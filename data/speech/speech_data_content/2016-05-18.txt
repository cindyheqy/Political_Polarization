Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, one of the great tragedies of our time is our failure to adequately deal with the needs of our veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan. We sent over 2 million brave men and women to fight under very difficult circumstances, to say the very least. While I was convinced from the beginning that the war was a tremendous mistake, that is all the more reason that we should work to protect those veterans as they return home with wounds that are both visible and, in some cases, unseen. It is no secret that these returning veterans have placed quite a strain on our VA facilities, which coincides with a national opioid epidemic. Prescription painkillers steal the lives of 78 Americans every day. Over 20,000 were killed last year, and it often leads to heroin addiction if their supply of opioid pills is interrupted. As veterans with PTSD, chronic pain, and any number of ailments are looking for relief, lethal opioid overdoses among VA patients are almost twice the national average. We are doing something wrong. This is at a time when the overwhelming number of veterans say to me that marijuana has reduced PTSD symptoms and their dependency on addictive opioids. Yet the VA official policy prevents their doctors who know them best from talking to our veterans about this, even in States where it is legal. In 24 States, the District of Columbia, and Guam, medical marijuana at the recommendation of a physician is legal. In those States, it is often used as an alternative to the addictive opioids to treat chronic pain. Fourteen States allow for medical marijuana to treat PTSD. Yet, veterans who are seeking relief from something that has proven to make a difference for many of their peers cannot get help from their VA doctor, even in States where medical marijuana is legal. This is outrageous. It is time for us to acknowledge our debt to those veterans and allow their personal VA physician, the doctor who knows them best, to be able to consult with them about medical marijuana in accordance with State law. My amendment doesn’t authorize the possession or use of marijuana at VA facilities, but it would allow physicians to treat the whole patient and to give them their best advice. We should not force our veterans to go to another doctor and pay for the service out of their own pocket with somebody who doesn’t know them as well as their own doctor. I would strongly hope that my colleagues would vote in favor of the Veterans Equal Access amendment in the MILCON–VA bill coming forward today. These men and women who have done so much for us and come home seeking help in dealing with health and coping with their return deserve our best. Forcing the VA to turn a blind eye to a potential useful therapy— something that is perfectly legal in their State—is not just shortsighted; I think it is cruel and unfair. I have listened to the many stories of veterans who have found that medical marijuana has made a huge difference in their return, recovery, and readjustment. Importantly, it doesn’t subject them to the danger of being part of the opioid epidemic that has been visited upon our veterans. We can help stop the tragedy of VA veterans dying of opioid overdoses at nearly twice the rate of the rest of the population by at least allowing their doctors to work with them, considering medical marijuana as an alternative therapy. f 
COMMENDING THE SERVICE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the service of law enforcement officers not only in Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District, but across Pennsylvania and the entire United States. As this week is National Police Week, it is especially important that we recognize 
the sacrifices of these men and women, especially those who have given their lives in the line of duty. Over the weekend, as part of National Police Week, communities across the country observed Peace Officers Memorial Day. This observation was created in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy to pay special recognition to those law enforcement officers who have lost their lives while providing for the safety and the protection of others. Last year, five police officers lost their lives in Pennsylvania: Officer Lloyd Reed in Westmoreland County, Patrolman John Wilding of Scranton, Lieutenant Eric Eslary of Westmoreland County, Detective Paul Koropal of Allegheny County, and Sergeant Robert Wilson III of Philadelphia. I know that I join my fellow members of the Pennsylvania House delegation in saying that their service to our Commonwealth will not be forgotten. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of Denise Jones, who is the chief clerk and county administrator for Venango County, located in Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District. After nearly 39 years of work for the county, Denise plans to retire next month. She started in the 1970s with Venango County, and Denise has served in a number of different capacities. Those include as a human services planner, as an administrative assistant, as an employee relations manager, and then finally moving into the role of chief clerk and county administrator in 1993. In addition to her service with the county, Denise serves on a number of boards dedicated to her community, including as board chair of the Northwest Hospital Foundation, which is dedicated to providing highquality health care for the residents of the Venango County area. Mr. Speaker, I am always proud to talk about the local officials who are making a difference in their communities, dedicating their service to improving the lives of people in their communities. I know that Denise Jones is one of those people, and I wish her the best of luck in her retirement. 
THE DUI REPORTING ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the DUI Reporting Act, a bill which I filed yesterday with my Judiciary Committee colleague, STEVE CHABOT of Ohio. If enacted, this bill would plug a glaring hole in our Nation’s drunk driving laws that enables repeat offenders to be tried as firsttime offenders, and repeat offenders are the ones most likely to cause serious accidents and death. Currently, when police make a drivingundertheinfluence arrest, they don’t always have access to information about all of the driver’s previous DUI convictions or arrests. The reason is because not all agencies report DUI arrests and/or convictions to the National Crime Information Center, known as the NCIC. That is the national crime database that is made instantly available to police and law enforcement right in their patrol cars. The consequences of this lack of reporting can prove tragic. Last year, there was an awful, awful accident, a crash in northern Mississippi just outside of my district. Two teenage girls, Maddie Kruse and Rachel Lynch, were headed out of Memphis on the way to a vacation. Their grandmother was driving the car. At about 6:30 in the morning, a man who had registered .17 at 6:30 in the morning hit their vehicle and killed Maddie and Rachel. This man had accrued seven DUI charges since 2008 but had been allowed to plead guilty five times to DUI first. He represented himself and had five first offense DUI convictions. Mississippi didn’t have a system and still doesn’t have a system to require those reportages. This story broke my heart and, I believe, the hearts of everybody in the Midsouth who read about it. This was a drunk driver who should have been in jail serving time off the road or have received treatment. The reason he wasn’t, according to local investigations, is because none of his DUI history had been reported to the NCIC and was not available to the highway patrolman. When that patrolman ran his driving record in the national database, his past DUI convictions never showed up because they weren’t reported. This is shameful in this day and age. This information should be reported so that law enforcement can get access to it and get drunk drivers off the road and save lives like Maddie’s and Rachel’s. Our bill would make that happen by creating a financial incentive for States to require DUI arrests and convictions to be reported to the NCIC and, therefore, available to law enforcement. The bill is bipartisan. It has the support of people throughout the country; but in Memphis, Billy Bond, at the Prosecutor’s Office, worked on this for a while and tried to get laws like this passed. We have had a good response from MADD. This bill will save lives. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass it quickly. f 
NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) for 5 minutes. Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to a matter of national security. Over the last several months, the National GeospatialIntelligence Agency, or NGA, has been considering locations for its new Western headquarters. The agency, which collects and analyzes satellite maps in support of warfighters, has outgrown its current location in St. Louis. With construction of the new NGA West facility scheduled to begin next year, the question is: Where? There are two sites under consideration. One is in north St. Louis. The other is in St. Clair County, Illinois, next to Scott Air Force Base. This site, which I have a chart of, is shovel ready. It is 182 acres of undeveloped land with room to expand. It is free of cost to the American taxpayers, with the county ready to hand over the deed to the NGA. To help make their decision, the NGA enlisted the help of the Army Corps of Engineers to study the environmental impact. Unfortunately, we have found that the Army Corps of Engineers’ Environmental Impact Statement is deeply flawed. The report is filled with errors, omissions, and underestimated risks. It is clear that the Army Corps did not provide an accurate accounting of the facts. The result is that the NGA announced plans last month to relocate to north St. Louis. Before that decision becomes final on June 2, I am here to set the record straight. To the right of this chart, you will see St. Clair County, Illinois. This is the site under consideration by the NGA. However, the Army Corps of Engineers’ report included data related to St. Clair County, Missouri, and St. Clair County, Michigan. One is 263 miles away from the actual site, and the other is 580 miles away from the actual site. The report also highlighted a river that isn’t even in southern Illinois. When alerted to these embarrassing errors, the Army Corps of Engineers failed to correct them. Considering that the NGA is a mapping agency, maybe they could teach the Army Corps of Engineers how to read one. Now, let’s look at the impact on mission security and public safety. Clearly, a DOD mapping agency would be a prime target for those who wish to do harm against this agency. This chart shows evacuation zones if either location were attacked by a car bomb. b1015 You can see that St. Clair County has ample setback to protect local residents and the site itself. The north St. Louis site, obviously, does not. We now know that security was a top criteria for placement of the new NGA. We know that force protection standards have traditionally led to colocating with existing military installations. So why are the standards being ignored for this facility? Let’s look at the facts. We have already talked about the NGA belongs in St. Clair County. We have already talked about mission security. We talked about public safety, and we saw the difference in the blast zones. St. Clair County is the right choice for taxpayers. The Army Corps claims 
the St. Clair County site would be 20 percent more expensive, but they haven’t even completed studies of the north St. Louis site. St. Clair County is shovelready now. North St. Louis is not. Every year that we delay this, it adds $40 million to the cost to this budget. St. Clair County has been proactive and transparent with the environmental studies. North St. Louis hasn’t even conducted its full analysis. The north St. Louis site has significant unknowns, including reports of hazardous waste and potential contamination from cold war era testing. How can this decision be made without answers to these very serious and healthrelated questions? In terms of recruiting the next generation, Scott Air Force Base attracts the best of the best. Thousands of millennials work at Scott Air Force Base, and many already have their security clearance. Finally, St. Clair County has the roadways, railways, and infrastructure to make NGA a success. North St. Louis will need to seize land through eminent domain and then create a network we already have in place. Mr. Speaker, I believe the NGA is making a terrible mistake that could have serious consequences. They didn’t have the correct data. Before this decision is made final, the people deserve the truth. Not just the people of St. Clair County, not just the people of north St. Louis, but we, the United States citizens. That is why I have called for a full investigation by the Inspector General’s Office. 
WATER AND DROUGHT IN CALIFORNIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ ) for 5 minutes. Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, this week, we recognize infrastructure week, where we highlight infrastructure development in our country and its importance to our districts. Now, we might think that infrastructure isn’t very important, but we depend on it in all aspects of our daily lives. Developed roads and bridges help to take our children to school or to take our kids to our national parks. Our bridges, dams, and water are the infrastructure that help to produce energy and provide us with clean drinking water. Broadband infrastructure ensures that everyone has access to learning and to information. But, unfortunately, our infrastructure is deteriorating at an alarming rate. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that our crumbling infrastructure is costing each of us, each family, $3,400 a year of our disposable income. When we take into consideration the increasingly high cost of living, for example, in Orange County, California, where I live, then we see that our families are, once again, footing a bill, and yet we are not making the investment that we need. In fact, the United States spends significantly less of its GDP than most developing countries for our national infrastructure. Unfortunately, this lack of investment is apparent throughout our country. We saw it in Flint, Michigan. When infrastructure fails to provide clean water, our communities suffer. In my home State of California, Porter Ranch, California, a massive gas leak released 100,000 tons of methane gas into the air. These failed pipelines reach back to the 1950s. With respect to our roads, the Department of Transportation found that nearly 68 percent of California’s roads are in poor or mediocre condition, and almost 30 percent of California’s bridges have been recognized as structurally deficient. As California enters its fourth year of a drought, we are seeing just how crucial water infrastructure dollars can be during times of turmoil. So, Mr. Speaker, we have to look no further than my home district to see the positive effects of investing in infrastructure to help our communities. Since I was elected to the Congress almost 20 years ago, the very first project that I championed was building a large factory, the largest in the world, to reclaim our water, to recycle our water, and it is the world’s largest advanced reclamation project. Today, that project has recycled nearly 188 billion gallons of water, and it really continues to be the flagship of water recycling. I have also fought to bring highspeed rail to California and led sending a letter to President Obama urging investment in the project, which will bring increased commercial and leisure travel. With respect to transit, I recently led a letter from the California delegation asking for $3.2 billion to fund the Capital Investment Grant Program, a program which funds projects all the way from northern to southern California. The Capital Investment Grants will help fund projects in my district, like the Orange County Streetcar, which increases transportation transit through my area so people get out of their cars, we protect the environment, and we move people more efficiently. Mr. Speaker, this Congress needs to get its act together and invest in infrastructure. 
WE NEED A PROGROWTH AGENDA TO RAISE WAGES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, Wendy’s, one of the world’s largest fastfood chains, plans to replace human employees with automated selfservice kiosks in many of its 6,500 restaurants around the country and around the world in an effort to counteract minimum wage hikes throughout the United States. I don’t blame Wendy’s at all. They can either react or they can close up their doors, and then no one will be working. The economics on the issue are pretty clear. Wendy’s is doing what they have to do to survive, and others will certainly follow suit. They will adapt, or they will be gone. When the government unnecessarily and unilaterally increases the cost of labor and imposes it on the job creators, the jobs are probably going to be replaced through automation and technological advancement. This is nothing new. This technology is not new. Wendy’s could have done this a long time ago if they just wanted to maximize their profits, as every single corporation in America seems to be accused of doing these days. But these are the job creators. These are the job makers. They have chosen now because they have no other choice. Many people say that this is an artificial wage and that it actually discourages employment and distorts the market. Well, here is the proof. This is exactly what is happening. And don’t blame Wendy’s. They are trying to survive in a 2 percent economy. Mr. Speaker, let’s not lock out millions of people from their entrylevel employment. I am a person who worked for less than minimum wage. One time I asked my boss at the time, I said: ‘‘Do I make minimum wage?’’ And he said: ‘‘No, you are not worth it.’’ I was just barely in high school. I didn’t have much to offer, except a strong back and showing up on time with a good attitude, and he paid me for that, and I worked my way up. The squeeze on the middle class is real. It is painful for tens of millions of anxietyridden Americans who don’t know whether they are going to have a job, even though it might be their entrylevel job. It might be the job that they could get in a 2 percent economy. Some people say that we are just transferring the jobs to those who will build kiosks or robots. Well, I have got to tell you, folks, I suspect that those jobs are not minimum wage jobs, so that is not going to be of much help. And, oh, by the way, I suspect they won’t be in your hometown where your Wendy’s is. So if you have got a job there and it is going to be displaced or replaced with one building a kiosk, unless you are planning to move to where they are building that, that is not going to be of much solace or help to your family. What this country needs is a pro growth agenda to help raise everyone’s wages to provide the opportunity for everyone to get started somewhere and then move up, just like I did, without hurting the people already struggling to get by. What we don’t need is more liberal, wrongheaded, unilateral, ideologicaldriven government regulation that destroys our jobs and livelihoods. 
GUN VIOLENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, since 1970, more Americans have died from domestic gun violence than in every war since the American Revolution. If all of the victims of gun violence since 1970 were put on a wall, like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, it would contain 1.5 million names and stretch 2
1⁄2miles. That is 25 times as long as the actual Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Congress is quick to offer moments of silence for some mass shootings, ignore most of them, and then proceed to do nothing else, except remain silent. Each month that we are in session, I will read the names of every person killed in a mass shooting during the previous month. I have also created my own memorial wall in the hallway outside of my office. Here are the stories of the victims killed in the 41 mass shootings in April of this year. There have been so many people this month affected by mass shootings that I don’t have time to list the injured, just those who were killed. Here are those who were killed: Anpha Nguyen, 31, and Jerry Nguyen, 24, were killed inside a restaurant owned by their uncle on April 1 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Jaime Wilson, 24, and Keiwuan Murray, 18, were killed on April 5 in St. Augustine, Florida. Jamie was holding her 2monthold baby at the time. Davon Jones, 17, was killed on April 14 in Orange, New Jersey. Gino Nicolas, 24, and Tanya Monique Skeen, 46, were killed outside a house on April 16 in Orlando, Florida. Gino was the leader of the Orlando chapter of My Brother’s Keeper, where he mentored atrisk youth. An unidentified 27yearold man was killed on a sidewalk on April 16 in Detroit, Michigan. Edwin Laboy, 46, an unidentified man, and an unidentified woman, were killed on April 17 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Jaxmany Jazan Montes, 29, was killed inside a nightclub on April 17 in Edinburg, Texas. He is survived by his wife and two children. Delhaun Jackson, 19, was killed in broad daylight on April 18 in Long Beach, California. Delhaun had a 1 yearold child, shown in this picture, and he was looking forward to his very first Father’s Day. Damond Dawson, 23, was killed while filming a music video in a park on April 19 in Chicago, Illinois. Natalie Srinivasan, 35, and her children, Siena, 5, and MJ, 2, were killed by their husband and father on April 19 in Katy, Texas. Jason Napoles, 18, was killed in a parked car with his friends on April 19 in Chicago, Illinois. Eight family members were killed on April 22 in Piketon, Ohio. They were Christopher Rhoden, 40; his exwife Dana Rhoden, 37; their three children, Clarence Rhoden, 20; Hanna Rhoden, 19; and Chris Rhoden, Jr., 16. Also killed were Chris Sr.’s brother, Kenneth Rhoden, 44; their cousin, Gary Rhoden, 38; and Clarence’s fiance, Hannah Gilley, 20. Rheba Mae Dent, 85; Roosevelt Burns, 75; Keila Clark, 31; Shelly Williams, 62; and Lizzy Williams, 59, were killed on April 22 in Appling, Georgia. They were killed after the shooter’s wife asked for a divorce. Recco Cobb, 43; Jadarrion Spinks, 25; and Roderick Nelms, 32, were killed at a home on April 23 in Auburn, Alabama. Angelo Barboza, 15, was killed on April 23 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Moments before, he had texted his mother saying he loved her and would see her soon. b1030 Davon Barrett, 38, and Devin Hamb, 27, were killed on April 24, in Chicago. They were at a memorial service for Davon’s brother, who died from gun violence in 2009. Carolyn Ann Sanders, 59, her daughter, Marquita Hill, 32, and Kenneth Cornelious Loggins, 32, were killed by Marquita’s ex on April 27 in Montgomery County, Mississippi. Joanne Woods, 49, was killed on April 27 in Forestville, Maryland. Leco Cole, 38, was killed in a house on April 27 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Members, these were lives taken unnecessarily. May the dead rest in peace, the wounded recover quickly and completely, and the bereaved find comfort. I urge my colleagues to stop being silent, and let’s do something to stop the rampage. 
THE FALSE PROMISES OF SOCIALISM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DUNCAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, people all over the country are moving from the high tax States to the low tax States. This is great for my home State of Tennessee. Almost half the people I represent have moved from someplace else; but it is not great for the country as a whole, and we will face many problems in the future if the high tax States do not start lowering their taxes and start trying to keep more of their people at home. New York in the 1970s had 43 Members of the House. Now it has 27 Members. After the 2010 Census, each Member was supposed to represent between 705,000 and 710,000 people. While, in the 1970s, congressional districts had much lower populations than now, if New York had had the average growth of most States, it would have had about 11 million more people than it now has. Cities and States throughout the Northeast and the Midwest have been losing populations or have been having growth lower than in most other States for many years. Last year, a man from New Jersey told me his property taxes on a 2,800squarefoot house were $13,000. Plus, they had State income tax on top of that. I told him the taxes on a similarsized house in east Tennessee would probably be between $2,000 and $2,500, and there would be no State income tax on top. Almost every week, when I am home in Tennessee, someone tells me a story about how high the taxes are in the States they have moved from. Of course, it will be good for the young people of Tennessee if our legislators keep taxes low and if people would keep moving there, because many new jobs will be created. An example of the problems, though, that high taxes have created in the States can be seen in Michigan’s Flint water crisis. When taxes become too high, first, upperincome residents move out, then uppermiddle, then, finally, middleincome. Then cities are left with a very low tax base. The pressures are greatest to pay the teachers, the policemen, and the firefighters first. The water infrastructure underground is out of sight, out of mind, and is often neglected. Flint has lost almost half of its population since the 1970s, as have many cities, large and small, throughout the high tax States of the Northeast and the Midwest. We are going to send a boatload of money to Flint because of all the publicity it has received, but we cannot do that for every city and county in all of the high tax States. I read a few days ago that Galesburg, Illinois, leaders are telling citizens to drink only bottled water. It is not fair to my taxpayers in Tennessee, where we have acted in fiscally responsible ways and have kept our taxes low, to have to now bail out all of the cities and counties and even States that have acted in fiscally irresponsible ways. Of course, the problems these wasteful, irresponsible, high tax areas that keep driving people out will be seen not just with infrastructure, but all across the board—in education, in law enforcement, and in other areas. Puerto Rico is in big trouble now. Many people say Illinois is next. I urge the high tax States all over the country to start drastically lowering their taxes. While this exodus of people from these States has been very good for States like Tennessee, it will not be good for the Nation as a whole in the long run if it continues. It should also serve as a lesson or as a warning that almost every city or State in this Nation and almost every country around the world that has had liberal, leftwing, big spending, high tax leadership is in serious financial trouble. Every young person who seems to be attracted to the false promises of socialism should look at Cuba, where despite hundreds of miles of beautiful oceanfront property and a wealth of interior natural resources, the average salary is $24 a month. They should also 
look at Venezuela, which has more oil than Saudi Arabia has. Their economy is in shambles, and children are dying because they can’t get food and medical treatment. That is what socialism gives the people, Mr. Speaker. 
THE STATE OF HOMELESSNESS IN AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) for 5 minutes. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise because I am deeply concerned about the homelessness crisis that is plaguing our country. Homelessness affects the very fabric of our communities, and it degrades the values upon which our country was built. Every American has the right to safe, decent, and affordable housing; but according to the latest estimates, nearly 600,000 Americans are currently homeless, over 83,000 of whom are chronically homeless and nearly 130,000 of whom are children who are under the age of 18, and these numbers are increasing in some of our major cities. Sadly, in my own hometown, in Los Angeles, homelessness increased by a staggering 20 percent between 2014 and 2015, and it continues to rise. But this is not just about the numbers. When I visit our homeless neighbors on Skid Row in Los Angeles, I see how these Americans are facing chronic mental and physical problems that make it even harder to rehabilitate their lives. When I speak to families that are dealing with homelessness, I see the toll this housing insecurity is taking on their children, who can’t concentrate in school because they are sleeping in cars at night. There is a solution to this problem, Mr. Speaker. We just need the political will and resources. That is why earlier this year I introduced comprehensive legislation to provide the resources we need to truly end homelessness in America. My bill, H.R. 4888, the Ending Homelessness Act of 2016, would provide over $13 billion over 5 years to strengthen programs and initiatives that will help us end homelessness in this country. The money will help to create approximately 410,000 units of housing to end homelessness for the estimated 407,000 homeless households in the country. This includes permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless, for Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher units, and deeply affordable units through the National Housing Trust Fund. My bill would also provide the resources to increase the number of outreach workers on the streets, working with homeless populations. Furthermore, my bill would provide technical assistance to help States and localities align their health and housing systems. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has reported that major progress toward ending homelessness in this country has virtually stalled without new funding. So there is a real need to invest in our Federal housing programs and to support our local service providers who are on the streets helping the homeless every day. Passing H.R. 4888 would be an investment that would pay dividends in the long run. Research has shown that when we provide housing to chronically homeless individuals, the cost to the taxpayer is significantly less than if we allowed them to remain homeless. For example, Los Angeles County’s Project 50 found that providing permanent supportive housing to 50 chronically homeless individuals saved the county close to $250,000 over 2 years. Similar results have been found in other major cities as well as in small cities and in rural areas alike. But this isn’t just about the cost or the savings, Mr. Speaker. It is about recognizing the crisis that we face as a Nation and having an honest conversation about what we really need to do to put an end to homelessness. We are the richest country in the world, and every person should have access to safe, decent, and affordable housing. This should be a bipartisan issue. We must, all of us, Democrats and Republicans, work together to finally end homelessness in this country once and for all. Mr. Speaker and Members, I will be on this floor every chance I get to force the real debate and the real conversation about this crisis that we are confronted with in America. We cannot continue to walk past homeless, helpless, mentally ill, physically ill homeless people on the streets and pretend we don’t see them. They are there. It is unconscionable that we allow this homelessness to continue to grow and to be on our streets. In Los Angeles, when you go to so called Skid Row, we have people on the streets who are lined all the way up to the steps of City Hall. Elected officials, ministers, community organizations, let’s get together with our legislators, let’s pass H.R. 4888, and stop the homelessness in America. 
ECONOMIC, RETIREMENT, AND NATIONAL SECURITY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, this morning, I want to discuss the issue of security with my colleagues—economic security, retirement security, and national security—three issues that probably right now in my conversations with constituents is what we hear the most about. Let’s look at the picture of economic security, or the lack thereof, that exists in our country and in our communities. What I hear from my constituents is that the 5 percent unemployment rate is indeed misleading because over 90 million Americans have dropped out of the workforce. They are losing hope and are unemployed. The Obama malaise, as I have constituents who like to term it, has created a workforce participation rate of 62.8 percent. Now, I want you to think about that. Of the eligible adults who are ready for the workforce, 62.8 percent have a job and are able to work. That is the worst level since the Carter administration. Our GDP is declining. Our economy grew at only half of a percent—half of a percent in the first quarter of 2016. That is lower than a 1.4 percent expansion in the previous period, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. President Obama had a chance to create 40,000 jobs, and he took a pass on it. He vetoed the Keystone pipeline so that he could cement his legacy and stature as a liberal icon. The American people are tired of being broke; they are tired of work permits that go to illegal aliens; and they are tired of $19.2 trillion in Federal debt. We need to get the government off the backs and out of the pocketbooks of the American people. It is time to loosen regulations and lower taxes. The issue of retirement security comes up so often in the conversations I have, especially with women, and it is important to note what is happening with Social Security and Medicare. The Social Security retirement trust fund is set to run out of money by the year 2034. That is not that far away. According to the Tax Foundation, under the current wage indexing formula, benefits are projected to climb by more than 150 percent, in real terms, over the next 75 years. I have introduced H.R. 603, the Savings for Seniors Act, which establishes within the Federal OldAge and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund a Social Security Surplus Protection Account to hold the Social Security surplus and prohibit it from being spent. Medicare has to be addressed as well. It is supposed to run out of money and be insolvent by 2030. We must make sure that seniors are secure, and we have to make certain that the money they have already paid into the system, they are able to receive. On the national security front, President Obama’s very, very timid foreign policy has emboldened our enemies from the rise of ISIS, to Russian aggression in Ukraine and in the Middle East, to the Chinese military expansion in the South China Sea. It has also left our allies asking: Where are you? You are not present as we try to address these issues. What we have seen with President Obama, I think, is inexcusable. For example, when the evil blade of ISIS decapitated Steven Sotloff in 2014, President Obama was on the golf course minutes after telling the American people: We will be relentless, and we 
will be vigilant to see that justice is done. Or, as he also calls it, leading from behind. b1045 Two other glaring issues we face are the Syrian refugee program and our southern border. There is currently no way to vet Syrian refugees, and I think this President is delusional if he thinks there is. I have introduced H.R. 4218 to suspend refugee admissions until Congress passes a joint resolution approving the President’s plan. Meanwhile, our southern border is overrun again. Through the first 6 months of fiscal year 2016, which ended on March 31, border officials apprehended 27,754 unaccompanied children. That is just shy of the 28,579 number apprehended for all of 2014. Think about that comparison. Mr. Speaker, we must provide economic, retirement, and national security for all Americans. We must rise to the occasion and make certain our Nation is secure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded not to engage in personalities toward the President. 
CALIFORNIA WATER LEGISLATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to work together on behalf of the people of California to get water legislation passed that will help fix California’s broken water system. Yes, Californians have been divided historically for decades for a number of reasons on how to fix our broken water system, but that must change because we are living on borrowed time, and nothing has explained that more clearly than the last 4 years of drought conditions. Yesterday, the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN ’s water legislation, the California LongTerm Provisions for Water Supply and ShortTerm Provisions for Emergency Drought Relief Act. This week, Congressman JOHN GARAMENDI introduced the House companion bill, legislation that I support as well. The California LongTerm Provisions for Water Supply and ShortTerm Provisions for Emergency Drought Relief Act would provide $1.3 billion in funding and support for desalinization, recycling efforts, and water storage projects like Temperance Flat and the expansion of San Luis Reservoir. The bill would also direct State and Federal agencies to maximize water supplies during the short term, while not violating existing environmental laws that protect threatened and endangered species. Additionally, the legislation includes language that would generate and provide for scientifically managed reservoir operations which would allow us to, for example, raise the spillway gates at New Exchequer Dam in Merced County, providing an additional 50,000 acrefeet of water storage for the Merced Irrigation District. Finally, the bill would complement the ongoing efforts made by the recent passage of a State water bond that I supported—$2.7 billion for additional water storage in California. In order to get California’s water bill passed and signed into law, our Nation’s Senators must understand that there is support for Senator DIANNE  FEINSTEIN ’s legislation among California Representatives in the House. That is why I am a cosponsor of the House companion legislation, H.R. 5247. Now, there is room for modifications and changes in Senator FEINSTEIN ’s legislation as well as the House bill, especially provisions that deal with shortterm fixes that would provide more accountability on how California’s water system is operated year to year. But if Congress is going to be able to provide some relief to the people of California, which is a template for Western States—and, I would say, the world—we must continue to move forward, and the passage of S. 2533 would undoubtedly be an important step in the right direction. Once S. 2533 is passed out of the Senate, the House and the Senate will have the opportunity to go to conference to resolve the differences that exist in these water bills by each of the Chambers. That is the normal process under which we usually conduct business. I have consistently fought to bring more water to our San Joaquin Valley, and that includes supporting the California water bill that the House passed last year, but we need to use all the water tools in our water toolbox to fix the entire State’s water needs. It is my hope that my colleagues will put aside their political differences which, for too long, have been a part of the problem and join me in supporting the California LongTerm Provisions for Water Supply and ShortTerm Provisions for Emergency Drought Relief Act, because fixing California’s water system is dependent upon it. If we don’t pass this legislation and we don’t work with Governor Brown in California, we cannot fix this broken water system. So, finally, what is this about? It is about investing in our infrastructure. We are living off the investments our parents and our grandparents made a generation ago. This is Infrastructure Week. We ought to be talking about investing in our infrastructure, not only in California, but around the country. What else is this about? It is about helping the environment because, notwithstanding the opposition to this legislation, the status quo is only resulting in further deterioration of the environment. Finally, what else is this about? It is about the reliability of our water supply to maintain our farms. Maintaining our farms, after all, is a part of America’s national security. We don’t think about it that way, but having reliable, costeffective food on America’s dinner table every night is about our national security. So it is about the sustainability, therefore, of our food supply and our way of life. If we are going to fix this, we have to come together. We have to work together. We have to get beyond our differences and beyond our talking points. If Congress is going to get anything done, we, in California, on our water fixes, must come together. f 
BUILDING SAFETY MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) for 5 minutes. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark Building Safety Month, to recognize the importance of building safety, and to congratulate the leadership of the International Code Council that develops and publishes the model building safety and energy efficiency model codes used in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and across the country. Increasingly, these codes, developed in the United States, are being adopted in other nations as a model of safe construction. Every year, there are sobering reminders about the key role that building codes can have. Foreign nations still experience catastrophic losses of life and property due to natural events and poor construction practices. These losses have been greatly reduced in this country thanks to the adoption of sound building practices. Deadly fires, tornados, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, and other events remind us of the critical need for strong buildings. As Congress discusses the need for resilience and greater energy efficiency in our communities, we are reminded in May that key elements of resilience and energy efficiency are sound building and energy codes. I want to congratulate the leaders of the ICC, which has sponsored Building Safety Month in May every year for over 30 years. The theme of this year’s Building Safety Month, appropriately, is ‘‘Driving Growth Through Innovation, Resilience, and Safety.’’ The leadership board of the ICC, including my constituent, President Alex Olszowy, building inspection supervisor for the LexingtonFayette Urban County Government in Kentucky, will join ICC’s chief executive officer, Dominic Sims, in Washington next week to discuss the critical need to support the adoption and enforcement of current building codes to make sure Americans are safe at home, at work, at school, and at play. On this occasion, I also want to highlight the good work of the Code Administrators Association of Kentucky, including president Jeff Camp and the other leaders of the Commonwealth’s ICC chapter, and to thank the thousands of men and women who work 
every day to make sure our buildings comply with building and fire codes. Their work, largely unseen and often unnoticed, is critical to keeping the American people safe. The model building codes adopted by ICC members from all 50 States allow every community to share the advantage of adopting building codes that are adaptable to local conditions but, at the same time, incorporate the very latest research, materials, and building practices. This is achieved through a publicprivate partnership, saving local jurisdictions from bearing the large expense of code revision, updating, and coordination. These model codes are produced through the cooperation of thousands of local U.S. code officials working with the building industry to produce codes that represent the consensus on what the minimum safety requirements are and should be for various building types, all without a dime of Federal taxpayer money. I should mention that the Architect of the Capitol maintains the safety of this building and all House and Senate office buildings by following the requirements in the current International Building Code. So congratulations and a heartfelt thanks to the hardworking members and leadership of the International Code Council during this Building Safety Month. 
HOUSTON, TEXAS, FLOODING The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this is a continuation of my mission of mercy, a mission that I gladly accept because a great American city has been declared a disaster area: a great American city with 2plus million people, a great American city where we speak more than 100 different languages, a great American city where we appreciate diversity and we celebrate it. In fact, we have developed a symbiotic relationship, a symbiosis such that we can do together what we could never do apart. A great American city, Houston, Texas, within Harris County, has been declared a disaster area; and it has been declared a disaster area, Mr. Speaker, because of the flooding that takes place in Houston, Texas. I asked that my staff prepare some intelligence for me to share so as to paint a picture of what this flooding is like in Houston, Texas. In Houston, Texas, on the tax day flood—socalled because it was the last day to file for taxes this year—we had this tax day flood, and it has caused damages that will approximate $2 billion. The good news is that that is revised down because the estimate initially was that it would be more. In Houston, Texas, over 100 neighborhoods experienced some flooding. In Houston, Texas, a great American city, we had 240 billion—billion with a B—240 billion gallons of water. A billion is still 1,000 million. So we have had 2,000millionplus gallons of water in Houston, Texas. And that was on one day. This is enough water to fill the Astrodome 750 times over. In Houston, Texas, we had more than 1,200 high water rescues, people stranded, lives at risk in Houston, Texas, a major American city, a great American city declared a disaster area. In Houston, Texas, there was 8.85 inches of rainfall—that broke the previous record from 1976—and, I might add, in some areas, 17 inches of water. That was all a part of the tax day floods. There were 121,000 people without power. Mr. Speaker, this is significant, but it is also significant to note that this is not the first time. Within the last year, 12 months, we had the Memorial Day flood, with similar circumstances and $2 billion in damages. Mr. Speaker, over the last 20 years, we have had at least one day of flooding in Houston, Texas, that has been called to the attention of the people in Washington, D.C., and I’m doing so now. b1100 Mr. Speaker, as bad as these things are, all of these damages that I have called to our attention, there is something more significant, something more meaningful that is happening in Houston, Texas, and that is lives are being lost. In the tax day flood, we lost nine lives, Mr. Speaker—nine lives— people who left home going to work, assuming that they would drive their cars and return home. Mr. Speaker, we have, in Houston, what are called flash floods. Even people who are judicious and prudent can sometimes find themselves in circumstances from which they cannot extricate themselves because of the way the water comes in so quickly— flash floods, nine lives lost, a great American city declared a disaster area. Houston needs a lifeline. When you are drowning in water, you need a lifeline. Well, there is a lifeline. The lifeline is H.R. 5025, the 2016 Tax Day Floods Supplemental Funding Act. This is a supplemental funding bill, which means it is not an earmark. It is the kind of thing we do when we have emergencies to contend with. We have done this before when we have had the storms on the East Coast. We have done this before, when we had New Orleans, Louisiana, and Katrina. We have done it when we have had fires. We have done it when we have had the tornadic activities. This is reasonable. It is prudent. It is judicious. It is something we ought to do to rescue, to throw a lifeline to a great American city that has been declared a disaster area. Well, the good news is, Mr. Speaker, we are recovering; but I hate to say, and I regret to say, I am reluctant to say, we are not out of the woods yet. We are not out of the woods yet, Mr. Speaker, because today there is an 80 percent chance of precipitation. Tomorrow, there is an 80 percent chance. I beg that we support H.R. 5025 and extend a lifeline to Houston, Texas, a great American city. f 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. DONOVAN ) at noon. 
PRAYER Reverend Dr. Patricia Venegas, Without Spot or Wrinkle Ministries International, La Verne, California, offered the following prayer: Heavenly Father, we come before Your throne room of grace today by unmerited favor. We thank You for this great Nation. Our forefathers faced many trials and tribulations in their days. They relied on You as they sought Your guidance for America, knowing they could not do it without You. Today, in this room, we humble ourselves before You and pause, asking You once again for Your guidance and perfect will for our Nation, as we pray Your kingdom come and Your will be done in America. I also pray for every Representative in this room today, who shoulders the immense responsibility to make decisions for the people they represent, give each one wisdom, knowledge, understanding, and discernment on every decision they make. I pray You will bless them and their families for the sacrifice they make for the American people. In Your holy name. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from California (Mr. BERA) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. BERA led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
WELCOMING REVEREND DR. PATRICIA VENEGAS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. NAPOLITANO ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to welcome Dr. Patricia Venegas of Without Spot Or Wrinkle Ministries International. I thank her and her husband for coming from La Verne, one of my cities. She started the church in 1998 with her husband, Reverend Benjamin Venegas, who is up in the gallery somewhere. From 1977 to the present, she serves as a chaplain to the Covina Police Department. She was ordained as a minister of the Gospel in December 2006. She published one book, ‘‘The Bride of Christ Without Spot Or Wrinkle.’’ She develops and writes curricula for conferences and seminars. Thanks for the work that you do, Reverend, to spread the Gospel throughout the San Gabriel Valley and beyond. May God bless you and God bless our country. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the incredibly brave men and women in blue who serve and protect our communities. For example, Sergeant P.J. Wilson of the CharlotteMecklenburg Police Department is a third shift supervisor. He and his team work the wee hours of the morning to make sure that we can sleep in peace. Officer K.S. Kodad works every weekend and most holidays because he knows that criminals don’t always work business hours. Officer Tim Purdy recently sat down in a school parking lot to calm and reassure a potentially suicidal autistic student. Detective McKee recently helped solve a homicide from last summer, with all five suspects now in custody. Mr. Speaker, these are just four of the thousands of police officers who should be recognized for their important work. Today and every day, we should take time to say thank you to the police officers we encounter in our communities. RECOGNIZING DR. EPHRAIM WILLIAMS (Mr. BERA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Ephraim Williams, Pastor of St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church in Sacramento. Pastor Williams has epitomized the importance of community and faith for the past 45 years. This past Sunday, my wife and I had a chance to worship with Pastor Williams and his congregation. He will be retiring this coming Sunday, but his legacy of service and leadership will live on through his congregation, which has grown from 100 worshippers to over 2,500. Pastor Williams led the efforts to finance and build an edifice and family life center, which now serves the surrounding community. His church offers employment fairs, home buyer workshops, financial literacy courses, and much more to the community. Pastor Williams also serves as a mentor and adviser to younger pastors and has helped develop the next generation of leaders in the faith community. On behalf of the Sacramento community and the region, I thank him for his 45 years of work and service, which has made our community a much better place to live in. Thank you, Pastor Williams. f 
CONGRATULATING 2016 GRADUATING CLASS OF ELITE YOUTH OUTREACH PROGRAM (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 2016 graduating class of the ELITE Youth Outreach program. ELITE is a wonderful program that teaches atrisk youth in our local communities in central Illinois on how to gain employment, communicate effectively, behave responsibly, and dress appropriately. The program was founded by Carl Cannon, a Peoriaborn native who served his country as a military officer and drill instructor. Now he is dedicated to training and inspiring youth to overcome barriers to success, as he did himself. In 2013, Carl Cannon received the FBI’s Director’s Community Leadership Award. This week, FBI Director James Comey will travel from Washington, D.C., to Peoria to address this year’s ELITE graduating class. I would like to commend Carl Cannon and his staff for their dedication to these students and recognize the transformative effect his program has had on youth in our Peoria area. I would also like to thank FBI Director Comey for supporting this worthy program with his presence this week in Peoria. Finally, I would like to congratulate the students who have completed this program. You should feel proud of your accomplishments. You have a community and national and local leaders who believe in you, and we support you. f 
INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of infrastructure week, which is a joint effort by business and labor to highlight the dangerous conditions of America’s roads and bridges. There are currently 69,000 structurally deficient bridges in America. Every second of every day, seven cars drive on a bridge that is structurally deficient. Congress said that we couldn’t afford to rebuild the roads and bridges of America, so we only spent $50 billion a year in the last decade to rebuild America’s roads and bridges—pathetically weak. We were told we couldn’t afford it. But American taxpayers spent $87 billion rebuilding the roads and bridges of Afghanistan. We spent $73 billion rebuilding the roads and bridges of Iraq— off budget and unpaid for. Congress needs to get its priorities straight. We need to put American workers back to work and invest in our infrastructure to unleash the great potential of American businesses to grow the American economy. 
CONGRATULATING PRAIRIE GROVE SCHOOL DISTRICT 46 (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Prairie Grove School District 46 in Crystal Lake, Illinois, for being selected as a finalist for the 2016 Secretary of Defense Freedom Award, the first ever from Illinois. This is the Department of Defense’s highest recognition given to employers for exceptional support of their National Guard and Reserve employees. This year, more than 2,400 nominations were submitted by National Guard and Reserve servicemembers. Prairie Grove is one of only nine public sector employer finalists. Among servicemembers at the school district who support the nomination is Lieutenant Colonel Patty Klop, a Marine reservist, a physical education teacher, and a parttime teacher for students who have disabilities. In her nomination, she speaks highly of District 46 when she says: ‘‘It’s been a real source of stability and comfort for me over the years. I’ve been on several deployments, and District 46 has always been there.’’ Prairie Grove is invited to the Freedom Award ceremony this August at the Pentagon. I look forward to the school district representing Illinois 
well as an exceptional employer of servicemembers. Congratulations, Prairie Grove. 
HEAD START (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 51st anniversary of the creation of Head Start. In my home State of Rhode Island, Head Start serves 2,500 children, including 100 homeless children and 500 children with special needs. Head Start is proven and effective. Young people who participate in Head Start have increased graduation rates, are less likely to become pregnant as teens, have improved economic opportunities, and are less likely to be involved in crime. Every dollar invested in Head Start saves up to $7 in future costs. In the 20th century, the United States set the standard in education and had the highest graduation rates around the world. Today, we rank 12th in college graduation and 26th in access to preschool for 4yearolds. If we are serious about providing the next generation with the skills they need to be successful and to compete in a global economy, it is critical that we significantly increase our investments in Head Start. Congratulations to Head Start on your 51st anniversary. Thank you for all that you do. 
RECOGNIZING CHIEF OF POLICE CHARLES R. JONES (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Beaver Falls Chief of Police Charles R. Jones on his retirement after decades of outstanding service to his community and to our Nation. After serving his country in the Air Force, which included time at the 911th Airlift Wing in Pittsburgh, Chief Jones embarked upon a career in law enforcement. He is a graduate of both Municipal Police Officers’ Training Academy and the Pennsylvania Deputy Sheriff’s Training Program in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He started with the city of Beaver Falls Police Department in 1994, and by 2008, he was chief of police. In October of 2011, the Pittsburgh FBI field office chose Chief Jones to join with other U.S. and international law enforcement leaders at the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia, for professional studies. A recipient of numerous awards, a man of faith, and a true leader, I thank Chief Jones for his service. In thanking the chief, I would be remiss in not also recognizing his wife Regina, who has also been a great advocate for her community. Although the chief is retiring, I fully expect he will continue his service to his community in multiple endeavors in the years to come. f 
HOUSE LEADERS NEED TO LEAD (Ms. ESTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor with a simple message for the leaders of this House: Do your job. The majority has refused to even vote on a budget—our most basic duty—and has failed to address over $3 trillion of needed infrastructure across the country. This is National Infrastructure Week. Fortyone percent of the roads in my home State of Connecticut are rated in poor condition. Bad roads cost the average Connecticut driver over $660 per year in unnecessary repairs and expenses. A great nation does not respond to crises with duct tape. A great nation does not tell 110 pregnant citizens with the Zika virus that they should make do with onethird of the necessary funding. For our infrastructure, for Flint, for the Supreme Court, for Zika patients, and for gun violence victims, the call to the leaders of this body is clear: It is time to lead. Do your job. 
b1215 THE IMPORTANCE OF SALVAGE TO FORESTRY (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, the Ninth Circuit Court is on a roll this week. First, they upheld gun rights in northern California. Now they have tossed out yet another frivolous lawsuit on salvage operations for forestry after a fire. Operations in western Siskiyou County on what is known as the west side fire—a fire that occurred in the summer and fall of 2014—are now finally proceeding where the value of that wood can be still, perhaps, hopefully, salvaged almost a year and a half later. Though it is only a scant 4 percent that they are going after in this harvest project here, you would think with the number of frivolous lawsuits and wailing over the project that we were causing an environmental disaster; yet the disaster has already occurred with the devastating fire. I am glad to see that the court ruled that some of the salvage operation can occur, because now the forest can actually recover. It can have an economic base to do so instead of merely coming out of the U.S. Treasury, and the people in the area can be employed in doing it in this forest fire recovery. It will be a positive for the habitat, a positive for the spotted owl. This is what we need to do in the long term. Salvage is an important part of forestry after a fire and not reinventing the wheel every single time we need to do the salvage and have lawsuits over it. f 
IN MEMORY OF ERIC BRADLEY (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, like everyone who knew him, I was shocked and am still very saddened by the sudden passing of Eric Bradley. Eric was so many things to so many people. He was a colleague, a friend, a mentor, a son, a husband, a father. For me, Eric was a dear friend who helped me in so many ways over the years, just as he helped so many others, but that was Eric. He gave of himself to everyone whom he met whether that be insight, advice, knowledge, or simple kindness. Behind all of his hard work, behind all of his efforts, there was a genuine passion for making life better for others. Just like anyone who crossed his all too brief time with us, I am better for having known him. I will miss my friend. 
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EASTER RISING (Mr. KING of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, this year is the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising in Dublin, Ireland, which was the seminal moment in the fight for Irish independence. Since that time, the United States and Ireland have had an extremely close relationship in trade, business, and on so many other issues on which we work together, probably none more important than the Good Friday Agreement, which was achieved 18 years ago this year. It is working today, for, after centuries of fighting and strife, there is now a peace process in Northern Ireland which has succeeded, is succeeding, and is going forward. I acknowledge this today, the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising, and the Prime Minister of Ireland, Enda Kenny, is in Washington today to help us commemorate this. 
GALESBURG FORGIVABLE LOANS (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise with great news about the city of Galesburg, Illinois. About a month ago, I spoke on this floor, and I urged the city to apply for lowinterest, federally funded loans 
through the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund. Many officials expressed legitimate concerns about the impact that might have on their budgets, so I worked with the city as well as with the U.S. and the Illinois EPA to see if those loans could be forgiven. Today I am so proud to announce that I have received assurances that up to $4 million in Federal funding will be forgiven. That will happen as soon as the city completes its application and receives formal approval. Mr. Speaker, all communities face challenges. What separates the great ones from the rest is whether communities can come together and solve these challenges. We still have work to do to protect children from lead exposure, but Galesburg is a great city, and I am proud that we are taking this important step together. 
VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, Cedar Bluff, Alabama, November 16, 2015: Sylvia Duffy, 71 years old. Clara Edwards, 68. Pamela O’Shel, 48. Tennessee Colony, Texas, November 15, 2015: Carl Johnson, 77 years old. Thomas Kamp, 46. Nathan Kamp, 23. Austin Kamp, 21. Kade Johnson, 6. Clarksburg, West Virginia, July 26, 2013: Freddy Donald Swiger, 70 years old. Fred Swiger, 47. Todd Russell Amos, 29. Christopher A. Hart, 26. Springfield, Missouri, November 15, 2014: Lewis Green, 44 years old. Trevor Fantroy, 43. Danielle Keyes, 29. Christopher Freeman, 24. Shreveport, Louisiana, May 5, 2016: Tyrone Coley, 37 years old. Randy Brown, 36. Robert Baulkman, 30. Joey Caldwell, 29. Richard Baker, 29. Platte, South Dakota, September 17, 2015: Nicole Westerhuis, 41 years old. 
RESTORE FUNDING TO THE OVERSEAS WAR ACCOUNT (Mr. GALLEGO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, the annual defense bill before the House today removes $18 billion from the overseas war account to fund activities that are not related to war. It is unfortunate that the Republican majority, which claims to be fiscally responsible, is raiding OCO in order to blow past bipartisan spending agreements. This budget gimmick would require an $18 billion supplemental next April—only halfway through the fiscal year—to restore overseas funding for America’s troops. This is no way to govern the Pentagon, and it is doing a disservice to our men and women in uniform by pushing for this. Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said that removing overseas funding during wartime is ‘‘objectionable on the face of it.’’ It is my hope and the hope of many others on the committee that funding for the overseas account will be restored on the House floor before the bill is voted on. I urge my colleagues to oppose the defense bill until these funds are restored. f 
HEAD START’S 51ST ANNIVERSARY (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, today is the 51st anniversary of Head Start. Fiftyone years ago, in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson announced the groundbreaking program. In that year, a shy little girl and the daughter of Mexican immigrants enrolled in Head Start, and it changed her life. That little girl was me. In this Chamber, when we fiercely debate funding education, we are sometimes too removed from the reality of the everyday struggles that are facing America’s children and just how wide that opportunity gap is. Even though I stand before you here as a Congresswoman, I also stand before you as a child of Head Start. Universal, early childhood education is the best investment we can make to close that education gap. I know this because I am living proof of it. Head Start was not merely something that helped me; it has helped 32 million children and their parents to prepare for school. It has prepared them for life. 
PROTECTING AND DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF LGBT EMPLOYEES IN THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL (Mr. ISRAEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, today and this week we will debate the national defense authorization. This is part of our most fundamental obligation as Members of Congress, to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America. However, there is a provision that is inserted into this bill that doesn’t protect and defend—it discriminates. It is a provision in this bill that would effectively stop an executive order that says that Federal contractors cannot discriminate against employees because they happen to be LGBT. I want to say this again. In the defense authorization, House Republicans have inserted a provision to empower and enable the discrimination of LGBT employees. That is not protecting and defending. That is discrimination. That is divisive. It is disgusting. Our job is to protect and defend the American people and not inject the defense budget with ideologies that are based on protecting a political base, Mr. Speaker. It is a disservice to our troops, and it is a disservice to our national security to inject such poisonous language into a defense budget that is meant to protect and defend the constitutional rights of the American people. f 
40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL VOLUNTEER FIRE COUNCIL (Mr. PASCRELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, which is the largest caucus in the Congress, I rise in advance of the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the National Volunteer Fire Council on May 20 so as to recognize its hard work and dedication to protecting our communities. The brave men and women who volunteer their time are professionals who put their lives on the line every day. Founded in 1976, the NVFC came together in Chicago to provide a unified voice for volunteer firefighters across our Nation. With this guiding vision, the NVFC has grown its ranks to a board comprised of 49 State fire service associations and with a membership of nearly 20,000 individual and department members. Today, volunteers have a strong voice at the table when it comes to critical fire and emergency service issues thanks to the NVFC. The organization has been there to meet the challenges that volunteers face and to address critical issues every day. From groundbreaking programs and innovative resources to legislative and regulatory advocacy, the NVFC continues to serve the volunteer in meaningful and significant ways. I look forward to continuing to work with them to advocate for our volunteers. 
COMMEMORATING 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 1916 EASTER RISING Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Foreign Affairs be discharged from further consideration of the resolution (H. Res. 716) commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising, a seminal moment in Ireland’s journey to independence, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment to the text at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment to the preamble at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
Strike the preamble and insert the following: Whereas the more than 35 million Americans of Irish descent strengthen the friendly relations between the United States and Ireland; Whereas throughout our history Americans of Irish descent have made significant contributions to the United States and have helped to shape its history; Whereas in April 1916, through the Easter Rising, an attempt was launched to secure Irish independence; Whereas signatories to the 1916 Proclamation of the Irish Republic were influenced by the experience of the United States and therefore included the United States as the only foreign country specifically mentioned in the Proclamation; Whereas the United States recognized and established diplomatic relations with the Irish Free State in 1923; Whereas Ireland is a valued partner in international fora, including the United Nations, the NATO Partnership for Peace Program, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the World Trade Organization; Whereas the United States and Ireland continue to share deep and abiding ties across a host of areas, including economic, scientific, and educational cooperative efforts, and international development cooperation; Whereas the United States and Ireland enjoy a thriving and mutually beneficial trade and investment relationship, with the United States being the largest exporter to Ireland of services, and the second largest exporter of goods; Whereas the United States and Ireland enjoy broad scientific cooperative programs, to the benefit of the United States, Ireland, and Northern Ireland, facilitated by the United StatesIreland Research and Development Partnership, which prioritizes joint research in the areas of nanoscale science and engineering, sensor networks, telecommunications, energy and sustainability, and health; Whereas the United States and Ireland support thriving bilateral educational exchange programs, which Ireland has promoted in recent years with the establishment of Student Ambassador programs, increasing scholarships, and being a contributor and Lead Signature Partner in the U.S. Generation Study Abroad Program; Whereas the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom have worked closely, with the ongoing support of the United States, in promoting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland; and Whereas the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising offers an opportunity for recommitment to strengthening the relationship between the United States and Ireland for the benefit of future generations in both countries: Now, therefore, be it Mr. KING of New York (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. The amendment to the preamble was agreed to. The title of the resolution was amended so as to read: ‘‘Recognizing the deep and abiding friendship between the United States and Ireland and recommending actions to further strengthen those ties.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4974, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5243, ZIKA RESPONSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 736 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. b1230 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of both H.R. 5243, the Zika Response Appropriations Act of 2016, and H.R. 4974, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 5243 under a closed rule with an hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations, along with a motion to recommit. In addition, the rule provides for an open rule for consideration of the MILCONVA appropriations bill for FY 2017. It also provides for a motion to recommit on the MILCONVA bill. Finally, Mr. Speaker, the rule includes three budget provisions, which allow for the enforcement of the OCO firewall, allow for Members to deposit savings from their amendments in a spending reduction account, and provides limitations on advance appropriations consistent with the budget resolution. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present H.R. 5243 to the House for its consideration. As I said in the Rules Committee yesterday, the debate over this legislation isn’t about whether or not we provide resources for Zika, it is about whether or not we pay for it through our existing resources or just add it to the national debt. I am pleased that we have chosen the former course. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5243 provides an additional $622.1 million, for a total of over $1.2 billion to fight the Zika outbreak. H.R. 5243 provides additional money to the Centers for Disease Control for mosquito control and programs for prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care. In addition, we provide the NIH with the resources needed to develop vaccines and diagnostic tests. In addition, as opposed to the President’s request, this legislation maintains important oversight restrictions on the use of these funds. Understandably, they must be used solely for Zika. The President’s supplemental request, in addition to not being paid for, would allow the socalled emergency funds to be used for almost anything. Importantly, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is fully offset by using leftover, unobligated Ebola funds and the unused Health and Human Services administrative funding. In addition, Mr. Speaker, this legislation reflects the emergency of this situation by making these funds available through the end of this fiscal year. Yesterday, Chairman ROGERS told the Rules Committee that a standalone piece of legislation stands the best chance of becoming law. If we were to attach this measure as part of one of the fiscal year 2017 appropriations bills, as the Senate has done, there is no guarantee that it would be enacted swiftly. In my opinion, the best way to ensure its quick enactment is through standalone legislation, like H.R. 5243. In addition to the Zika response appropriations bill, this rule allows for the consideration of the first appropriations bill considered by the House for FY 2017, the MILCONVA appropriations bill. I am pleased that the House is, once again, going through regular order and considering appropriations bills under an open process. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am always proud that we can bring these bills up under an open process where all Members have the opportunity to bring their ideas for an upordown vote by the entire House. H.R. 4974 provides $73.5 billion in discretionary funding for the Veterans Administration, a 3percent increase over FY16. In addition, it includes important oversight and good government provisions, like preventing the closure of Guantanamo Bay, prohibiting bonuses for all VA Senior Executive Service personnel, and increased oversight, like requiring largescale construction projects to be managed by an outside entity so that mistakes like the Denver VA health facility, now $1 billion over budget, will never be repeated. I am encouraged by the hard work of Chairman ROGERS and Ranking Member LOWEY for their commitment to regular order and ensuring that the power of the purse is one that this House can continue to exercise. Both the Zika Response Appropriations Act and the FY 2017 MILCONVA bill demonstrate our commitment to that end. I urge support for the rule and the underlying legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for H.R. 4974, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, and H.R. 5243, the Zika Response Appropriations Act. There are many things to praise in the military construction and VA appropriations bill. This is the first of the FY17 appropriations bills to reach the floor, and I hope that we soon have the opportunity to vote on other important appropriations packages. The legislation, as pointed out by my good friend, provides $81.6 billion in total discretionary funding for fiscal year 2017 to fund military construction projects and programs within the Department of Veterans Affairs. It provides funding to hire 242 new VA staff to help reduce the VA’s backlog in processing claims, as well as important funding for mental health programs and suicide prevention outreach. Certain VA medical services, including longterm care for veterans and support services for caregivers, are also included in this bill, which increase health program funding by approximately 5 percent as compared to the last fiscal year. As cochair of the Congressional Homelessness Caucus, I also welcome the inclusion of the President’s full fiscal year ’17 request for veterans homelessness outreach programs in this legislation. We have made great progress in our work to end veteran homelessness, and these programs play a critical role in getting our veterans off the streets. 
However, despite these points, the bill is not without criticism. The additional language that indiscriminately denies performance awards as well as the inclusion of other ideologically divisive provisions that are outside the scope of this legislation, to me, are problematic. Because of these provisions, the President has indicated that he will veto this legislation in its current form. So it is my hope that we can work together to present a final package that will be able to become law, providing the important funding that our military servicemen and women, their spouses, and our veterans need and rightly deserve. I now turn to debate the Republican majority’s socalled response to Zika. Despite any hope I had that the generally bipartisan effort crafting the military construction and VA appropriations bill may perhaps signal that my friends in the majority are suddenly able to govern responsibly, I am beyond disappointed in the inadequate measure presented here today. Nearly 3 months ago, the President requested Congress to provide $1.9 million to combat the spread of the Zika virus. This number was based on what our Nation’s top experts and scientists at the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, and elsewhere believe is needed to meet the challenges of this impending public health emergency. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, our national top expert on infectious diseases, has warned that if we don’t provide funding at this level, and I quote him, ‘‘that is going to have a very serious negative impact on our ability to get the job done.’’ So, naturally, after these warnings and nearly 3 months after the administration’s request, what have my friends in the Republican majority presented today? A bill with a funding level less than onethird of the amount our Nation’s top doctors tell us is needed to win the fight against the Zika virus. I fear that in trying to address the Zika virus, my Republican colleagues are many days late and many dollars short. This decision risks worsening an already severe crisis. As of May 11, the Centers for Disease Control reports the following: In the continental United States, there have been 503 reported travelassociated cases of Zika. In the United States territories, including Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the United States Virgin Islands, there are 698 locally acquired vectorborne cases reported. b1245 While these numbers may seem small, we must take into account that we are not even in the summer months, and mosquito season has not even started. Despite these troubling figures, if you want to learn what is most important to the majority and their response to this emergency, one need look no further than the summary of this bill prepared by the Committee on Appropriations Republicans. At the top of that summary, they noted for their Members that the funding was ‘‘entirely offset.’’ This statement was underlined, bolded, and italicized. Mr. Speaker, we are facing a public health emergency, and apparently the most important thing to my friends on the other side isn’t that we address this emergency headon with adequate and robust emergency funding but, rather, that we make sure what little funding they are allocated doesn’t cost new money to do so. I guess my Republican friends will be at ease in the face of this looming public health emergency knowing that their response to pay for it is ‘‘offset.’’ One would think that the duty to provide an appropriate level of funding to respond to a national health crisis would be enough to garner a ‘‘yes’’ vote from the Republican majority. Apparently not. I represent one of the States that everyone agrees will be hardest hit by the Zika virus. Indeed, Florida already reported 106 travelrelated cases. Twentytwo of the cases in Florida are from Palm Beach and Broward County, areas that I represent. When the summer months come and this emergency worsens, I don’t think my constituents will be at ease knowing that at least the money Republicans approved of was an offset. Later, Mrs. NITALOWEY , the ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations, the subject matter for today, is going to make statements. I haven’t had an opportunity to talk with her this morning, but yesterday in the Committee on Rules I asked her whether or not, when other emergencies have come up, it has been required that they be offset, and her response was that it was not. She, like myself, has been here during a lot of emergencies that we must and, rightly, should address for the American citizenry. This happens to be one more, and here we are haggling about offset rather than addressing the seriousness of this public national health emergency. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to begin by agreeing with my friend in terms of the appropriations process itself. He is right to celebrate the appearance of one of the bills down here under an open rule, just as I am sure my friend is aware, the Committee on Appropriations, under Mr. ROGERS ’ and Mrs. LOWEY ’s able leadership, has actually produced a series of bills ready and lined up. So I have no doubt this is the first of many bills—I would hope all bills—that we eventually see on the floor that every Member has an opportunity to come down here and amend as they see fit. I also want to appreciate what my friend had to say about the VA and military construction bill. I think he is absolutely correct. That is one of our very best subcommittees. Chairman DENT and Congressman B ISHOP are chair and ranking member. They work together extremely well. While I know my friend has some concerns with specific provisions of that, again, this is a process. As he knows, this is our opening process. We will see what happens. I think at the end of the day, that particular legislation will garner a great deal of bipartisan support, in part because of the very points my good friend made in talking about the bill. Now let’s move to Zika. Here, we obviously have a different point of view. Let me posit some things, Mr. Speaker, that perhaps those watching this debate and discussion aren’t aware of. First, $600 million has already been deployed for Zika. That was out of money set aside for both Ebola and other infectious diseases. That money, by the way, totaled over $5 billion originally. There is still close to $3 billion of it left. It was to be spent over several years. So when the President made his request, the initial response from Chairman ROGERS was, spend this money now. Don’t wait on Congress to act. You have got available resources. The administration eventually agreed with that point of view. So to this point, nothing has been left undone because of money. Everything the Federal Government has wanted to do has been fully funded. And, indeed, in that fund, there is still well over $2 billion, so literally everything it plans to do in the timeframe it plans to do it can be done. So that is $600 million of the $1.9 billion immediately available. This bill would provide another $622 million, which is actually more money than the administration plans to spend in this fiscal year. So they will have more than enough resources. In the bill, there is actually money included for the National Institutes of Health that will not be spent until next year as they work through the process of developing vaccines and diagnostics. So there is more than adequate funding here. Finally, in the remainder of the year, when we get to the LaborHHS bill and the foreign operations bill, we will put in literally hundreds of millions more money for fiscal year 2017. That $1.9 billion isn’t to be used right now. It is to be used over a 2year period, so you don’t need all of it right now. The key difference is not the amount of money. The key difference is, number one, this is offset. My friend is correct about that. It is paid for. Rather than saying we are going to just immediately add an additional $1.9 billion to the national debt, say: Look, we have money set aside; we have got money here we can offset through other unused funds, and we have got money in the regular appropriations process for next year. All of this can and should be paid for. Frankly, it is not like a Hurricane 
Sandy or a Hurricane Katrina with massive damage, immediate response required. This is actually smaller, more manageable, and these are moneys spent over not a short period of time, but over a couple of years. So this is actually the prudent way to actually move forward on this money. But again, the important thing to know is everything that has needed to be done has been done. There hasn’t been anything delayed. Nothing has been set back. Frankly, what Mr. ROGERSoffers us will actually speed money to the process. The debate, here again, as I said in my opening remarks, isn’t about Zika; it is about whether or not you want to pay for the response, and that requires some tough choices to be made. That means other things that aren’t emergency might not get as much funding. The administration, like anybody else, if they can have their cake and eat it too, is delighted to do so. The more prudent path is to actually pay for the emergency that you have if you can. If you can’t, then you move to something bigger. But in this case, we have the ability to do that, and I think we ought to do it. I would hope our friends work with us on this. We see that this is an emergency. We have provided money immediately. We are moving now, prudently, to provide additional money, more than is needed in the short term and, frankly, as the bills roll out, you will see that there will be additional money yet to come—money that, by the way, was not intended to be spent until next year anyway. So there is no reason to spend it all right now. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up the Democratic alternative Zika bill that provides the administration with the $1.9 billion its top scientific and medical experts say is needed to mount a robust response to the Zika crisis without jeopardizing its ability to address other public health threats, like Ebola. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the RECORD along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ), the ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations and my good friend, to discuss our proposal. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, the Republican Zika bill provides $622 million, about onethird of the $1.9 billion requested. The bill also steals more Ebola funding as an offset instead of replenishing what was already redirected to Zika. We don’t offset spending to respond to emergencies, and we certainly don’t steal from prior emergency response efforts still underway when a new emergency arises. Let’s just consider, my friends, recent history. Emergency funding was provided to respond to both Ebola and H1N1. In last year’s omnibus, Congress used emergency funding without offsets to pay for wildland fire suppression, mostly in the West. Congress also provided emergency funding to respond to two hurricanes and flooding in the Carolinas and Texas, again without offsets. When those disasters struck, we didn’t steal money from prior disaster response, like the emergency funding provided for hurricane damage in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida; or storms in West Virginia; or tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kentucky. In fact, after the 2013 Oklahoma tornadoes, my friend, Chairman ROGERS , said: ‘‘I don’t think disasters of this type should be offset. We have an obligation to help these people.’’ Now that the Zika public health emergency has ravaged Brazil, spread to Puerto Rico, and threatens an outbreak in the continental United States, suddenly Republicans insist on shortchanging efforts to ensure the deadly Ebola virus doesn’t reemerge to pay for Zika response. The money they would take from Ebola isn’t nearly enough to prevent the spread of the deadly Zika virus that especially endangers pregnant women and children who could be born with very severe disabilities. If the previous question is defeated, Mr. HASTINGS will amend the rule to offer my bill, H.R. 5044, as a substitute, providing the full $1.9 billion the administration requested without offsets to ensure an adequate response to Zika that doesn’t rob our Ebola response. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me begin by thanking my good friend for her wonderful work on that committee. She has had the opportunity to serve on her subcommittee when she was a subcommittee chairman and now to work with her ranking member. There is no better person than NITALOWEY on that committee. However, we are going to disagree a little bit here. First of all, when you say the bill only provides a third, of course, you have already got a third. The first $600 million is the first third. That has already been deployed. It is being spent. This is the next third. The remaining third is money that will be spent—by the way, not this year, but next year—and it will be presented in the normal appropriations bills. I happen to chair one of those committees, the socalled LaborHHS Subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. We will have hundreds of millions of dollars in that bill for next year’s Zika response. So to suggest that somebody is being shortchanged, the money is just being prudently laid out at an appropriate pace and paid for along the way. That is point number one. Point number two, again, this isn’t a debate about the disease. It was this committee and our chairman who immediately responded and said: You have extra money left. Now, by the way, the Ebola money, if you go back and look at the legislation, is Ebola and other infectious diseases. b1300 In other words, when Congress appropriated that, they knew they might be appropriating more than was needed for Ebola and there might be other crises to come up. So that money is being used exactly the way it is supposed to be used. The Appropriations Committee has assured that both the CDC and the NIH and the administration that, should additional money be required—and there is still almost $2 million of Ebola money—and if you need more and you are going to spend it over the next several years, come back and we will sit down and we will work with you and get you the money. So this suggestion that somehow the fight against Ebola has been sidelined or cut short or shortchanged, again, is simply not true. My friends use a lot of rhetoric here, largely to hide the fact that while we have got plenty of available money both set aside in the normal appropriations process and certainly in this bill of Chairman ROGERS to pay for things, they just simply want to add it to the national debt. They don’t want to use available resources. They don’t want to operate within the normal Appropriations Committee, I guess because they want to spend that money someplace else. To suggest that anybody is disingenuous or shortchanging either Zika or Ebola simply doesn’t square with reality. It was Congress, after all—a Republican majority in the House and a Democratic majority in the Senate, but, frankly, a genuinely bipartisan effort—that voted the $5 billionplus for Ebola in the first place. Last year, the President asked for a billiondollar increase at the National Institutes of Health. We gave him a $2 billion increase. I can’t remember the precise number last year, but I do remember we appropriated more for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention than the President requested. So it is not as if these things are not a priority. I think they are a priority on both sides of the aisle. We have proven that by bringing appropriations bills to the floor beyond what the President requested. But we think the prudent thing to do is not just willy nilly add $1.9 billion worth of debt on the American taxpayer, particularly when the money is at hand to pay for what we need right now and we have an appropriations bill coming up in June 
where the rest of it can be taken care of and we can actually monitor this thing. On the Ebola crisis, we may well have appropriated more than we needed to. That is why we have the other infectious diseases. In fact, if you look at the administration’s budget proposal, they actually were taking $40 million out of this same pot of money to spend on unrelated malaria suppression abroad. I am not quarreling with that—that is fine—but it suggests, again, even the administration thought, ‘‘Well, maybe there is more money than we need in here for Ebola, or we can count on Congress to come back,’’ which, by the way, is true if they need more money. This is all about trying to circumvent the appropriations process and trying to add debt when there are sufficient resources available. If there were not, then that would be another matter. I agree with my friends: the response is important. But in this case, because the response is spread out over 2 years, you have plenty of time. And this is a relatively modest amount of money. This isn’t like an $80 billion expenditure that we had for Hurricane Sandy. We can do this in a thoughtful and prudent way and avoid the debt that is associated with emergency spending. We want to continue to work with the administration. We have demonstrated in the past that we are willing to fund NIH and CDC above administrationrecommended levels. We responded quickly during the Ebola emergency. We think this is the appropriate way to go. The Senate is moving a vehicle, as we all know. At some point, if we pass this—and I think we will—we will sit down with our friends, and we will hammer out a common response. But, again, do remember that nothing is not being done for lack of money. Everything the administration has wanted to do to date, it has had the resources to do. And we will continue to make sure that it does. At the end of the day, we think they ought to be paid for, since we have the ability to do that. And that is what we are trying to accomplish: keep debt off the back of the American taxpayer, if we possibly can. In this case, we can and we should. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, before yielding to my good friend from Texas, I include in the RECORD a letter from the White House over the signature of Shaun Donovan, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Susan Rice, National Security Adviser, directed to the Speaker of the House, PAUL D. R YAN, on April 26, 2016. THEWHITE HOUSE , Washington, DC, April 26, 2016. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN: As you are aware, on February 22, the Administration transmitted to Congress its formal request for $1.9 billion in emergency supplemental funding to address the public health threat posed by the Zika virus. Sixtyfour days have passed since this initial request; yet still Congress has not acted. Since the time the Administration transmitted its request, the public health threat posed by the Zika virus has increased. After careful review of existing evidence, scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. The Zika virus has spread in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and abroad. As of April 20, there were 891 confirmed Zika cases in the continental United States and U.S. territories, including 81 pregnant women with confirmed cases of Zika. Based on similar experiences with other diseases transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito— believed to be the primary carrier of the Zika virus—scientists at the CDC expect there could be local transmission within the continental U.S. in the summer months. Updated estimate range maps show that these mosquitoes have been found in cities as far north as San Francisco, Kansas City and New York City. In the absence of action from Congress to address the Zika virus, the Administration has taken concrete and aggressive steps to help keep America safe from this growing public health threat. The Administration is working closely with State and local governments to prepare for outbreaks in the continental United States and to respond to the current outbreak in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. We are expanding mosquito control surveillance and laboratory capacity; developing improved diagnostics as well as vaccines; supporting affected expectant mothers, and supporting other Zika response efforts in Puerto Rico, the U.S. territories, the continental United States, and abroad. These efforts are crucial, but they are costly and they fall well outside of current agency appropriations. To meet these immediate needs, the Administration conducted a careful examination of existing Ebola balances and identified $510 million to redirect towards Zika response activities. We have also redirected an additional $79 million from other activities. This reprogramming, while necessary, is not without cost. It is particularly painful at a time when state and local public health departments are already strained. While this immediate infusion of resources is necessary to enable the Administration to take critical first steps in our response to the public health threat posed by Zika, it is insufficient. Without significant additional appropriations this summer, the Nation’s efforts to comprehensively respond to the disease will be severely undermined. In particular, the Administration may need to suspend crucial activities, such as mosquito control and surveillance in the absence of emergency supplemental funding. State and local governments that manage mosquito control and response operations will not be able to hire needed responders to engage in mosquito mitigation efforts. Additionally, the Administration’s ability to move to the next phase of vaccine development, which requires multiyear commitments from the Government to encourage the private sector to prioritize Zika research and development, could be jeopardized. Without emergency supplemental funding, the development of faster and more accurate diagnostic tests also will be impeded. The Administration may not be able to conduct follow up of children born to pregnant women with Zika to better understand the range of Zika impacts, particularly those health effects that are not evident at birth. The supplemental request is also needed to replenish the amounts that we are now spending from our Ebola accounts to fund Zikarelated activities. This will ensure we have sufficient contingency funds to address unanticipated needs related to both Zika and Ebola. As we have seen with both Ebola and Zika, there are still many unknowns about the science and scale of the outbreak and how it will impact mothers, babies, and health systems domestically and abroad. The Administration is pleased to learn that there is bipartisan support for providing emergency funding to address the Zika crisis, but we remain concerned about the adequacy and speed of this response. To properly protect the American public, and in particular pregnant women and their newborns, Congress must fund the Administration’s request of $1.9 billion and find a path forward to address this public health emergency immediately. The American people deserve action now. With the summer months fast approaching, we continue to believe that the Zika supplemental should not be considered as part of the regular appropriations process, as it relates to funding we must receive this year in order to most effectively prepare for and mitigate the impact of the virus. We urge you to pass freestanding emergency supplemental funding legislation at the level requested by the Administration before Congress leaves town for the Memorial Day recess. We look forward to working with you to protect the safety and health of all Americans. Sincerely, SHAUN DONOVAN , Director, The Office of Management and Budget. SUSAN RICE, National Security Advisor. 
Mr. HASTINGS. Excerpting from that letter a portion of the first paragraph on the second page, let me read what is said, in partial response to my good friend from Oklahoma: ‘‘Without significant additional appropriations this summer, the Nation’s efforts to comprehensively respond to the disease will be severely undermined. In particular, the administration may need to suspend crucial activities, such as mosquito control and surveillance, in the absence of emergency supplemental funding. ‘‘State and local governments that manage mosquito control and response operations will not be able to hire needed responders to engage in mosquito mitigation efforts. Additionally, the administration’s ability to move to the next phase of vaccine development, which requires multiyear commitments from the government to encourage the private sector to prioritize Zika research and development, could be jeopardized. ‘‘Without emergency supplemental funding, the development of faster and more accurate diagnostic tests also will be impeded. The administration may not be able to conduct followup of children born to pregnant women with 
Zika to better understand the range of Zika impacts, particularly those health effects that are not evident at birth. ‘‘The supplemental request is also needed to replenish the amounts that we are now spending from our Ebola accounts to fund Zikarelated activities. This will ensure we have sufficient contingency funds to address unanticipated needs related to both Zika and Ebola. As we have seen with both Ebola and Zika, there are still many unknowns about the science and scale of the outbreak and how it will impact mothers, babies, and health systems domestically and abroad.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ), my good friend. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am concerned. I am concerned because, while the mosquito is not the unbeatable foe, it is the deadliest living organism on the Earth. The deadliest life form is the mosquito. Annually, the mosquito kills 1 million humans, mostly from malaria, I must tell you, but I must tell you that they also kill by way of the West Nile virus. In Houston, Texas, we have had people contract the West Nile virus. We have people die. I would also mention that they are the greatest survivors. They survived the dinosaurs. We are dealing with a deadly foe. Make no mistake, the size should not in any way cause us to believe that this is something we can take as less than a deadly enemy that we have to confront. The World Health Organization has indicated that there may be as many as 4 million cases of the Zika virus from Zikacarrying mosquitoes in the Americas. As of February 1, we had seven confirmed cases in Houston, Texas. It appears, from what I have read, that standing water activates them. It appears that rain can activate these mosquitos. If this is true, in Houston, Texas, given that we have just had the socalled tax day flood and because we are still being inundated with rain quite regularly—an 80 percent chance of rain today in Houston, an 80 percent chance tomorrow—it appears that we have the makings of a special problem in Houston, Texas. So, I am gravely concerned. I hope that we do all that we can to make sure that we get the necessary equipment and the necessary funding so that this enemy can be confronted properly. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by actually agreeing with my friends and, certainly, my good friend from Texas. He is right about the danger that we are dealing with. My friend from Florida is certainly right about the severity of this. I think where they are wrong is the suggestion that nothing has been done; $600 million has been deployed. This bill is actually a response to the very letter that my good friend from Florida read. This does provide the next third of the requested money by the administration. And, frankly, the bill extends this into next year to address the concerns my friend expressed about having a multiyear commitment. The money in here for the National Institutes of Health, which is the lead agency in developing vaccine and diagnostics, is fully funded for what they have asked to be funded for next year. So this actually does that. Now, we will have an additional bill through committee in June where we will provide additional resources for the CDC for next year and whatever other things needed. The total spending here on both sides is about the same. It is being deployed right now. This is a response to some of the concerns. What concerns my friends, I think, is they would just prefer not to pay for it. They would just prefer to add it to the national debt. Well, gosh, that is a great thing to do, but that is probably how we ended up with a deficit of over half a billion dollars for FY 2017 and a national debt of over $19 trillion. If this were something that we couldn’t handle any other way—that we only had an emergency—I would agree with my friends. I did that when we had the Sandy relief. There was no other way for something that large. That is not the case here. This is $1.9 billion. Most of that money is coming out of the LaborHHS bill, which, by the way, spends $163 billion a year. If you can’t fund $1.9 billion spaced over 2 years in a bill that provides in that period of time around $320 billion, you are just not trying. This is all about being able to spend someplace else. And, again, not one thing has not been done. Everything that anybody in the Federal Government has wanted to do, they have been able to do. In addition, the Ebola money is not just the Ebola money; it is Ebola and other infectious diseases. That is what it was there for. It was not just meant to be spent only on Ebola. Even after the $600 million, even after the money that is offset in this bill, which is roughly at $350 million, that fund still will have almost $2 billion in it that can deploy any way against infectious diseases that the administration says it needs, and it has the commitment of Appropriations, which has demonstrated again and again that it will do this: If you run short in this area, we will backfill. That is why we have appropriations bills moving now. We can take care of you. But we can do it within the budget limits negotiated with the administration. That is prudent management of the money. So, given the track record here, both in responding on Ebola and putting more money in the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control than the administration expected and now moving quickly to be helpful here, I think we have either a misunderstanding or a manufactured crisis. There is no crisis. There is a real challenge, and money needs to move toward it now. That is exactly what we have done. That is exactly what we are doing in this bill. That is exactly what we will do in the appropriations bills that will be presented in Congress as the appropriations season progresses. With that, I want to reassure my friend that the resources will be there. They have been there thus far. They will continue to be there. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ), my good friend. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, the indifference by some in this Congress to a looming public health crisis is truly stunning. This Republican bill cuts the emergency funding request for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by 80 percent. That is $4 out of every $5 it asks for that will be eliminated. The Zika virus is a terrible virus. It eats away at the brain of a fetus and results in a family tragedy of a child who is born with very severe birth defects. It will require costly lifetime care. b1315 Zika can be sexually transmitted, and it has spread to many parts of Texas. We have Texastough mosquitoes, and the season is just beginning there. We are on the cusp of an epidemic spreading across our region; meanwhile, the Republicans are refusing to provide the resources to prevent it. Now, I appreciate the very reassuring words that we have been hearing here, but just this morning I sat down and met with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Tom Frieden, and I asked him: What difference does it make that $4 out of every $5 you have asked for are being cut? He said in our discussion: If this Republican bill is approved to deny this vital CDC and NIH funding, we will not be able to develop the tools to diagnose the virus, combat the mosquitoes, and develop a safe and effective vaccine against it. He said: We cannot monitor all of those who are being infected, have already been infected, and the neighbors around them that another mosquito bite might transmit the virus to them. He said: We cannot get back to Texas and other States’ general emergency preparedness funds that we have taken away in order to try to fight the Zika virus. To do the job effectively, this Administration needs more than four months of temporary funding. It needs long term contracting authority to get at this crisis and to prevent it. I think that disease control and prevention represents some of our best and most effective investments in health. We can save a lifetime of suffering to so many families, and we can save millions of dollars of public and private monies that these children 
born with severe birth defects will have. The gentleman is correct that the Republican Senate is considering this matter. In fact, it not only considered it, but, finally, yesterday it approved legislation that offers almost twice as much in the way of resources to address this crisis as the bill the gentleman is promoting today includes. I say let’s join together and reject this rule—reject it, and demand that the Republican leadership respond with the funding necessary to protect families across America from an emerging Zika tragedy. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to always recognize my good friend from Texas, who is really one of my good friends in this body. But I am not surprised that the Senate bill is twice as much money because it runs for twice the time. This bill runs to September 30th. The Senate bill runs until September 30, 2017, so they are not materially that different. What we have said is we would deal with next year’s problem in the appropriations process for this year. Now, again, I know my friend’s concern is legitimate. I do. I don’t have any doubt about it. But I point out one more time, $600 million has been appropriated or has been made available. This is an additional $600 million. This $1.2 billion for the time of this fiscal year is actually more than the administration had planned to spend in this period. It reaches into next year, but they will have it available for this year if they need it. They have another nearly $2 billion in Ebola/other infectious diseases money, and they have the assurance that additional things are coming. The only difference here is, are you going to pay for it? Or are you just going to add it to the national credit card, another $2 billion, roughly, on the national debt, when you have the resources and the time available to operate within the appropriation system? So this debate, as I have said repeatedly, isn’t about Zika. It is about whether you pay to deal with Zika, or whether you would just like to do whatever you want to do and forget about paying for it. Unfortunately, we don’t have that luxury indefinitely. So this is a responsible, wellthoughtthrough measure. It is fully paid for. Nobody is short of resources, nobody will be short of resources. The money is available to do whatever the administration wants to do. It is well aware of that fact. And these are additional resources deployed here, with the assurance of other resources that will be deployed during the course of the normal appropriations process. So I fail to see, when the amount of money is essentially the same on both sides over essentially the same period, why we keep going back and acting as if this $600 million is all there is. There is another 600 that has already been spent. There is more coming. It is coming in a regular way. The only thing that upsets my friends on the other side is it is being paid for. I mean, how outrageous: we are actually going to pay for a government activity that is important for us to accomplish, with the assurance that if more is needed, more will be made available. Mr. Speaker, that is the simple difference here, despite all the discussion about the disease, about readiness, is who is willing to pay for what needs to be done and who, frankly, would just prefer to put on it the national credit card. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENE GREEN ), my very good friend. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Members, I thank my colleague from the Committee on Rules and my classmate for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule and to H.R. 5243. The last three Democratic speakers are from Texas. The Southeastern States are ground zero for Zika and other diseases. It is the first known vectorborne disease to cause microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. Our knowledge of the disease and how it is transmitted and its complications have evolved rapidly since the epidemic began, but there is still a lot unknown. We do not have rapid diagnostic tests or an effective vaccine against this virus. The mosquito vector is actively present in several parts of the United States, including Houston and the Southern States. Current vector control efforts are uncoordinated and inadequate. Cases of Zika are being introduced frequently by returning travelers, and mosquito season is rapidly approaching our community. As of May 11, there were more than 1,200 confirmed Zika cases in the continental U.S. and U.S. territories. Robust action is required to protect Americans, and this bill falls dramatically short of the response this epidemic demands. H.R. 5243 only provides a third of the funds necessary to respond to a Zika outbreak and, even worse, a large portion of the funding is taken from money Congress has appropriated to respond to the Ebola crisis. We are taking money away from researching Ebola cures to put on Zika. Ebola will not go away. We cannot rob Peter to pay Paul. My good friend from Oklahoma, I know in 2003, we sent legislators up to his district. I hope in Texas we don’t send mosquitos up to his district, because that could happen. Congress has a constitutional and moral duty to protect the health and welfare of our country. I am saddened to say this bill fails to uphold our responsibilities to the American people. Crises of this magnitude demand robust, multiyear investments in our public health infrastructure, vaccine, diagnostic development, and transmission control. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HASTINGS. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Funding to fight the Zika virus must be treated as an emergency that is similar to past emergencies, like Ebola and H1N1 viruses. It should not be offset or use previously appropriated funds for other public health priorities. Doing so will only continue the broken cycle of lurching from outbreak to outbreak. Even worse, this bill only funds the Department of Health and Human Services’ response until September 30. Mosquitos don’t follow our fiscal year. This threat is real, immediate, and grave. On behalf of American families, mothers, and the next generation, we must do better. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and bring meaningful legislation to the floor that adequately and responsibly funds our response to the Zika virus. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My good friend, Mr. GENE GREEN — and he is my good friend—as I recall, those Texas legislators were called the Killer Bees. And if you want to compare them to mosquitos, I will leave you that luxury and that political risk. We just call Texas legislators welcome guests. So they are welcome to come any time. In terms of the point, though, I think I agree with much of what you say, other than the last part of what you said about adequately, responsibly funding. That is exactly what we are doing. The total amount of money here we are talking about, my friends keep forgetting about this $600 million that has already been deployed, and they keep suggesting that this is like only Ebola money. That is not the way the legislation is written. It is written for Ebola and other infectious diseases. In other words, we are using that money exactly the way we are supposed to use it, not shortchanging anybody. If we need money later—because this is money that is to be spent over multiple years—we will come back and put it in. But that money, frankly, if it had not been available, there would not have been an immediate response possible. It was available, so it is being used in the appropriate way. This is the next third. So when we hear this talk about only a third of what the administration requested, we have already done a third. We are getting ready to do the next third, and we are telling you, in bills that are coming 
to the floor, both State and foreign ops, and LaborHHS, that there will be additional money that will essentially total about what the administration has asked to spend. We recognize that these things do develop, do change. Our understanding of them changes over time. This is actually a thoughtful way to do this. But the assurance has been made: if you need more money, then you have got it. We will work with you. We will find a way to do it. Our assistance is, if we can pay for it, then we do pay for it; and that is exactly what we do in this bill. We hear comparisons, erroneous comparisons, you are only doing half as much as the Republicans in the Senate. No. We are doing it through September 30 of this year. They are doing it through September 30 of next year. The amounts are essentially about the same. The difference, then, is also the same, frankly, with all due respect to my friends in the Senate, we are offsetting and paying for this. And that just seems, to us, the prudent way to do it, not to put more debt on the back of the American taxpayer when you don’t have to. If we had some emergency that called for hundreds of billions of dollars or something of that nature, that would be different. That is not what we are dealing with here. Now, I have a lot of respect for my friend’s concerns, but the chairman of our committee actually led a delegation to South America partially on this issue recently. I happened to have the privilege of going along with Chairman ROGERS . We stopped in Peru, where there is a Naval research station we have operated for decades. It normally focuses on tropical diseases—we have a lot of issues with that when our military is deployed in those areas—but it is working around the clock on Zika and is doing some great work. Then we went to Brazil, which is really the epicenter of this outbreak; sat down and talked with the Centers for Disease Control people on the ground, which we did; talked with the Brazilian government, which we did; saw, as Brazil was deploying literally hundreds of thousands, 220,000 of its own military personnel, to go door to door. So I think probably Chairman ROGERShas as good a grasp, with all due respect, as anybody in this body on what is being done, what needs to be done, and how to proceed. At every step along the way, he has shown that resources are going to be made available. They have been, but they are being made available in a responsible, prudent way, with appropriate oversight, in a timely manner, but in a manner which is offset and paid for. That is what I think the American people want us to do: take care of what is important, do it right, do it responsibly, and pay for it if you have the funds available before you automatically add it to the credit card that our kids and grandkids are going to someday have to pay off. So we will continue to work with our friends. We will work with our colleagues in the Senate. But to suggest for 1 minute that the Federal Government doesn’t have the resources it needs, when it has much more than it has asked sitting still unobligated in funds, is just simply not the case. It has the money it needs. It is getting the resources in the right way. We are simply paying for them. I know that is hard for some of my friends to accept, but it is actually the appropriate way to proceed. We actually should do more of this in this body rather than less. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it has become clear that the Republican leadership has either abdicated its authority to govern to the far right of its party, or never had the wherewithal to do so in the first place. b1330 Either way, the American people are tired of this majority’s inability to address the issues facing our country. During the 114th Congress, Republicans have brought to the floor bills with absolutely no hope of becoming law, strictly partisan measures that were more messaging bills than serious legislative proposals. We saw it a couple of weeks ago with a string of bills attacking the Internal Revenue Service to score political points during tax day. None of that is going to become law. We have seen it with bills to weaken environmental protections or to limit a woman’s right to choose. Now we see it with a bill that the President has threatened to veto because Republicans have included ideological riders. The majority seems to be more focused on scoring political points than actually getting to the business of governing. Our friends on the other side of the aisle attempt to merely swat away the looming public health crisis posed by the Zika virus. This approach is as lacking in leadership as it is callous. I can guarantee you that the mosquitos carrying the Zika virus do not care if you are a Democrat or a Republican. They do not care if the money used to stop them is offset. But I can promise my Republican friends, pinching pennies on basic investments to address a public health emergency will inevitably heighten costs—in dollars and lives—down the road. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank, as always, my good friend from Florida. He is truly a delight to work with, one of the really great Members in this body. Not surprisingly, he knows I disagree with him on his characterization of the current Congress, because saying that we haven’t done anything is forgetting what has actually happened. This is the first Congress to pass a multiyear highway bill since 2005 and the first one to overhaul common education since 2002. Last week, we had opioid legislation on this floor that we all know is critical and is certainly going to come into law, and it will be funded. We had the first real human trafficking bill; an overhaul of the Veterans Administration; a budget agreement that meant we had no closures and no debt crisis; more funding for the National Institutes of Health—it has been one of the central issues in this debate—than the President asked for last year, more new funding; and the same thing for the Centers for Disease Control. So I actually argue it has been a pretty productive Congress in many, many ways. In terms of Zika, though, let’s again get back and just clarify things. The President asked for $1.9 billion in emergency funding. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee immediately said: You have got plenty of money. Use whatever you want; $600 million of that was used. If you need that replenished, we will replenish that in the normal course of appropriations. He now brings to the floor a bill that carries the next third of the funding that the administration has asked for, fully offset, money that is more than they expect to spend from now until September 30. Some of that money is available into next year, certainly the money that the NIH would need for diagnostics and vaccines. We will bring to the floor the rest of it. So the only thing that we really differ on is should we pay for this major effort or not when we have the resources. We have the resources. Ours is paid for. The administration’s proposal is not. It is just that simple. Do you just want to add $1.9 billion, or do you want to responsibly work the problem? This committee, the Appropriations Committee, has been at the forefront of responding to this every step along the way. It will continue to do so. We will work with our friends. In closing, Mr. Speaker, the Constitution gives the Congress the power of the purse. Article I, section 9 gives that authority to Congress. While the President has every right and duty to submit a supplemental appropriations request, it is the duty of Congress to examine that request and provide for the funds and conditions it feels appropriate to execute them. That is exactly what we have done on Zika, and that is exactly what we have done on MILCON–VA. With that in mind, I would encourage my friends to support the rule and the underlying legislation. The material previously referred to by Mr. HASTINGS is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution ....  [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule ....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4909, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 735 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alabama? There was no objection. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 735 provides for continued consideration of H.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. The resolution provides for a structured rule and makes in order 120 amendments. These amendments are on top of the 61 amendments that were made in order by yesterday’s rule. That is a combined 181 amendments on one bill. As I mentioned during yesterday’s debate, the NDAA process has always been bipartisan. In fact, Congress has successfully passed the NDAA for each of the last 54 years. That is a really impressive accomplishment. I hope this year is no different. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my colleagues that the NDAA passed out of the Armed Services Committee by a vote of 60–2. That vote total is very, very impressive and demonstrates the bipartisan nature in which our committee, the Armed Services Committee, operates. Another thing I really appreciate about the NDAA process is how open it is and how so many different Members are able to have input into the final product. The first round of amendment debate yesterday was an example of a healthy debate on a wide range of amendments. You look around the country, and so many of our communities are home to important military assets and programs. Some communities are home to military bases where we are training our future fighters. Other communities contribute to our military success with industry suppliers; and every single community across the country is home to servicemembers, whether Active Duty, Guard, or Reserve. Each of these communities faces unique challenges and offer different perspectives. That is why I believe it is so important that we have such an open process to allow a wide range of views to be discussed and debated. During the Armed Services Committee process, we considered 248 amendments. When you add up the amendments considered at the committee level to the amendments we will consider on the floor, it brings us to a huge total of 429 amendments on one bill. These amendments cover a range of important issues from National Guard to cybersecurity, to sexual assault, to religious freedom, to military health care. Looking at specific security threats we face, these amendments address issues relating to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Europe, Russia, and many more places. I know my colleague from Massachusetts is particularly interested in the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF, debate, as I am. Although the Foreign Affairs Committee, not the Armed Services Committee, has jurisdiction over AUMFs, I was pleased that we were able to obtain the committee’s approval for Ms. LEE’s amendment to be made in order so the House can debate this issue on the floor. I know that doesn’t go as far as my colleague from Massachusetts would want it to go, and I hope that there is a time when this body, after hearings in appropriate committees of jurisdiction, can have a full and informed debate on a new AUMF, but we cannot do that under these circumstances today and give the American people the full and fair hearing that they deserve. A few of my colleagues have also expressed concerns about the way this NDAA is funded. This rule makes in order an amendment by Mr. ELLISON  that would cut money out of the overseas contingency operations account. While I think these concerns are misguided, this rule allows that debate to take place. The rule makes in order an amendment by our Rules Committee colleague, Mr. POLIS, which would put in place a 1 percent acrosstheboard reduction in total spending under the NDAA. Again, I think this would be a grave error, but this rule provides for that important debate. We have heard bipartisan concerns about visa programs for certain atrisk populations in Afghanistan, and this amendment makes in order a bipartisan amendment by Mr. BLUMENAUER  to reform the Special Immigrant Visa program. The rule allows for debate on another bipartisan amendment that would require the Department of Defense to report on China’s activities in the South China Sea in their annual report on Chinese military power. I think this is an issue that is particularly important. I hope this gets my point across that we have taken a comprehensive look at national security issues and allowed a wide range of Members, both Republicans and Democrats, to bring their amendments forward. We hear a lot about the need for an open process. Again, I am very pleased that, between the Armed Services Committee and the House floor, 429 amendments will be considered. Given the large number of amendments, I want to thank our Rules Committee staff who put in very late hours to help sort through the amendments. I know it wasn’t easy work, but we certainly appreciate all that they do and the extra hours they put in to help facilitate this debate. Yesterday, I outlined why the National Defense Authorization Act is so critically important. I talked about the critical investment the bill makes to boost our military readiness. I discussed how the bill increases accountability and efficiency at the Pentagon, and I highlighted some of the critical reforms included in the bill. I won’t rehash these points, but I do want to reemphasize one key point: every day we send our servicemembers into dangerous situations. When we do so, we don’t send them into battle as Democrats or Republicans. We send them into battle as Americans. So as we continue working through this bill, I want to again plead with my colleagues to avoid making this about politics. Instead, let’s make this about America and about ensuring our servicemembers have sound policy and the resources they need in order to keep our country safe. We shouldn’t—and, quite frankly, we can’t—let politics get in the way of passing this critical national security bill. Our military men and women deserve nothing less. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 735 and the underlying bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) b1345 Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the honorable chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. THORNBERRY , and the ranking member, Mr. SMITH of Washington, for once again working in a bipartisan manner to bring before this House H.R. 4909, the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. I don’t agree with everything that is in this bill. In fact, there is a lot I do disagree with. But I appreciate that the chairman and the ranking member always treat all Members submitting amendments to the NDAA with respect, and that is very much appreciated. But I must rise in very strong opposition to this structured rule because there are very serious issues that merit the time and attention of this House that were submitted to the Rules Committee by Members from both sides of the aisle, which have not been included in this structured rule. Almost 200 amendments were not made in order. As a Democrat, I am used to being shut out by the Republican majority, but dozens of Republican amendments were blocked as well. Let me say to my Republican friends who did not have their amendment made in order: If you don’t want this to be a pattern, then vote ‘‘no’’ on this rule; if you don’t want this to be a precedent, then vote ‘‘no’’ on this rule. Send a message to your leadership that, in fact, you want a more open and transparent process. Don’t go along just to get along. Don’t be a cheap date when it comes to an open process in this House. The issues that are involved with the Defense Authorization Act are too important to be just blocked with no debate, no deliberation, and no votes. My friend talks about an open process. Open process, my foot. It is not an open process. Almost 200 amendments were not made in order. That is just not right. Mr. Speaker, if there is one thing that disturbs me in particular about this structured rule, it is how it fails the American people once again in not allowing substantial debate about the issues of war and peace. Mr. Speaker, nothing is more critical than the issues of war and peace. And once again, the Republicans on the Rules Committee have ensured that no amendment that deals with authorizing the current U.S. military engagements in Iraq, Syria, or Afghanistan was made in order. The only amendment made in order is the one offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) to repeal the 2001 AUMF for Afghanistan, an amendment that she has courageously offered for several years now. Mr. Speaker, one of the amendments not made in order was an amendment 
offered by me and several colleagues to prohibit the use of any U.S. funds after April 30, 2017, for the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces to Iraq or Syria in the fight against the Islamic State if an AUMF has not been enacted. This was a bipartisan amendment offered by Representatives JONES , G ARAMENDI , YOHO, LEEof California, C ICILLINE , and myself. And let me make one thing very clear, Mr. Speaker: this amendment is not an AUMF. There is not one single syllable in this amendment that reflects the language of an AUMF. The distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee was very clear during the committee markup of the NDAA that AUMF amendments were not the jurisdiction of his committee but, rather, the Foreign Affairs Committee. But this amendment is not an AUMF. And it is germane, by the way. My amendment only prohibits the obligation and expenditure of funds after April 30, which is the chairman’s chosen date for the cutoff of all OCO funding, and then only for the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces to Iraq and Syria to combat ISIS, unless an authorization for that purpose has been enacted. Quite simply, if you want the money to fight a war, then pass an AUMF. This amendment doesn’t care who writes it. It doesn’t care when it is debated or approved. It just requires that an AUMF be enacted by April 30. If not, no more funds for U.S. troops in the air, on the water, or on the ground until an AUMF is enacted. All this amendment asks is that Congress do its job. We ask our men and women in the military to do their jobs, and Heaven only knows, they carry out their duty with courage, honor, and professionalism. I only ask that Congress do the same. This should not be too much to ask. We have sent our uniformed men and women into harm’s way in Syria and Iraq for nearly 2 years now and still Congress refuses to do its duty and authorize their deployment. We have been bombing, we have got boots on the ground and engaged in combat, and we have had troops killed in action, yet this Congress can’t seem to debate and vote on an AUMF. I personally believe that endless wars, endless bombing, and an everexpanding U.S. military footprint in the Middle East is not a substitute for efforts aimed at reconciliation and political solutions. The status quo will not make the world more secure. I know some of my colleagues differ with me, and that is fine, but let’s have the debate. Let’s have clarity in what we are doing, and let’s make sure that what we are doing works. Dodging responsibility only means that these wars will remain on remote control, and that is sad. Last night in the Rules Committee, we heard lots and lots and lots of excuses. One of my favorite excuses that we heard last night was that 10 minutes would not be enough time to debate such a serious matter as what my amendment proposes. Well, Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee can assign as much time as it wants to debate an amendment. That is what we are there for. Two hours, 3 hours, 3 days, 3 weeks if it wishes. That is what the Rules Committee is supposed to do: provide serious time to debate serious issues. I heard that the Foreign Affairs Committee should be and would be drafting an AUMF. Fine. Terrific. If it comes out and is enacted before April 30, then it would fit right in with my amendment. But if this House continues to dawdle and whine and shirk its duties, then there should be no more money after April 30 for a war that hasn’t been authorized by Congress. I was told that the Republican leadership doesn’t like the AUMF that the President sent to Congress over a year ago. Well, neither do I. I think it is too broad. But, Mr. Speaker, if the majority or anyone here doesn’t like the President’s AUMF, then it is the duty of Congress to draft debate and vote upon its own version of an AUMF and send the bill back to the President for his signature or veto. That is how the system works, or at least that is how it would work if this House ever managed to do its job. I was told that the next President wouldn’t have enough time to figure out an AUMF for Iraq and Syria by April 30. But, Mr. Speaker, I didn’t choose April 30 as a date when all funds for the Overseas Contingency Operations account would be cut off. That date is built into the NDAA already. If April 30 is enough time for a new President and new Congress to ask for more money for these wars that are supplemental, then it should be plenty of time for Congress to take up and debate an AUMF. Now, of course, this Congress or the next one should and could take up an AUMF any day it so desires. I remember, in 2014, that Speaker Boehner told us that it would be better for the 114th Congress to debate and pass an AUMF for Iraq and Syria rather than the 113th Congress. Well, here we are 16
1⁄2months into the 114th Congress with no thought of taking up an AUMF on battling the Islamic State. I guess this Congress is just too damned chicken to do its job when it comes to war, and we are going to kick the can into the 115th Congress or maybe the 116th Congress. Enough with the excuses, enough. In fact, I remember, last year, Speaker RYAN said an AUMF for Iraq and Syria for the war against the Islamic State would be one of the first things this Congress would take up this year. Well, here we are in the middle of May and there is no AUMF in sight, just the same old tired excuses, the same cowardice, the same political posturing. There is no shortage of Members of Congress talking tough against ISIS. We hear it all the time on the House floor. But let’s be honest: that takes absolutely no courage at all. None of us are on the frontlines in Syria or Iraq. We are all safe and sound in the U.S. Capitol. But think for a minute. What must be going through the minds of our troops when they see a Congress that doesn’t even have the guts to debate these wars while they have been put in harm’s way? Every single Member of this House should be ashamed. Our collective silence—our collective indifference—is dismissive of our constitutional responsibility. This Chamber is guilty of moral cowardice. Mr. Speaker, there are nearly 200 reasons to oppose this rule, and that is how many of the amendments submitted to the Rules Committee were not made in order under either the first rule to the NDAA or today’s rule. Basically, 50 percent of all amendments submitted are not being allowed a chance to be heard. I urge my colleagues to reject this rule. I urge my colleagues to show some backbone and demand that the majority leadership of this House carry out its constitutional duty to debate and vote on an AUMF for Iraq and Syria. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My colleague from Massachusetts raises some very important points. It would be appropriate for our Foreign Affairs Committee to take up those points and consider them after we have had a lot of hearings, including an opportunity for a notice to the American people so the American people can be heard. Coming up with this sort of an idea that it is just going to come through the Rules Committee without any hearing, without any real expertise in the Rules Committee to consider it, and then putting it on the floor for limited debate is not the way to do it. Now, I must admit I have some reservations about establishing a hard stop of April 30 of next year. Saying that we are going to allow the next President to come forward with a new OCO proposal before April 30 of next year, which we did 8 years ago, is not the same thing. What my colleague is proposing is a hard stop. That is exactly what the President did in Iraq: a hard stop. We pulled out, and look what happened: absolute chaos, a nation that has gone from being a nation into being a nation in total dissolution. We came close to doing the same thing in Afghanistan. Thankfully, the President has pulled back from that. Because when we telegraph to our enemies, ‘‘Hey, we are out of here after a certain date,’’ they know when we are leaving, they know when we are stopping, and they know exactly how to time their activities against us. I don’t think we should give that opportunity to our enemies. Now, I completely agree with my colleague from Massachusetts that we 
need a new AUMF. I have said that on multiple occasions. I have signed letters to that effect. And I do believe that we have a situation in Syria that is not authorized, as it should be under the law. Why are we in this situation? Because we have yet to receive a strategy from the Obama administration on how to prosecute that war. We had the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. GABBARD ) before the committee last night. She has fought over there. She knows this better than just about anybody in this room. She laid out clear deficiencies in the administration’s socalled plan, which they sent over to the Armed Services Committee 45 days later, and only after we had to browbeat the Secretary of Defense to meeting its statutory responsibility. And she laid out clearly what we need to do in terms of a strategy. We have yet to get that from the Commander in Chief of our own Armed Forces. If we would get that, if we would get a clear strategy for victory, not a clear strategy for some pie in the sky, we are going to arm some Free Syrian Army that is not working, then I think we could have something to work on to bring to this floor. The problem is we are having to put ourselves in the place of the Commander in Chief, which is not what the Constitution calls for, nor will it work. We are going to continue to struggle with this because of the failure of this administration, not because of the failure of this House. I agree with the gentleman: I want to see a new AUMF. I want to see it go through hearings. I want to see it debated on this floor so I can vote for it or against it, and everybody can vote for it or against it. But the proposal he makes is not the right way to do that, so I hope that we continue to reject it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. With respect to the gentleman, I don’t think we agree with each other. The reason why we are doing this is because Congress has failed to act. The time for an AUMF is before you put troops in harm’s way. Some of us tried before we entered into this latest Syrian war to actually have a debate on an AUMF, and we were denied that opportunity. We are reengaged in Iraq. We asked before we did that, ‘‘Let’s have an AUMF,’’ and we were denied that opportunity. We have been denied and denied and denied and denied. All we are saying is that we ought to do our job. The President submitted an AUMF to Congress. He did his job. You don’t like it—I don’t like what he submitted either—but he did his job. He doesn’t control what we do here. We decide what to do. The Foreign Affairs Committee 2 years ago could have taken this issue up. They didn’t. They are not taking it up now. Here we are 2 years into these latest conflicts and nothing. It is shameful. Come on. We ought to come together, even if we disagree on what our strategy should be, and debate this. b1400 We have no trouble sending our young men and women into harm’s way; yet when it comes to doing our job, all of a sudden we have 1,000 excuses why we can’t do it. That is unacceptable. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. KILMER). Mr. KILMER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, the NDAA is about ensuring that we have the best trained and equipped fighting force in the world. It is about honoring our commitment to the men and women who serve and to their families. It is not about targeting proud Americans simply based on who they love; but this rule would effectively discriminate against LGBT men and women who serve our Nation as private contractors. This rule runs contrary to our values. It runs contrary to what we believe in. It runs contrary to the idea that we treat everyone with equal respect. It also runs contrary to what the majority said it wants—a transparent process, allowing the House to work its will. This rule blocks an amendment that was offered by my Republican colleague, CHARLIE DENT, to strip this discriminatory provision from even being considered. As we approach Memorial Day, our focus should be on providing our servicemembers with the proper tools so that they may carry out their missions, not on pushing forward provisions that target LGBT Americans. Let’s vote down this rule. Let’s strip this harmful policy from the NDAA so that we remain committed to equal rights, and let’s get back to debating how best to support our troops. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the gentleman’s comment. This is something that we had some significant discussion about last night in the Committee on Rules. Let’s make sure that the facts are straight. There is not one single thing in this bill that discriminates against anybody. In fact, in the provision he is talking about, there is not one single mention of LGBT. What is in that provision is a clear application by this law of protections of religious liberties that people have enjoyed in this country since the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act—one of the hallmarks of the legislative achievements of this body and an act, I believe, everybody in this body supports today. It says that the religious protections in that law that we are all so proud of should be enjoyed by people who have Federal contracts. Private parties that contract with the government should enjoy religious freedom. That is not discrimination. That is protecting the rights of the American people. Sometimes we get confused around here about that, and we are getting confused in the military bill about that, and that is very troublesome. Let’s talk about the First Amendment. The First Amendment says that the government can’t do anything to restrict the expression of religion, the practice of religion, the belief of religion by anybody in this country. It is called the Free Exercise Clause. We have forgotten the Free Exercise Clause in this body and in this country. We need to go back to it. About 20 years ago, this body passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It was so popular that it passed by a voice vote. It had just a handful of people who voted against it in the Senate. It specifically requires that we do exactly what is in this bill. We are being consistent with that law by putting this provision in there. What do we do with this particular provision? We say that the provisions of title VII in the 1964 act and the provisions that regard this in the Americans with Disabilities Act apply to private contractors with the Federal Government. That is not discrimination. By anybody’s definition, that is not discrimination. To try to turn it into that is doing something on a bill that is talking about the defense of this country, which is just not appropriate. It is absolutely appropriate that the Committee on Rules rejected that amendment. If the people on the other side of the aisle or on our side of the aisle want to have this debate, there are other forums and other times to do it. When we are talking about the defense of this country, it is not the right time. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In the dead of night in the Committee on Armed Services, House Republicans added what we believe is discriminatory language to the NDAA, which would effectively overturn President Obama’s historic executive order that protects LGBT workers in Federal contracts, therefore, enabling discrimination with taxpayer funds. That is what we believe. We had a very vigorous debate in the Committee on Rules last night, and the gentleman defended his position quite ferociously; but we believe it is discrimination, plain and simple. An amendment was offered by a Republican Member to strike that discriminatory language from the bill. It was germane, and the Committee on Rules decided on its own not to make it in order. The Committee on Rules shouldn’t be about making decisions on issues that, I think, the entire Congress has an interest in debating and in voting on, but, unilaterally, the Republicans in the Committee on Rules last night said: No, we are not going to make a 
Republican amendment in order that would have struck what we believe is discriminatory language. That is not an open and transparent process. That is shutting the process down in a way that, I think, demeans this House. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the distinguished Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. This is not consistent with what the Speaker and the other leaders of the Republican Party have said they were going to do. It is inconsistent with how they said they were going to manage this House. It is inconsistent with the rights of the American people to have their Representatives vote on issues of great importance, which, of course, is what the Speaker and Mr. MCCARTHY and Mr. Cantor said in this book, ‘‘Young Guns.’’ I am going to read a paragraph from this book. This is in PAULRYAN’s section, under his heading, the Speaker of the House: ‘‘The new Washington way,’’ in speaking about what was apparently the stuff he didn’t like, ‘‘isn’t open debate broadcast on C–SPAN; it is closed door, backroom deals. The Washington way doesn’t seek input from both sides of the issue; it muscles through bills on strict oneparty votes. And the Washington way,’’ speaking clearly of the way the majority of the Democrats were leading, ‘‘isn’t interested in honest upordown votes on transformational programs. It rigs the process,’’ it reads, ‘‘to produce the outcome it desires through any means necessary.’’ That is exactly what is happening in this rule—exactly. PAULRYANand the young guns promised transparency, openness, and the House’s being allowed to work its will. So what has happened in the Committee on Rules? Exactly the opposite. No transparency—a muzzling of the Members of the House of Representatives in not allowing a vote—but simply, unilaterally, in the dead of night, pocketing an amendment that was adopted in the committee that says that women would be treated just like men. Now, I know that is a revolutionary concept for some on your side of the aisle here, and I know you certainly didn’t want your Members to vote on that extraordinarily controversial issue. So in the dead of night, without any debate, without a vote in the Committee on Rules, it was simply put in the chairman’s pocket, and 434 of us were ripped out of the process. The young guns said that wouldn’t happen. Now, the young guns, by the way, so we all understand, are the Speaker and the majority leader now. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. HOYER. Ladies and gentlemen, we ought to reject this rule, and the American people ought to reject this rule. The American people ought to say: bring the issues to the floor and let the House work its will. That is why they elected us, not to have the chairman of the Committee on Rules say: Sorry, you don’t get to vote. He wasn’t elected dictator; STENY  HOYER wasn’t elected dictator; J IM MCGOVERN wasn’t elected dictator. We were elected to be one of 435 people to make policies for this country and for our people. Reject this rule. Bring democracy back to the House of Representatives. Let the people’s representatives set policy in the light of day. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Maryland. He wasn’t on the floor when I spoke earlier. Perhaps he didn’t hear that, between the Committee on Armed Services and on this floor, 429 amendments have been made in order—181 for this floor alone. That is an open process, and it is a far more open process than what this House saw when other people were in charge. This is the process that the American people have a right to expect, and they are getting exactly what they were told they were going to get. Mr. Speaker, the provision that he is referring to, a provision regarding including women in the draft, was, in fact, offered in the middle of the night without there being any hearings in the Committee on Armed Services, without there being any notice to the American people. There wasn’t an adequate hearing; there wasn’t an adequate opportunity for everybody to be heard. So the decision was made that the better way to do it, if we are going to consider it—and it probably is something we need to consider at some time—is to do it through a regular committee process, where we notice it to the American people, where we have hearings, and when people can be heard. Then we can have a full and honest debate with the American people having had a chance to weigh in. I disagree with the gentleman from Maryland. I think this is exactly the appropriate process. If we are going to take up something of that magnitude, we ought to do it right and not do it because of an amendment that was offered as sort of a lastminute thing in the middle of the night when we are considering this bill. I have great respect for the gentleman from Maryland. He was not there when it was offered. He was not there during the Committee on Rules’ consideration last night, so he is probably not fully aware of the number of amendments that we have both in the committee and on the floor today—429 amendments. This is an open process. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ). Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for protecting us from ourselves. That seems to be somewhat paternalistic, of course. As I understand it—and I was not there, but it wouldn’t have mattered whether I was in the Committee on Rules—it was not done in open session in the Committee on Rules. The Committee on Armed Services voted upon it, and apparently the majority of your side lost, and they don’t want us to consider it, and they don’t want to subject your Members to voting on it and letting the American people know where you stand. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are advised to address all remarks to the Chair and not to each other. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ). Mr. ELLISON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, while millions of Americans are struggling to get by and sustain their families, Republicans are trying to make it easier for employers to steal their wages. Right now we know that there are reports of at least $5 million in stolen wages and penalties from the U.S. contract companies. Last month, Representative JOHN KLINE, my colleague and friend, introduced an amendment to this bill to block the President’s Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order at the Department of Defense. This executive order that the President issued helps ensure companies with Federal contracts are following Federal labor laws, like protections against wage theft, workplace safety rules, and the right for workers to organize. It is the result of years of advocacy by workers, labor rights activists, members of the Progressive Caucus, and Members of Congress generally. This week I introduced an amendment to strike Mr. KLINE’s language. Let’s at least have a debate about it. Let’s at least debate whether or not workers should get protection from wage theft. I guess that was one of those amendments that didn’t quite make it through the process. It is no surprise that the Republican led Committee on Rules didn’t give us a vote on our amendment, because they don’t want to have to debate this in front of the American people. The American people might like to know that there are companies that are stealing workers’ wages but that the President is trying to protect those workers. Now the Republican majority is trying to stop the President from protecting those workers. b1415 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, now, the President’s executive order isn’t punitive. It actually helps companies to follow the rules. 
Debarment is the last resort, and it is the clear nuclear option for companies that refuse to correct their behavior, but Republicans don’t like it. Instead of helping companies that are fair to workers, they want to make it easier for companies that steal workers’ wages. Workers aren’t the only ones who should be outraged. This amendment actually gives a leg up to contractors who don’t play by the rules, putting companies who are doing right at a disadvantage. Please vote ‘‘no’’ on this rule for this and many other reasons. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I wasn’t able to respond to that last comment from the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ). I want to make sure that he knows—and everybody in the House knows—that during the consideration of the rule we passed yesterday, an amendment was offered in the Rules Committee to strip out this executing amendment. That was offered in the Rules Committee and rejected by the Rules Committee in an open vote. Our meetings are on C–SPAN. They are not behind closed doors. Everybody can watch what we do. Then yesterday we came on the floor, and that rule was offered on this floor and there was a full debate. I know; I was here for it. I managed that rule as well. After that full debate, this House voted, and voted by a clear majority to adopt the rule. So we went through a democratic process. We went through an open and clear process, both to consider that particular issue and consider the rule itself, and the House acted its will. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Give me a break. To insinuate that this is somehow all on the level or an open process, I take exception to that characterization. The amendment that the distinguished minority whip was referring to was put into the rule. It was a selfexecuting amendment so that the majority here did not have an opportunity here to vote up or down on it on its own merits. Instead, they were forced to vote up or down on a rule that made in order a whole bunch of amendments on a variety of issues where they could vote up or down on, but not on this. So to defend this process, a process that is indefensible, is getting a little tired. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ). Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule for a number of reasons: because it doesn’t make a proper AUMF in order, because it fails to make in order an amendment I cosponsored along with Representatives DENT, SMITH, and several others. The bill contains language adopted by the Committee on Armed Services at 1 in the morning the other day with no warning that would effectively overturn President Obama’s executive order protecting LGBT workers for companies with private contracts. In other words, private contractors using our Federal tax dollars in any area— not just in the defense area, by the way—would be allowed to fire someone just because they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender. This is unacceptable, it is cruel, and it is totally unnecessary. Now, the distinguished gentleman said that the language contains nothing referring to gay or lesbian people; it simply protects religious liberty. It says that private contractors, in the exercise of their religious liberty, may discriminate. It disallows the President’s executive order, and so the effect is that private contractors may discriminate on the basis of sexual identity or gender if that is their religious belief. No one has said it for years on this floor, but they used to, that it is okay to say: My religious belief says I shouldn’t hire a Black person or a Jewish person. We don’t think that is acceptable, and we don’t call that religious liberty. But we now call religious liberty the ability of a private contractor to fire someone or refuse to hire them just because they are gay or lesbian. That is cruel and unacceptable. Why not allow the House to vote on whether or not to include this type of hateful language in the defense bill? Why not allow a vote on the Dent Smith amendment? Must we let this bigotry and intolerance win the day? We ought to defeat this rule. I, for one, will not vote for the entire bill if this language is included in it. We must strip this toxic, hateful measure from the NDAA, if not through an amendment, then in conference. We ought to ensure that no Federal contractor has the ability to fire someone just because of who they are or who they love and because they profess that it is their religious belief. So they cannot be allowed to impose their religious beliefs on hiring and firing other people. We must continue to fight until all Americans have the rights they deserve. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. With regard to the amendment in question, it was considered late at night because of the fair and open process we have in the committee. And it took us that long—from 10 in the morning until that time of the night— to get to it. Everybody knew it was coming because it was noticed and everybody had a copy of it well in advance. So it wasn’t a surprise to anybody. Everybody knew it was coming. Now, the particular provision itself does not contain anything close to a word like discrimination. But just so we can make the record straight, I am going to read it: 
I was listening to my friend from Massachusetts talk about what he considers to be discriminatory. Well, I am going to go through the list again. Do we consider the First Amendment to the Constitution to be discriminatory? Do we consider the Religious Freedom Restoration Act that passed this House by a voice vote to be discriminatory? Do we consider title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to be discriminatory? Do we consider the Americans with Disabilities Act to be discriminatory? Because that and only those things are what are contained in this provision. So we can call things discriminatory, but when you look at the actual text of it and understand what they actually are, they are protecting basic rights. And that is what we should be all about. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the gentleman reciting the Republican talking points of the Republican leadership, but that doesn’t explain why the amendment to strike this provision was not made in order. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ). Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and the underlying bill. Our armed service chiefs and secretaries have requested two results from Congress in defense: stability and predictability in the budget. Instead of adhering to their requests, this bill actually creates a contentious budget environment next April that causes even more harm to our military. The bill is full of contradiction. It authorizes funds for over 50,000 more troops, but no money to send them anywhere after April. It authorizes muchneeded equipment, but not any money to employ it on the battlefield. It authorizes 9,800 troops in Afghanistan, just not any money to keep them there during the actual fighting season. It sends a message to our allies that we are only 60 percent committed to our missions with them, and it sends the message to our adversaries that we are only 60 percent committed to stopping them. It is like we are a basketball team who bought new uniforms, recruited highly skilled players, built a new facility, and didn’t even have any money left to play the second half of the season. No team wins under those circumstances. It doesn’t matter how many stateoftheart weapons you have or how welltrained your troops are, you can’t win if you don’t show up. Much like General Breedlove, who believes ‘‘virtual presence means actual absence,’’ I believe this is a virtual plan and will be an actual disaster. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule and ‘‘no’’ on the underlying bill. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. With great respect to the gentlewoman, she, I am sure, was not here yesterday and was not listening when I said this: that provision she is referring to, which gives the next President the opportunity to make changes in the overseas contingency operation account, is exactly what this House did in 2008, the last time we were about to change administrations. ThenSenator Obama voted for it. ThenSenator Kerry voted for it. ThenSenator BIDEN voted for it. This is not new. This is standard when you are changing administrations. Nothing more. Nothing less. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman how many more speakers he has on his side? Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I believe I am the only speaker from my side. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote against this rule. Almost 200 germane amendments, substantive amendments were not made in order. Again, I am used to, as a Democrat, having the Republicans shut me out every chance they get; but to my Republican colleagues who were shut out on their legitimate amendments, the germane amendments, stand with us and send a signal to your leadership that this closed process is unacceptable. My colleague, Mr. BYRNE , talks about this being an open process. We must have different definitions of openness because when almost 200 amendments are shut out—and, by the way, on top of all of that, there were really kind of unusual shenanigans in the Rules Committee about selfexecuting amendments so that we don’t have an opportunity to even vote up or down on them—that is not an open process. That is something we should try to move away from. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am going to close as I began by saying to my colleagues to please vote against this rule because it does not make in order the opportunity for us to be able to debate the issues of war and peace when it comes to Iraq and Syria. We have been involved in Syria and again in Iraq now for almost 2 years. By the way, we left Iraq not because President Obama wanted us to, but because the Iraqi Parliament voted us to leave. That is a little bit of history that my colleague left out. The time to debate an AUMF, an Authorization for Use of Military Force, was before we commit our forces into harm’s way. Many of us, Democrats and Republicans, pleaded with the leadership to let us have that opportunity, for us to work in a bipartisan way to see whether we could come together. And time and time and time again, we were denied that ability, that right. Now, we are being told: Well, you know, this is not the time. We don’t have enough time to do it. Maybe the Committee on Foreign Affairs should do it, but this is not the place to do it. When is? You have waited for over 2 years. Nothing. I will say that these excuses, they are insulting to the American people, but more importantly and more significantly, they are insulting to the men and women who are in harm’s way. They do their job. They do what we have asked them to do, but yet we don’t have the guts to do what we are supposed to do. Shame on all of us for allowing this to go on this long without debating these wars. The President of the United States submitted an AUMF. I have problems with it. I think it is too broad. If you don’t like it, fine. Then come up with a new idea, but doing nothing is not an option. Read the Constitution. We have an obligation. We are not living up to it. Do what is right by the American people, by the men and women who risk their lives every day because we have put them into harm’s way. b1430 It is absolutely unconscionable that we can’t even have the ability to debate the amendment that I offered to be able to say that we are not going to continue funding these wars unless Congress does its job. That is the least we can do, and yet the Committee on Rules said no. It is germane, it is in order, there is no problem, but because some majority in the Committee on Rules says, ‘‘No, we are not going to do it,’’ everybody is denied that right? It is a bipartisan amendment. This is not just a Democratic concern. There are a lot of Republicans who share my views on this as well. Let’s do our job. Stop being so chicken when it comes to debating issues of war and peace. This is the time when we ought to come together and do the right thing. Vote ‘‘no’’ on this closed rule. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I hold in my hand all 1,271 pages of the underlying bill, and it is filled with the things that we need to do to defend the American people. As interesting as the debate we have just had has been, think of how much of it had nothing to do with defending the American people, which is what we are supposed to be here about, which is the single most important thing that we do. My colleague talked about guts. The guts I care about are the guts of the fighting men and women of the United States. We have a solemn obligation to them to pass this bill, to make sure that we are doing everything to supply them, to train them, to make sure that they are ready, to make sure we have reformed the Pentagon so that the Pentagon is doing its job by them, so that we have a policy that will make sure that we are defending the American people. That is what this law is all about. 
The rule itself makes in order, between yesterday and today, 181 amendments. That is on top of over 200 amendments that were considered as part of this bill. This has been a completely open and transparent process and will continue to be as we consider it over the next several hours. Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 735 and the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The previous question was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15 minute vote on adoption of the resolution will be followed by 5minute votes on ordering the previous question on House Resolution 736 and adoption of House Resolution 736, if ordered.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 4909. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 735 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 4909. Will the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) kindly resume the chair. b1521 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 4909) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, with Mr. COLLINS of Georgia (Acting Chair) in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The Acting CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, amendment No. 14 printed in part B of House Report 114–569 pursuant to House Resolution 732 offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) had been disposed of. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, no further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in order except those printed in House Report 114–571 and amendments en bloc described in section 3 of House Resolution 735. Each further amendment printed in the report shall be considered only in the order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. It shall be in order at any time for the chair of the Committee on Armed Services or his designee to offer amendments en bloc consisting of amendments printed in the report not earlier disposed of. Amendments en bloc shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services or their designees, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . BUCK  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 114–571. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle B of title III, add the following new section: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about this amendment to the 2017 NDAA. Since taking office in 2009, President Obama’s administration has forced its green energy agenda on the American people despite the devastating costs. For our military, this means a mandate to purchase renewable energy and to incorporate climate change into almost every aspect of training, regardless of cost or efficiency. As you might imagine, these mandates result in some absurd wastes of money. Every cent spent by the Department of Defense on the incorporation of the administration’s climate change agenda is a cent lost for the defense of the American people. The U.S. military should be focused on defending American citizens, not serving as a playground for the green energy movement. Moreover, spending the American people’s tax dollars on crony capitalism is despicable. Renewable energy should be free to compete in the energy marketplace. American families shouldn’t be asked to subsidize costly, inefficient, and uncompetitive green energy with their hardearned tax dollars. My amendment ends this wasteful and dangerous practice; it prohibits renewable energy mandates placed on the Department of Defense; and ensures that every unit of energy our military purchases is the most costeffective option available. I ask for support on this amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK .) Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, I stand today opposed to this amendment, as the representative of Fort Drum, an Army post that is 100 percent energy independent and selfsustainable, relying solely on biomass energy. Unfortunately, this amendment would impede military facilities, like Drum, from continuing to pursue energy solutions that enhance national security, training capabilities, and operational flexibility. Fort Drum and the north country serve as models for operating government facilities more efficiently, where ReEnergy, our alternative partner, positively affects the Army and has created 300plus jobs throughout our community. Providing our military with resilient energy ensures our servicemembers remain able to respond to any threats at any time. DOD’s use of alternative energy strengthens their ability to conduct combative operations, humanitarian response, and protects our national security. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment which would have a detrimental effect on alternative energy technologies that make our troops safer, increases combat effectiveness, and severely undercuts programs like those at Fort Drum. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. PETERS ), a member of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I am also opposed to this amendment. The DOD’s employment of alternative energy is not about hugging trees; it is about improving our mission capabilities and saving lives. The military’s investments in alternative energy technologies not only make our troops safer and increase combat effectiveness, but they also reap government energy savings. Renewable energy systems reduce our reliance on foreign oil and have saved lives by cutting down on refueling trips in the battlefields. Around 3,000 American soldiers were killed or wounded in Afghanistan while protecting fuel convoys. The military is already adopting cuttingedge renewable energy technologies, like transportable solar panels and backpacks used by marines to generate electricity. Last August, I was at Naval Base Coronado when the Navy signed the largest renewable energy purchase by the Federal Government in history. The project will provide 210 megawatts of energy at an estimated savings of $90 million over the length of the contract. Since 2009, the department estimates that they have saved over $1 billion through renewable energy projects on installations. As we consider how to allocate the limited resources we have to support our servicemembers and keep Americans safe, it is counterproductive at best to prohibit the military from using funds on costsaving alternative sources of energy and redirecting it toward mission priorities. A 21st century military with the capability to counter new and dynamic threats cannot be powered by the energy of yesterday. Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman’s support of this amendment and not opposition to this amendment. This amendment simply says that the military must determine the most costeffective method. It does not ban renewables at all. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. GIBSON .) Mr. GIBSON. I thank the ranking member and appreciate his leadership. Mr. Chair, I am sure that the gentleman from Colorado has the best intentions. And, with respect, I ask him to withdraw the amendment because it is very problematic, as it is currently worded, prohibiting the reduction of energy consumption. I mean, this is important not only in terms of savings itself but, quite candidly, for saving lives. After four combat tours in Iraq, we found any way possible to reduce the amount of convoys to go forward into our most forward positions and outposts because we knew every time that we were on the road, we could be at risk; we could lose lives. I appreciate the effort to save money. And I think that if the gentleman withdraws the amendment and works with the committee, I am sure that we can find a way to move forward on that score. But, as Ms. STEFANIK mentioned, her post at Fort Drum really is reliant on—or is certainly benefiting from this biomass endeavor that is right there at Fort Drum. So I want to thank Mr. SMITH for yielding me the time, and I certainly respect to the gentleman who offered the amendment. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ). Mr. WALZ. Mr. Chairman, I join my colleagues, national security experts, military leaders, and America’s energy producers, and rise in strong opposition to this amendment. The Department of Defense’s use of alternative energy as accelerated in recent years and strengthened the military’s ability to conduct combat operations, humanitarian response, and homeland defense. b1530 In short, it has improved the readiness of the Armed Forces to protect freedom overseas. DOD is the largest consumer of energy in the world, 117 million barrels of oil. Every 25 cent increase in a gallon of gas costs $1 billion to the American taxpayers and $1 billion less to the troops. DOD’s fuel costs from 2005 to 2011 were so volatile, the costs went from to $4.5 billion to $17.3 billion, even though we reduced our usage by 4 percent. An example of this is the U.S. Pacific Fleet in 2012 faced a $200 million budget 
gap that had to be filled by taking money from elsewhere because of rising fuel costs. This willingness to not look at all American homegrown energy and security is simply wrongheaded. And the idea that it costs more to do this—it costs $83 billion more to protect shipping oil coming from overseas. I ask my colleagues to resist this amendment. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of the time. I agree with my colleagues, three of whom have served in the military and understand the need for this. This is an investment. This is an investment in alternatives. If we are tied to oil, tied to fossil fuels, and have no alternative—right now they are cheap, but then they go up in costs. And they are also far more difficult to get into the field, as Mr. GIBSON pointed out. This is an investment to give us the alternatives that we need. Nothing is more important to the success of a military—past the people who serve—than the ability to get the fuel they need, whatever form it comes in. This is an investment in developing muchneeded alternatives. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, the fact that this amendment requires the military to choose the most costeffective energy source allows the military to spend its money on those priorities, rather than on energy. I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado will be postponed. The Committee will rise informally. The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. LAMALFA ) assumed the chair.

AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . FLEMING  
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. C OLLINS of Georgia). It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 114–571. Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of subtitle B of title III, add the following new section: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. FLEMING ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana. Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, my amendment prevents scarce dollars from being wasted to fund two of President Obama’s executive orders regarding climate change and green energy. These are dollars that should go to the readiness of our Armed Forces. A similar amendment has already been adopted by voice vote for the past 2 years during House floor consideration of the Defense appropriations bills. My amendment is supported by 28 outside organizations, including the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Americans for Prosperity, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, and many others. These executive orders require the Department of Defense to squander— squander—precious defense dollars by incorporating climate change bureaucracies into its acquisition and military operations and to waste money on green energy projects. EPA bureaucrats and other political appointees are directing our military commanders on how to run their installations and procure green weapons, which undermines ongoing acquisition reforms in the NDAA. These activities are simply not the mission of the U.S. military. Regarding DOD’s energy policy, decisions by installation commanders and DOD personnel need to be driven by requirements for actual costeffectiveness, readiness, not arbitrary and inflexible green energy quotas and CO2 benchmarks. My amendment does not prevent the DOD from considering renewable energy projects where it makes sense. But these decisions should not be driven by these mandates. Take, for example, the Naval Station Norfolk, where the solar array cost the Navy $21 million but only provided 2 percent of the base’s electricity. According to the Inspector General’s Office, it will take 447 years for the savings to pay the cost of the project. However, solar panels usually only last about 25 years. These mandates are diverting limited military resources to Solyndrastyle boondoggles while sacrificing our military’s readiness, modernization, and end strength. In a time of declining defense budgets, we need to ensure that every dollar spent goes directly to support the lethality of our Armed Forces. Again, my amendment is similar to repeated efforts by the House to prevent national security dollars from being wasted to advance the President’s onerous green energy and climate change requirements. So I ask that the House continue that opposition to this nondefense agenda by supporting my amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. PETERS ). Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment. In January of this year, the Pentagon issued a directive saying: ‘‘The Department of Defense must be able to adapt current and future operations to address the impacts of climate change in order to maintain an effective and efficient U.S. military.’’ This followed a DOD report to Congress released last July that said: ‘‘Climate change is an urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources such as food and water . . . and the scope, scale, and intensity of these impacts are projected to increase.’’ From 2006 to 2010, Syria experienced overwhelming refugee flows that DOD characterized as a climaterelated security risk creating negative effects on human security and requiring DOD involvement and resources. In 2014, the Pentagon reported that the impacts of climate change may increase the frequency, scale, and complexity of future missions, while at the same time undermining the capacity of our domestic installation to support training activities. The readiness of our military depends on being able to train and equip the most advanced force in the world, but the threat of rising sea levels from escalating temperatures and melting icecaps could put dozens of military installations at risk. San Diego is home to the largest concentration of military forces in the world. With seven military installations in my district alone, rising sea levels, drought, and finding reliable energy sources all pose challenges. San Diego military installations are investing in energy security and increasing 
water and energy efficiency. We should not undermine those efforts. This amendment is an attempt by top politicians to prevent the Department of Defense, which is tasked with maintaining a strong military, keeping all Americans safe, and protecting our global interests from addressing what they call an urgent and growing threat to our own national security. But national defense is not about politics or ideology. It is about security, readiness, and continuing to field the most dynamic and effective military in the world. We cannot have that if we ignore science and the concerns of the brightest military minds in the United States of America. I oppose this reckless amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana has 2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Washington has 2
3⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I would respond, first of all, by saying I think we all see the reports. If you are on Armed Services, you hear our generals talk about how our readiness is in dire straits, that we can’t respond to the challenges around the world. At a time like this, why would we want to pay 5 or 10 times the nominal amount for fuel? It makes no sense. To my colleague who wants to argue climate change: fine, we can argue that. But this is not the place to debate that. You see, my amendment allows for the Department of Defense to do whatever is best for our Armed Forces. Whether you agree with climate change or not, it doesn’t matter. All we say is let’s free up the DOD, our Armed Forces, and our generals to do the right thing. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ). Mr. SARBANES. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, the Obama administration issued two critical executive orders directing Federal agencies to take responsibility for anticipating and responding to the effects of climate change. This amendment that is being proposed would block the Department of Defense from undertaking that effort. The amendment is illadvised. It doesn’t protect and prepare the American people for the impacts of climate change, and it won’t help our military operate in a new security environment created by climate change. Climate change poses a significant security threat to the United States and the world at large. But don’t take it from me. Our Nation’s military leaders are saying we need to prepare for this new threat. The proponents of this amendment should listen to the military experts, not the special interest polluters that benefit from climate denial and the status quo. As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I have been frustrated that the Republican majority has refused to hold serious hearings on the urgent problem of climate change, so Democrats on that committee went to Annapolis in my State to hold a climate change field forum. We heard testimony from Vice Admiral Ted Carter, the Superintendent of the Naval Academy. He told us that our future military leaders are learning about the science of climate change and the national security consequences that stem from it. He testified that because the Naval Academy sits on the waters of the Chesapeake Bay, they have several projects in motion to address sea level rise and the increased regularity of flooding. They are retrofitting older buildings and building new facilities that double as seawalls to protect the campus. Vice Admiral Carter also told harrowing stories of sailing aircraft carriers in between two massive hurricanes and equipment that short circuited in waters with surface temperatures in excess of 100 degrees. Certainly my colleagues on the Republican side would not deny that these are consequential problems. Leaders like Admiral Carter cannot afford the luxury of ideological climate denial. He is taking the right steps to address climate change. We should support him and our other military leaders. Unfortunately, this amendment would do the opposite. For that reason, I urge its defeat. Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, again, my amendment is not a debate about climate change, regardless of where you fall on that issue. All this does is free up DOD to make the vital important decisions on that, instead of handcuffing it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, actually, it precisely does handcuff them by telling them how to make their decisions, saying they can’t make a decision based on their belief that needs for alternatives to fossil fuels are important. If we don’t wish to handcuff them, don’t offer an amendment telling them that they have to spend their money in a certain way. That is exactly what this amendment does. Again, there are multiple reasons for making these investments in alternative energy. I will return to one that was raised by Mr. GIBSON . Out in the field, you need multiple different sources of energy. If you can get a situation where you have properly developed solar power or thermal power and you can use that on the spot where you are at, instead of relying on trucks to bring in diesel or gasoline, you are saving lives. This is an investment in making our military more prepared. What this amendment does is it restricts the ability of the Department of Defense to make that investment. If you don’t want to restrict them, don’t restrict them. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana has 1 minute remaining. Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to the ranking member, all my amendment does is holds the status quo before these two executive orders; and that is, the commanders in the field and the generals at the Pentagon can do whatever is best for the military, whether or not it has to do with saving money or spending more money on alternative forms of energy. My amendment frees them up. It does not restrict them in any way. I urge adoption of this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. FLEMING ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana will be postponed. b1545 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . PEARCE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 114–571. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, in January of 1993, the BRAC Commission closed 
Fort Wingate in New Mexico. Fort Wingate was destined and designated to go to two tribes, equitably divided between the two—the Navajo Nation and the Zunis. During the past 12 years, I have been involved in negotiations back and forth between the tribes. The lands were occupied ancestrally by both tribes. There have been many long, ongoing discussions between all of the parties. We have gotten signatures in the past from different members of the Navajo government. We currently have a letter dated May 16, 2016, in which it states that it is the opinion of the Navajo Nation that the land division and the terms developed between the two tribes would provide a solution to the land division. All we are asking is that the agreed upon maps be distributed in accordance with the terms, signed by the speaker of the Navajo Nation and the Zunis. That is the purpose of this amendment today. It is a fairly simple distribution according to the provisions that are listed in the BRAC ruling of January 1993. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM ). Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment in its current form and at this particular time. This amendment, as it has been pointed out, directly impacts two federally recognized tribal nations: the Navajo Nation and the Zuni Pueblo Nation in New Mexico. They have been working with the Department of Defense to resolve the disposition of this excess Federal land. The Navajo is one of the tribes that would receive the land in transfer, and it is opposed to some of the language that is still occurring in this amendment. The Pearce amendment, unfortunately, claims a provision that would require a rightofway in perpetuity to the Navajo, and the Navajo agrees, it is my understanding, to work toward some of the land transfer. I ask the gentleman: Are they aware that the Navajo doesn’t agree in having this land transfer go in perpetuity and that it would like to work something else out? I yield to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ). Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, that is a provision that I, personally, did not put into the bill. It came from the committee of jurisdiction, the Natural Resources Committee. They insisted on it because it is prevailing language under the law. The objection in the letter from the Navajo, which I was just showing the gentlewoman previously, describes that, and the language reads that they have so far failed to acquire a new rightofway with the U.S. Army and now have come to Congress to address their error. What has happened is that the right ofway has yielded, and the language here was language that has previously been set up by the committee in order to address this. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Chair, there is some disagreement as to how this language should be structured. I don’t think we should be pushing through something that the Navajo Nation now finds controversial but that wasn’t controversial when working with the Department of Defense and making sure that they had the rightofway and access to the land. It is a sovereign nation. There are only 10 minutes of debate. There seems to be a little bit of uncertainty as to where the Navajo Nation is coming down on the particular language that the gentleman has. I do not fault the gentleman for bringing the language forward, as Chairman BISHOP has changed from what the original conversation had been between the sovereign nation and the Department of Defense by putting the perpetuity in it. I believe we should respect the right of sovereignty of the tribe, and I believe at this time we should defeat the amendment. I would like to work with the gentleman to come up with language that is acceptable both for the Department of Defense and the two tribal nations. They were so very close. I would like to make that happen. Mr. PEARCE. Again, addressing the gentlewoman, those are the subjects that Mr. LUJA´Nand I have agreed that we would work on in conference. I think that we are more than willing to accommodate, but to stall this out now—this is the last vehicle this year. Literally, we are out of time. I would gladly accept the gentlewoman’s help in the conference committee, and I want to resolve this. Again, I have been working on it for 12 years. We go and we get the signatures. It has been very arduous on the parts of all, and I understand the difficulty when you have aboriginal lands. Again, when I look at the language, it is language that was previously established in the HoChunk Nation distribution. The language literally is set in precedent, and the committee explains to us there is not much option there; but I am more than willing to work on the issue with the gentlewoman. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. PEARCE. I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I look forward to working with the gentleman. I am sure we can come up with an accomodation that will make everyone satisfied. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, reclaiming my time, what we are trying to do is put into the hands of two Indian nations land that has been designated for them since 1993. I think that all parties just want it to be done in the right fashion. We are so close at this point that I would really appreciate the fact that we put it in this bill, that we include it, and move it into the conference. I am certain that with the Senator’s input, they will be listening to the same concerns as the gentlewoman is listening to. Again, I appreciate the help of Mr. YOUNG , Mr. L UJA´N—all of those parties—and both Chairman THORNBERRY  and Chairman BISHOP . I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, in closing, again, I just appreciate the consideration by the gentlewoman. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ). The amendment was agreed to.

AMENDMENT NO . 30 OFFERED BY MR . POLIQUIN  
FARENTHOLD OF TEXAS  At the end of title III, add the following new section: 
Consistent with section 2492a of title 10, United States Code, the Secretary of Defense is encouraged to enter into contracts with thirdparty vendors in order to provide members of the Armed Forces who are deployed overseas at any United States military facility, at which wireless highspeed Internet and network connections are otherwise available, with access to such Internet and network connections without charge. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ). Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment, which is included in here, that encourages the Department of Defense to provide free WiFi access of the Internet to military personnel who are deployed overseas. Right now our military personnel, in some instances, are required to pay twice as much as a typical American family would pay for access to the Internet. Access to the Internet is a way for our troops to keep their morale high by staying in touch with their families back home by using technology like FaceTime and Skype. This amendment does not require any expenditure by the military. It merely instructs the military to work towards this goal: to make it available where possible and to indicate that it should be a priority. It doesn’t cost anything, but it is a great morale booster, and it should be great for our troops. I urge my colleagues to support this. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 3 minutes. I speak about the broader bill. Unfortunately, something happened in the Rules Committee yesterday that has been happening far too often in recent years. This was much debated during the debate over the rule, but I didn’t have a chance to come and talk about it. There was an amendment added in committee that overturns an executive 
order by the President. The executive order basically says: if you discriminate against the LGBT community, you will not be allowed to get government contracts. That executive order also had an exception for religious organizations. The amendment that was added in committee—and it is much debated as to what it did or didn’t do, but my reading of it is that it dramatically expands that exception and basically increases the ability of defense firms and subcontractors to discriminate against the LGBT community. The larger problem here is: Why couldn’t we vote on it? It puts our Members in the position of voting for a defense bill that has what we believe to be discriminatory language in it without our even having had the opportunity to have voted to remove that language. This is something that has happened for the last 3 or 4 years on an increasing basis. It used to be that this was an open rule. With the defense bill, you basically offered an amendment; you had a debate; and you had a chance. Then we started to shrink them down a little bit. Now, in the last couple of years, anything that is inconvenient for the majority to vote on or, even more distressingly, anything that they think will make it inconvenient for us to vote on the bill gets struck. That is not the way the Rules Committee is supposed to work. They are supposed to give us the opportunity to vote on these amendments. They, again, have narrowly crafted it down to just the amendments that they like. Having this discriminatory provision within the defense bill, in addition to all of the other problems, has forced me to the point at which I am actually going to oppose the bill, which I do not want to do and did not want to do; but I hope, in the future, the Rules Committee will at least give us a chance to vote. We had a robust debate about the substance of this particular amendment earlier. Again, it is not so much about the substance of the particular amendment. It is about the opportunity for our Members to have a vote. If we could go on record and vote against that amendment on the floor— do our best to strip it out—then at least we are on record. Here, we are simply forced to vote for a defense bill that contains discriminatory language that we do not support. I hope, in the future, the Rules Committee will stop doing this, will let the democratic process work, will give us the opportunity to vote, accept the outcome of that vote, and move forward. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 30 seconds. My understanding is that the provision that the gentleman refers to is a restatement of religious liberties from the 1964 Civil Rights Act. What that tells me, if he opposes the bill based on that, is that there are Members who are looking for some excuse to vote against this bill. You can always find one. I can find one myself. I don’t think that is the right thing to do, however, for the men and women who serve our Nation. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ). Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chair, each month across our great country, our brave men and women in the National Guard and the Armed Forces Reserves leave their homes and report for duty. Each month they train on the ground and in the air and on the sea so that they are ready at a moment’s notice to fight for our freedom. Our guardsmen and reservists often travel long distances to their training sites, and their travel costs often exceed their monthly training pay, which forces them to buy gas, meals, and sometimes hotel rooms out of pocket. Right now, today, under existing law, if you work for the IRS or the EPA or some other Federal Government agency, you are granted a tax deduction for outofpocket travel expenses if you travel beyond 50 miles of your home; but if you are a guardsman or a woman or if you are in the Reserves, you need to travel more than 100 miles to receive the same benefits. Mr. Chair, this is not fair, and this is not right. I urge everybody to endorse and support my amendment No. 300. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ) will control the time of the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH). There was no objection. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ). Mr. KILDEE. I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. Chair, for many years, the Air Force used perfluorinated chemicals in its compound for firefighting foam, but in the past few years, very high levels of these PFCs have been discovered in the fish near the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Oscoda, Michigan, which is in my district. Tests have revealed the presence of PFCs as well in the groundwater that people who live near the former Air Force base depend upon. The CDC and the EPA have both said that PFCs can be potentially harmful to people’s health, though there is still not clear guidance as to what is a safe level of exposure, especially in the long term; although, there is great concern on this question. I have asked the Air Force as well as the State of Michigan to provide bottled water to those identified individuals who are living near Wurtsmith whose water may be contaminated by PFCs at least until more research is done on the safety of their water. My amendment would require the Department of Defense to do whatever it can to prevent further exposure to PFCs. b1600 Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the amendment to renew the 1year ban on the Obama administration or any other administration from using any Department of Defense funds to implement the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, a treaty which, by the way, has never been ratified by our Senate. Specifically, the amendment bans the use of Department of Defense funds for the ATT Secretariat, a body that was created for effectively implementing the ATT according to the treaty’s supporters. Last August, ATT member nations organized the Conference of States Parties to the ATT, a conference in which we did not have a vote and which decided that American taxpayers are now on the hook to pay 22 percent of the expenses of this annual meeting. This taxpayer money would go directly to the ATT Secretariat and become part of its core budget. My amendment prevents these hardworking American taxpayer dollars from flowing into the coffers of those who are working to implement the ATT. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for including this in the en bloc amendment, and I urge all my colleagues to stand in support of our Second Amendment and of our Nation’s sovereignty and vote in support of this amendment to renew the annual ban on the funding of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ). Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Chair, my amendment would exempt reimbursement for medical expenses from the Department of Veterans Affairs calculation of annual income when determining pension eligibility for veterans. This amendment is a version of H.R. 4994, the Veterans Pensions Protection Act, bipartisan legislation endorsed by the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and others. A few years ago, a disabled veteran and a constituent of mine was struck by a vehicle while crossing the street. After receiving insurance compensation for his injuries, he lost his pension. This is because, under current law, compensation for medical expenses, including insurance settlement payments or reimbursements, are considered income by the VA. We effectively punish our veterans when they receive these types of compensation after suffering medical emergencies like the one I just outlined. This is, quite simply, wrong. My amendment will rectify this. I ask the House to support this amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ) to discuss an additional amendment he has. 
Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of an amendment that directs our service academies to notify the Members of Congress of acceptees at least 48 hours before publishing the acceptance or letting the acceptee know. As most Members of this body know, we are actually the interviewing source for the service academies. Young men and women seeking to serve this country attending a service academy apply for a nomination from their Member of Congress, most often go through a very lengthy vetting process, and we develop a relationship with these young men and women. Historically, the service academies have allowed us to call them and tell them they are accepted and congratulate them. This year, in some instances, the service academies have quit doing that, which was a longstanding practice. I believe that it is appropriate that those who interview and work so hard to get those young men and women into our service academies should be the ones delivering the news to them rather than them reading it on a Web site or in a piece of mail. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment when it comes before the House. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. HIMES). Mr. HIMES. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank both the chairman of the committee and the ranking member for the opportunity to offer this amendment, which would be a very straightforward amendment, which simply requires the Department of Defense to report to the Congress on the policies, doctrine, procedures, and authorities, as well as the definitions associated with a cyber attack on the United States. This is a small step in a larger very, very important effort that Chairman WESTMORELAND and I have been working on for some period of time now to try to bring some clarity to what is, today, kind of the Wild West in the cyber realm. In the kinetic realm, we understand very clearly what an act of war is. We understand our doctrine for responding as such. In the cyber realm, we don’t know exactly when a crime becomes an act of war, how to deal with an asymmetric actor versus a nationstate. It is terribly important that we begin the process, with other nations around the world, of establishing some clarity on these points. That won’t help our adversaries, but it will remove uncertainty from the system in this new and very, very important realm. Again, I thank the leadership of the House Armed Services Committee and hope this amendment will be supported. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time on this en bloc amendment. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS). Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the committee for including, en bloc, my amendment No. 59, which is a step to look at commonsense, costsaving proposals that the United States Navy itself has offered earlier this year that could save as much as $900 million by consolidating carrier Air Force wings from 10 to 9. In the fiscal year 2017 budget request, the Navy asked Congress to reallocate their 10th carrier wing into their 9 existing wings, which they feel would boost readiness and save money. I understand there is reluctance to make what I believe is a strategic, costeffective move, and that is why I offer my amendment today, directing the Secretary of Defense to offer Congress a study on this issue. As Vice Admiral Michael Shoemaker said: ‘‘Restructuring to nine carrier air wings is the most efficient use of those operational forces to meet global requirements.’’ The study will serve as an important step in realizing a more efficient, capable, costeffective Navy. I am very encouraged that the committee was willing to include this en bloc today, and I see this as an important first step toward recognizing increased readiness as well as cost savings. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy in permitting me to speak on the en bloc amendment, and I appreciate the committee having accepted the amendment dealing with cost accountability for the B–21 bomber. This is a new weapon that has both conventional and nuclear weapons capability. We are in a situation now where there is tremendous stress on our Defense Department budget with a whole range of weaponry. I think it is more important now than ever that we are able to understand exactly what we are getting into, how much this is going to cost. There is about $1.4 billion already into this. We ought to be able to know what the total commitment is being made, to be able to have appropriate decisions made by Congress. I am deeply concerned that the Defense Department, to this point, has resisted giving an appraisal of what the total cost is going to be, somehow fearing that, if the total budget were available, that would give too much information to our adversaries about the weight, size, and range of the plane. I think not. I think the real danger here is that the American public and Congress would know what the costs are. This is not an acceptable approach as we deal with these critical questions. It is important, Mr. Chairman, that we have full transparency about what the costs are going to be for these massive, expensive, and, in some cases, questionable weapons systems. This is not an argument for or against it. It is an argument for transparency and being able to know what we are getting into. The worst of all possible worlds is making commitments and then finding, 5 and 10 years down the line, that we can’t follow through on them or they result in cannibalizing other important priorities. I would think that this is one area that we could all agree we need to have this transparency and have this information available. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, this seems to me to be a priority going forward, given the experience we have had with cost overruns and given how many elements that this committee is trying to juggle. The demands on the committee, I think, are remarkable. It is not a job that I envy. These are hard decisions that are being made. The Department of Defense can do a favor for themselves and for us by being fully transparent so we know what we should be budgeting for in the future and that they can be held accountable for performance. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I want to speak about one of the amendments that is in this en bloc package offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. MULVANEY ). My understanding of that amendment is that it tries to have a clearer process by which we fund the military, and that is a goal for which I have enormous sympathy. We clearly need to have more predictable funding for the military. That is true on behalf of our military commanders and all the troops. It is true on behalf of industry. It is true on behalf of budgeting in the government. I personally also agree we need to do away with the artificial caps that have caused such difficulty for the military in recent years. I also believe that it would be beneficial if administrations did not play political budgetary games. For example, in this year’s budget, the President requests a very low number for Israeli missile defense, knowing full well that the Congress, on a bipartisan basis, is not going to let that go through. We are going to be more responsible. So they are counting on us to have to cut other programs so that we can do what they should have done to begin with. There are all sorts of tactics that are used in developing budgets. There has got to be a better way. Apparently, some administration political appointees have been urging Members of the House to call the approach in this bill a gimmick. Actually, I have heard that term used a few times on the floor over the last couple of days. 
Well, one question I have is: Was it a gimmick in 2008 when, under Democratic majority, this House used exactly the same approach in fully funding the base requirements for the year and then had a bridge fund that allowed the new President to evaluate deployments and the funding and to make adjustments, which President Obama took advantage of? That is what it was intended for. Now, why was it okay then, but it is a gimmick now? It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, someone would consider that a double standard. Would Members rather that we continue to cannibalize aircraft and deny pilots the minimum amount of training they are supposed to get? Are Members content to have class A mishaps continue to go up in service after service, or is the desire to score political points so strong that Members would rather let those trends continue rather than deal with them here in this bill before us? Mr. Chairman, my point is that I agree there has got to be a better way. But I also believe that we have a choice before us today, and that is whether we fund the training, the maintenance, the end strength, the modernization that starts to fix the problems that I have talked about or we stick with namecalling, we look for excuses to vote ‘‘no’’ and allow those problems to get worse. Lives are at stake. So while I don’t know that I agree with all the particulars of the gentleman from South Carolina’s amendment, I think he raises important issues. Therefore, I urge Members to support that amendment as part of this en bloc package and resolve to try to put partisanship and excuses aside and think about the men and women who serve and what is in their best interest. I urge adoption of the en bloc amendments. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. b1615

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in House Report 114–571. Ms. LEE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle E of title XII, add the following: 
CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE , May 11, 2016. MEMORANDUM  Subject: Presidential References to the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force in Publicly Available Executive Actions and Reports to Congress. From: Matthew Weed, Specialist in Foreign Policy Legislation. This memorandum was prepared to enable distribution to more than one congressional office. This memorandum sets out information and analysis concerning presidential references in official notifications and records to the Authorization for Use of Military Force (2001 AUMF; Public Law 107–40; 50 U.S.C. §1541 note), enacted in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, to justify and undertake military and other action. It contains very brief discussions of the relevant provisions of the 2001 AUMF, and the uses of U.S. armed forces connected with 2001 AUMF authority, as well as excerpted language and other information from the notifications. 
UTILIZATION OF 2001 AUMF AUTHORIZATION  Prior to the U.S. military campaign against the Islamic State that began in summer 2014, executive branch officials made statements that included certain interpretations concerning the 2001 AUMF, including the following interpretations: The 2001 AUMF is primarily an authorization to enter into and prosecute an armed conflict against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. The 2001 AUMF authorizes the President to use military force against Al Qaeda and the Taliban outside Afghanistan, but such uses of force must meet a higher standard of threat to the United States and must use limited, precise methods against specific individual targets rather than general military action against enemy forces. Because the 2001 AUMF authorizes U.S. involvement in an international armed conflict, the international law of armed conflict informs the authority within the 2001 AUMF. This law permits the use of military force against forces associated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban as cobelligerents; such forces must be operating in some sort of coordination and cooperation with Al Qaeda and/or the Taliban, not just share similar goals, objectives, or ideologies. According to the Obama Administration, this interpretation of the scope of 2001 AUMF authority fits within the overall framework of presidential power to use military force against those posing a threat to U.S. national security and U.S. interests. In situations where the 2001 AUMF or other relevant legislation does not seem to authorize a given use of military force or related activity, the executive branch will determine whether the President’s Article II powers as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive, as interpreted by the executive branch itself, might authorize such actions. In this way, similar U.S. military action to meet U.S. counterterrorism objectives might be interpreted to fall under different authorities, of which the 2001 AUMF is just one, albeit important, example. 
RECORDS OF EXECUTIVE ACTIONS AND PRESI DENTIAL REPORTING TO CONGRESS REF ERENCING THE 2001 AUMF  CRS has located 37 relevant occurrences of an official record, disclosed publicly, of presidential reference to the 2001 AUMF in connection with initiating or continuing wilitary or related action (including nonlethal military activities such as detentions and military trials). Of the 37 occurrences, 18 were made during the Bush Administration, and 19 have been made during the Obama Administration. The notifications reference both statutory and constitutional authority for the President to take such action, as well as statutory provisions requiring congressional notification, including reference to provisions in the 2001 AUMF. As will be discussed in detail below, the manner in which Presidents have presented information on military deployments and actions in these notifications, the constitutional and statutory authority for such actions, and the reporting requirements for such actions, have changed over time. 
FORCES AND /OR USING MILITARY FORCE IN VOLVING REFERENCE TO THE 2001 AUMF  Both President Bush and President Obama have provided formal notifications of military deployments and/or action to Congress at various times since enactment of the 2001 AUMF, referring to that authorization to various degrees and ends. While presidential reports to Congress concerning the use of military force and other activities undertaken by the U.S. armed forces initially provided a fairly simple and straightforward discussion of actions and related authorities, over time these reports became increasingly detailed, complicated, and difficult to decipher with regard to determining applicable presidential authority. At all times, both Presidents have relied primarily on their constitutional Article II powers as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. In many instances, reference to 2001 AUMF authority has been supplementary and indirect; in only a few cases has a President relied directly on 2001 AUMF authority as justification for a military operation, deployment, or other action. This is not to say that 2001 AUMF authority does not serve as a sole or primary legal basis for military action in any given situation reported in a notification, only that the notification language is susceptible to more than one interpretation when it concerns presidential authority to use to military force or undertake other military action. Below are provided several tables of information concerning presidential notifications and records of other executive action referencing the 2001 AUMF. Each table provides: a date of each notification or record; the relevant military activity, location, and/or purpose of such activities, as available; the constitutional and statutory authority provided in the notification or record as provided; and the reference to applicable reporting requirements precipitating each respective notification or record. For Tables 1–8, each set out in its own section with accompanying analysis, each table includes a group of notifications that are similar in composition and content. Each subsequent table and section, therefore, denotes a change in composition of the notifications referencing the 2001 AUMF in some way. Initial Reporting in the Aftermath of the September 11, 2001 Attacks President Bush’s reports to Congress concerning military deployments in the weeks following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks were relatively concise, focusing on the need to address the terrorist threat in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, and the deployments and actions taken in response to such threat. The first notification on September 24, 2001 references deployments to ‘‘a number of foreign nations’’ in the ‘‘Central and Pacific Command areas of operations.’’ Major military operations in Afghanistan had not yet commenced. The second notification on October 9, 2001 includes similar information but also notifies Congress of the commencement of combat against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. In these two notifications, President Bush stated that he had taken the actions described pursuant to his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. In both notifications, he referred to the 2001 AUMF as evidencing the continuing support of Congress, but did not specifically state he had taken such action pursuant to 2001 AUMF authority. The President stated in these notifications that he was reporting on these actions to Congress consistent with both the War Powers Resolution and the 2001 AUMF. It is possible to conclude that reporting action consistent with the 2001 AUMF would mean that the action was considered taken pursuant to 2001 AUMF authority. 
Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I want to encourage all my colleagues to read this report. It shows that this authorization has, in fact, become that blank check for war. In the more than 14 years since its passage, it has been used 37 times in 14 countries to wage war with little or no congressional oversight. It has been used 18 times by President Bush and 19 times by President Obama. This report only looks at unclassified incidents. How many other times has it been used without the knowledge of Congress or the American people? Not only has this authorization been used to justify military action thousands of miles away, it has also been used much closer to home to allow warrantless surveillance and wiretaps, indefinite detention practices at GTMO, and targeted killing by drones, including of American citizens. It has also been cited as the authority for the nearly 2 yearlong war against ISIL, a war that Congress has never debated, voted on, or specifically authorized. Mr. Chairman, our brave servicemen and women continue to be deployed around the world. Whether they are combat troops or not, they are in combat zones. They are risking their lives. Don’t we at least owe them our representation in terms of our job to debate and vote on the cost and consequences of the war? I think we owe them that. If we all agree that ISIL must be degraded and dismantled, then why is Congress missing in action? Every day more bombs fall. We have already lost three brave servicemen. We have already spent more than $9.6 billion, and we spend an additional $615,000 per hour. I know that while we may not share a common position on what the shape of any new AUMF to address ISIL might look like, I know that many of us do agree that the overly broad and almost 15yearold AUMF represents a major and very concerning deterioration of congressional oversight. That means a lack of involvement and input and voice of the American people. Let’s repeal this blank check and finally, 90 days later, debate and vote on an AUMF to address the ISIL threat. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment which would unilaterally end the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda. Mr. Chair, ISIS grew out of al Qaeda in Iraq. The President has determined that the 2001 AUMF allows the United States to target ISIS. Both the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs agree that they have full legal authority to combat ISIS, and Congress has supported that view by appropriating funds. Many Members want to enact a new AUMF to renew the authority to fight ISIS and support our troops, but this amendment fails to do so. We must understand that a new AUMF cannot give President Obama any more authority to fight ISIS than he currently claims. It could give him less. The President asked for less in his proposal. It is clear many want an AUMF that limits the authority of this President and the next President. The administration still does not have the broad, overarching strategy needed to defeat these radical Islamist terrorists. Once the President provides that strategy, this House can have an informed debate over a new AUMF, but this amendment would leave us with no strategy and no authority. That is irresponsible. Ms. LEE. Mr. Chair, let me just make one comment before yielding to my colleague from Minnesota. First, the President has sent over an AUMF. He sent this over 15 months ago. The Speaker yet has to take this Authorization for Use of Military Force up. The President has asked for it. Why don’t we do our job? We could at least either bring the one that he sent over, or we need to put our own on the floor. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON). The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California has 1
1⁄4minutes remaining. Ms. LEE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the gentlewoman’s amendment. I want to just say that the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) is absolutely wrong when he says there would be a unilateral ending to the struggle against Daesh, or ISIL. The only way that would happen is if we do not take up a new AUMF that would authorize us to take on that battle. What we need to do is take on our constitutional responsibility. We cannot abdicate it with this outofdate AUMF that is only tenuously connected to many of the conflicts we see arising today. We have a responsibility under the Constitution, Article I, section 8, to debate and vote, up or down, use of force. We should do that. We should do it now. There is nothing to prevent us from passing a new one or crafting our own or passing the President’s unless we abdicate that responsibility. This allows us to criticize anything the President does and yet, at the same time, never take responsibility for 
passing our own AUMF adapted for the moment that we are in. That is not right. I support the gentlewoman’s amendment. Ms. LEE. Mr. Chair, I will just close by saying my amendment is enacted 90 days after the signing of this law. That means we have 90 days to debate and vote upon an ISILspecific Authorization for Use of Military Force. We need to do our job. We have a constitutional responsibility to do our job. Unfortunately, Congress is missing in action. We need to do exactly what the American people sent us to do. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, no one can contest the gentlewoman from California’s sincerity on this issue. On September 14, 2001, when this House passed the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that she is talking about, 3 days after 3,000 Americans had been murdered on 9/11, the vote in this House was 420–1, and the one person who voted against this AUMF was the gentlewoman from California who offered this amendment. So her sincerity cannot be questioned. I also, by the way, happen to agree with her that we need to update this AUMF. As a matter of fact, this House passed, twice, provisions that I had authored to update the 2001 AUMF. We passed it in 2011; we passed it in 2012. Unfortunately, the administration says: No, we are opposed to that; the one we have got is just fine. And the Senate took that position, and so it did not get passed into law. But to say, now, to unilaterally repeal the 2001 AUMF on which the administration is relying for all its counterterrorism activities not only against al Qaeda, but against ISIS and others, to repeal it now, I believe, would be a mistake. There are still real dangers in the world from terrorists. I don’t think I need to remind Members of Paris, of Brussels, of San Bernardino, and just today, of Baghdad. The other point I want to make, Mr. Chairman, is I think we all underestimate the catastrophes that have been avoided—in other words, the terrorist plots, what they wanted to do, what they tried to do—that were thwarted. Sometimes they were thwarted just because we were lucky, but a lot of times they were thwarted because of the work of the men and women in the military, the men and women in the intelligence community, the men and women in law enforcement doing a lot of hard work, sacrificing, some of them losing their lives to make sure that we did not have a repeat of the 3,000 people murdered on 9/11. We owe them, Mr. Chairman, more than just a thankyou. We owe them whatever preparation, whatever equipment, whatever support they need to continue to battle terrorists today. That is what this bill tries to do: to make sure that we don’t send people out in the Middle East to bomb terrorists on airplanes that cannot fly, that cannot be maintained, that we don’t wear our pilots and our mechanics out. That is readiness. That is what we are talking about in this bill. That is what we have an obligation in this House to do for them who do so much for us. I oppose the gentlewoman’s amendment. As I say, I have tremendous respect for her views and the sincerity with which she holds them. I think it results in a more dangerous world. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. LEE. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . POLIS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in House Report 114–571. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following new section: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, this is a very simple amendment. When we look at our country’s national security, it is important to make sure that we don’t mortgage our national security because fiscal security is an important part of protecting our country. My amendment would give authority to the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense to reduce the overall amount of money authorized by this bill by 1 percent. It simply cuts defense spending by 1 percent. As you know, we spend as much as the rest of the world, combined, on defense. We want to have a strong defense, but of course, as you know, this current authorization exceeds the levels of the Budget Control Act, even with this 1 percent reduction, which is really a compromise. It only reduces it by $5.5 billion and, in fact, continues to authorize at a level of $10 billion more than the bipartisan Budget Control Act. In a bill in which we overfunded multiple accounts and weapons systems above the request level of the military, I think 1 percent is a very reasonable request. It is about $5.5 billion. It is certainly possible to find these cuts. In fact, they are very likely to occur because, again, if we conform to the Budget Control Act, there would actually be a larger cut than even this humble one that we are offering before you today. As an example, the bill authorizes $9.5 billion in nuclear weapons activities alone. We could pass my amendment. Even if we allocated the entire cuts to nuclear weapons, we would still be spending $4 billion on nuclear weapons. I think the estimate is we would then have enough to destroy the entire world and wipe out life as we know it three times instead of six times. How much is enough? There are plenty of other programs that we could look at. Of course, it should not be Congress making those decisions in a political manner; it should be the military and the executive. I imagine they would start with accounts that Congress has chosen to overfund. At some point, we have to stand up for fiscal security and realize that mortgaging our future and our children’s future to Saudi Arabia and China does not enhance our national security; it detracts from it. My amendment is a small first step toward taking a stand against a military budget that we simply cannot afford. We need to reduce our budget deficit. This is a very small and simple way to start. We can make these strategic cuts and, of course, still fully protect our national security and even enhance it. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment and take this modest step toward fiscal responsibility as a compromise between the Budget Control Act levels and the committee authorization levels. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. b1630 Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. This amendment cuts defense below the President’s request, below last year’s funding, and below what the last Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said was the lower, ragged edge of what it takes to defend this country. Let’s just put in a little bit of context here. This bill, counting OCO and everything, is a whopping onehalf of 1 percent over what we spent last year. Onehalf of 1 percent. Inflation is supposed to be 2.1 percent. So what it really means is this bill, even in real dollars, is a cut, even as it is. This bill is 23 percent less than we were spending on defense in real terms in 2010. Mr. Chairman, the world is not 23 percent safer now than it was 6 years ago. And yet the gentleman from Colorado’s amendment would cut that even further. This bill stays within the amount requested by the President. It meets the need for base requirements and provides a bridge fund for deployments, just like Democratic majorities did for the last change of administration. And I think that is the most reasonable response. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the great State of California (Ms. LEE), a cosponsor of this amendment. Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I want to first thank Congressman POLIS for yielding time and for his work to ensure that our Nation’s fiscal security is secure through this amendment. It is an honor to cosponsor this amendment with him. I want to thank the ranking member also for guiding us through this very difficult bill to make sure that we all know what is included in the bill. I just have to say, our amendment, I think, would take a modest step in making this bill a lot better to help us rein in the overthetop, quite frankly, Pentagon spending, while protecting the pay or health benefit accounts of our brave servicemen and women and their families. Over the last 15 years, Pentagon spending has ballooned by 50 percent in real terms. Pentagon spending now consumes more than half of the Federal discretionary budget. That is just outrageous. Recently, The New York Times made this case in their editorial called ‘‘A Better, Not Fatter, Defense Budget,’’ which I include for the RECORD . 
[From the New York Times, May 9, 2016] A BETTER , NOTFATTER , DEFENSE BUDGET  (By the Editorial Board) To hear some military commanders and members of Congress talk, the American military is worn out and in desperate need of more money. After more than a decade in Iraq and Afghanistan, they say, troops are lagging in training and new weaponry, which is jeopardizing their ability to defeat the Islamic State and deal with potential conflicts with Russia and China. While increased funding for some programs may be needed, total military spending, at nearly $600 billion annually, is not too low. The trouble is, the investment has often yielded poor results, with the Pentagon, Congress and the White House all making bad judgments, playing budget games and falling under the sway of defense industry lobbyists. Current military spending is 50 percent higher in real terms than it was before 9/11, yet the number of active duty and reserve troops is 6 percent smaller. For nearly a decade after 9/11, the Pentagon had a virtual blank check; the base defense budget rose, in adjusted dollars, from $378 billion in 1998 to $600 billion in 2010. As the military fought Al Qaeda and the Taliban, billions of dollars were squandered on unnecessary items, including new weapons that ran late and over budget like the troubled F–35 jet fighter. The waste and the budget games continue with the House Armed Services Committee approving a $583 billion total defense authorization bill for 2017 last month that skirts the acrosstheboard caps imposed by Congress in 2011 on discretionary federal spending. The caps are supposed to restrain domestic and military spending equally, but defense hawks have insisted on throwing more money at the Pentagon. That doesn’t encourage efficiency or wise choices. The panel took $18 billion from a $59 billion offbudget account, which has become a slush fund renewed annually to finance the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and other trouble spots, and is not subject to the budget caps, and repurposed that money for use in the $524 billion base military budget. The move will underwrite the purchase of more ships, jet fighters, helicopters and other bigticket weapons that the Pentagon didn’t request and will keep the Army from falling below 480,000 activeduty troops. It also means the war account will run out of money next April. Representative Mac Thornberry, the Republican chairman of the committee, apparently assumes the next president will be forced to ask for, and Congress will be forced to approve, more money for the war account. This sleight of hand runs the risk that troops overseas, at some point, could be deprived of some resources, at least temporarily. The full House should reject this maneuver. Many defense experts, liberals and centrists as well as hawks, agree that more investment is needed in maintenance, training and modernizing aging weapons and equipment. These needs were identified years ago, yet the Pentagon and Congress have chosen to invest in excessively costly hightech weaponry while deferring maintenance and other operational expenses. The Pentagon can do with far fewer than the 1,700 F–35s it plans on buying. It should pare back on President Obama’s $1 trillion plan to replace nearly every missile, submarine, aircraft and warhead in the nuclear arsenal. Defense officials recently reported that 22 percent of all military bases will not be needed by 2019. Civilian positions will have to be reduced, while reforms in health care and the military procurement system need to be carried out. All of these changes make good sense, given the savings they would bring. But they are politically unpalatable; base closings, for instance, have been stubbornly resisted in recent years by lawmakers fearful of angering voters by eliminating jobs in communities that are economically dependent on those bases. Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that sustaining the current military force of roughly two million and paying for all the new weapons systems will cost billions more than Congress has allowed under the budget caps. To maintain sensible troop levels, Congress and the administration need to begin honestly addressing the hard fiscal choices that they have largely been loath to make. Ms. LEE. The article lists program after program, many of which our generals did not ask for, that have cost taxpayers billions without making us any safer. Clearly, we also need to audit the Pentagon. That is why I am pleased the House adopted the BurgessLee amendment yesterday to require a report on auditability and help keep moving toward auditing the Pentagon. While we were working on that, we should take every opportunity to address Pentagon spending. The article in The New York Times sets forth: ‘‘The waste and the budget games continue with the House Armed Services Committee approving a $583 billion total defense authorization.’’ Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN ), the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I want to reiterate the importance of making sure that we are funding defense at the President’s request. The FY 2017 request, I think, is minimally adequate, but it is not just me. The administration’s own Secretary of the Army Murphy stated that this budget request is minimally adequate and that we are taking a high risk as an Army and as a Nation when the Army is funded at this level. So there is still risk there with this level of funding. As the chairman pointed out, we live in a more dangerous world today, but we see our Marine Corps and Air Force having to go to aircraft that are museum exhibits to cannibalize parts to bring them in to have a minimally operational cadre of aircraft. We see this, too, when we talk about only 9 of the 20 B–1 bombers are available today because they are lacking parts and when we have 30 percent or less of our Marine Corps helicopters available because they are lacking parts. We see that, in a squadron of 14 jets, only 3 in the Marine Corps are available because they are lacking parts. It is irresponsible not to provide to the brave men and women that serve this Nation the things that they need. We are asking them to go into harm’s way. We are asking them to do tremendously difficult jobs. We are asking them to maintain safety. Yet we are not providing them the resources necessary. This amendment would do even more to take away what is already a challenging situation for those brave men and women that are doing a tremendous job and that, as their leaders have said, are being stressed to the breaking point because they do not have the basic resources to keep those aircraft flying, to keep those ships on the 
water, to keep those systems necessary to be able to perform the job that we have asked them to do. We have an obligation as a Nation that, when we ask those brave men and women to go into harm’s way, to support them. It is unconscionable when we don’t do that, when we have situations like 84 percent of our Marine Corps aircraft are in a nonready status, based on a 10year average. So when we talk about taking dollars away, what signal does that send to the brave men and women serving in the military? I think this amendment cuts to the heart of what we must do as a Nation, and that is to rebuild readiness, not degrade readiness. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, there are a number of programs which Congress has forced spending on the military that even the military has not requested. As an example, we blocked the Navy from making a sound fiscal decision saving $900 million to shutter a carrier air wing. There are a dozen more Black Hawk and Apache helicopters than requested by the military to meet our national defense needs. There are two extra V–22 Ospreys that were not requested, 500 extra Javelin missiles above the request, 500 more extra Hydra guided rockets, and 75 extra Sidewinder missiles. These are just some of the examples of some the lowhanging fruit that we can use to restore military funding to a more fiscally responsible manner. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from Colorado raising the issue that he just raised because it gives me the opportunity to affirm that many of the programs he was just mentioning like the Black Hawks, for example, have been requested by many of the Members on his side of the aisle. And they were included in the unfunded requirements list from the Army. So the way it works is we get all sorts of requests from Members on both sides of the aisle. Each of the services gives us a list of what they would like to have had in the budget request but the administration took out, and then where the two match up as Member priorities and service priorities, that is what these funds are. It is not that they weren’t asked for from the military. It is the military wanted them but OMB took them out. And when you have many Members, particularly on the Black Hawks, the V–22s, the LCS, and a number of the items he just mentioned on his side of the aisle, asking for them as well as the service, then that becomes part of the modernization priority. Let me just make one other point. In the Black Hawk case specifically, these new Black Hawks will replace helicopters that were built in 1979, for which we cannot get parts, which have very restricted flight envelopes because of all the restrictions. They can’t be repaired. They can’t do everything the Army wants them to do. So the administration did not ask for any. Many Members on the Democratic side asked for some. We put them in here. And that is the way to fix readiness: by replacing a 1979 helicopter with a 2016 helicopter. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed.

defense inventory. I would hope that, in the future, when maybe we have a new administration willing to turn a page, when we have a Congress that is willing to entertain a broad and robust debate about this critical issue, that we can deal with an effort to rein in this trilliondollar spending folly that is going to have disastrous effects for our military readiness in the years ahead. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman, the reason these weapons have not been used since 1945 is that we have had a credible nuclear deterrent. The fastest way to have a more dangerous, destabilized world is for the credibility of that deterrent to erode, and I worry about that. Secondly, if you look at what is planned with upgrading the weapons and the delivery systems, at no point does it become more than 11 percent of the U.S. defense budget. That is a pretty good investment to make sure that they are not used, and I suggest that it is well worth the investment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ). Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, the amendment I offer today, in cooperation with the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. JONES ) requires a report simply from the Secretary of Defense, detailing the quantity, composition, and lost income of survivors currently affected by the Dependency and Indemnity Compensation offset to the Survivor Benefit Program. It continues this body’s crucial, bipartisan effort to find a feasible solution for the disgraceful way we shortchange and penalize our military widows and widowers. This mandatory offset hurts those who have already given more to freedom than most of us ever will, the life of a spouse. It hurts women like the Army Sergeant First Class who recently contacted me. She is an Afghan veteran herself, mother of three. Tragically, she also is a Gold Star Wife due to the death of her husband in Iraq in 2004. As a young widow of a servicemember who died as a result of his service, she is not eligible to receive the full amount of her benefits, making the burden of living without her spouse that much more difficult at a time of enormous adjustment for their family. What’s more, if she were a Federal civil service survivor, she could receive both benefits. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. KAPTUR. If she were a civil service survivor, she could receive both benefits; and if she were over the age of 37, she could receive both benefits. Her husband gave his life for liberty. She is a veteran, too. We must honor their sacrifice as we honor the sacrifice of any other American who dies in service to our Nation, and find a way to fix this awkward offset. This report will help us better define the situation so we can find just solutions. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Montana (Mr. ZINKE), a member of the committee. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my colleague from Florida’s amendment to create a Judge Advocate General career litigation track in the Army and the U.S. Air Force. The legislation provides the Army and Air Force JAG officers with trial and prosecutorial experience that is absolutely critical. Currently, Army and Air Force JAGs lack experience, as multiple reports have said. As a matter of fact, a shocking 89 percent of military prosecutors only have 10 or fewer contested cases. This inexperience is a disservice to those who seek justice under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Anyone who has suffered a transgression and sexual assault or other crime while serving in the military, quite frankly, deserves the best. The Navy has implemented this litigation path and is already reaping great results. It is time for the Air Force and the Army to follow suit. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to make clear that my opposition to the bill at this point is not just based on the exclusion of the amendment that would have lifted the discrimination against the LGBT community. That was sort of the last straw. I was on the fence about this bill from the very beginning because, understand that this bill continues the pattern of the last few years, of putting our defense on a fiscal path to nowhere, a fiscal path towards a cliff of not having the money to fund what needs to be funded because the Budget Control Act remains in place. Now, the chairman repeatedly says that in 2008, we did this when a new administration was coming in. We only funded half of the overseas contingency operation fund, knowing the supplemental was coming. There was no Budget Control Act in 2008. The Budget Control Act is in place. Even if we get a supplemental in April—and in this Congress, getting additional money is no guarantee—the Budget Control Act remains in place, and this Congress has shown a complete unwillingness to get rid of it. So what we are doing by funding all of these programs that some of my colleagues have started, we are funding a defense that we cannot sustain. I think the best example of this is the military wanted to cut the size of the Marine Corps and the Army. Now, the levels that they wanted to cut them to were levels that no one in the defense community wanted to cut them to, but that was the amount of money that they have available under the Budget Control Act. As soon as we repeal the Budget Control Act, we will have a lot easier conversation about how to fund defense; but what we are doing to national security right now is we are creating a bow wave that they will not be able to absorb. When the Budget Control Act kicks in again next year, all of a sudden the Army and the Marine Corps will have to, like that, cut—my numbers may be off a little bit here—30,000 in the Army, 10,000 in the Marine Corps. You can’t really do that in any sort of reasonable way. It will be incredibly disruptive to the military, incredibly disruptive to readiness. Now, I will agree with the chairman that a passionate case can be made for spending more on defense. Heck, if we spent a trillion dollars on defense, a passionate case could be made for spending even more than that when you look at the threat environment. But we have the money we have. He also cited that, in 2010 numbers, we are now 23 percent below where we are at, and that is true. But we are 23 percent below where we are at because of the 2011 Budget Control Act which, again, this House refuses to repeal. So instead of dealing with the amount of money that Congress has forced the Department of Defense to deal with, we fantasize that more money will appear, and in that fantasy, we put the military in an impossible situation. We start all of these programs. There is not the money to finish those programs. And maybe someone can tell me where this money is going to come from, how it is going to magically appear, when we are $19 trillion in debt— I forget off the top of my head what the deficit is this year, but it is somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 or $600 billion—deficits for as far as the eye can see; the Freedom Caucus on the Republican side refusing to spend any more money. This money is not going to appear. And so what we are going to have is we are going to have a military that has to cut drastically and irresponsibly in the blink of an eye because we refused to let them do it responsibly. I would urge Members to read Secretary Carter’s testimony before the Senate earlier this week or last week where he outlined what a devastating impact this defense bill will have on our national security when the bills that it is charging actually come due. Now, that is the primary reason to oppose this bill; contemplating swallowing that and hoping that, like last year, we could fix that in conference. But in addition to that, to have discriminatory provisions in it brings me 
back to 2009, when the Republicans opposed the defense bill because it had an antihate crime piece of legislation attached to it. There are reasons to oppose the defense bill other than you just don’t really like people who serve in the military, and that is a condescending and irresponsible argument to make against those who would oppose the bill. If we continue down this funding path, we are not serving the military. All of these readiness disasters that we keep hearing about have, in part, happened because of the way this committee and the Appropriations Committee has funded defense for the last 3 or 4 years, by taking from readiness to fund a wide variety of programs, including the beginning of the $1 trillion Mr. BLUMENAUER talked about for our nuclear deterrent. We are not making choices. We refuse to get rid of the A–10. We refuse to lay off 11 cruisers. We refuse to allow the military to shrink its size and, instead, we keep putting it on a credit card and hoping that the money will appear. Well, when that money doesn’t appear—and it is not going to. I haven’t seen money just sort of burst out of nowhere in my lifetime. Maybe we will be lucky and maybe it will be the first time—but it puts the Department of Defense in a tenuous position. We need to start making choices based on the money that we actually have. This bill doesn’t do that. Six months from now, our troops serving in Afghanistan and Iraq will have no money, and we hope that problem fixes itself. That is a national security reason for opposing this bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 7 minutes remaining. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I think I made clear a few moments ago that I believe we need to have a better way to fund defense, a more predictable way. But, Mr. Chairman, I am not willing to wait to support the military until that is done. I am not willing to wait until we have tax reform and entitlement reform and all sorts of other things before I am willing to stand up and support the military. There are lives at stake today, and we have enormous challenges in the future, there is no question, budgetary and otherwise. But I think it would be a mistake if I were to say we have all these challenges coming down the road, therefore, I am not going to fix this problem that is affecting pilots, mechanics, others today. We can do something about it today. As a matter of fact, the gentleman talks about the Budget Control Act. We have made some alterations to the Budget Control Act for each of the last 4 years because of this problem. I think most people, at least on both sides of the aisle, realize that when you cut defense 23 percent since 2010, and the world is not 23 percent safer, we are not asking our military folks for 23 percent fewer deployments, that something has got to give. So there has been—it has been painful, it has been messy, it has not been ideal, but there has been some alterations to the Budget Control Act. I said a while ago that I am for doing away with these artificial caps. The Budget Control Act did not work as anyone, I think, intended. There was never the mandatory spending reform that was the goal. And what bore the brunt of the cuts? Defense. Fifteen percent of the budget has absorbed 50 percent of the cuts under the Budget Control Act. That is wrong. Now, I think if Members on both sides of the aisle committed to working together to fix that, we could. Now, that would involve not having a President use the military as a hostage to try to force more domestic spending, which is what this President has done. That would mean that we focus on trying to fix defense, and understand that all of us have other priorities that we need to also work on at the same time. But we are always going to have different budget laws and different circumstances. I still do not understand how a Democratic majority, in 2008, could use this approach, to give the new President the benefit of the doubt, the benefit of a fresh look; and when we try to do the same for the next President, who none of us know who it is going to be, but when we try to use the same approach, all of a sudden then you just can’t do it. It is irresponsible, it is a gimmick, and all sorts of names. The gentleman mentioned that we are not making choices and mentioned specifically the A–10. Mr. Chairman, there are a lot more things that I would like to have done in this bill, lots of additional programs I would like to have authorized. We had to make difficult choices. But just to take the A–10 for an example, the administration has proposed eliminating the A–10 for the past several years. This Congress reached a different judgment on that. That is what the Constitution, by the way, says we are supposed to do. It is our job to raise and support, build and maintain the Armed Forces of the United States. On the A–10 program, we reached a different conclusion. We decided that, until you have something to take its place, we shouldn’t get rid of it. And you know what? The Secretary of Defense has testified that it has been devastating in its use against ISIS today. If we had eliminated it, it wouldn’t be there. So sometimes our judgment—and we have a long list of instances where Congress, under majorities of both parties, have exercised a different judgment from the administration and where we were proved right. So we make tough choices. Sometimes our choices actually turn out to look pretty good in hindsight. But the bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is we could all wait to support a defense bill until some faroff condition were met. It is easy to vote ‘‘no’’ unless something happens or unless some condition is met; but for this, if only that. That is easy. But that does not fix the immediate problems that face the men and women who volunteer to defend our country, the problems that they are facing today. That is what we are trying to do with this bill. We don’t actually fix them. We just start to turn it around. I don’t think there is an excuse that justifies opposing doing what is right for them, and that is the reason I believe that this bill should be supported. I hope Members will support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. b1700 
AMENDMENT NO . 7 OFFERED BY MR . ELLISON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in House Report 114–571. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, my amendment strikes language telling the President to expand our mission in Afghanistan, language that tells the President to put more of our troops in harm’s way, to go backwards towards a combat mission in Afghanistan. Now, Republicans may not say it, but the effect is exactly what they are pushing for—moving the United States military and the United States back toward a combat mission in Afghanistan, not forward away from one. Worse yet, they are pushing for an expanded mission before the new commander on the ground, General John Nicholson, finishes his review. That is right. Congress is giving instructions to the President before the current commander has weighed in. This is a mistake. 
So the opening line of the sense of Congress tells the President to leave 9,800 troops in Afghanistan next year. The current plan calls for 5,500. This sets the tone for what is next. Unfortunately, the amendment that strikes this language was not ruled in order. My amendment starts by striking the next provision. The Republicans want our military to unilaterally strike the Taliban. Now, of course, these people are absolutely bad news, but the State Department does not recognize them as a terrorist organization at this time. This is a decision that should be based on military considerations. Thus, our counterterrorism mission is allowed to strike and go after Daesh and al Qaeda, but the mission regarding the Taliban is defensive in nature; and if that is going to be changed, it should be based on military considerations, not just through a piece of legislation. In fact, the Afghans are leading all missions against the Taliban, and this has been happening well before we transitioned to a noncombat mission. So let’s not call for going back to combat mission tactics, especially when the commander has not asked for it. Finally, I would like to talk about a particular provision that is close to me. I would like to address what I regard as actually a troubling piece in the provision, which says, and I will quote from the proposed legislation: 
The United States military personnel who are tasked with the mission of providing combat search and rescue support, casualty evacuation, and medical support should not be counted as part of any force management level limitation on the number of United States ground forces in Afghanistan. 
This is a mistake. I believe that our medical personnel and others should be considered boots on the ground, contrary to the language in the provision. Combat medics carry weapons, they take casualties, and they are killed. Why shouldn’t we count them? It doesn’t seem to make sense to me. One of the closest people in the whole wide world to me is an Active Duty military combat medic, and if they are in a war zone, I want them counted. So with that, I ask for my amendment to be approved and included, and I ask that we listen to military people on the ground before we start trying to tell them what to do, and that we absolutely count combat medics and people who do rescue. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces. Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I am going to try to make some sense of this. We just had an amendment where we were debating providing the Authorization of Use of Military Force to the President, and we wanted to make certain that the President had the authority, and this is the portion of our bill where we actually provide authority. The word ‘‘authority’’ is throughout these sections that are, by this amendment, being asked to be deleted. But as Mr. ELLISON stated, we should look to the commanders on the ground. So let’s look at what they have said. General Campbell, testifying about the Haqqani network, said that it remains the most capable threat to U.S. and coalition forces. Now, what does threat mean? It means that they are trying to kill us and our coalition forces. It is a State Departmentdesignated terrorist organization which harbors al Qaeda and is the most lethal actor on the battlefield. These provisions that will be deleted relate to our ability to fight them. Approximately 30 percent of district centers are under Taliban control and influence or are at such risk, says General Campbell. Now, General Nicholson, who is currently the commander, is doing his review. That is correct. But what we are doing in these provisions is providing the status quo. We are not presuming that he is going to come back and say: Let’s cut; we can go do this with less troops. We are allowing that he would have the same resources that General Campbell had so that he would have an ability to defend our troops. Basically, if you go down to these paragraphs that are being deleted, this comes down to some fairly easy decisions: If you believe that ISIL is not a threat to our troops, vote for this amendment. If you believe that ISIL is not a threat to our allies in the Middle East, vote for this amendment. If you believe that the killings that were directed and inspired by ISIL in Brussels and Paris are not a threat to our Nation or our NATO allies, vote for this amendment. If you believe that it is okay for the Taliban to control portions of Afghan territory, even though al Qaeda planned and directed 9/11 under Talibancontrolled Afghanistan, vote for this amendment. If you believe that the U.S. and NATO troops should be responsible for Afghan security, and not Afghan security forces, vote for this amendment. If you believe, however, that we have a responsibility for our national security and to our troops, vote against this amendment. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE). Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, first, let me thank Congressman ELLISON for yielding and for his tremendous leadership. This amendment is extremely important. Today I rise to urge my colleagues to support this amendment and, really, allow our ground commanders to do their job. Now, of course, time and time again, Congress has refused to do its job. From Zika funding to confirming a new Supreme Court Justice, we failed to do our job. Instead of letting Congress do its job, the majority only seems interested in Congress doing other peoples’ jobs, and that is including our military commanders. There is no way we should be allowing this to happen. Make no mistake, Republicans are trying to expand the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and further expand America’s longest war. For nearly 15 years, we have been fighting a war in Afghanistan. Our brave servicemen and women have gone way beyond the call of duty. They have done everything we have asked them to do. It is past time to bring them home to their families and to their children. But minimally, we should not be telling our military leaders what to do in a war zone, especially before they have completed their ontheground assessment. So I hope that we vote ‘‘yes’’ on this commonsense amendment. While our young men and women are in Afghanistan, until we bring them home, let’s use the best type of intelligence, the best information, and the best direction that the ground commanders have determined based on their ground assessment in this war. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, just to be clear, the underlying provisions which the gentleman’s amendment would strike are sense of Congress provisions. Basically, it is the sense of Congress that the ground commanders ought to make these decisions. Unfortunately, artificial troop caps and overly restrictive requirements on our military increase the danger that our military faces in Afghanistan. So if you draw down too low the number of people you have, for example, then you don’t have enough to protect yourself. That is part of what we are seeing in Afghanistan. If you tie the military’s hands and say, ‘‘Okay. You cannot go after this enemy, even though they may pose the most deadly threat to you,’’ then you increase the danger to our military. That is exactly what these provisions try to deal with. Mr. Chairman, the Afghans are doing the fighting in Afghanistan. They are advancing and getting more capable all the time, but they still need us to be there and to advise and assist them. Just to look briefly at some of the provisions that the gentleman would strike, one says that the commander in 
Afghanistan has the authority to strike the Haqqani network. They are the ones that pose, in many people’s eyes, the biggest threat for big bombings and so forth in that region. Why would we not allow our military commander, if he wants to, if he thinks it is right, to strike them? Another provision the gentleman strikes is the one that says that we ought to have resources to go after ISIS. Remember, Mr. Chairman, that it is not just al Qaeda and the Taliban that are growing in Afghanistan. ISIS is growing there, too. This just says we ought to do something about that. The gentleman’s amendment would strike it. On troop caps, part of what is happening in Afghanistan is that we are artificially limiting the number of people there. As I mentioned, that increases the danger to the troops we do have there. Otherwise, we are bringing some people in on a temporary basis or hiring contractors to do the job. So these artificial troop caps mean that commanders and the administration have got to find all these ways around it, but they still increase the danger that the people we do have there face. That doesn’t make sense. There are still dangers in Afghanistan to our national security. These provisions the gentleman would strike just try to untie the hands of our military so they can deal with it on a military basis, not a political basis. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I urge Members to do likewise. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 9 OFFERED BY MR . ELLISON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in House Report 114–571. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Strike section 1502 and insert the following new section: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I rise to urge support for my amendment to H.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. The overseas contingency operations account is supposed to provide emergency funding for wars and unexpected operations overseas, operations that cannot be planned for in the base budget. Republicans are raiding this account. They are taking money from missions designed to protect our Nation from imminent threats to feed the military industrial complex. They argue that this makes our military stronger and that it improves our national security; but what it really does is, the Republicans have taken money from operations overseas and put it towards money for procurement, for nonwar needs, so much so that the operators would only be funded through 2017, April of next year. My amendment puts the money back. Mr. Chairman, Secretary Carter stated that this gimmick is gambling ‘‘with warfighter money at a time of war.’’ He said: ‘‘It would spend money taken from the war account on things that are not DOD’s highest priorities across the joint force.’’ My amendment takes the $9.4 billion taken for procurement on items like extra F–35s and the littoral combat ship, which the Pentagon did not prioritize, and puts the funds back in the OCO operations and maintenance account. b1715 Mr. Chair, $26 million of that money will go to preventing suicides amongst our military, as the President’s request for this was $26 million lower than the amount we appropriated in 2016. This problem is not going down, and it should not receive less support from us. In summary, we are putting money back where it belongs. We are supporting our troops on the ground. We are supporting those services overseas. We are supporting military readiness. We are supporting the priorities of the Pentagon and the President, not those of the defense industry. And I will say, Mr. Chairman, that if I were to ask you who I got a call from and ask you to guess, did I get a call from the President’s office or the Pentagon or Boeing, the answer would be number three, Boeing. That is who called me and doesn’t like this particular amendment. In fact, we didn’t hear from the others. We heard from the industry, the special interests. Let’s just say the Republicans do push through extra funds for OCO next year. This would still be shortchanging domestic programs that will have to be cut to pay for the defense industry. We all know that Republicans won’t let us raise taxes to cover additional costs. We won’t be able to take on more debt. Americans are going to suffer under the Republicans’ scheme to give the Pentagon equipment and the industry just more. I oppose it, and I urge support for my amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER ). Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, when we read our newspapers, we certainly know that the world is becoming a much less safe place. The conflicts around the world and the ability of our military to respond are incredibly important. But also, if you read the newspaper, you understand that our military is at a critical juncture. The effects of sequestration have significantly undermined the readiness of our military. The argument that Mr. ELLISON is making about what pot of money funds come out of is kind of irrelevant in that his amendment isn’t pure and that he doesn’t take all of the money out of one pot and move it into another. He only takes a portion. The President does the same thing in this shell game of where dollars come from. It is not an issue of where do dollars come from. It is an issue of, where do they go? If you read this bill, the issue of where these go, which is what Mr. ELLISON wants to stop, is moneys that go to readiness. It goes to the ability of our military to be prepared. The Admiral Vice Chief of Staff, General Daniel Allyn, recently explained that to build readiness ‘‘the Army has been forced to cancel or delay military construction, sustainment, restoration, 
and modernization across our posts, camps, and stations. Additionally, the Army reduced key installation services, individual training programs, and modernization.’’ In essence, readiness. This amendment strips away funding from critical programs that have been identified by our military services that were not fully funded by the President’s budget request that go to readiness. We are currently in a readiness crisis. Marine pilots are having to cannibalize museum parts to get their F– 18s ready to deploy. Of the Marine Corps 271 strike aircraft, only 46 can fly. Of the most severe type of aviation accidents, Marines are 84 percent above their 10year average. The Air Force maintainers are also cannibalizing museum parts to get aircraft in the air. Of the 20 B–1 bombers, which are workhorses in Iraq and Syria, only 9 can fly due to parts and maintenance shortfalls. Pilots are getting less than half of their training required during a time when our adversaries are becoming increasingly capable and technologically advanced. The Air Force’s Vice Chief of Staff, David Goldfein, recently stated during congressional testimony that lower than planned funding levels have resulted in one of the smallest, oldest, and least ready forces across the full spectrum of operations in our history. Voting for this amendment supports cutting our troops’ strength, cutting training and maintenance, forcing our armed services to maintain crumbling facilities, and forcing our servicemembers to continue to rely on faulty and worn out equipment. It is not an issue of what pot this money comes out of. It is a matter of where it goes. It needs to go for our servicemembers, so vote against this amendment. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR (Mr. RICE of South Carolina). The gentleman from Minnesota has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE). Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank the gentleman for yielding, and for introducing this amendment, and for his leadership to end waste, fraud, and abuse at the Pentagon. This amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor, would stop Republicans from using the overseas contingency operation fund as a piggy bank for more wasteful Pentagon spending. Yes, it really does appear that Christmas is coming in May for the militaryindustrial complex. Right now, Republicans have robbed critical programs, like military suicide prevention, and redirected that money to the OCO fund where there is no accountability, no transparency, or oversight. By funneling this money to the OCO account, Republicans are shortchanging lifesaving programs to fund wasteful programs, like the F–35 and tanks that rust in the Nevada desert. Even the Pentagon say they don’t want these programs funded. Yet, Republicans are jeopardizing our real national security priorities to further enrich the militaryindustrial complex. Our troops deserve better, Mr. Chairman. This is a dangerous budgeting gimmick. This amendment would end the OCO fraud and return the funds to the important programs that they were intended for. Let’s end this scheme and put the money back into where it belongs, and that is protecting our troops and the American people. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, let me just conclude by saying that it is time to put resources where they are needed, among suicide prevention and directly to our troops, not into simply more militaryindustrial complex procurement stuff, not just to help private business feed its bottom line profit, but to help our soldiers and to help our military on the ground, when needed. I urge support for my amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, just to be clear, the President in his budget request takes some of the OCO dollars and uses it to meet base requirements. He does that in his budget. It is not a question of whether it is done or not. The question is, how much? And even though the President uses OCO dollars to help meet base shortfalls, his own Comptroller in the defense budget review writes, even though they do that in the President’s budget request: ‘‘The Department will continue to experience gaps in training and maintenance over the near term and have a reduced margin of error in dealing with risks of uncertainty in a dynamic and shifting security environment.’’ In other words, even the President’s own budget documents say that it is not enough what he has done. So what we try to do is we try to do more. We are not going to do it all, but we try to do more to make sure that the training and maintenance that our troops are entitled to are provided. What that means is we should not send anyone out on a mission for which they are not fully prepared and fully supported. The problem is, as I mentioned awhile ago with the Black Hawk example, some of these folks have to fly helicopters that were made in 1979. I, myself, saw a fighter plane that President Reagan sent to bomb Muammar Qadhafi in 1986, and they couldn’t find the parts for it. The pilot tried. He figured out a way to take a part off of a museum aircraft and tried to make it fit, but the holes were drilled in the wrong place, so it didn’t work. The only thing you can do to replace a helicopter made in 1979 or an airplane that was flown on a mission in 1986 is to get a new one. So that is what the procurement is. As I mentioned a few moments ago, we have had a number of people from the Democratic side of the aisle who have asked for C–40s, MQ–4s, Black Hawks, B–22s, F–18s, F–35s, C–130s. Now, they didn’t just invent that. The reason that Democratic Members have asked for those things above and beyond what the President submitted is because there is a real need and because the only way we are going to fix some of these readiness problems, in addition to more money for training and maintenance, more money for facilities, and preventing further cuts in end strength, is to replace some of this old equipment with new equipment. That is what we do. The gentleman would undo that. I think his amendment should be defeated. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota will be postponed.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON ) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Chairman, I would like to speak first about an amendment to be considered in a later en bloc regarding Special Immigrant Visas. I want to call attention to the urgent need to continue the Special Immigrant Visa program for Afghans who worked for U.S. forces. This bipartisan amendment, backed by several veterans on the committee, would remove the unfortunate narrowing of eligibility requirements included in the mark, which would prevent hundreds of Afghans whose lives are at risk because of their work for our country from even being considered for resettlement in the United States. The narrowing of eligibility intentionally excludes hundreds of Afghans who worked for the State Department, USAID, and U.S. security contractors in a number of capacities, many of whom face welldocumented death threats due to their work with our government, regardless of whether that was with frontline troops or on an American base. By narrowing eligibility, the program would erode the expectations of hundreds of Afghan staff whose lives remain in danger because of their work for the U.S. mission and also make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified Afghan staff in the future who are essential to achieving our diplomatic and assistance goals. For that risk and sacrifice, the very least we can do is offer them a chance to stay live, to keep living, rather than abandoning them to the same enemies they united with us to destroy. One of the things I was most proud of as a Marine infantry officer was that we never let our enemies make us compromise our values. One of those values is a solemn commitment to our allies and to our brothers in arms. I urge your support on the floor in following through on our commitment to our Afghan partners. I also want to comment on the fact that the chairman of the committee and I worked to resolve some differences that we had on understanding the concerns of our diplomatic mission in Afghanistan. I appreciate very much his work with me on that to support our troops and mission overseas. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Massachusetts, and he is exactly right. He and other Members are very concerned about this issue. He has talked to me about it a number of times. I have been concerned that there was abuse of this system. That was gathered from visits I have made to Afghanistan, including last year. But I very much appreciate the points that the gentleman from Massachusetts has made. I think he and others who have worked on this issue have come up with a good amendment. I support it. All of us agree that if someone has risked their lives or would be in danger for supporting the United States and our folks in Afghanistan, then that person needs protection. None of us want to see the program abused. But I am convinced that the changes that the gentleman has been instrumental in working out are helpful. I support it. And I thank him for his efforts on doing this. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. YOUNG ). b1730 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chair, I will be brief. According to the Federal Trade Commission, our men and women who are defending our Nation and their families are twice as likely to fall victim to 
identity theft and fraud. Because they protect us, we need to do more to protect them and their families from scammers who take advantage of their service. My amendment No. 177 simply requires the Department of Defense to report to Congress on its efforts to protect their information. I thank the chairman for working with me on this amendment, and I look forward to working the committee to better protect those who sacrifice so much to defend our Nation. I also thank my cochair of the Bipartisan Congressional Task Force to Combat Identity Theft and Fraud, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. SINEMA ), for her great work. She has been a great partner in helping to protect taxpayers and now our servicemembers from having their identities stolen. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. SINEMA ). Ms. SINEMA. I thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Mr. M OULTON for supporting the YoungSinema amendment. I thank Congressman YOUNG for working with me and others in offering this bipartisan amendment to protect members of the Armed Forces and their families from identity theft. My home State of Arizona is one of the top 10 States that is affected by identity theft. Military families are among those most targeted and most at risk for these crimes. Our amendment improves the Department of Defense’s efforts to protect military families’ financial information from identity theft. I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to combat identity theft and financial fraud. Again, I thank my friend, Congressman YOUNG , for working with me on this important, commonsense amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Among the amendments in this en bloc package is one that I have authored to establish a global engagement center. I thank my cosponsors of this amendment, Mr. WILSON and Mr. LANGEVIN , the chair and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats & Capabilities. I also thank Chairman ROYCE , who has worked with us. Included in this amendment are reforms of the Broadcasting Board of Governors that he and his ranking member have worked on for some time. Mr. Chair, it has been a source of great frustration for me that our government has seemed to be so inept in the battle of ideas against the terrorists. I first introduced a bill on this topic in 2005. Today there is a lot of talk not only of the socalled physical caliphate that ISIS claims, but of the virtual caliphate. Unless and until we can be more effective at engaging in the battle of ideas, we will not succeed in defeating terrorism. It is not just the terrorists we have to worry about. We have seen the Russians lie and use deception for military gain. We have seen similar sorts of tactics by the Chinese in their building these islands out in the South China Sea and elsewhere around the world. This amendment requires the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and others—the executive branch—to get their act together, coordinate, and more effectively engage in the battle of ideas. I hope it helps. As I say, this is a crucial battlefield, and our country needs to do better in this field. Mr. Chair, as I have no further speakers at this point, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ). Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I am appreciative to the gentleman from Massachusetts for allowing me to speak on my amendment. Mr. Chair and Members, a lack of opportunity for Federal contracting is one of the main factors of the widening racial wealth gap. As the Nation’s largest employer, the Federal Government has a critical responsibility to focus on increasing minority and female inclusion in the job market; yet, only a fraction of Federal contracts goes to minority or femaleowned businesses. This is partly why the wealth gap and extreme disparities in racial incomes continue. Amendment No. 49 ensures that we meet important contracting goals by analyzing a 5year study by the GAO on how the DOD contracts with minority and femaleowned businesses. While there are many ways the government can address the issue of more equitable contracting, one important and more immediate impact, I believe, the Federal Government can have is by providing more opportunities for minorityowned businesses. The DOD spends roughly $285 billion a year on contracting, more than all Federal agencies combined. With such large purchasing power, it is imperative that these funds are used not only to provide the best services for the Department of Defense, but also to distribute fairly and wisely in all communities. The study proposed is the first step toward identifying where those opportunities lie for great inclusion. This amendment further emphasizes and underscores the importance of minorities in both our local and national communities. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding and also for his service to the Nation. I thank the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. SMITH; the chairman of the full committee, Mr. THORNBERRY ; and the Rules Committee for accepting this amendment. Let me thank the gentlemen doubly and triply for being kind enough to accept this amendment on a regular basis, and I am going to persist because I believe it is important. Mr. Chair, let me make a big pronouncement or announcement or breaking news: there are women in the United States military. I want to say that again. There are women in the United States military. My amendment deals with triple negative breast cancer. It calls for the increased collaboration between the DOD and the National Institutes of Health to combat triple negative breast cancer. This amendment directs the Department of Defense to identify specific genetic and molecular targets and biomarkers for TNBC. ‘‘Triple negative breast cancer’’ is a term used to describe breast cancer. Its cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors and does not have an excess of HER2 protein on its cell membrane of tumor cells. I am not in the military. I have had many family members in the military, but I would venture to say this is a case in which you have battalions, and you are on the field, and you have a difficult enemy who keeps moving away from your sight and your target. Though you have used overlapping forces, you can’t seem to pinpoint the enemy. Ultimately you are victorious, but that is because you collaborate and you work together. This makes commonly used tests and methods to detect breast cancer not as effective, meaning the ordinary style of fighting does not work for triple negative breast cancer. Seventy percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast cancer do not live more than 5 years after being diagnosed. It is important to note that TNBC affects women under 50 years of age, and it makes up more than 30 percent of all breast cancer diagnoses, specifically in African American women. The collaboration between the Department of Defense and the NIH to combat triple negative breast cancer can support the development of multiple targeted therapies for this devastating disease and can help women in the United States military, those who are serving our country. Triple negative breast cancer is a specific strain of breast cancer for which no targeted treatment is available. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. MOULTON. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman so very much. Mr. Chair, it is a disease, however, that can be conquered. Triple negative breast cancer, TNBC, accounts for between 13 percent and 25 percent of all breast cancers in the United States. It is of a higher grade, and it onsets at a 
young age. That means these women are in the United States military. Finally, because it continues, there is a need for research funding for biomarker selection, drug discovery, and clinical trials that will lead to the early detection of TNBC and to the development of multiple targeted therapies to treat this awful disease. My amendment would provide for that. In coming from Houston, Texas, with MD Anderson Cancer Center, I can tell you that they are looking at major research that can be very helpful between the NIH and the Department of Defense. I hope my amendment will stay in this particular bill, and I hope it will go to the Senate and will be signed by the President. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY , Ranking Member ADAM SMITH and the Rules Committee for making in order and including Jackson Lee Amendment and including it in En Bloc Amendment Number 2 to the ‘‘National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.’’ This is the first of 3 Jackson Lee amendments made in order by the House Rules Committee. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 45, calls for increased collaboration between the DoD and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 45 directs the DoD and NIH to collaborate to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer. This amendment directs the Department of Defense to identify specific genetic and molecular targets and biomarkers for TNBC. ‘‘Triple Negative Breast Cancer’’ is a term used to describe breast cancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, and do not have an excess of the ‘‘HER2’’ protein on their cell membrane of tumor cells. This makes commonly used tests and methods to detect breast cancer not as effective. This is a serious illness that affects between 10–17% of female breast cancer patients and this condition is more likely to cause death than the most common form of breast cancer. Seventy percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast cancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 45 will help to save lives. TNBC disproportionately impacts younger women, African American women, Hispanic/ Latina women, and women with a ‘‘BRCA1 genetic mutation, which is prevalent in Jewish women. TNBC usually affects women under 50 years of age and makes up more than 30% of all breast cancer diagnoses in African Americans. Black women are far more susceptible to this dangerous subtype than white or Hispanic women. The collaboration between the Department of Defense and NIH to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer can support the development of multiple targeted therapies for this devastating disease. Triple negative breast cancer is a specific strain of breast cancer for which no targeted treatment is available. The American Cancer Society calls this particular strain of breast cancer ‘‘an aggressive subtype associated with lower survival rates.’’ Triple negative breast cancer is a term used to describe breast cancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, and do not have an excess of the HER2 protein on their cell membrane of tumor cells In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control predicted that that year 26,840 black women would be diagnosed with TNBC. The overall incidence rate of breast cancer is 10% lower in African American women than white women. African American women have a five year survival rate of 78% after diagnosis as compared to 90% for white women. The incidence rate of breast cancer among women under 45 is higher for African American women compared to white women. Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells: TNBC accounts for between 13% and 25% of all breast cancer in the United States; usually of a higher grade and size; onset at a younger age; are more aggressive; are more likely to metastasize. Currently, 70% of women with metastatic triple negative breast cancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed. African American women are 3 times more likely to develop triplenegative breast cancer than White women. AfricanAmerican women have prevalence TNBC of 26% versus 16% in nonAfrican American women. AfricanAmerican women are more likely to be diagnosed with larger tumors and more advanced stages of breast cancer. Currently there is no targeted treatment for TNBC. Breast cancers with specific, targeted treatment methods, such as hormone and gene based strains, have higher survival rates than the triple negative subtype, highlighting the need for a targeted treatment. Because there continues to be a need for research funding for biomarker selection, drug discovery, and clinical trial designs that will lead to the early detection of TNBC and to the development of multiple targeted therapies to treat this awful disease Jackson Lee Amendment Number 45 included in En Bloc 2 is essential to paving a way for advancements in these areas. I thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH for including these amendments in the En Bloc Amendment Number 2, and I urge all Members to join me in voting for its adoption. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ). Mr. LIPINSKI. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in support of an amendment I offered along with Mrs. COMSTOCK . It seeks to expand the SkillBridge job training program by directing unit commanders to encourage participation by departing servicemembers. It also directs the DOD to form a comprehensive study so that they can evaluate and improve the program as needed. The SkillBridge initiative helps returning veterans by providing them with job training and apprenticeship programs in areas that span every sector of the workforce. This program has already trained around 4,500 servicemembers, and the 18 SkillBridge programs claim to have an employment success rate of 100 percent. Encouraging participation will help more of our veterans find employment when they reenter civilian life, which is something we need to do all we can to promote. I thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH for supporting this amendment in this bloc. I urge my colleagues to support the bloc. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes. I would like to discuss an amendment to come up in a future en bloc package. I joined a vast array of foreign policy experts and retired generals—and even Israel’s own nuclear commission—in supporting the nuclear deal with Iran because, although it was an imperfect deal, nobody could articulate a better pathway to a better deal to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The nuclear deal, however, is only that—a nuclear deal. As when President Reagan was negotiating nuclear deals with the Soviets, we make these agreements with our enemies, not with our friends, and we must not forget that Iran remains opposed to us in a vast array of other ways. As with the Soviets, enforcement of the deal requires continued vigilance. My amendment would require the President to notify Congress whenever Iran conducts a ballistic missile launch and inform Congress as to the actions the President will take in response, including diplomatic efforts to pursue additional sanctions and the passage of a United Nations Security Council resolution. While we have been successful in deterring Iran from building a nuclear weapon with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, we must continue to apply pressure to deter further actions that destabilize this fragile region and threaten our allies. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of the en bloc package. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. CARTER of Georgia). The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 10 OFFERED BY MR . ZINKE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in House Report 114–571. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chair, I offer amendment No. 10 as the designee of Mrs. LUMMIS from the great State of Wyoming. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle D of title XVI, add the following new section: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. ZINKE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this amendment to highlight the importance of maintaining our nuclear deterrence. This amendment will ensure that our land based nuclear ICBMs are ready at a moment’s notice and are not placed on a reducedalert status. President Reagan had it right. He championed the notion of peace through strength. Those wise words still apply today, even greater. The harsh reality is that we live in an increasingly unstable international environment. Nuclear deterrence provided by the triad has been the backbone of our national security posture for over half a century. Just last fall, the Secretary of Defense stated: ‘‘The nuclear deterrent is a musthave . . . It is the foundation. It’s the bedrock and it needs to remain healthy . . . ’’ Montana is a proud defender of our triad, and our troops are always ready. Our ICBMs should be, too. As more nationstates, including Iran, begin to defy international laws and pursue nuclear and ballistic missiles, it is critical that we do not scale back our nuclear deterrence. I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. b1745 Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. Having previously served as the chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee for several years, I am intimately familiar with our intercontinental ballistic missile forces and the important role ICBM deterrence plays when it comes to our national defense. While I understand the intent of this amendment, it is fundamentally unnecessary, dramatically overreaching, and lacks meaningful policy reform. The budget request for FY 2017 contains no funding for reducing the alert level or reducing the number of deployed ICBMs below 400, and there are no plans to do so in the future. Furthermore, the statement of policy with regard to ICBMs, which is legally binding, significantly overreaches. It states that modernization of the ICBMs and retaining an alert ICBM force is necessary to ensure robust nuclear deterrence by preventing any adversary from believing it can carry out a small, surprise, firststrike attack which disarms the strategic forces of the United States. However, this disregards the crucial and fundamental role of submarines that provide assured, survivable secondstrike capability, which would dissuade an adversary from even thinking they could launch a disarming attack against the United States. If we include any legislation on ICBMs, Mr. Chairman, it should be that we increase accountability and ensure that we are improving the morale and culture inside the Air Force with regard to nuclear weapons. Some of the serious and embarrassing problems that have plagued the ICBM missileers and security forces in recent years unfortunately continues, such as the Air Force base in Wyoming where 14 enlisted airmen in the security forces were being investigated for drug use just several weeks ago. I see nothing in this amendment that addresses that problem, nor do I see anything in the bill that addresses that issue. If we are going to talk about keeping ICBMs, it should be in a meaningful way, instead of yet another annual amendment driven by what seems like parochial interests in highlighting their role, particularly at the exclusion of other legs of the nuclear triad. While the committee tried to work with Ms. Lummis, Mr. Chairman, to avail the amendment of some of these concerns, bipartisan negotiations was seemingly rejected. So, Mr. Chairman, I hope that we are able to make some of these adjustments as we conference with the Senate, but I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment as offered. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great State of North Dakota (Mr. CRAMER ). Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Chairman, reducing our ICBM alertness is reducing our readiness, and the whole point of the Defense Authorization Act is to ensure our military readiness. The ICBMs have been a very effective deterrent to enemy aggression for decades. This amendment is simply a deterrent to those who would try to reduce our readiness by reducing our alertness and reducing the number of ICBMs. This would be a dangerous step, contrary to the longstanding policies of our defense and certainly a bad posture. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great State of Alabama (Mr. ROGERS ). Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, as chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I understand that the responsiveness and distributed nature of our ICBMs are their most critical feature and their unique contribution to our nuclear triad. Without ICBMs, an adversary would only need to strike less than 10 targets to disarm our nuclear forces. With ICBMs, an adversary needs to strike hundreds of hardened targets deep in the American homeland. That is a much more difficult proposition and is at the very heart of deterrence. This is not a parochial issue or a political issue. This is a profound national security issue. Dealerting our 
ICBMs or unilaterally cutting their numbers is a terrible idea. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, as I previously stated—and with all due respect to my colleague—this bill contains no funding for reducing the alert level or reducing the number of deployed ICBMs below 400, and there are no plans to do so in the future. Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, how much time remains? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy and his leadership on this, and I think he laid it out very clearly. This is an imaginary problem, but it is an area that actually needs to have some attention to it. He referenced recent problems in terms of potential drug abuse. You know they found the cheating earlier because they were investigating drug abuse when they found out that there was cheating on the readiness test. I would advise my colleagues to read Eric Schlosser’s ‘‘Command and Control,’’ a fascinating study about the history of American nuclear weapons and problems that we have had, mistakes that were made, and near misses. There are serious issues that we need to be thinking in terms of the readiness and how it goes forward. We need to think clearly about what we do in the future, what is the right level of deterrence, and how are we going to adequately analyze it. 454 landbased missiles are not necessarily a magic number that we should be freezing on a permanent basis. Looking at what happens going forward with the trilliondollar commitment with missiles that are submarine based—we have our bombers; we have land based—and being able to have a critical appraisal of how much deterrence is enough and look at problems, such as security lapses, training problems, drug problems, this is not a situation that we should just sort of happily freeze for the next goaround and maintain that any adjustment to this or even evaluating an adjustment is somehow a threat to national security. The real problems that we face dealing with international terrorism and the potential of nuclear weapons falling into rogue hands, those are very real problems that we need to be doing more. This vast nuclear triad that we will spend a trillion dollars on does not help us with those challenges. Rather than hollow out the military, we ought to be looking at potential changes going forward. This amendment is illadvised, unnecessary, and is the wrong direction we should be going. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chair, this amendment is about ensuring that our nuclear deterrence that has protected this country for over 70 years remains strong and viable. Yesterday, this body passed a measure to keep our nukes safe. It is now time to ensure they are ready at a moment’s notice. There is no reason to have a nuclear force unless they are ready. To lower the alert posture of our landbased ICBMs would result in a 2 week delay before our ICBMs would be ready to use. This would cripple our ability to respond quickly, which is the entire point of having a nuclear triad. In the military, we always hope for the best but plan for the worse. While I hope we never have to use our nuclear weapons—and, indeed, I believe everyone in this body does—to lower their posture status of landbased ICBMs would unnecessarily put us at risk. I encourage all my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. ZINKE). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 11 OFFERED BY MR . LAMBORN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in House Report 114–571. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas and committee staff for their willingness to work with me on this amendment. I fought long and hard to get this museum the recognition it deserves, and I am very pleased that we have a path forward where we can finally achieve that. My amendment simply recognizes this museum in Colorado Springs as the National Museum of World War II Aviation. This amendment does not authorize any funds. The museum is not seeking Federal funds and does not have plans to do so in the future. The National Museum of World War II Aviation has taken great care to focus its story line on an aspect of military history that has not been fully explored by other national military museums. The intent is to augment the tremendous work that is being done by those museums, not to duplicate or replace it. It is the only museum in the United States that exists to exclusively preserve and promote an understanding of the role of aviation in winning World War II. It is dedicated to celebrating the American spirit and to recognizing the teamwork, patriotism, and courage of the men and women who fought, as well as those on the home front who mobilized and supported the national aviation effort. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ) has been a strong advocate for this museum, and I certainly appreciate him bringing it to the committee’s attention and to the attention of the House. Many Members share the gentleman’s commitment to the preservation of historic aircraft, and I will certainly work with him on this and related issues. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, based on that reassurance and on that pledge to work together, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. 
AMENDMENT NO . 12 OFFERED BY MR . SANFORD  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in House Report 114–571. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of title XXXV add the following: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SANFORD ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I rise with a very simple amendment. It would do nothing more than call for a GAO report of the maritime security fleet. I do so because I think that we would all acknowledge that knowledge is power, and the ability to look very closely at what is happening within that fleet, I think, is important. I would also say that, as a believer that defense is a core function of the Federal Government, we would want to have transparency in the way that we expend those funds in pursuit of our Nation’s defense. I think that this is important in light of the fact that overall funding has risen by about $89 million here over the last, I guess, funding cycle. You have seen the pership stipend go from $3.5 million to $5 million. There has not been a study of what is happening within that fleet of ships for more than 12 years, and so, again, this is not in any way prescriptive in nature as to what should or shouldn’t happen or the merits or demerits of the program. It is simply saying might we not learn a little bit more of what is happening within that fleet, and that is it. I reserve the balance of my time. b1800 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The gentleman from South Carolina is correctly concerned about the expenditure of money. I would suggest to him that this study is a waste of the expenditure of money by the GAO and, hence, the taxpayers of the United States. Studies about the MSP have been available over many, many years; and in fact, there is now, in the Office of Management and Budget, a comprehensive study that was commissioned by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. The gentleman can certainly contact OMB and get that study and, quite probably, get all the information he is going to request in this particular analysis and, furthermore, not have to waste taxpayer money in the process. I would point out to the gentleman a statement that was made on January 17 of this year concerning the MSP program by General Darren McDew, commander of US TRANSCOM. This is the guy who is responsible for moving men, women, materiel, and equipment around the world. He said: ‘‘Our overwhelming success was due in large part to the 10,000 U.S. mariners who sped 220 shiploads of decisive U.S. combat power throughout the buildup known as Operation Desert Shield. Without those mariners and vessels, our ability to project decisive force and demonstrate our national resolve would have been a mere fraction of what was required to ensure the swift victory the world witnessed. Simply put, moving an army of decisive size and power can only be accomplished by sea,’’ and the MSP is the central part of that. We don’t need this study. What we need is strong support for the MSP. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chair, I would say to my colleague that, again, what we would all recognize is that OMB is different than the Government Accountability Office. The OMB is fundamentally executive branch in nature. I think there is a real value to having a third party independent look at what is happening with the study. Again, it is not prescriptive in nature, but having that third party look, I think, is that much more important in all of our justifications of this program or other programs like it. I would also say this, in terms of ‘‘waste of money,’’ as we know, GAO is funded through the legislative branch. This would not involve an additional expenditure of money. It would be incorporated into the expenditures that currently take place within the legislative branch and, again, GAO, by extension. In that regard, I think it would be a good use of taxpayer money to take a look that has not been taken in more than 12 years. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, that is the first time I have ever heard that expenditure by the House of Representatives is not taxpayer money, but I guess some people can claim that. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. FORBES ). Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. I know how committed he is to national defense and to fiscal responsibility in the country. However, one of the things that we haven’t talked about in this amendment is it asks us to look at outsourcing this to foreign countries to be able to do, and I think today I rise not just as chairman of the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, but also on behalf of my good friend Mr. COURTNEY , who is the ranking member on that subcommittee and who has given us authority to say that he is opposed to this as well for these reasons. The sealift, if we lose that sealift, we have lost the lifeblood to our warfighters because that is the vessel, that is the lifeline that keeps them and sustains them. The very question for us is this: If that balloon goes up and the bell rings, are we going to trust a foreign power to hold in their hand that very lifeblood for our men and women and our warfighters? I want to remind everyone in the House that in World War II, 1 in 26 merchant mariners were actually killed. It was a higher rate of loss than any other service. The rate was so high, in fact, that the merchant marine concealed it because they were afraid they couldn’t find enough mariners if the true danger of the services were known. So our big question here is, even if we came back with a study that said it might be cheaper to outsource it, would anyone in this room dare place that trust in a foreign country? I think very clearly we would not. Mr. Chairman, also these decisions are probably best made by military transportation command, sealift command, and maritime command, and they have said there is no guarantee whatsoever that a foreignflagged fleet will sail into harm’s way if we need them. They have said a 60ship capability is extremely important, and they have said that foreignflagged ships which might be cheaper cannot be relied on for critical national security missions. Mr. Chairman, I hope we will oppose this amendment, we will reject it. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from South Carolina has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I would say this: in essence, we already have outsourced this. I think the question about the maritime security fleet is that it is currently run by a foreign flagged fleet of vessels. If I am not mistaken, it is almost exclusively run by Maersk, which is a foreignflagged vessel. The question of this amendment is to say: Might not there be other ways of doing it? Maybe this is the best way to do it. Maybe there are other ways to do it. But this notion of not being willing to look, not being willing to have a third party validate or, if you will, take a look and say this makes sense or, no, there is a better way of skinning this cat both for the military and for the taxpayer, I think again warrants, in this case, the study by the GAO. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1 minute remaining. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. In Desert Storm I, back in the 1990s, a ship that was manned by Pakistanis was loaded at the docks, began to sail, and turned around because the crew refused to go into that zone. We cannot 
allow that to happen ever again. The MSP was started specifically to provide that kind of sealift power that we need to move our men, materiel, and equipment, wherever they may be needed in the world. It does us little good to spend $680 billion on a Defense appropriation bill and not be able to get where the trouble is. Do away with the MSP, and that is where you are headed with this, moving toward foreign flags and, indeed, Maersk is operated by a foreign country, but it is licensed to operate in the United States with American sailors on American ships for the MSP program. We don’t need to waste money on this. The studies are available dating back to 2006, 2009, and, more recently, with the OMB study. We don’t need to waste our money. We need to get on with supporting the MSP program. I ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I would again go back to the basics. This stipend goes to Maersk presently. It has been raised from $3.5 million to $5 million. Maybe that is the best thing in the world to do; maybe it is not. But I think it is worthy of study, particularly given the fact that we have raised the stipend by $89 million over the last year, particularly given the fact that we have not looked at this issue from the standpoint of an outside third party validation from the GAO for more than 12 years. It is for that reason I simply say, again, in no way prescriptively, it is worth a look. And again, given the fact that the Government Accountability Office does regular studies on a whole host of different issues on a very regular basis, I think this is worthy, given the additional $89 million that was spent last year. I would ask for a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SANFORD ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina will be postponed. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 18 printed in House Report 114–571. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
and we thought we had it worked out. So right at the eleventh hour here, to have the Department of Defense say ‘‘No, we want to change it’’ is something I think we still need to examine more closely. I thank Mr. PALLONE for the time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time simply to say this amendment, a version of this amendment, was filed last week. Working with the Committee on Energy and Commerce, it has been revised. Again, the purpose of this amendment is—and what I think it clearly does is simply restate what everybody thought was the case—to resolve a disagreement among lawyers. That is the reason I call it, really, a technical amendment. I hope that the House will adopt it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ). The amendment was agreed to. b1815

AMENDMENT NO . 69 OFFERED BY MR . LANGEVIN  
OF RHODE ISLAND  Page 480, before line 13, insert the following: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON ) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. ELLMERS ). Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, this amendment does one thing: it maintains oversight and accountability of the Air Force. This will ensure that the Air Force follows through on their promise of providing adequate air support to ensure there is no negative impact on the readiness of Fort Bragg paratroopers. I have said this is a terrible decision, and today’s amendment is about holding the Air Force accountable. It will require the Secretary of the Army and the Air Force to evaluate and to report the levels of air support provided to Fort Bragg by the Air Force. As the Representative of Fort Bragg, this will allow me to monitor jump numbers and ensure military readiness is not jeopardized in any way, shape, or form. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ). Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I want to, first of all, thank my HASC colleague across the aisle, ETC Chairman WILSON from the great State of South Carolina, for working with me on this bipartisan amendment to expand talent exchange authorities within the DOD. This amendment addresses a key challenge facing the Department, which is competition with the private sector to recruit and retain highly skilled talent. As we understand right now, it is exceptionally competitive in, for example, the IT and cybersecurity fields. We need to be able to retain, attract, and recruit the best and the brightest in this field, particularly because salaries are very high and it is very difficult in many ways for the DOD to compete in this space. While we are very grateful, of course, for those who devote their lives to a military career, not everyone will give 20 or 30 years of their lives to the U.S. military. But there is certainly no shortage of patriotism across the private sector, and dedicating several months or years of their lives to our national security is certainly a worthy endeavor. This also gives DOD employees exposure to cuttingedge operational techniques and best practices across a wide array of disciplines, while giving private sector employees insight into how the Department operates. Mr. Chairman, we must ensure that we are recruiting the best and the brightest in order to uphold our national defenses. This amendment has been sought after by the DOD. Again, there is bipartisan support on this amendment. It gives great flexibility to the Department to be able to work to bring in people of great talent from the private sector for a period of time. Again, it also allows the DOD to have our men and women in uniform go to the private sector for a time and learn best practices and what cuttingedge techniques and capabilities are happening in the private sector. So this is a good, commonsense amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership in this very important endeavor. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this amendment package, which includes my amendment that clarifies that the pilot program for prescription drug acquisition costs regarding TRICARE pharmacy benefits will also include small business pharmacies. Currently, the pilot program helps extend discounts to TRICARE beneficiaries for prescription drugs filled at retail pharmacies. My amendment simply clarifies that small business pharmacies are retail pharmacies and will be included in this pilot program. In many cases around the country, people are unlimited when it comes to which pharmacy they can have their preparations filled at. With this amendment, we can ensure all pharmacies, both large and small retailers, will be included in this pilot program. I encourage all my colleagues to support this amendment package. Mr MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I wanted to refer back to an amendment that was in the previous en bloc that dealt with the special immigrant visas. I want to express my appreciation to the committee, the chairman, the ranking member, and to the staff. This is a complicated issue. It is in your bill, but it is not entirely within your jurisdiction. And there has been an ebb and flow. It has been something that I have, as you know, been working on for a decade, and that is for the United States to keep faith with the people in Afghanistan who made the mission possible—the people who literally risked their lives as guides, construction workers, interpreters, and truck drivers—the men and women who made it possible for us to succeed. It isn’t just the Department of Defense. There are men and women who worked with the State Department and USAID, which are an important part of our activities in those countries. Those foreign nationals are every bit at risk as somebody who is guiding our troops in the field. I appreciate your willingness to put in the en bloc amendment a little bit of flexibility. I hope it is not the last word, because we need to think seriously about what we do for the people who work on base, people who work for the State Department, and the people who work for USAID so that we are able to make sure that we have an adequate number of visas and that we don’t have an arbitrarily short period of time because the pipeline has been hopelessly complex and flawed. We have been working with the bureaucracy in trying to make it work better, but that is an ongoing struggle. And the fact is, there are different people with different committees who have different orientations. I hope that this en bloc amendment is just the start and that we can continue working with the chairman, with the minority party, with the staff, and with the advocates and various people who are committed to making sure that we do right by the people who are at risk now of being killed, murdered, tortured, and having family members killed. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON ). Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, North Carolina is a proud, strong military State. We are proud of the men and women who answer the call and risk their lives to protect us. I never, ever want them to be in a fair fight. I want them to always have the tools, the equipment, and the training needed to dominate and destroy the enemy. That is why I filed an amendment with my colleague, RENEE ELLMERS , to protect training of paratroopers at Fort Bragg, the epicenter of the universe. As you may know, the Air Force has moved forward with plans to deactivate the 440th Airlift Wing. This deactivation puts these young paratroopers, and indeed our very national security, at risk, as evidenced by the failure of the Air Force to meet current training requirements. For the sake of our national security, this amendment is absolutely critical to hold the Air Force accountable and to ensure our rapid reaction forces are prepared for deployment at a moment’s notice. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ). Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the bipartisan amendment I have cowritten with my colleague, Judge TEDPOEof Texas. The amendment, which is part of the en bloc amendments, endorses an ongoing effort at the Defense Security Cooperation Agency to develop a comprehensive framework for the assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of security cooperation activities of the Department of Defense. It follows a related monitoring evaluation amendment Judge POEand I offered to the NDAA for FY 2016 and the committee retained, gratefully, in the 2017 bill. Security cooperation with foreign security forces builds valuable international partnerships and enhances the ability of our partners to carry out joint military operations and enhances American security while it is at it. However, few requirements are placed on these programs to measure the impact of funding provided to our foreign security partners. Looking at efficacy, does it work? Judge POEand I have led the effort to apply assessment, monitoring, and evaluation leading principles to U.S. foreign assistance administered by the State Department, USAID, and other Federal agencies. Last year, the House of Representatives passed our bill, the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability, H.R. 3766. We should have a similar expectation of accountability for our security cooperation programs as well. I welcome the committee’s bipartisan efforts to begin to reform, consolidate, and modify the more than 120 security cooperation authorities Congress has provided DOD over the years. Notably, the underlying bill strengthens countrybycountry reporting requirements for security cooperation and begins to reorganize security cooperation authorities into one coherent separate section of title X of the U.S. Code. Furthermore, the Senate is advancing an NDAA bill that requires DOD to produce an annual budget justification for security cooperation funding. There is obviously significant demand, Mr. Chairman, for more transparency and accountability in terms of U.S. security cooperation. Our amendment is consistent with that demand, and it builds on the great work done by the committee in this area to define clear objectives and metrics for security cooperation. I want to thank the chairman, the ranking member, and both committee staffs, minority and majority, for their excellent work and for their bipartisan approach to this and so many other issues in the bill. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. GUINTA ). Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, and I want to thank the chairman for including it in the en bloc package. My amendment increases funding for U.S. NORTHCOM’s Joint Task Force North by $3 million to assist with its counternarcotics operations. As part of my work as the chair of the Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic, I traveled to the Mexican border earlier this spring to investigate sources of illegal fentanyl and heroin coming into the country. There I learned and had the opportunity to meet with the commanding officers at the Joint Task Force North, the joint service command that supports Federal law enforcement agencies with resources to identify and interdict criminal activities conducted within the United States and its borders. My goal is to ensure that Joint Task Force North receives the funding necessary to continue their counternarcotics efforts. Again, I want to thank the chairman and the Armed Services Committee for their work on the underlying bill, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, again, I thank the distinguished gentleman, and I also thank the chairman of the full committee, the ranking member of the full committee, and the subcommittee chairs as well. I serve on the Homeland Security Committee, and I am constantly aware of the overlapping duties and responsibilities, Mr. Chairman, of the United States military, which has its confinement in certain areas, but also working to secure the homeland. The Jackson Lee amendment No. 64 in en bloc amendment No. 4 makes an important contribution to the bill by improving the effectiveness of U.S. Northern Command, or NORTHCOM, in fulfilling its critical mission of protecting the U.S. homeland in the event of war and to provide support to local, State, and Federal authorities in times of national emergency. Specifically, here is what my amendment does. It develops and has in place a leadership strategy that will strengthen and foster necessary institutional and interpersonal relationships with State and local governments. The backbone of securing the homeland is engaging State and local governments. Also, to develop an instructional program to train key personnel how to lead effectively in the event of a disaster when they do not have command authority to dictate actions. b1830 In addition, NORTHCOM, which was established in 2002 in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, is to bring the capabilities and the resources of the U.S. military to the assistance the American people during a catastrophic disaster like war or a pandemic outbreak of diseases, such as Ebola, Zika, SARS, or influenza; major earthquakes, floods, and natural disasters; or terrorist attacks. I live in the Gulf Coast, and I am well familiar with hurricanes, enormous rains that we have just experienced, needing to bring to bear moving large numbers of people, housing large numbers of people. And then this morning I spent time after time of dealing with the Zika virus, which, again, our southern Gulf Coast region may be the epicenter. Let me quote, for example, a quote from a renowned professor, Leonard Marcus, out of Harvard. What we are trying to do is: ‘‘Effective emergency preparedness and response requires leadership that can accomplish perceptive coordination and communication amongst diverse agencies . . . ’’ The Acting CHAIR (Mr. HOLDING ). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. The challenge is, as we learned from 9/11, ‘‘operating within their specified scope of authority, preparedness leaders in characteristic bureaucratic fashion often serve to bolster the profile and import of their own organization, thereby creating a silo effect . . . ’’ So let me speak as that Homeland Security member and the person who has been engaged in the crises or disasters in my own community. When we collaborate we work better together. When we develop relationships, we work better together. Let me just offer a moment of personal privilege as someone speaking about relationships. This bill has many good elements in it, and I am propelled 
and committed to diversity and respecting all people. I am saddened by the language that the Russell amendment has dealing with the LGBT, and I am saddened that the Dent amendment was not allowed in. We need to build on collaborating with all people to secure America and to make a better military. I thank the gentleman for the support of my amendment in the en bloc. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of En Bloc Amendment Number 4 to H.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, offered by Chairman THORNBERRY . I want to express my thanks and appreciation to Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH, and their colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for their work thank on this bill and their devotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces. I also thank Chairman SESSIONS and Ranking Member SLAUGHTER of the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64, which is included in En Bloc Amendment Number 4. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64 makes an important contribution to the bill by improving the effectiveness of the Northern Command (‘‘NORTHCOM’’) in fulfilling its critical mission of protecting the U.S. homeland in event of war and to provide support to local, state, and federal authorities in times of national emergency. Specifically, Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64 encourages NORTHCOM to: 1. Develop and has in place a leadership strategy that will strengthen and foster necessary institutional and interpersonal relationships with state and local governments; and 2. Develop an instructional program to train key personnel how to lead effectively in the event of a disaster when they do not have command authority to dictate actions. A mission critical function of NORTHCOM, which was established in 2002 in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks is to bring the capabilities and the resources of the U.S. military to the assistance of the American people during a catastrophic disaster like war, a pandemic outbreak of diseases such Ebola, Zika, Sars, or influenza; major earthquakes, floods, and natural disasters; or terrorist attacks like those occurring on September 11, 2001 and at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. NORTHCOM leaders will be much more effective in saving lives, protecting assets, and enhancing resilience after the disaster has occurred if they are trained in the techniques of effective engagement with civilian leadership. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64 will help ensure that such training will be available. Mr. Chair, let me explain why this type of training—commonly referred to as ‘‘Resilience’’ training is very important. As stated in a highly influential journal article by Professor Leonard Marcus and his colleagues at Harvard’s National Public Leadership Initiative, ‘‘effective emergency preparedness and response requires leadership that can accomplish perceptive coordination and communication amongst diverse agencies and sectors.’’ (Leonard J. Marcus, Barry C. Dorn, and Joseph M. Henderson, MetaLeadership and National Emergency Preparedness: A Model to Build Government Connectivity, in Biosecurity And Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, And Science Volume 4, Number 2, 2006). The challenge is, as we learned from the 9/ 11 Commission, operating within their specified scope of authority, preparedness leaders in characteristic bureaucratic fashion often serve to bolster the profile and import of their own organization, thereby creating a silo effect that interferes with effective system wide planning and response. Resilience training seeks to equip preparedness leaders overcome this obstacle of ‘‘traditional silo thinking by teaching ‘‘metaleadership,’’ a new type of overarching leadership that intentionally connects the purposes and work of different organizations or organizational units. Metaleadership training enables leaders to provide guidance, direction, and momentum across organizational lines that develop into a shared course of action and a commonality of purpose among people and agencies that are doing what may appear to be very different work. Metaleaders have the skill and training to imaginatively and effectively leverage system assets, information, and capacities, which a particularly critical function for organizations with emergency preparedness responsibilities like responding to terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or pandemic outbreaks of infectious diseases like the Ebola and the Zika Virus, which may disproportionately affect persons in the Gulf Coast region, including my congressional district in Houston, Texas. As a senior and charter member of the Homeland Security Committee, and the Ranking Member of Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I have spent the better part of the last decade and a half working to craft policies and provide the resources, personnel, equipment, and funding needed to protect the security of our homeland and the American people. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64 will help ensure that those responsible for providing leadership in times of national emergency have the skills and training to prevent, mitigate, or recover from any major catastrophe, disaster, or tragedy that could befall our nation. I urge my colleagues to support En Bloc Amendment Number 64 and thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for including Jackson Lee Amendment Number 64 in this important measure. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG ). Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of two amendments I offered to this year’s National Defense Authorization Act. The amendment we are currently considering requires the DOD to report on the effectiveness of efforts to detect and monitor drug trafficking, specifically heroin and fentanyl, which is devastating my home State of Michigan and the entire country. The United States Southern Command is already doing important work to interdict drug runners and provide needed training to counternarcotic teams in Central America. My amendment would help quantify those efforts and see what more can be done to combat the heroin and fentanyl coming from this region. The second bipartisan amendment, which we will consider later today, requires DOD to verify it has sufficient access to Afghan accounts to guarantee effective audits. It is important that our military has access to financial information to protect U.S. funds from waste, fraud, and abuse, and ensure taxpayer resources are being spent effectively. I appreciate these amendments being included en bloc. I urge the support of my colleagues. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PITTS). Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, and I thank the chairman for including it in the next en bloc amendment, one that brings accountability to countries granting consent to Russian naval vessels calling into port. The aggressive posture and actions of the Russian Federation over the last few years has profoundly changed the global landscape. Russia has invaded Crimea, and currently still occupies that region. And Russia directly intervened militarily to shore up the Assad regime in Syria. The common thread that runs through these two interventions is that of warm water ports for the Russian navy. Crimea’s port in Sevastopol and Syria’s port of Tartus provide Russia with access to the warm waters of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, waters that are essential to Russia’s reach of aggression. Despite these aggressive actions, some countries are accommodating the Russian navy by allowing warships and submarines to call into their ports. Spain, although a cherished NATO ally, grants Russia access to the ports in its enclaves across the strategically important Strait of Gibraltar, where the United Kingdom has a Permanent Joint Operating Base that hosts U.S. ships. Furthermore, Greece and Malta have hosted Russian warships last year. The recent highprofile visits to Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua by Russia’s navy in recent years are also cause for concern. Mr. Chairman, governments across the globe should be isolating the Russian navy, not accommodating it. The Russian navy must constantly compete with geographic and strategic disadvantages of lacking access to warm blue waters of the world, but these disadvantages are forfeited when we lack a cohesive, unified effort to deny Russian vessels the ability to call into foreign ports. With the inclusion of this amendment, the Secretary of Defense will have to report to Congress and, thus, the American people on these instances. And I hope governments will think twice before offering up their ports to Putin’s navy. 
I urge support of the underlying bill as well. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois, (Mr. KINZINGER ). Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of amendment No. 74 in the en bloc, the Blumenauer Special Immigrant Visa amendment. I just want to speak to the program broadly and quickly. In Afghanistan, countless people put their lives on the line to serve as translators, basically being the middle person between American troops and the population we are trying to secure. Now, we promised them opportunity to come into the United States, but this process has been bogged down by bureaucracy. In fact, many have been in this process for years, and still in the first steps because of the bureaucracy on this. Unfortunately, today, actually, many Afghans are being killed every day by the Taliban, by ISIS, by al Qaeda, as a result of having worked with us. I want to thank Representative MOULTON and Representative B LUMENAUER for their work on this. This is a bipartisan issue, and one that I think we ought to take very seriously, keeping our commitment to those that help us, because there will be a war again some day, and we ought to be able to maintain the trust of the population we are there to secure. So I thank Mr. BLUMENAUER for putting this amendment in, and I thank the chairman for accepting it. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chair, I just think it is important to pause for a second and just think about what has just happened here. We have had a package of amendments that have been discussed, about an equal number of Republicans and Democrats. They have talked about very important issues and contributions that they have made, but if a Member then votes against final passage of the bill, the contributions are nullified. And I think it is just important to step back and just reiterate that all of us have provisions in this bill we agree with and disagree with. We place different values on different parts of the bill. But what has happened before is that Members have put aside some personal differences and still paid attention to the larger purpose of the bill, which is to support the men and women who serve our country. I hope that can happen again. However proud Members may be of the various provisions—and there are a lot of good provisions from both sides of the aisle—however proud they may be of those, if you don’t support the final bill, you are not accomplishing very much. I hope Members not only will support this en bloc package, but the final measure. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON ) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON ), the distinguished chair of our Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. I thank Chairman THORNBERRY for his leadership of peace through strength. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of amendment No. 69, a bipartisan amendment submitted with Ranking Member JIMLANGEVIN . As we reach to secure cyberspace and protect American families from new and emerging threats while encouraging innovation, we turn to the mutual benefit that publicprivate partnerships provide industry employees and Department of Defense personnel. We have seen the success of public private partnerships already in the IT field. This amendment will provide an opportunity to expand the benefits of the talent exchange to all components of the Department of Defense. The benefits to the military are clear. These partnerships provide the ability for fresh talent and concepts from outside the government sector. The private sector benefits as well by having the flexibility to gain a unique insight into how the government operates and engage in public service creating jobs. This bipartisan amendment promotes choice and opportunity that will benefit America’s workers and the defense community. Actually, the collaboration will benefit all American families. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. PETERS ). Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support two amendments that we have in the en bloc, the first on veteran hiring, a sense of Congress amendment. I rise to support a simple, but important effort that everyone in this Chamber can agree on. My amendment adds to this bill a sense of Congress that the Department of Defense should seek ways to maximize the number of veterans employed to build military construction projects. We are talking about good jobs here that can help our veterans make the transition to civilian life. In places like San Diego, we have already had a number of contractors employing highly skilled veterans to do this work. Many Members of this Chamber, on both sides of the aisle, champion the cause of hiring veterans. It is a policy we have incentivized the private sector to implement. I hope Members will support this amendment and join in showing that our military readiness can be built by those who know personally how important that readiness is when fighting for our freedom. I also want to speak on integrated missile defense. Mr. Chairman, Iran is a chief sponsor of international terrorism, and regularly threatens to obliterate Israel, our most important ally in the region. Those who supported agreement last year to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon understood that the JCPOA does not eliminate all of Iran’s threats to the United States and our partners in the Middle East. My amendment would take further steps to support our allies in the region and crack down on Iranian aggression. By vocalizing our support for working with Israel, the Gulf Cooperation Council, Jordan, and Egypt, to build an integrated missile defense system, we can build off of the successes of Israel’s existing missile defense network. I support the funding authorizations included in this year’s defense budget that will continue to support Israel’s missile defense program. Through a smart, targeted approach with our partners, we can continue to counter Iranian aggression and promote security. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this amendment package, which includes my amendment that ensures the safety of Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay. Home to the Atlantic ballistic missile submarine fleet, Kings Bay’s contributions to national security and to the nuclear deterrence capabilities of the U.S. fleet cannot be overstated. Just south of the installation is a lowuse general aviation airport called St. Mary’s Airport. The flight lines for their airport take civilian aircraft right over the base, raising a number of security concerns for the installation and for the weapons packages stored there. The dangers this poses to our nuclear stockpile is glaring, and this amendment is the first step in remedying that situation. This amendment would allow for the relocation of the St. Mary’s Airport service due to national security concerns posed to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay. This amendment has been a major priority for the Navy, and provides muchneeded changes to security concerns that have been persistent for a number of years. With this amendment, we can protect our nuclear submarines while providing new economic opportunities. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this amendment. MR. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ). Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, the Counter Iran Maritime Initiative. b1845 Iran is a serious risk to our national security. We must remain vigilant. We must protect our troops and our allies in the Middle East. This amendment will help stop illegal arms shipments from Iran to terrorists and protect our national security. My amendment will help keep American troops and our allies in the region, including Israel, safe. It authorizes our military to provide training, equipment, supplies, and military construction to nations along the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea. I am glad that there is broad, bipartisan consensus on the need for this amendment so that we can keep our troops safe and shore up the safety of our allies in the region. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROSKAM ). Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I want to tell you briefly about the Roskam amendment, which requires the President to provide Congress with a comprehensive report on Iran’s usage of commercial aircraft for military and terrorist activity. You say to yourself, Mr. Chairman: Why do we need this? Why is this important? Here is why. There is an important American company that is actively talking to the Iranians about the possibility of selling aircraft to them. Here is the problem with that. Everybody—everybody—agrees that the Iranians are the world’s largest state sponsor of terror; and therefore, it goes that if you give them something that is useful for military purposes—that is, aircraft—it is fungible, and it can be used for any purpose. The notion that the Iranians are going to use Boeing 
aircraft, for example, simply to transport people on vacation back and forth within Iran is profoundly naive. So what this amendment does is it puts the aircraft industry on notice and it puts the Iranians on notice that we are very interested in what they are doing with commercial aircraft, for what purpose. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, thanks again to the Armed Services Committee for making in order with the Rules Committee my three amendments that I have discussed today, two that I have already discussed, and this one that I will now bring to my colleagues’ attention. Today, walking out of the bush of Nigeria, it was determined that another Chibok girl has been found, discovered, or fled. The debate is whether or not the military forces of Nigeria helped her out. What we do know is that she was missing for 2 years, along with the 200plus girls that were taken. Fifty seven of them escaped in the immediacy of the hours, and six of them died, and this young woman has now come out 2 years later. Families are suffering, and Boko Haram has become one of the most vile and most vicious terrorist groups in the world. They are affiliated with ISIS, ISIL, but they have, if you will, no conformity to any protocol but killing. They have burned and killed Muslims and Christians alike, schools, homes, mosques, and churches. They have decapitated people. They have sent 8yearolds with bombs strapped to their bodies to kill. So my amendment is very straightforward. As I do this, let me say that a number of you have joined Congresswoman FREDERICA WILSON week after week wearing red to bring the girls home. She joined me, and we traveled together within weeks of the girls being taken in 2014. We confronted families, saw the pain, saw women with slashed throats that had healed, and we saw the leaders of government who then were somewhat, if you will, challenged about this task. So my amendment is one that deals with collaboration. It is a sense of Congress that provides for condemning the ongoing violence, expresses its support for the Nigerian people, and calls on the President to support Nigeria, Lake Chad Basin, and the international community to ensure accountability for crimes against humanity. It also asks for the initiative that we can engage the Department of Defense to assist the Government of Nigeria and countries in the Lake Chad Basin to develop capacities to deploy and destroy Boko Haram, obviously with the use of possible security forces, recognizing the Leahy amendment, but also with technology. Lives are still in the midst. Lives are still not being provided for. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. WOMACK ). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I am asking that we collaborate with the forces in Nigeria and the forces that have been part of the multinational task force to be able to have a strategy that deals with Boko Haram. This report can be critical in our efforts to empower and complement the efforts of the Multinational Joint Task Force as well as the commitment espoused at the recent Lake Chad Basin Regional Security Summit. So I would say that we have to recognize that we now have an individual. This young woman can give us the intelligence. I am concerned that these girls cannot be rescued now. This is partly asking President Buhari of Nigeria to join in with this information— this new information, the collaboration that, hopefully, as we move through this legislation, ongoing, right now—to rescue those girls and also support the idea of a special envoy to focus on the dangers in the Lake Chad Basin region. Let me compliment the African command. I met many of them when I was in Nigeria. I think it is an excellent command among all the other commands. They can be dynamic in their work. My resolution, my amendment, my sense of Congress, is to give us focus to bring back the girls and save these girls. We have the information. Bring back these girls. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY , Ranking Member ADAM SMITH and the Rules Committee for making in order and including Jackson Lee Amendment Number 99 and including it in En Bloc Amendment Number 8 to the ‘‘National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.’’ This is the third of 3 Jackson Lee amendments made in order by the House Rules Committee. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 99, calls for a report on efforts to combat Boko Haram in Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin. In the wake of the Rules Committee making this Amendment in order, I hold in my hand an article entitled ‘‘#BringBackOurGirls: Chibok Victim Found in Nigeria After 2 Years, Activist Says.’’ Two years after her captivity, we learn that a 19 year Chibok school girl named Ameina Nkeki was found Tuesday by the Civilian JTF vigilante group, which fights alongside the Nigerian military, in a village near the Sambisa Forest. Nkeki had a baby with her and told the militia members she had escaped from Boko Haram captivity. Indeed, just last night right before presenting before the Rules Committee on this Amendment, I met with a remarkable couple whose name I do not want to mention in order not to place their lives in danger. This couple, through their NGO, helped in the rescue, recovery and reintegration of over 10 Chibok girls. Because of their remarkable work, the girls are now able to continue to pursue their education. Unfortunately, the lives of these good Samaritans are now in jeopardy. I plan to do everything in my power to make sure that they and the persons they seek to empower are not harmed. This is why I have introduced the bipartisan measure H. Res. 528—Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the Victims of the Terror Protection Fund. And this is why I am working on a measure related to a Special Envoy on Boko Haram to the Lake Chad Basin. Support for this Amendment is timely as it is: 1. Strongly condemns the ongoing violence and the systematic gross human rights violations against the people of Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin carried out by Boko Haram; 2. Expresses support for the people of Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin who wish to live in a peaceful, economically prosperous, and democratic region; 3. Calls on the President to support Nigerian, Lake Chad Basin, and International Community efforts to ensure accountability for crimes against humanity committed by Boko Haram against the people of Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin, particularly young girls kidnapped from Chibok and other internally displaced persons affected by the actions of Boko Haram; Additionally, the Report calls that no later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General shall jointly submit to Congress a report on efforts to combat Boko Haram in Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin; Among others, the report shall also include the following elements: 1. A description of initiatives undertaken by the Department of Defense to assist the Government of Nigeria and countries in the Lake Chad Basin to develop capacities to deploy special forces to combat Boko Haram; 2. A description of United States’ activities to enhance the capacity of Nigeria and the countries in the Lake Chad Basin to investigate and prosecute human rights violations perpetrated against the people of Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin by Boko Haram, al Qaeda affiliates, and other terrorist organizations to promote respect for rule of law in Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin; 3. This report can be critical in our efforts to empower and complement the efforts of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) as well as the commitments espoused at the recent Lake Chad Basin Regional Security Summit. Mr. Chair, the U.S. war on terror has been waged for over a decade and the lesson is clear that our adversaries adapt very quickly because they are not constrained by geographic limitations. In the beginning it was only Al Qaeda—now the list includes Al Shabaab, Boko Haram which last year affiliated itself with ISIS/ISIL. Indeed, the data on persons affected by violent extremism is staggering. There are now more than 2.2 million Nigerians, and over 450,000 internallydisplaced persons (IDPs) and refugees in neighboring Cameroon, Chad and Niger. An estimated 4.2 million people in the Lake Chad Basin region face water and food security crises, including 800,000 in Nigeria’s 
northern Borno and Yobe states, Nigeria, where an estimated 184 children a day risk starvation without the immediate provision of emergency food assistance. Boko Haram continues to claim responsibility for atrocious and targeted violence ranging from burnings, kidnappings and killings of civilians and school children, such as the Chibok girls and a suicide bombing of the United Nations building in Abuja on August 26, 2011, that killed 21 people and injured dozens more, many of them aid workers supporting development projects across Nigeria. Half of persons displaced are children. I continue to commend the tireless efforts of the United Nations, United States officials, Regional Leaders, Civil Society Organizations, Community Groups and good Samaritans who have helped to support efforts of combatting Boko Haram and securing peace and security in Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin. Through this Amendment, we will establish our strong support and commitment for the protection and empowerment of the peoples of Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin who continue to face the threat of terrorism and violent extremism from Syria to Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin which covers Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and everywhere in between. As terrorist craft new strategies to threaten our homeland and harm our allies, it is in the U.S. security interest to double our counterterrorism efforts that identify, engage and empower people who are victimized by terrorist groups like Boko Haram, Al Shabaab, Al Qaeda and ISIS in Africa and Pakistan. For this reason, our military must adapt as quickly and as seamlessly as our adversaries in empowering our allies. Our message must be clear: the United States must expand its capacity to meet the terrorist threat where it emerges whether here in the homeland or abroad. The Nuremberg trials were essential in bringing to justice war criminals who committed acts of barbarism against civilians and military personnel during World War II, but a critical component of bringing war criminals to justice is the gathering and preservation of evidence. No person whether they travel to a battle field and later return to their native country or live in the region where they commit acts of terrors should rest well because they believe that no one will come to seek justice on behalf of the millions of lives destroyed. Our message must be clear: terrorism will not thrive on our watch. I ask for your support of this Amendment. 
INNIGERIA AFTER 2 YEARS , ACTIVIST SAYS (By Alexander Smith) The mass kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram from the Nigerian town of Chibok in April 2014 ignited an international outcry. The ensuing#BringBackOurGirls campaign was backed by the likes of Michelle Obama, while the U.S. and other countries sent military assistance. A handful of the kidnapped girls managed to escape early on but most were never found. Both Nigeria’s military and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign said Wednesday that one of the girls was now in safe hands—but gave conflicting information on the circumstances and her identity. Bukky Shonibare, one of the strategic team members of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, told NBC News that a 19yearold named Ameina Nkeki was found Tuesday by the Civilian JTF vigilante group, which fights alongside the Nigerian military, in a village near the Sambisa Forest. Nkeki had a baby with her and told the militia members she had escaped from Boko Haram captivity, Shonibare said, noting that the details of the girl’s escape were not immediately clear. This is a major, major breakthrough—this is the breakthrough we’ve been waiting for,’’ she said. Nkeki was taken to a military base in Damboa before being brought to her mother and her former highschool head teacher— both of whom positively confirmed her identify, according to Shonibare. The activists are ‘‘100 percent sure that this was one of the Chibok girls,’’ Shonibare added. Col. Sani Usman, a spokesman for the Nigerian Army, confirmed via WhatsApp message that one of the kidnapped Chibok girls had been recovered. He added in a statement that the girl was ‘‘rescued’’ by ‘‘our troops’’ near Damboa. It was not immediately clear if he was referring to his soldiers or the JTF. Usman’s statement also identified the girl as Falmata Mbalala—which did not correspond to the name given by Shonibare and the Bring Back Our Girls movement. Both Usman and Shonibare insisted they had the correct name for the young woman. NBC News was not immediately able to reconcile the differing accounts. While the Chibok Girls drew the most international attention, an estimated 2,000– plus women and girls have been abducted during Boko Haram’s violent campaign in Nigeria. Chibok may not even be the largest group to be kidnapped, with Human Rights Watch reporting that some 400 people were taken from the town of Damasak last year. The army gave details of a largescale operation against Boko Haram on Tuesday— the day the young woman was reportedly found—in Sambisa forest. The military said troops killed 15 Boko Haram fighters after coming under heavy fire in the area of Alafa. Troops also rescued 41 hostages—mainly women and children the military added in a statement. While Nigeria’s government has publicly touted an aggressive campaign to beat back Boko Haram, its failure to find the girls has drawn criticism. The news comes one day after the president’s wife, Aisha Buhari, presented ‘‘symbolic’’ checks to the mothers of the missing girls. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ). Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I very much appreciate Chairman THORNBERRY ’s acceptance of my amendments No. 100 and No. 125. The first recognizes the heroic efforts of the Pakistani doctor, Dr. Afridi, who helped us bring to justice Osama bin Laden, the prime mover in the massacre of 3,000 Americans on 9/11. Dr. Afridi is a courageous hero who enabled us to destroy this terrorist monster. He continues to languish in a Pakistani dungeon. This amendment was adopted by the House during consideration of past defense authorization acts but was stripped out during conference negotiations with the Senate. This is a shameful slap in the face to Dr. Afridi and other heroic friends around the world who put themselves at risk to stand up with us. Who will trust us? Who will stand with us if we betray our friends like this? It is time to end this irrational support that we give to Pakistan. It is only prudent that we increase—which is another one of the amendments I talk about today—certification required to release American military or economic aid to Pakistan. It behooves us not to finance Pakistan’s brutal suppression of ethnic groups and religious minorities like the Baloch and the Sindhis who are under attack today simply for seeking their political and religious freedom. I would ask my colleagues to join with me and to stand also with the people around the world. Send a message: If you stand with the United States, we will not forget you; we will stand with you. The people of the United States and the United States Congress stand tall with you and appreciate that you have risked your lives in a way that saved American lives. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and so I urge adoption of the en bloc amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON ). Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the bipartisan amendment with Congressman SETHMOULTON , No. 95, that would increase transparency and accountability—in addition to promoting peace through strength. In the past few months, the Tehran regime has repeatedly pushed the boundaries of the dangerous Iran deal and on United Nations Security Council resolutions. Since January, the Iranian regime has tested at least two intercontinental ballistic missiles, including one that had the writing ‘‘Israel should be wiped off the Earth,’’ written in Hebrew. These ICBMs have the ability to reach Israel and other allies in the Middle East from southeastern Europe to India. Sadly, the American people have not received satisfactory answers about why the actions by Iran are without repercussions. This amendment will require a quick and clear response: Why or why not did the ICBM tests violate international agreements, and what response the administration will take. This bipartisan amendment will hold the administration accountable and require a timely and thorough report on our response to hostile actions. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote in support. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HOLDING ). Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Chairman, let me begin by thanking both Chairman THORNBERRY and Chairman R OYCE for 
their assistance in helping to craft this amendment, and also let me thank Ranking Member ENGEL and Dr. Bera, who joined Chairman ROYCE as original cosponsors. Mr. Chairman, this amendment truly is a testament to the broad, bipartisan support for the U.S.India relationship here in Congress. Our agreement is straightforward. It seeks to promote greater defense trade and encourage additional military cooperation between the United States and India. I believe that by requiring our government to take actions such as strengthening the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative and encouraging combined military planning with India, we can make certain that the U.S. India defense relationship endures. Mr. Chairman, given the dynamic nature of the IndoPacific region and its importance to our own national security and future economic growth, now is the time to build on recent successes and propel the U.S.India strategic partnership forward. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Amendment Number 70. I want to thank Representative CONNOLLY  for his good work on this amendment. DOD is one of the last agencies that implement most of our foreign aid to come up with an evaluation policy. USAID has one. The State Department has one. The Millennium Challenge Corporation has one. But not DOD. Evaluations do not just trace how money is spent. Evaluations help us figure out if the money is achieving its intended outcome. Is it working? Is it making a lasting difference? The good news is that the DOD is working on an evaluation policy now. But just because they are working on it doesn’t mean it will get done. We all know what bureaucrats can do if given the time. Amendment Number 70 makes it clear that Congress supports a strong evaluation policy. We should be doing rigorous evaluation on all our foreign aid because Americans deserve to know how their money is being spent. And that’s just the way it is. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia). The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON ) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have no speakers here at this point, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ). Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking the chairman and the ranking member for including my amendment in the en bloc amendment. This amendment will require a report detailing plans to inform American manufacturers about opportunities to equip foreign militaries receiving U.S. assistance. Each year, our country provides billions of dollars to our international partners in military assistance to foster security relationships and to ensure our national security. This is a worthwhile investment necessary to preserve American interests abroad, but we need to make sure that American businesses, particularly American manufacturers, are given ample opportunity to compete for these taxpayerfunded contracts. My amendment helps ensure American companies are aware of what opportunities are available to them and to their employees. By ensuring more American companies are aware of these opportunities, we can support job growth among American companies, which in turn will support the overall health of our economy and our Nation’s defense industrial base. Increased competition also helps ensure that our international partners are provided with the highest quality products available, thus helping to better secure their own better future and protecting our own national security interests. b1900 The amendment simply ensures that American businesses have the opportunity to compete for these contracts so that as we are building up and securing our national security interests around the world, we are also strengthening American jobs, American manufacturing, and growing our economy. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
Mr. Chairman, I would like to speak about a bipartisan amendment that passed the full Committee on Armed Services, and also had to go through the Foreign Affairs Committee to be approved. It calls on the administration to report to Congress on a comprehensive political and military strategy for our fight against ISIS in the Middle East. Mr. Chairman, we are sending troops back into Iraq today, just 7 or 8 years after we pulled the last troops out. Many of the battles they are fighting have familiar names—Fallujah, Ramadi, and Haditha—battles that we fought and won a long time ago. But we did not have a strategy to ensure the peace. Mr. Clausewitz taught us about 200 years ago that war is an extension of politics. We have to have a political endgame for our fight in Iraq, or we will find ourselves continually going back there again and again. When Iraqi politics fail, a new terrorist group sweeps in; and American troops are left to pick up the mess. If you think about what happened when ISIS swept in from Syria and entered western, then northern Iraq, the Iraqi army wasn’t just defeated by ISIS. The Iraqi Army put their weapons down and went home because they had lost faith in the Iraqi Government. We must have a longterm, comprehensive political and military strategy. We owe it to the troops to ensure that their efforts will not be in vain. I am proud of the bipartisan support for this amendment, both on the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I am especially proud that the chairman worked with me to get it adopted. I am glad that it is included in the bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendments en bloc. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, on Sept. 22, 2011, Adm. Mike Mullen, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Haqqani Network was behind the 2011 attack on our embassy and a truck bombing that wounded more than 70 U.S. and NATO troops. Adm. Mullen went on to say, ‘‘The Haqqani Network acts as a veritable arm of Pakistan’s InterServices Intelligence agency.’’ Last year, the Haqqani Network and the Taliban killed more Afghan civilians and troops than in any other year since the Taliban was toppled in 2001. My amendment adds a fourth condition on the aid to Pakistan. This new condition requires the Administration to certify that Pakistan has shown progress in arresting and prosecuting Haqqani Network senior leaders and midlevel operatives. This forces Pakistan to make a choice: either go after the Haqqani Network in a public way that it has never done before or lose hundreds of millions of dollars of US aid. And that’s just the way it is. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. T HORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this en bloc package. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to say quickly, in the en bloc package, there was an amendment that was put in there having to do with our development of a new rocket engine and a new launch vehicle. I just want to thank publicly Mr. ROGERS , the subcommittee chairman, who worked very closely with me on developing this language. We have got a lot of great things going on out there. There are a lot of American companies that are working hard to develop a new engine so we will no longer have to rely on the Russian engine. 
The amendment that was included allows those companies to use some of the money that the Air Force is providing for the development of a new engine, to use it also to develop a launch vehicle to go along with that engine. We have got, like I said, great companies like Blue Origin in my district, Aerojet Rocketdyne—a lot of folks working on new vehicles—SpaceX as well. This amendment allows the money that the Air Force is providing not just to go to the engine but for some of it to go to a launch vehicle as well. I think this will greatly reduce the cost of our launch costs for the Air Force, which has been a significantly problem recently. So I thank Chairman ROGERS for allowing us to offer that amendment and for working with me on it. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I want to thank my good friend Mr. ROGERS from Ala bama for his work with me on this amendment. The Intermediate Nuclear Forces or ‘‘INF’’ Treaty places limits on groundlaunched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. In 2008, the Russians tested a missile within this prohibited range and were caught red handed. But it took 3 years for the Administration to report any concern about Russian compliance to Congress. It took a full 6 years for the State Department to officially find the Russians in violation. After eight years, there have been no serious consequences for Russia’s violation of the treaty. My amendment would prohibit government contracts with entities that have contributed to Russia’s violation of the INF Treaty. Russia is not our ally, is not our friend, and we cannot take it at its word. Czar Putin is determined to restore Russia to its glory days. We must respond with strength. And that’s just the way it is. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes. I just want to thank the chairman, and I want to thank the staff and the Members for putting together this piece of legislation. It is always a long process but I think a good process, in which we pull together a variety of different amendments. And, as the chairman has said many times, it is a bottomup process. It starts with the Members offering their ideas in putting together the bill. I think, once again, we have done that process fairly well. The problem and the challenge, as I had mentioned earlier, comes from the budget number and the problems that we face. I know the chairman has said earlier, you know, we can’t solve all these problems; so let’s help the troops now. The problem is, it is like you have got a credit card and you say: wow, off in the future there may be problems, but let’s just buy whatever we want, put it on the credit card now, and that will help everybody in the long run. But it doesn’t. It is not helping the troops to pass a bill that has 6 months worth of funding for a yearlong’s worth of overseas contingency operations, and it is not helping them to hope that the Budget Control Act goes away. The chairman mentioned that last year we had this same problem and we did wind up getting an agreement, and that is true. Part of the reason we got that agreement, however, is because we, on this side, insisted on that agreement and did not merely accept the defense bill that was offered without resolving those issues. And, once again, we have to insist upon that: that it does not make sense to have the Budget Control Act and continue to insist on spending more money on defense. Essentially, what the majority party wants is they want a Ferrari, but they only want to provide the money to pay for a Honda, and they keep hoping that somehow that extra money is going to appear. That hurts our troops. We have heard all of these stories about the terrible state of our readiness. Consistently, over the course of the last 4 years, the bill that has been passed in the House and the Senate has put less money into readiness than the President asked for. Why? Because they wanted to pay for a wide variety of programs, including the A–10, an important plane, we have heard. I am not saying that there is anything in this bill that you can’t make an argument for as being important. The problem is it doesn’t add up, and it leaves us in a position where the military is continually having to stare at a cliff, knowing that the money is not going to be there and trying to figure out how to plan through that. I want a more sensible process. We should fully fund the OCO and fund the base budget at the level that it is funded at. If we don’t find that sufficient— and I know just about every member of the Armed Services Committee on the Republican side does not find that number sufficient—then provide the money. This isn’t a matter of saying, well, what has that got to do with this? That has got everything to do with this. If you are not willing to provide the money to pay for these programs, starting them, or telling the military that they have to have a fixed number of members of the Army and the Marine Corps, and then knowing that the money isn’t going to be there a year from now, is not helpful. We have to bring some sanity to the budget process. This bill, artfully, just imagines that 6 months from now, we will magically make up the extra money in OCO. That is a big problem that, once again, we need to confront. But just like last year, I am confident that we will come together in conference, we will talk about this, we will work it out, and we will come up with a bill. But I hope that we will start understanding the money a little bit better and making this actually work so that the bill we pass is helping the men and women of the armed services who serve us so well. So it is not about whether or not you support the troops or not; it is a matter of whether or not you think this bill is the best way to do it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ). Mr. LIPINSKI. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chair, I rise to thank Ranking Member SMITH and Chairman T HORN BERRY for an amendment that was included in one of the prior en bloc groups of amendments. The amendment that I joined Mr. POMPEO in offering requires the DOD to report to Congress on the cooperation between Iran and the Russian Federation and the extent to which that cooperation affects our national security interests. Even before the Iran nuclear deal, we watched Tehran and Moscow become 
closer partners, as Russia announced it would lift its ban on selling advanced missiles to Iran and began military cooperation with Iran in Syria to prop up the Assad government. This year, Russia and Iran have worked together to undermine U.N. Security Council ballistic missile resolutions and announced an $800 million missile defense contract. It is imperative that we fully understand the impact of this alliance on our national security interests because both nations continue to be hostile towards the U.S. and our allies. This amendment will help do just that. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington has 5 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 10 minutes remaining. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time just to, again, emphasize that this is a very, very important piece of legislation, and it is important that we get it right. This is one step in the process. At the committee level, we worked together and got the bill out. At the time, I raised the concerns that I am raising now. I voted in favor of the bill, hoping that we would make improvements on the floor. Instead, we went the other way. We had one amendment that was supported in the committee that the Rules Committee stripped without allowing a vote, a rule that would have women sign up for the Selective Service, an amendment that was supported by my caucus. The Rules Committee didn’t even allow us to have a vote on that. They just stripped it. On another one, on the amendment that we didn’t like that was in the bill, they went the other way and didn’t allow a vote on that to keep it in place. That is not a fair process. I will say that there are ultimately two objections to this bill and preface it with one thing. I think the chairman in committee has been very, very fair, has worked very well with Democrats, and I do appreciate that. The Rules Committee, on the other hand, has been the exact opposite. They have been completely and totally partisan in a way that is not in keeping with the tradition of the Armed Services Committee and the way we do business in a fair way: to allow members to have votes on amendments that are important to them. They didn’t do that, and that made this bill even worse than it was when it came out of committee. I hope the Rules Committee will do better in the future. I don’t think that is likely, but that is certainly one issue. The second issue is, again, the funding. If we are really going to provide for the troops, we have to realistically look at the next 10 years and begin building a national security strategy that can support them, based on the budget that we are prepared to provide. There is no new revenue coming. Even if the budget caps go away, typically the way the budget caps go away is they are extended for another year, and basically we use 10year money to pay for 1 year’s worth of goods and services, which only puts us in a further hole. Lastly, I will point out those other portions of the budget. The defense budget has grown as a proportion of the discretionary budget. It is now over 55 percent of it. b1915 Essentially, what the Republican party is trying to do is to spend all of the money on defense, and then there will be nothing left over for the other priorities. Those other priorities do matter, and it is wrong to ask: Well, what has the defense bill got to do with our crumbling infrastructure? What has the defense bill got to do with long lines at the TSA or at Homeland Security or at the Department of Justice or anywhere else? It has got everything to do with it in a year when we don’t have a budget resolution, so we don’t have set amounts of money for each bill. Every dollar that we put into this is taking out of the overall allocation and is taking from all of those other priorities. Yes, national security is incredibly important, but I think infrastructure is important as well. I think the Department of Homeland Security is important, as is the Department of Justice, as is the Department of the Treasury, which tries to stop terrorists from raising money. What we are doing here is refusing to pass a budget resolution, to put the numbers in place, and then spending all of the money on defense first—sorry. It is an exaggeration as it is not all of the money but more of the money than was agreed upon—and then what is left over goes to everything else. That is not a responsible way to budget. That is not a responsible way to provide for this country. For those reasons, I am going to oppose the bill. I hope, again, as we did last year, we will work this out in conference, come up with a more sensible approach, and have a bill that we can all support. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. I appreciate the gentleman’s comments that he believes I have tried to be fair with Members of the minority in constructing this bill. I have tried to be; although I have to say, Mr. Chair, if one leans over backwards to make sure Members of the minority contribute to the bill even to the point at which some of the provisions Members of the minority are interested in are opposed by Members of the majority—if you still try to do that and yet Members of the minority vote against the bill—I have got to ask myself: Why? Why do I do such things? Just in the past hour and a half, maybe 2 hours, we have spent time with basically equal numbers of Members on the Republican and Democratic sides in their talking about their amendments—discussing very important issues—but none of those issues happen without having the bill pass. Yet I get the feeling that, at least for some Members, there may always be that next bridge that we have got to get to before they can support the bill. Mr. Chair, the ranking member described my view really better than I did. He said that my opinion is we have to help the troops now, and that is exactly my view. Just think about what the alternative is: no, we are not going to help the troops now because we are not sure where the money is going to come from next year or 5 years from now or the next 10 years. In the meantime, while we are not sure about all of that, we are going to continue to let class A mishaps grow. What that means is more people stand in danger of losing their lives, but we are going to go ahead and allow that to happen because we don’t know where the money is going to come from or we object to this provision, et cetera. It is absolutely true. My view is to help the troops now because now is the time that they are cannibalizing the aircraft, not getting the minimum number of training hours, seeing class A mishaps go up, have only nine B–1s that are available to fly. The statistics go on and on. Mr. Chair, the other point I would make is that readiness is not just a question of funding the operation and maintenance accounts. That is really what I have thought most of the time I have been here. What I have come to understand, however, is that you can cut end strength, you can cut the number of people in the military, down to the point that you can never get ready. I think that is part of what the Air Force is facing now. They have cut the number of people. We are 700 pilots short, and we are 4,000 maintainers short. It doesn’t matter how much money you are putting toward them when you have only so many mechanics. The average experience of a mechanic in the military has dropped significantly just in the last 2 years. People are part of fixing readiness, and procurement is part of fixing readiness. How many times do I have to explain that you can’t fix a 1979 Black Hawk helicopter? You have to get a new one. You can’t replace an early 1980s F/A–18 model. There are no more parts for it. You have to replace it with an F–35. That is what we do in this bill. Mr. Chair, I continue to be perplexed at how the funding approach that was good and passed by a Democratic majority in 2008, between Bush and Obama, is somehow unacceptable between Obama and whoever is next. None of us knows who is next. We don’t 
know who is going to be the next President. To fully fund the readiness requirements for the whole year so as to deal with those problems of maintenance and training and people and procurement, to fully fund those and then have the new President take a fresh look at the deployments, seems to make sense. It sure made sense in 2008. I think it makes sense in 2016 as well. Mr. Chair, the Rules Committee made in order 180 amendments for consideration here on the floor. I understand not everybody’s amendment was made in order, but it is a little hard for me to understand how people could complain about the process when 180 amendments were made in order, many by Democrats, many by Republicans. I realize not every amendment was made in order, but, surely, a lot of topics have been discussed. Finally, Mr. Chair, I just have to take a moment and read one of the amendments that some Members have complained about that was placed into the bill in committee by Mr. RUSSELL  of Oklahoma. It reads: 
That is it. It is one paragraph. That is it. I don’t know who is opposed today to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. That is the reason I just get this feeling, personally, that there may be those who are just looking for some excuse to vote against the bill. The price of that is that readiness problems— class A mishaps—will continue on the trend they are on. Absolutely. Help the troops now. I can’t predict the future. I don’t know who is going to be elected President. I don’t know who is going to be elected to Congress. I don’t know what the budget will be in future times, but I know what I can do now. I know what I can do today. I can help the troops now. You bet. Sign me up. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 119 OFFERED BY MS . BORDALLO  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 119 printed in House Report 114–571. Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of the bill, add the following: TITLE LXXIII—GUAM WORLD WAR II LOYALTY RECOGNITION ACT 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 735, the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. BORDALLO ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Guam. Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Chair, I appreciate this amendment being made in order. It is time that we bring resolution to the people of Guam and all U.S. citizens who have suffered under enemy occupation during World War II. We found an offset to address its costs, which was one of the problems. I look forward to adopting this amendment and working with the Senate during conference. Again, I thank very much Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH and Chairman B ISHOP for their support of this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. WOMACK ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the many contributions the gentlewoman from Guam has made to our committee as the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Readiness, among other capacities. I think this is a good amendment, and I certainly hope our Members will support it. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. BORDALLO ). The amendment was agreed to. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia) having assumed the chair, Mr. WOMACK , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4909) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
ZIKA RESPONSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 736, I call up the bill (H.R. 5243) making appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, to strengthen public health activities in response to the Zika virus, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.

GENERAL PROVISIONS—THIS TITLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the consideration of H.R. 5243 and that I may include tabular material on the same. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise to present H.R. 5243, the Zika Response Appropriations Act. The Zika virus clearly poses a great threat to public health not only in the United States, but around the globe. It has become increasingly important that we, the Congress, act to protect our most vulnerable, particularly infants and pregnant women, from the risks of this disease. Our response must be urgent, direct, and strategic, targeted at preventing the further spread of this disease. The bill before you today provides $622.1 million to fight this dangerous virus. It prioritizes critical activities that must begin immediately, such as vaccine development and mosquito control. I was glad to see that the administration took our committee’s advice and redirected $589 million from less urgent needs to fund immediate actions to respond to Zika. This was and is the most immediate source of funding in the fight against Zika. b1930 But given the severity of the crisis, it is clear we must do more. The funds within this legislation will continue the Department of Health and Human Services’ and the Department of 
State’s critical efforts to fight the spread of this harmful disease for the rest of the fiscal year of 2016 and beyond. This means that, in total, Congress will have provided over $1.2 billion so far with this bill to respond to Zika in fiscal year 2016. I am proud that we have provided this funding in a responsible way. The funding in this bill is entirely offset through rescissions of unobligated infectious disease funds that included Ebola or from whatever leftover administrative balances there exists within HHS. Importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill takes a thoughtful, strategic approach to how to address the fight against Zika, directing funds where they are needed most urgently and where they can do the most good. This legislation provides $170 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to support mosquito control efforts, disease surveillance, international response, and public education. These funds can also be used for emergency preparedness grants to State, local, and territorial health departments that may confront reductions to their existing budgets. Within this total, up to $50 million is available for health programs targeted at prenatal care, delivery and postpartum care, newborn health assessments, and care for infants with special needs related to Zika. These funds are focused on States and territories currently experiencing Zika outbreaks. The National Institutes of Health received $230 million to help expedite the research and development of Zika vaccines, making sure these treatments can be made available to the public quickly and safely. For the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, BARDA, $103 million will be directed to development and production activities for Zika, including for new rapid diagnostic tests and vaccines. Our response to Zika must also include cutting off the virus at its source, since mosquitos know no boundaries. For the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, the bill provides a total of $119.1 million, $100 million of this total directed to mosquito control efforts. This also includes funding for public education efforts aimed at reducing mosquito exposure. The remaining $19.1 million is provided to help manage and oversee these programs. As I noted earlier, we have taken the fiscally responsible step of offsetting every dollar spent in this bill. To go even further and to ensure accountability, transparency, and effective use of tax dollars, we have included strong oversight requirements. For instance, the Department of Health and Human Services, the State Department, and USAID are required to submit spending plans to Congress before any funds can be spent. And we have directed $2 million total for GAO and Inspector General oversight. The bill also reiterates current, strong protections against the use of any funds for abortions. The White House’s request earlier on made none of these oversight efforts, allowing broad transfer authorities across the entire Federal Government and creating what I call ‘‘slush’’ funds with virtually no limits. This bill guarantees that every cent goes to address the problem at hand: fighting the Zika virus. This funding is critical to stop the spread of Zika and to protect our most vulnerable people, both here at home and abroad. Every child deserves the chance at a full and healthy life, and every mother deserves to see her child survive. This measure will help make this happen for sure in an effective, efficient, and responsible way. Mr. Speaker, with this bill and its passage, the Congress will have seen to $1.2 billion just over the next 4
1⁄2 months, the balance of this fiscal year. The administration request of $1.9 billion was for several years. We, in this bill and the earlier transfer of funds from the Ebola infectious disease fund, see to it that we put money on the problem now, not waiting for further action. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5243. I reserve the balance of my time.

Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In February, the World Health Organization declared Zika a public health emergency of international concern, and the President called for $1.9 billion to respond to the impending crisis to prevent the spread in our very own communities. According to the National Governors Association, the Nation is on the threshold of a public health emergency. In a separate letter, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities, National Association of County and City Health Officials wrote to urge Congress to provide emergency supplemental money for Zika, rather than repurpose money from other highpriority programs. I include in the RECORD both letters. 
MAY10, 2016. Hon. THADCOCHRAN , Chairman, Senate Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. ROYBLUNT , Chairman, Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services & Education, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. BARBARA MIKULSKI , Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. PATTY MURRAY , Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services & Education, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMEN COCHRAN AND BLUNT AND  SENATORS MIKULSKI AND MURRAY : The U.S. Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities and National Association of County and City Health Officials call on you to advance legislation without delay to respond to the Zika virus. Our associations serve people in cities and counties where the burden of Zika will be felt directly. Emerging infectious disease threats like Zika require ongoing vigilance, but the particular risks from this virus require immediate, additional investments. We urge Congress to provide emergency supplemental funding for Zika rather than repurpose money from other high priority programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other federal agencies that ensure our health security and public health preparedness. CDC has already diverted more than $44 million from public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) to fund the Zika response. Backfilling this PHEP funding is critical to making sure that communities are ready to respond to all threats. Although not a new virus, 2015 marked the first widespread transmission of the Zika virus in the Americas. The virus is spread primarily by mosquitoes and usually causes only mild illness or no symptoms. However, in Brazil and other countries affected by Zika there has already been a steep increase in birth defects in infants born to mothers who were infected during pregnancy. In January 2016, CDC warned women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant to avoid travel to regions and countries with widespread Zika transmission or to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes there. With the weather getting warmer and increased numbers of mosquitos in many places in the United States, Congress can no longer wait to act. In local communities, health departments are engaged in educating the public and health care providers about Zika, conducting prevention activities through mosquito eradication and screening travelers from countries where the outbreak has surfaced. Our associations urge you to act quickly in providing emergency supplemental funding to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to support the local response to Zika with increased virus readiness and response capacity focused on areas with ongoing Zika transmission; enhanced laboratory, epidemiology and surveillance capacity in atrisk areas and surge capacity through rapid response teams to limit potential clusters of Zika virus in the United States. Thank you for your consideration of this request. For further information, please contact: Crystal Swann, Assistant Executive Director, at cswann@usmayors.org; Carolyn Coleman, Esq., Senior Executive and Director of Federal Advocacy at coleman@nlc.org. or Eli Briggs, Senior Government Affairs Director at ebriggs@naccho.org. Sincerely, TOMCOCHRAN , CEO & Executive Director, United States Conference of Mayors. CLARENCE E. A NTHONY , CEO & Executive Director, National League of Cities. LAMARHASBROUCK , MD, MPH, Executive Director, National Association of County and City Health Officials. MAY9, 2016. GOVERNORS ASK FOR SWIFT ACTION ON ZIKA FUNDING  WASHINGTON .—The National Governors Association (NGA) today released the following statement on congressional funding of the Zika virus: ‘‘The nation is on the threshold of a public health emergency as it faces the likely spread of the Zika virus. As with all such emergencies, advance planning and preparation is essential to prevent injury and death. A key component to averting infectious disease outbreaks is to prevent incidence levels from reaching a critical ‘tipping point,’ after which there is a rapid increase in the number of infections. This is particularly true of the Zika virus—the most important way we can protect people is to minimize infections and prevent a concentration of cases, which can lead to outbreak and children born with severe, lifelong birth defects such as microcephaly. As Congress returns from recess today, the nation’s governors urge the Administration and Congress to work together to reach agreement on the appropriate funding levels needed to prepare for and combat the Zika virus. We also ask they act as expeditiously as possible to ensure those funds are available to states, territories and the public at large.’’ 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, as summer approaches, the CDC confirmed 1,204 cases, including more than 100 pregnant women in the continental United States, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories as of May 11. So far all of the continental U.S. cases are associated with travel, but experts expect the first locally transmitted cases in a matter of weeks. The scientific community has concluded, after careful review, that Zika can cause microcephaly resulting in miscarriage and other severe fetal brain defects, as well as adult neurological disorders. When the House Republican leadership failed to act, the administration was forced to redirect $589 million, mostly from emergency Ebola balances, to fund immediate efforts to respond to Zika. According to Dr. Fauci at the National Institutes of Health, the redirected funds allowed the United States to start work. But we cannot finish what we need to do. The Republican bill does not allow us to finish the job either. It provides $622 million, less than a third of what is needed. The administration requested $743 million for State and local efforts to reduce mosquito populations as well as conduct public health studies of the Zika virus. The House Republican bill provides $120 million, plus an additional $50 million for block grants. By providing such a small fraction of the requested amount, we would be drastically underfunding State and local public health departments, hampering efforts to expand mosquito control and mitigation, and unnecessarily placing millions of pregnant women at risk. In addition, the administration requested $246 million in direct assistance for Puerto Rico, an epicenter in the Zika outbreak. The House Republican bill does not provide this direct funding for Puerto Rico, again, placing tens of thousands of pregnant women at risk. In the past, Congress has come together in a bipartisan manner to address and respond to emergencies from the Ebola and H1N1 viruses to natural disasters and agreed that these emergencies should not be offset. When a tornado strikes, we don’t steal money from the unfinished relief efforts for the last hurricane; yet House Republicans would take more Ebola funding, risking that it could reemerge, and give less than it needed to stop the spread of Zika in communities throughout the United States. Without full funding to replenish Ebola accounts, we won’t complete commitments to fortify international public health systems or have health contingency funds in place to respond to outbreaks of either disease or any other unanticipated public health crisis. That is why I introduced H.R. 5044, which would provide the full emergency supplemental to combat Zika and prevent the virus from spreading without risking investments in our public health infrastructure. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill we should be debating today, not the House Republican Zika, which is a day late and a dollar short. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), the chairman of the House Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. He is also a member of the House Rules Committee. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for yielding me the time I need. 
I want to begin my remarks by complimenting our chairman. Quite frankly, I don’t know anybody that has spent more time on this issue and devoted more thought to it than Chairman ROGERS . He took a codel down to the region. Our first stop was in Peru where we stopped at a Naval research station. It has been there for many decades. Their purpose normally is to look at tropical diseases, which they are doing, but they have now switched their efforts primarily to Zika, just as they should. So we were on top of this early. Then we went to Brazil and, under Chairman ROGERS ’ leadership, we had the opportunity to meet with the Centers for Disease Control’s people on the ground and also talk to our colleagues in the Brazilian Government about the appropriate ways to move forward on this that were done thoughtfully and responsibly. What Chairman ROGERS has laid before us is essentially a threepart plan that funds all the administration wants to do. The first is the initial $600 million that would not be available had the chairman not directed the administration to immediately use available funds. Now, when we passed money for Ebola, if you go back and look at the legislation, it was not only for Ebola. It was for Ebola and other infectious diseases. Frankly, the money there may well be more than we need for Ebola. But in any case, it is going to be spread over many years. So because the chairman pushed hard on this, we actually have $600 million available immediately, and the message to the administration was to start spending what you need to do now. The second piece of this threepart plan is the bill that is in front of us today. It is over $600 million. As the chairman pointed out, this is two thirds essentially of what the administration has requested and more than they requested in this fiscal year. Remember, this bill is only for this fiscal year. So the next third will come in the bills that are presented by my subcommittee and by my good friend, Chairman GRANGER ’s subcommittee, the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs. So if you actually look at the total amount provided, it is about what the administration has requested, and it arrives in a timely manner to meet all their needs. The one single critical difference is that what the chairman has provided is fully offset. Now, my very good friend from New York mentioned that, in emergencies, we don’t normally offset. The reality is we do offset when we can. She mentioned tornados. Let me give you an example. In 2013, my home community of Moore, Oklahoma, was hit by tornados. There was a question of whether or not there would be money available. There was, in fact, money available. That money was in the FEMA disaster relief fund. There was more than enough money in there that had already been appropriated to use. That is what is true here again today. We have more than enough money in the Ebola funds that we appropriated 2 years ago to actually take care of the initial phase of this action and any other problem that comes up. This is now additional money on top of that. b1945 So the wise thing, it seems to me, is to actually use the funds that you have set aside for these purposes. First, $600 million from the Ebola money and infectious diseases. The next would be this. The next tranche of money would be in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education bill that I am privileged to be chairman of and will bring to this floor in June, and my friend Ms. GRANGER will also bring forward additional money in her bill to help with the efforts overseas. So the simple fact is this really isn’t an argument about Zika. It is an argument about whether you will pay to take care of the needs that we have. We have more than enough funds in what we have already voted, what we will vote for here, and what we will provide next year to actually take care of the problem. The chairman has made an additional commitment that if we need to backfill that money, if we are short for some other infectious disease that none of us can anticipate or for Ebola, we will take care of that during the regular appropriations process. So this is, essentially, I think honestly, a solution in search of a problem. The money is here. We have the money. We are appropriating the money. The administration has not failed to do one thing it wanted to do because of lack of money. The money is available. The real question here is: Are you going to offset that money and make sure that we don’t add another $1.9 billion to the national debt by using the money you have got available or are you just going to simply charge it to the national credit card? That is what my friends on the other side—with the best of intentions, I am sure—are actually advocating. Let’s just put the country $1.9 billion deeper in debt as opposed to using available resources, appropriating additional resources and offsetting them, and then using the normal appropriations process to go forward. I want to commend the chairman, honestly, for being thoughtful, careful, and prudent with taxpayer dollars. That is what this is all about. If we work together, we can provide all the money that the administration needs without increasing the national debt. If we do what our friends on the other side suggest, we will simply add $1.9 billion more, and at the end of the day, we won’t be in any different place than we will be under the chairman’s plan. Mr. Speaker, I would recommend that we pass this legislation, build on top of the $600 million we have already provided, and allow Ms. GRANGER and myself to bring forward to the full Congress the additional funds that they need in the normal appropriations process. Remember, this $1.9 billion isn’t needed today. It is needed over a multiyear period. We are providing it over a number of years, and we are doing it without adding to the national debt. It seems to me pretty clear. Actually, both sides have the same aim here. We want to take care of an urgent healthcare problem. The difference is the chairman has presented— first, in the $600 million we have already deployed, and in the $622 million that we will deploy in this bill, and the additional money that will come in the normal appropriations process—everything we need. In some sense, this argument is an argument we don’t need to have unless your aim is simply to have $1.9 billion more. I want to thank the chairman for what he has done. I look forward to continuing to work with my friends on the other side of the aisle. At the end of the day, we will have more than enough money. The difference will be we will not have added one cent to the national debt. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE), a distinguished member of the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on the Budget. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman LOWEY for yielding and also for her very steady and effective leadership on our committee. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the LaborHHS and State and Foreign Operations subcommittees, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5243, which is the socalled Zika funding bill. Earlier this week, the majority finally decided to act on Zika, yet their proposal shows just how unwilling they are to take this crisis seriously. Even now, they have offered barely onethird of the resources needed to fight Zika. Not only are my Republican colleagues’ efforts 3 months late, they are also woefully inadequate to address this major public health emergency. If that weren’t enough, Republicans have once again included poison pills that have no place in this legislation. While we are trying to work to protect our Nation’s most vulnerable, including pregnant women and their children, the majority is putting politics over public health, and that is just wrong. The Zika outbreak has already spread to more than 26 countries, including the United States and our territories. Sadly, there have been two Zika deaths in Puerto Rico. This summer, Americans living in Southern States face tremendous risks from the virus. Not only does this bill underfund our Zika response, it raids vital funding for other dangerous infectious diseases, such as Ebola. Quite frankly, we should 
not roll the dice should another Ebola outbreak occur. We know how this appropriations process works. I don’t want to chance that. We appropriated Ebola funding for Ebola. This is not the time to rob Peter to pay Paul. The experts are clear. We need the full $1.9 billion request, emergency request, without offsets. Now, we have seen war funding emergency supplementals fly through this House without many questions raised. This is an emergency, and we need to treat it as such. Finally, this bill includes Hydelike language, a dangerous rider that denies access to abortion coverage for women if they are poor, a veteran, in the military, or a Federal Government employee. Let me be clear, politicians have no business denying a woman health coverage based on her income, her employer, or her ZIP Code. Once again, the majority has decided to put their extremist ideology over public health. Why in the world would they put this rider in this Zika funding bill? It doesn’t make any sense, and it is wrong. It has been 3 months since the World Health Organization declared the Zika virus as a public health emergency. That was February. Three months since the President requested emergency funds, the time to act is now. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote to reject this bill and let’s instead pass a bill with adequate funding and without ideological antiwomen riders. The American people can’t afford to wait much longer for Congress to get this right. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations for State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5243, the Zika Response Appropriations Act. This bill provides $622 million to respond to the Zika virus both at home and abroad. As chair of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, I want to highlight funds in the bill for the international response efforts to stop the virus at its source. This includes mosquito control activities to stop the spread of the virus, public information campaigns to get the message out about Zika, and evacuations of Americans when needed. These efforts will build on work that has already begun. After my colleagues and I urged swift action, the administration decided to redirect $589 million of funds already in hand to respond to the Zika virus. This funding bill is the next step. It provides our best estimate of what is needed for the remaining months of this fiscal year. As we draft the fiscal year 2017 appropriations bills and information about the threat of Zika becomes more clear, we will address at that time any additional requirements through our regular process. Unlike the President’s request, the activities supported in this bill are targeted and focused. This bill also contains strong oversight provisions and is fully offset. H.R. 5243 provides what is needed now to respond to the Zika virus, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ), the ranking member on the Legislative Branch Subcommittee. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking member, the gentlewoman from New York, for her leadership on this issue. I join my colleagues in urging Congress to vote down this wholly inadequate legislation and take meaningful action to address the public health crisis the Centers for Disease Control called ‘‘scarier than we originally thought’’ and support the President’s request. My home State of Florida leads the Nation in confirmed cases of the Zika virus, with 113 people infected already and counting. Florida health officials declared a state of emergency in February. As we head into mosquito season, as well as high travel season, we know the risk of Zika will rise. We have seen the heartbreaking images of babies born with microcephaly. As researchers are continuing to learn more about the different ways that Zika can be transmitted, it is critical that Congress provide the funding needed to thoroughly tackle this virus now. I am proud that we have transcended partisan lines in Florida at least. Senators NELSON and R UBIO as well as Governor Scott have all been outspoken advocates in support of the President’s request to fight this disease, which he made nearly 3 months ago. I have heard many of my House Republican colleagues acknowledge the devastating effects of this disease and the need for serious proposals to combat it. Sadly, the only serious part of the bill before us is how far it is from meeting our Nation’s needs in overcoming this public health crisis. The bill that the Republican leadership has introduced will not provide meaningful support to my constituents or constituents affected by this across the country. Among its many other shortcomings, this bill would raid funds from accounts designated for Ebola, which, as many public health officials have testified already, is still a threat. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is irresponsible. It also fails to provide any specific resources to Puerto Rico, where Americans are suffering the greatest burden of what Dr. Thomas Frieden, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, recently called an epidemic. It continues attacks on a woman’s ability to make her own reproductive health decisions, and, perhaps most astonishingly of all, this bill only provides these limited and borrowed funds until September 30, when they will then expire. Let me assure you that mosquitoes and diseases do not follow the congressional budget calendar. I urge the entire House to quickly pass legislation that I have introduced along with my colleagues, Ranking Member LOWEY and Ranking Member ROSA DELAURO , which would support the President’s request of $1.9 billion. We cannot simply watch more people get infected with Zika as we dither over how we fund critical investments into vaccine research, prevention strategies, and finding a cure. This is a mosquitoborne and sexually transmitted virus. Mosquitoes don’t know whether they are biting a Republican or a Democrat, and we should not politicize this serious crisis. The National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Health and Human Services have repeatedly provided plans that clearly detail the need for these funds and how they would be spent. Our local public health facilities, particularly in Florida, the Gulf States, and Puerto Rico need added resources, as do our local mosquito control programs. We need more investments into vector control and mosquito eradication. We need more public education, and we need more resources to ensure that people are able to protect themselves. I will quote my colleague from the Senate, Senator MARCO RUBIO, that we must—and I agree with him—we must get out in front of this. We will only have ourselves to blame if we dither and don’t do so. So I say to my colleagues, we must act responsibly, we must respond appropriately, and we must do it quickly. This bill does not come close to doing that, so I will cast my vote against it in hopes we will reach an agreement that actually appropriates the amount of resources that address this burgeoning crisis. My constituents cannot wait and neither can yours. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HULTGREN ). The gentleman from Kentucky has 13
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from New York has 18 minutes remaining. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CULBERSON ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science. Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, the Zika virus does pose a genuine emergency situation and, as in any emergency, requires a calm head, clear thinking, and rational approach to dealing with the problem, absent of emotion. You have got to be careful and thoughtful about these things. As with any emergency situation, you have got to trust the experts, and the experts in the field have told us that the Ebola virus is no longer as serious a threat as it was. That emergency has passed. We now need to focus 
on the Zika virus, which we are beginning to see cases in the United States. So, in a thoughtful, careful, rational way, the Republican majority has made certain that the money, our constituents’ hardearned tax dollars, is wisely and prudently spent. b2000 When we first recognized it, Chairman ROGERS , Chairman C OLE, and Chairman GRANGER made sure there was $5 billion set aside in the current year to fight Ebola and other infectious diseases. Nearly $2 billion is still in that account for other infectious diseases. And to deal with this Zika crisis, we have in this legislation tonight—which I urge my colleagues to support—added another $622 million that is completely offset. We have made savings and cuts in other areas of the government to make sure that our constituents’ hard earned taxpayers dollars are wisely spent. We are not increasing spending. We are offsetting this $622 million to fight Zika in a thoughtful, intelligent, rational way, beginning with funding mosquito control and prevention in those States with heavy mosquito populations. Texas was inundated with rain this past April, and we got the threat of a large mosquito population that is very real. So this funding tonight, which is completely offset and paid for, will help combat that threat. Chairman ROGERS , Chairman C OLE, and Chairman GRANGER have provided $230 million to the National Institutes of Health in addition to—remember— the $2 billion that is still there from the current year to fight Ebola and other infectious diseases. We have made sure that there is careful oversight of our constituents’ hard earned tax dollars and to make certain that each agency has to report to Congress on how the money is going to be used. They have to submit a spending plan. We have to make certain the dollars are going where they will do the most good. That is our responsibility. That is our duty. As good stewards of our constituents’ hardearned tax dollars, as guardians of the Treasury, we have a fiduciary duty to make sure that money is not wasted. Chairman ROGERS also put an expiration date on the funding to make sure that the money is not going to be transferred to other activities. It has got to be spent on fighting this dreaded disease. The only politicization that has taken place tonight are those who would stand up in front of the people of the United States and try to make it an emotional issue. We have got to approach this, as in any crisis, in a calm, thoughtful, and intelligent way that makes sure that we are targeting our constituents’ hardearned tax dollars where they will do the most good. Any additional funding that is necessary to fight this outbreak in the next fiscal year can and will be considered as part of the normal appropriations process. In a thoughtful, considerate way, Chairman ROGERS has given us a bill to help solve this crisis, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ), the ranking member of the Small Business Committee. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, this is the face of Zika: an innocent child harmed with the disease—a disease that we could prevent. Now, this disease is harming our fellow American citizens in Puerto Rico and on the eastern side of the mainland. Already, because of Washington’s decades of neglect, Puerto Rico’s health care system is broken. Last year, 500 doctors packed up and left the island, never to return, and physicians are leaving at the rate of one a day. While Puerto Rico’s health infrastructure is vulnerable, we are seeing this terrible disease take hold. More than 570 cases of infection have already been reported in Puerto Rico, including almost 50 pregnant women, and two deaths. How dare anyone in this Chamber say that this is political. It is not political when we have people that are dying in Puerto Rico. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Now, what are House Republicans doing in response? They are proposing less than onethird of the money needed to respond to Zika. They are providing no—zero— money targeted for Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, look at this face again. Shame on this House for this failure. Look at this face and then look in the mirror. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. This bill specifically mentions Puerto Rico. These moneys go to Puerto Rico, as well as to the rest of the territories and the States. So the money will be there if this bill passes. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DIAZ BALART ), the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies. Mr. DIAZBALART. Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank Chairman ROGERS  for his leadership on ensuring that the United States is able to do everything necessary to combat Zika, and do so immediately. South Florida is ground zero in the United States for this disease. So the funding that this bill provides is, frankly, critically important to Florida, especially, as we know, because mosquitos are most active during the summer months. This horrible disease has the capability to infect many, and we must focus on stopping it before it continues to spread. So I believe, Mr. Speaker, that we need to provide every dollar needed for Zika prevention, treatment, and response programs and, I would repeat, not one penny less. This bill is the second part of a three pronged effort to combat this disease. First was the almost $600 million in repurposed Ebola funds. Now we are providing an additional $622 million for, again, a total of over $1.2 billion to deal with this disease. So let’s be clear: if more funds are needed, Congress will step up and do what is necessary to make sure that, if those funds were necessary sometime in the future, they would be available. It is also crucial, Mr. Speaker, that President Obama’s administration and the Centers for Disease Control provide Congress with detailed information as to how they plan to spend these proposed funds. Congress also has a responsibility to protect American taxpayers so that their hardearned dollars are spent efficiently and effectively, much unlike, Mr. Speaker, the fiasco with those so called ‘‘shovelready’’ programs. Let’s make sure that we do not repeat that embarrassing fiasco and waste of taxpayers’ money. So I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, as it does provide the funds necessary to fight Zika immediately— immediately, Mr. Speaker—again, while also making sure that we protect the hardearned American people’s tax dollars. I once again want to thank the chairman for doing this so quickly, so efficiently, because Florida is ground zero. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), our distinguished Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I like Mr. DIAZBALART . But if I get sick, I hope it doesn’t take 90 days for the emergency responders to come to my aid. February 22 is when the administration said we needed this money. Almost 90 days later, we are talking about onethird of what they said was necessary. Mr. Speaker, our Nation faces a very real and present danger from Zika. Our people face that crisis. Already, more than 1,200 Americans, including more than 110 pregnant women, have confirmed cases of Zika virus. Would that have been the case if we had acted on February 22? I do not know. But I certainly wouldn’t want to rely on this Congress to enact anything in a timely fashion. We know that there is a link between Zika virus and severe birth defects, including microcephaly, which can be lifethreatening and for which there is no cure. We saw a tragic picture of a child. Puerto Rico, with its 3.5 million American citizens, has been especially 
hardhit and needs help from the Federal Government to prevent and contain the spread of the virus and ensure access to health services for those affected, particularly pregnant women and children. Last week, Puerto Rico health officials reported the island’s first confirmed case of Zikarelated microcephaly. This is a public health crisis. And I guarantee you, if it had been a terrorist who had attacked, we would have responded on February 23. The President has requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding to combat the Zika outbreak, but that is not what House Republicans brought to the floor today. Instead, they are putting forward legislation that would provide just $662 million—less than a third, as I said. That means we can’t fully fund the development of a vaccine; deployment of diagnostic testing, especially for pregnant women; and vector control to manage mosquito populations. In addition to its inadequate funding level, the Republican bill offsets the spending by further depleting funds that were appropriated to combat the Ebola virus. I know they are going to say they are going to backfill it. I won’t hold my breath. The administration has already been forced to borrow more than half a billion dollars in Ebola accounts, while Congressional Republicans ignored its Zika supplemental funding request from February 22 to this day. That is no way—no way—to handle public health crises. I urge my colleagues on the Republican side to join us to respond effectively to the President’s request. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. HOYER. Representative VERN BUCHANAN of Florida, who supports the President’s request, said last week— not STENY HOYER , a Democrat—but VERNBUCHANAN , a Republican: ‘‘All Members of Congress should take this virus seriously and put aside partisanshiptime is not on our side as the summer months draw near.’’ Senator MARCO RUBIO of Florida said in April: Congress is ‘‘going to have to explain to people why it is that we sat around for weeks and did nothing on something of this magnitude.’’ That is MARCO RUBIO. Let’s work together to pass an emergency supplemental. STEVE WOMACK said this: ‘‘If we fail to deal with the issue and there are hardships that would be posed on society in this country, you wouldn’t be able to compute those costs.’’ ‘‘It’s a dice roll to get into an argument about Zika funding and running the risk in having something catastrophic happen and we own it.’’ You will own it if this gets out of hand and we don’t have the appropriate resources deployed now. It should have been 30 days ago, 60 days ago, 90 days ago. Let’s not have this become a crisis. Let’s act now on the full sum necessary to meet this crisis. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Does the gentleman not realize, the request from the National Institutes of Health for vaccine development, we put in $40 million and the money transferred from the socalled Ebola fund; in this bill, there is another $230 million just for vaccine development at NIH. That is every penny that they asked us for. So they are getting actually more. They asked for $270 million, and we are delivering $270 million. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. YOUNG ), a member of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. I thank Chairman ROGERS for yielding, for his leadership, and for taking this seriously. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Zika Response Appropriations Act. There is no question the Zika crisis presents a serious threat to our Nation’s public health and an immediate, impactful response is required. The bill does such. This important legislation provides funding immediately for the most pressing needs, including care for infants and mothers, vaccine development, and efforts to control the spread of the disease. Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: this is not the final word on the fight against Zika. The funding level we are discussing today quickly and effectively funds muchneed efforts for the current fiscal year, 2016. It is an immediate response, while making progress on regular order as well. And we will fund fiscal year 2017 expenditures, so there will be more. As has already been said, this bill is fully offset by using leftover funds to combat the Ebola outbreak and any unused administrative funds at the Department of Health and Humans Services. b2015 It is the responsible and thoughtful approach to an issue and mission we all agree on, right, combating Zika? Some have argued the bill should fully fund the President’s request. The fact that repurposed Ebola funds used to offset this bill remain unspent years later shows it is hard to predict how much it will cost to contain an outbreak, and where funds will be needed. The House is acting quickly and responsibly, as we make repeated requests of the administration to share a detailed plan. Repeatedly, we have gotten incomplete responses. That is troubling. The administration has no complete plan, but they want us to fund it. That is simply the wrong approach. Though we pass this bill today, work will continue tomorrow on fully funding an effective and comprehensive plan to stop the Zika virus. We are doing this. As we gather the information, we need to move forward. This bill responsibly and effectively provides the needed funding where the government is ready now to help those in need. Mr. Speaker, we can argue about process in this Chamber all night, but that will do nothing to help the women and children facing very real health dangers caused by the Zika virus. What will help them is passing this critical, targeted, and responsible legislation now, which provides needed funding now, where it can actually be used. Subcommittee Chairmen COLE and GRANGER , thank you for your leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the articulate gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, who has been very clear on the need to combat the Zika virus. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, this bill is woefully inadequate. The Zika virus is a public health emergency. It is a crisis. Last week, 1,204 confirmed cases in the United States and its territories, over 100 of them pregnant women. One person has died. Temperatures are rising already and reaching high levels in the United States in the areas where these mosquitoes thrive, and we are told that this could spread to 30 States. The Olympics are less than 80 days away in Brazil. We are going to send our young men and women into harm’s way. The window for us to act on this effort is closing, and the majority’s Zika Response Appropriations Act is too little. It is too late. It only provides a third of the President’s request. Without additional funding, the CDC will not be able to protect pregnant women by better understanding the link between Zika and adverse health effects. They will not be able to control and mitigate mosquito populations before the epidemic spreads further. They lose laboratory capacity, they lose the ability of surveillance as the outbreak is moving on. The most immediate needs of State and local public health departments are woefully underfunded by the House Republican bill. Our States’ and our municipalities’ emergency funds have been slashed. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the list of all of the States in this country and the loss of preparedness funds in order to be able to deal with the crisis. 
Grantee Cuts (dollars) Cuts (%) Grantee Cuts (dollars) Cuts (%) 
Ms. D ELAURO. While the administration requested $743 million for CDC’s public health activities, the House bill provides only $120 million, 84 percent below the request. Who are we kidding? This is going to put millions of pregnant women in danger. According to the CDC, pregnant women are already facing unacceptably long delays in learning Zika test results. Physicians are advising women not to get pregnant. Pregnant women are scared to death about what is going to happen to the child that they are carrying. Director Tom Frieden has said that experts estimate a single child with birth defects can cost $10 million to care for. We need to prevent this. And the amount of money that the majority has talked about is inadequate to prevent it. If each child takes $10 million to care for, and we take a look at $622 million, we are going to look at our ability to take care of 62 children who might be affected with microcephaly. This says nothing about what the child’s quality of life is, the delays in learning to speak, to walk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. Ms. DELAURO. It is a delay in learning to speak, walk, hear and eat. Imagine. But we can stop this crisis before it gets worse. We have to act now, and we have to fully fund the President’s request. It is the responsible thing to do. More importantly, it is the moral thing to do. Months from now, when the results of our inaction become apparent, we will ask ourselves, why did we delay? Why did we wait? You know, I do not often quote Senator MARCO RUBIO, but yesterday he said this about the House bill, and I quote: ‘‘Frankly, that’s just not going to cut it. If we don’t spend more than that on the front end, I think we are going to spend a lot more later because the problem is not going to go away.’’ I could not agree more. We need to act now. That is our responsibility. The President’s request was in February. It is now almost the end of May. People are suffering, and we have the power in this body to stop that. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOYCE ), a member of our committee. Mr. JOYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5243, the Zika Response Appropriations Act of 2016. I would like to acknowledge the thoughtful leadership of Chairman ROGERS on this matter. The bill provides $622.1 million for the Department of Health and Human Services, the State Department, and USAID, to fight and prevent the spread of the Zika virus. This funding will be available immediately. This funding is for this fiscal year only, available September 30, 2016. This funding is entirely offset. Finally, the bill contains strong oversight measures to ensure responsible and effective use of taxpayer dollars. The resources provided in the bill are in addition to the $589 million the Obama administration has already identified to repurpose to fight Zika. In other words, $1.2 billion will be in place to combat the virus. Please stand with me today in support of H.R. 5243. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York has 8
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Kentucky has 4 minutes remaining. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from New York and let me thank the chairman of the full committee, and let me thank the health scientists and doctors who have given us the real story of this case. Mr. Speaker, the first Ebola case was in Texas, the first case in the United States. And the CDC says that we have not extinguished or eliminated Ebola. The proposal today is not $1.2 billion. It is $600 million because you have taken $600 million or so out of the Ebola. And the doctors indicate that there are about 8 clusters or more of Ebola in Africa, where 85 CDC personnel are there. And if one case breaks out, we will need 1,000 personnel to deal with it. So what are we doing with the Zika funding if we are not providing the Centers for Disease Control what they need, $10 million to care for a child? They do not have the tools in order to do it. They cannot. People carrying the Zika virus do not know that they have the Zika virus and, as well, they have asked for $800 million, which you are not giving to them. This is the epicenter of the potential of the Zika virus in the United States. The idea that there is sitting water in places like the Gulf region, the idea that people travel, and the person who is traveling has a mosquito that bites them, and then they—that mosquito can transmit it. Here are the mosquito cesspools in Houston, Texas. So today I stand in opposition to the underlying proposal. We need the $1.9 billion that the administration has asked for. We cannot rob from Peter to pay Paul. If you listen to the diagnosis, or you listen to the assessment, the doctors are saying that the Zika virus invades 
the brain of the baby and destroys that brain and, therefore, we do not know the longterm effects of a woman or of those who have not yet been assessed of the Zika virus. This is the wrong way to go. Vote against this bill. Give what the President wants and the CDC wants now. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. 5243, the ‘‘Zika Response Appropriations Act of 2016,’’ because this appropriations measure falls short of what is needed to aggressively address the enormity of the Zika Virus threat to the Americas and the United States, with particular concern for Puerto Rico. I thank President Obama for his leadership in requesting $1.9 billion to address the threat of the Zika Virus, and facing congressional delay he took funds from Ebola response to prepare the nation to face the Zika Virus threat. Let us not forget—Ebola was on our doorstep last year before Congress acted and there are still Ebola hot spots that are occurring, which have to be addressed, but we now lack the resources to deal with that ever present threat. I am committed to doing everything I can to address the threat of Zika Virus, but I am not supportive of tricks or misguided strategies to get legislation to the House floor in the name of Zika prevention that will do too little; and funding that will abruptly end on September 30, 2016. As the founder and Chair of the Children’s Caucus and a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I am acutely aware of how dangerous the Zika Virus is to women who may be pregnant or may become pregnant should they be exposed to the Caribbean. Houston, Texas, like many cities, towns, and parishes along the Gulf Coast, has a tropical climate hospitable to mosquitoes that carry the Zika Virus like parts of Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean. For this reason, I am sympathetic to those members who have districts along the Gulf Coast. These Gulf Coast areas, which include Houston, the third largest city in the nation, are known to have both types of the Zika Virus carrying mosquitoes: the Aedes Aegypti the Asian Tiger Mosquito; which is why I held a meeting in Houston on March 10, 2016 about this evolving health threat. I convened this meeting with Houston, Harris County and State officials at every level of responsibility to combat the Zika Virus and to discuss preparations that would mitigate its. The participants included Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and Professor of Pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine and Dr. Dubboun, Director of the Harris County Public Health Environmental Services Mosquito Control Division who gave strong input on the critical need to address the threat on a multipronged approach. The potential for the Zika Virus outbreaks in the United States if we do not act is real, and the people on the front lines are state and local governments who must prepare for mosquito season, establish community oriented education campaigns, provide Zika Virus prevent resources to women who live in areas where poverty is present, and environmental remediation of mosquito breeding near where people live. The assumption that everyone has air conditioning; window and door screens that are in good repair or present at all; does not take into consideration the pockets of poverty that are present in every major city including many towns, counties, parishes, and cities along the Gulf Coast. The 18th Congressional District of Texas, which I represent, has a tropical climate and is very likely to confront the challenge of Zika Virus carrying mosquitoes before mosquito season ends in the fall. Mr. Dubboun, Director of the Harris County Public Health Environmental Services Mosquito Control Division stressed that we cannot spray our way out of the Zika Virus threat. He was particularly cautious about the over use of spraying because of its collateral threat to the environment and people. We should not forget that Flint, Michigan was an example of shortsighted thinking on the part of government decision makers, which resulted in the contamination of that city’s water supply. The participants in the meeting I held in Houston represented the senior persons at every state and local agency with responsibility for Zika Virus response. The expert view of those present was that we need a unity of effort plan to address the Zika Virus in the Houston and Harris County area that will include every aspect of the community. The collective wisdom of these experts revealed that we should not let the fear of the Zika Virus control public policy. Instead we should get in front of the problem then we can control the Zika Virus from its source—targeting mosquito breeding environments. The real fight against the Zika Virus will be fought neighborhood by neighborhood and will rely upon the resources and expertise of local government working closely with State governments supported by federal government agencies. The consensus of Texas, Houston, and Harris County experts is that we make significant strides to stay ahead of the arrival of mosquito transmission of Zika Virus if we act now. The CDC said that for the period January 1, 2015 to May 11, 2016, the number of cases are as follows: 
Travelassociated cases reported: 503 Locally acquired through mosquito bites reported: 0 Total: 503 Pregnant: 48 Sexually transmitted: 10 GuillainBarre´syndrome: 1 
Travelassociated cases reported: 3 Mosquito acquired cases reported: 698 Total: 701 Pregnant: 65 GuillainBarre´syndrome: 5 There are 49 countries and territories in our hemisphere where mosquito borne transmission of the Zika Virus is the primary way the virus is spread include: American Samoa; Aruba; Belize; Barbados; Bolivia; Brazil; Bonaire; Cape Verde; Central America; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Curac¸ao; Dominica; Dominican Republic; El Salvador; Ecuador; Fiji; French Guiana; Grenada; the Grenadines; Guatemala; Guadeloupe; Haiti; Honduras; Islands Guyana; Jamaica; Martinique; Kosrae (Federated States of Micronesia); Marshall Islands; Mexico; Nicaragua; New Caledonia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Panama; Papua New Guinea, Paraguay; Peru; Samoa, a US territory; Saint Barthelemy; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; Saint Vincent; Saint Maarten; Suriname; Tonga; Trinidad and Tobago; US Virgin Islands, Venezuela and particular note is made by the CDC by listing the 2016 Summer Olympics (Rio 2016) separately. As of May 11, 2016, there were more than 1,200 confirmed Zika cases in the continental United States and U.S. Territories, including over 110 pregnant women with confirmed cases of the Zika virus. The Zika virus is spreading in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and abroad, and there will likely be mosquitoborne transmission within the continental United States in the coming summer months. The most important approach to control the spread of Zika Virus is poverty and the conditions that may exist in poor communities can be of greatest risk for the Zika Virus breeding habitats for vector mosquitoes. The spread of disease is opportunistic—Zika Virus is an opportunistic disease that is spread by 2 mosquitoes out of the 57 verities. We should be planning to fight those 2 mosquitoes in a multipronged way with every resource we can bring to the battle. SOURCES OF ZIKA VIRUS SPREAD  
Poverty is where the mosquito will find places to breed in great numbers, but these mosquitoes will not be limited to low income areas nor does the disease does not care how much someone earns. The Aedes Aegypti or Yellow Fever mosquito has evolved to feed on people for the blood needed to lay its eggs. This mosquito can breed in as little as a cap of dirty water; it will breed in aquariums in homes; pant water catching dishes; the well of discarded tires; puddles or pools of water; ditches; and children’s wading pools; Although water may evaporate mosquito eggs will remain viable and when it rains again or water is placed where they are the process for mosquitos development resumes. Our enemies are those who illegal dump tires; open ditches, torn screens, or no screens; tropical climates that create heat and humidity that force people without air conditioning to open windows or face heat exhaustion. 
It might be hard for people who do not live in the tropical climates along the Gulf Coast to understand what a heat index is—it is a combination of temperature and humidity, which can mean that temperatures in summer are over 100 degrees. Zika Virus Prevention Kits like those being distributed in Puerto Rico, which are vital to the effort there to protect women, will be essential to the fight against Zika Virus along the Gulf Coast. These kits should include mosquito nets for beds. Bed nets have proven to be essential in the battle to reduce malaria by providing protection and reducing the ability of biting insects to come in contact with people. Mosquito netting has fine holes that are big enough to allow breezes to easily pass through, but small enough to keep mosquitoes and other biting insects out. 
The kits should also include DEET mosquito replant products that can be sprayed on clothing to protect against mosquito bites. Mr. Speaker, we should be preparing aggressively so that this nation does not have a reoccurrence of what happened during the Ebola crisis—when the Federal government seemed unprepared because this Congress was unmoved by the science, until domestic transmission of the disease were recorded. 
The Zika Virus is a neurogenic virus that can attack the brain tissue of children in their mother’s womb. The Zika Virus will be difficult to detect and track in all cases because 4 in 5 people who get the disease will have no symptoms. We know that 33 states have one or both of the vector mosquitoes. Dr. Peter Hotez said that we can anticipate that the Americas including the United States can expect 4 million the Zika Virus cases in the next four months and to date there are over a million cases in Brazil. The virus has been transmitted through sexual contact. We know that evidence of the Zika Virus in newborns in the United States may not become apparent until we are in the late fall or winter of next year. The most serious outcome the Zika Virus exposure is birth defects that can occur during pregnancy if the mother is exposed to the Zika Virus. Infections of pregnant women can result in: Still births; The rate of Microcephaly based on Zika Virus exposure far exceeds that number. Microcephaly is brain underdevelopment either at birth or the brain failing to develop properly after birth, which can cause: Difficulty walking; Difficulty hearing; and Difficulty with speech. 
Researchers and scientists at the CDC; NIH and HHS do not know how the disease attacks the nervous system of developing babies. They cannot answer what the long term health prospects are for children born with such a severe brain birth defect. They have not discovered the right vaccine to fight the disease—which requires care to be sure that it is safe and effective especially in pregnant women or women who may become pregnant. They do not know what plan will work and to what degree if any a tight network of mosquito control established in areas most likely to have the Zika Virus carrying mosquitoes will work as well. How the Zika Virus may evolve over time and what they may mean for human health. I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 5243, and support the President’s request for $1.9 billion to fight the Zika Virus threat. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HARRIS ), a member of our committee and a medical physician. Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentlewoman from Texas. We should be thankful for the scientists we have, whether it is at the CDC, whether it is at the NIH, those public health officials who are going to make sure that the mosquito control occurs that is necessary, to those who are at BARDA and other agencies where we develop the vaccines that are necessary, and do the necessary research. This House bill, in distinction to the President’s request, is targeted and well thought out. This bill deals just with Zika. The President’s request didn’t. It dealt with whatever other infectious disease comes down the road. Yet, Zika is what is in front of us now. Mr. Speaker, it is going to take 2 to 3 years to complete the necessary research and to complete the vaccine development and bring it to market. This bill deals with the needs over the next 6 months. The administration requested a total of about $1.6 billion in research, because there is about $300 million that has nothing to do, really, with researching and curing Zika. So it is $1.6 billion over 3 years. The House took the position we actually need to frontload that. We need to deal with this fiscal year, so we put together a package of $1.2 billion to be spent over the next 6 months to make sure that we start the necessary research, we start the vaccine development, and deal with those outyears through the normal appropriations process which is going to take place over the next 2 years. So our approach is actually a much more valid approach, targeted, well thought out, will provide all the necessary funds to the CDC, NIH, for the vaccine development and the mosquito control over the next 6 months, when we need it most, and then add additional funds as necessary, as science learns more about what we need. We can’t possibly know what we need now. The administration put a request without possibly knowing what we need 2 or 3 years in the future. We will find out what we need and we will add those. Mr. Speaker, this is the right approach. This is actually more money up front than the administration has asked for, which is exactly the correct approach to deal with this imminent threat to the health of U.S. citizens here and in Puerto Rico. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ). Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, as an emergency medicine physician and a public health expert myself, I rise today to strongly oppose this inadequate Zika funding bill, and to urge my colleagues to fully fund our Nation’s efforts to fight the Zika virus. In the emergency department, you don’t just partially treat a patient. This is called negligence. You don’t just take out a third of the cancer. You don’t just give a third of the antibiotic dose for a severe pneumonia. Mr. Speaker, this bill is less than a third of what is needed to treat and protect women and their children from the Zika virus. It is less than a third of the prescription from the CDC and the experts needed to protect American families from Zika. Tomorrow I am voting ‘‘no’’ because I demand that we fully fund efforts to protect families, pregnant women and their children from Zika. Mr. Speaker, time is past due for you to do your job and address the Zika virus threat. We must completely fund efforts to protect American families from Zika. The American people deserve no less. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b2030 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. GRAHAM ). Ms. GRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, more than 120 Members and every Democrat of the Florida delegation have asked for a vote on fully funding the fight against Zika. In Florida, we have had more than 100 recorded cases of Zika. There is no doubt we are in the midst of a public health emergency. There are pregnant women who are afraid to go out at night. As a mom myself, I am worried about my own daughter and her future. Our State’s tourism industry counts on thousands and thousands of people traveling to Florida. Those provide thousands of jobs, and millions of dollars flow into our economy. All of that is at risk. We can’t wait, and we shouldn’t be forced to fight this virus with one hand tied behind our back. Scientists and our public health officials have asked for $1.9 billion. We should stop playing games, Mr. Speaker, and fulfill the request. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I would like to repeat again, as a Member who has been in this House and has had the privilege of being part of many responses to emergencies, this is an emergency. In last year’s omnibus, Congress used emergency funding without offsets to pay for wildland fire suppression mostly in the West. Congress provided emergency funding to respond to two hurricanes and flooding in the Carolinas and Texas, again without offsets. When those disasters struck, my colleagues, we didn’t steal money from prior disaster response like the emergency funding provided for hurricane damage in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, storms in West Virginia, and tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kentucky. We paid for those emergencies. We did not steal from any other account, my colleagues. In fact, after the 2013 Oklahoma tornadoes, my friend, Chairman ROGERS , told reporters: ‘‘I don’t think disasters of this type should be offset. We have an obligation to help these people.’’ So, my friends, I just want to emphasize again, we have a crisis. We have 
people suffering. The potential is enormous. These are Americans. These are citizens. Whether it is here or in Puerto Rico, we have a responsibility to respond. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, for those who are concerned that this is not an adequate amount of money at the right time, let me just say this. The money that the President requested of us, the $1.9 billion, was for the balance of this year and all of next year—17
1⁄2months, $1.9 billion. In this bill, plus what we earlier forced them to put into these matters, almost $600 million, that $600 million, this $622 million is just for 4
1⁄2months, from now until the end of the fiscal year. I say that is more than adequate. If there is more needed, when the regular appropriations bills come up for fiscal year 2017, you heard Chairman COLE and Chairman G RANGER say we will put in the hopper whatever is needed at that time. So this is wholly adequate. It is more than adequate in terms of money. Now, for those who are concerned about whether or not we are taking too much money away from Ebola, in the first place, that fund is not just for Ebola. When it was created 2 years ago, it was for Ebola and other infectious diseases. That is what we are dealing with here. We are asking the administration to use that money. This is an infectious disease. You have got over $2 billion laying there unused left over from what was not spent in eradicating Ebola. By the way, the World Health Organization now says that Ebola is no longer an international emergency. So the money in the socalled Ebola—I call it the infectious disease account—that money is available and needs to be spent now. That is what we told the President shortly after he said he was going to send us a supplemental request. We said to use the money you have. Finally, they did spend $589 million of that. Now we are adding to that with some $622 million. So there is plenty of money there. There is plenty of money left in the till of the infectious disease account if it is needed for Ebola or anything else. There is upwards of $2 billion laying there unused. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the previous question is ordered on the bill. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. MOTION TO RECOMMIT  
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I am opposed to the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order on the gentlewoman’s motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker and Members, this is the final amendment to the bill. It will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. We don’t have time for that. If it is adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, America has a public health emergency at its doorstep, and it requires a robust and urgent response. Yet the Republican bill utterly fails to deal with the emergency posed by the rapidly spreading Zika virus, and it leaves our neighbors and our communities at risk. So the amendment I am offering today provides the resources requested by our public health experts and researchers to combat Zika, the $1.9 billion to help prevent, detect, and respond to Zika in contrast to the paltry $622 million in the Republican bill. I would like to thank Mrs. LOWEY , Ms. DELAURO , Ms. W ASSERMAN  SCHULTZ , Ms. G RAHAM , Mr. R UIZ, and everyone. I would like to thank the March of Dimes, which is advocating for full funding, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Why? Microcephaly. Microcephaly is a severe brain abnormality that is now linked to the Zika virus, as are other anomalies where brain and skull development are affected. We are talking about a lifetime of seizures and developmental delays, such as problems sitting, standing, walking, seeing, hearing, and feeding problems. Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment for the Zika infection. Brazil has reported the highest incidence of microcephaly, with over 4,000 suspected cases tied to Zika. Microcephaly has also been detected among women who contracted Zika in Colombia, Panama, and U.S. territories. In fact, in the U.S. and U.S. territories alone, we have 1,200 cases. Thirtytwo of these are pregnant women, two cases of microcephaly. The Florida Department of Health says we have 120 Floridians diagnosed with Zika, including pregnant women. Because there is no cure for the Zika virus, Congress must act to do everything we can to prevent it. We need the diagnostic tests, we need the vaccines, we need research, and we need tools for our communities back home. We have got to educate our neighbors. This Republican bill is woefully inadequate. It puts our neighbors back home at risk and could subject us to huge economic risks as well. Let’s get specific. The GOP’s Zika bill provides less than onethird of the funds requested by public health experts. I heard the Republican appropriators say they intend to do more next year. The mosquitos don’t know that, do they? The mosquitos are not going to wait until next year. That is unconscionable. It is unconscionable that such underfunding does 
not allow the development of vaccines, the diagnostics, and the research in birth defects. The most immediate needs are woefully underfunded in the Republican bill. The CDC requested $740 million for public health activities like mosquito control. The House bill provides $120 million, 84 percent below the request. That means the CDC is not going to have adequate funding to assist our local communities. The House bill cuts the request by the National Institutes of Health for research and development of vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics by $132 million, or 28 percent. The House bill completely neglects immediate needs of American citizens in Puerto Rico. The administration asked for $256 million. What does the Republican bill provide? Zero. Furthermore, the State Department and USAID will only get $119 million. Now, if we learned anything from Ebola, it is that addressing the health threat overseas can be extremely effective, but you give it short shrift here. Colleagues, this is a public health emergency, but it is not the only one. It is not the first one, and it will not be the last. It requires a serious, thoughtful response, one with adequate funding, not a feeble attempt to demonstrate you are trying to do something. Now, not only will the GOP obstruction likely prove dire to the health of our neighbors, but there is going to be a huge economic impact as well. Currently, pregnant women and men who hope to have a baby are advised by CDC to avoid traveling to Brazil and other areas. What if there is a similar traveling advisory for the State of Florida, the Texas coast, New Orleans, Charleston, and Mobile, Alabama, all communities that rely on the tourism dollar, from small businesses to large? So you are asking not only for a public health emergency, but for an economic emergency as well. Members, this call to action requires actual action. This call to action was made months ago. Your answer needs to be equal to our challenge. Please pass my amendment so that we can fully fund the Zika response. Don’t give the short shrift Republican bill a hearing. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the bill vote and ‘‘yes’’ on the MTR. I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I insist on my point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his point of order. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I raise a point of order against the motion because the proposed amendment contains an emergency designation which constitutes a change to existing law within the meaning of clause 2 of rule XXI. Accordingly, it violates the longstanding prohibition on legislating on a general appropriations measure, and I must insist upon my point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order? If not, the Chair is prepared to rule. The gentleman from Kentucky makes a point of order that the instructions in the motion to recommit contain legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI. The instructions, in pertinent part, designate certain appropriated funds as an emergency requirement pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Chair has ruled on numerous occasions, as recorded in section 1052 of the House Rules and Manual, that a proposal to designate an appropriation as an ‘‘emergency requirement’’ within the meaning of the budgetenforcement laws is fundamentally legislative in character. On these premises, the Chair holds that the instructions contained in the motion to recommit offered by the gentlewoman from Florida, by including a proposal to designate an appropriation as an ‘‘emergency requirement’’ within the meaning of the budgetenforcement laws, constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI. The point of order is sustained. The motion is not in order. b2045 Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is: Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the House? MOTION TO TABLE  
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I move to table the appeal of the ruling of the Chair. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15 minute vote on the motion to table will be followed by a 5minute vote on passage of the bill, if arising without further proceedings in recommittal.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. CLYBURN. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from South Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. This amendment would fight discrimination in the military, which 
erodes obedience, unity, commitment, and esprit de corps. The Supreme Court highlighted these four essential attributes in explaining the military deference doctrine, under which this amendment is constitutionally sound. The first section of the amendment would prohibit senior ROTC programs in any institution that displays the Confederate battle flag. This objectionable banner, which has never been the official flag of the Confederacy, is a symbol of hate, racial oppression, resistance to the rule of law, and White supremacy. Any doubt as to this flag’s meaning was erased by the perpetrator of last summer’s horrific shootings at Emanuel AME Church. Regrettably, the Confederate battle flag still flies at the Citadel, just 2 miles away from Mother Emanuel. I happen to disagree with the Citadel’s board members’ belief that they are barred from removing the flag until the South Carolina State Legislature acts to revise or repeal the so called Heritage Act. But it is clear that this hateful symbol will not be removed until pressure is brought to bear on those with the authority to remove it. b2145 In recent days, Citadel alumni have reached out to me to express their support for this effort. One of these alumni, Dr. Larry Ferguson, was a member of The Citadel class of 1973, the first class with more than one African American. Dr. Ferguson desegregated the band, but was subsequently kicked out of the band for refusing to wave the Confederate battle flag and play the song ‘‘Dixie’’ at sporting events. I received another letter from a group of 17 alumni. They write that the Confederate battle flag ‘‘is representative of an ideology of hate and privilege, and is an abuse of power that still persists in the life of the school and in the State’s halls of power and influence. ‘‘The fact that, in 2016, the Confederate Naval Jack flag hangs in a public place of worship, on the campus of a public college, and is protected by an unjust law is clear evidence of this reality.’’ These letters make abundantly clear how the glorification of such an odious symbol at a military college undermines obedience, unity, commitment, and esprit de corps in our future military officers. I will include in the RECORD both letters, and I urge my colleagues to heed the voice of these Citadel alumni so that no more cadets will have to struggle in the shadow of this oppressive banner. 
MAY16, 2016. DEARCONGRESSMAN JAMES CLYBURN , I am writing to inform you of my support of your efforts to limit ROTC funding to The Citadel because of the displaying of the Confederate flag in the Summerall Chapel. I am Dr. Larry J Ferguson a 1973 African American graduate of The Citadel. When I entered The Citadel in the summer of 1969 our class was the fourth year of desegregation at The Citadel. But the class of 1973 is the first class that had more than one AfricanAmerican in it. Nine of us entered The Citadel in 1969 and six of us graduated in 1973. I was the first AfricanAmerican to desegregate The Citadel’s Regimental Band Company. In 1970 as a young 18 year old sophomore I informed the administration that I would not play the song ‘‘Dixie’’ or participate in the celebratory waving of the Confederate flag at our sporting events. I was subsequently removed from the band and the administration threatened to take away my academic scholarship despite my having good grades. Thanks to my parents and attorney Daniel Martin, Sr. they successfully argued for me to keep my scholarship. Thanks also to Maj Clarence Richardson U.S. Army (Ret), I was able to transfer to C Co. where he was the tactical officer. I had a bitter/sweet 4 years at The Citadel. There were a few of my white class mates who went against the grain and let me know that I could count on them to be my friend. But the overwhelming tension always present around me was that I was only tolerated at The Citadel because of my race and because I stood up for racial justice. One of the beginning ways to establish racial justice is to repudiate all symbols of racial oppression. The majority of African Americans and many other people of various ethnicities find the Confederate flag and the song ‘‘Dixie’’ offensive because the flag and the song have long been associated with hate groups. These hate groups used the Confederate flag and the song ‘‘Dixie’’ as symbols directly connected to their culture of terrorism and hatred for AfricanAmericans and for anyone who supported racial integration. These Confederate symbols cannot de divorced from the hate groups that created a system of racial oppression and bigotry in these United States of America and as such they should only remain in places of historical reference—not public platforms of adulation. Let us teach our future generations that bigotry and racism are vigorously opposed in our society and that symbols that are directly connected to bigotry and racism are not to be celebrated in any form or fashion. As a lifetime member of The Citadel Alumni Association and as a past member of The Citadel Board of Visitors I want to thank you Congressman Clyburn for addressing this issue. Recent history teaches us that 50 years ago it took external pressure to make The Citadel desegregate its Corps of Cadets. This legislation will exert appropriate pressure on state authorities so that the Confederate flag will be removed from Summerall Chapel thus allowing everyone who enters to be able to worship in dignity and solemnity. Yours Truly, LARRY J FERGUSON , DMD. 
MAY16, 2016. Congressman JIMCLYBURN , Assistant Democratic Leader, 6th Congressional District of South Carolina, Washington, DC. DEAR CONGRESSMAN CLYBURN : Since 1939, the Confederate Flag, a historic emblem of racial intolerance flown by proslavery rebels both before and after the Civil War, is still currently being displayed in The Citadel’s Summerall Chapel. The flag’s presence in the most hallowed place on the entire campus, where cadets gather to worship, is an assault on the sensibilities of those who understand The Citadel’s history, but do not share the values the flag has come to represent. As black alumni of The Citadel, we acknowledge the school’s efforts to remove this divisive symbol from our house of worship. We agree that a museum is a more appropriate place for the flag. Its current location in the school’s chapel stands as an affront to those of us whose ancestors suffered racial violence, hatred, and bigotry under the shadow of that flag and its ideology. As you know, the school’s administration continues to suggest that it is constrained from removing the flag as a consequence of the Heritage Act. As we have stated in previous correspondence to the school, the Heritage Act is an unjust piece of legislation. We further contend that the Citadel’s decision to ‘‘follow the law’’ (the Heritage Act) is a tactic to delay the flag’s removal from the Chapel; it is an attempt to redirect responsibility for this matter to the South Carolina House of Representatives, whose Speaker, James Lucas, vowed to deny a vote on the issue. As a consequence, we hold both the school and the legislature equally responsible for the fact that the Confederate Flag still flies in the Chapel on campus. Also, it is not lost on us that the school’s decision to ‘‘follow the law’’ (Heritage Act) in this moment is a bit disingenuous, particularly since the school, as a public institution, for years defied antidiscrimination laws related to the admission of Black people and women to the school. The Citadel cannot in one moment of history defy the law in order to preserve white and male privilege, while now representing itself as an abider of the law (the Heritage Act) while the flag still hangs in Summerall Chapel. From the beginning of our fight to have the flag removed, we suspected that the school and the state would fail to muster the political will and moral courage to have the flag immediately removed from the chapel. For this reason, we are grateful and in solidarity with you and your colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives as you introduce measures to withhold federal funding for Reserve Officer’s Training Corps programs from all colleges and universities displaying the Confederate flag. In closing, our position reaches far beyond the issue of the Confederate flag. We believe that the school’s ability to fulfill its obligation to develop principled leaders and to model the virtues of duty, honor, and respect are undermined by the continued veneration of a relic from a tragic chapter of America’s history. For many of us, the flag is more than a symbol; it is representative of an ideology of hate, privilege and an abuse of power that still persists in the life of the school and in the state’s halls of power and influence. The fact that in 2016 the Confederate Naval Jack Flag hangs in a public space of worship, on the campus of a public college, and is protected by an unjust law is clear evidence of this reality. While we continue to work energetically to have the flag removed immediately from the chapel premises, we remain in support of your efforts to address this at the federal level of government. Thank you for your leadership on this matter. As graduates of the school and allies in this fight, we stand firmly in solidarity with you. Sincerely, Hillery Douglas ’82; Fr. W. Reginald Simmons ’87; James Stevens ’89; Garrick Benson ’89; Johnny Orr ’89; Ken Williams ’89; Anthony Terrell ’89 C.

Mr. CLYBURN. Make no mistake about it: a vote against this motion is a vote to continue flying the Confederate battle flag and allow discrimination at a military college. 
I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SEANPATRICK MALONEY ), my good friend. Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I have never voted against the defense bill, and I never thought I would. My dad was a veteran who was nearly killed serving his country. He taught me to respect those who serve and to speak plainly about right and wrong. So let me speak plainly now. This bill writes antigay bias into Federal law. It strips LGBT Americans of basic workplace protections by reversing the President’s antidiscrimination orders, saying it is once again legal for your LGBT neighbors and family members to be fired because of who they are. This is wrong. This is not about supporting our troops. It is not about fighting ISIS. It is not about religious protections. We can do all that, and we should. This is about bigotry, plain and simple. But we can fix it by embracing the bipartisan effort, denied by the Rules Committee, to remove this hateful language and keep everything else. Mr. Speaker, this is not some procedural vote to be waived away; this is about whether we will reaffirm equal rights or rationalize discrimination. When my husband and I got married, after waiting 22 years, so many of you expressed your support. Will you now look me in the eye and say that it would be okay for me to lose my job over it? Just today, a Member of this House, refusing to help strike this antigay language, said to me: But you know where I am on your issues. I said: No. This is where you are on my issues. Your vote is where you are on my issues. And this is where your children and where history will remember you are standing on our issues. You have the opportunity here and now to strike this antigay language and, in doing so, strike a blow for equality. Mr. Speaker, we are told that we are to make America great again. Well, you cannot make America great by making America hate. Vote against discrimination. Vote for this motion to recommit. Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking the 63 members of the Armed Services Committee not only for all of their work in putting this bill together, but for the seriousness with which they take our duties under the Constitution to help provide for the common defense. Our members don’t always agree, but we are able to work our way through our differences most of the time and think about the larger cause. You might say we sacrifice some of our individual differences or preferences in order to support the men and women who sacrifice so much for us. I want to thank all the Members of the House. We have had a lot of Members over the last 2 days who have come down to the floor and talked about their amendments, and all of those amendments have helped make this bill a better bill. That is the way that, for 54 straight years, Congresses with majorities of both parties and Presidents of both parties have signed into law a defense authorization bill. Last year, it was a little iffy, but that is the way it has happened. I just want to suggest to our colleagues that it is especially important we do that this year. There is a lot of uncertainty out there. Some of that uncertainty is because of President Obama. Part of that uncertainty is because of us. Part of the uncertainty is because of the political campaign. Part of the uncertainty is because of the turmoil in the world. My suggestion to you is that, with all this uncertainty going on out there, it is particularly important this year that we send a message to friends and adversaries that the United States is willing to stand up and defend ourselves. And it is even more important, I would suggest, that we send a message to our troops that, whatever uncertainty is out there, we are going to support them. Mr. Speaker, to support our troops, we have to vote ‘‘yes’’ and pass this bill. Now, I realize that if one wants to oppose this bill, there are lots of reasons to do that. The bill takes the same budget approach as Speaker PELOSI and Majority Leader H ARRY  REIDused in 2008, the last time we had a change of administration. The bill includes a provision that reaffirms the protections of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. I really hope if anybody has a question about that, come read the amendment. I have got it here. Please read this provision so you can judge for yourself. But before any Member votes ‘‘no,’’ I hope they ask themselves whether they really want to send a message to our troops that, yes, that Member would be supportive of the troops, if only; or, I would really support the troops, but for; or, I would really support the troops maybe when. I don’t think that is the right way to go. Let me just finish with a fact and a story. One fact is that today, of the 271 strike aircraft across the Marine Corps, 46 are available for flight operations. That is 46 out of 271 are available today. But let me make it personal for just a second. Over the past week, I have encountered two marines. On Sunday, I was privileged to attend the commissioning of a young man who is just entering the Marine Corps. He hopes to be a Marine aviator. He is full of promise and enthusiasm. Earlier in the week, I learned that an experienced Marine aviator has decided to leave the Marine Corps because he doesn’t think the aircraft he is flying are safe, and he has got two young kids at home. Now, earlier in the debate, the ranking member said my philosophy in this bill was to help the troops now and worry about other problems later. Well, there is some truth in that. I want to help the troops now. I worry about aviators who don’t think their aircraft are safe now. I can’t solve budget problems in the future. I don’t know who is going to be elected President. I don’t know what problems the world is going to face. I can do something now, and that is to vote for this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. RECORDED VOTE

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Clerk be authorized to make technical corrections in the engrossment of H.R. 4909, to include corrections in spelling, punctuation, section and title numbering, crossreferencing, conforming amendments to the table of contents and short titles, and the insertion of appropriate headings. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection.

MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017 
Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4974, and that I may include tabular material on the same. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 736 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 4974. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b2209 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 4974) making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, with Mr. COLLINS of Georgia in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. DENT) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. b2210 Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today, it is my honor and privilege to bring H.R. 4974, the fiscal year 2017 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act to the House for consideration. I present this bill alongside my very good friend and ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP ), who has been an essential partner all along the way. I greatly appreciate the participation and support of our committee members on both sides of the aisle as we considered priorities and funding levels for the important programs in our bill. We analyzed the budget request, developed questions, and held oversight hearings to get direct feedback from members of all the services, the Department of Defense leadership, the Secretary of the VA, and the VA inspector general. We received over 1,000 requests from Members, again, from both sides of the aisle, and we gave them full and fair consideration. The bill is also the product of actively listening to the concerns of our veterans and veteran advocates, servicemembers, spouses, caregivers, military family members, and healthcare providers both within and outside the VA over the past year. As we consider this bill, I can’t proceed further without noting that this subcommittee has a formidable level of support from the chair and ranking member of the full committee. So I thank Chairman ROGERS and the ranking member, Mrs. LOWEY . Their attention, oversight, and genuine care for the military and veterans has been inspiring. To round out the team, we have some great support from our professional staff: Maureen Holohan, Sue Quantius, Sarah Young, Tracey Russell, and Matt Washington on the committee staff; and Sean Snyder, Drew Kent, and Heather Smith on my personal staff. I would also like to note Michael Reed and Michael Calcagni with Mr. BISHOP  of Georgia’s office. We couldn’t do it without them. I would also like to note the retirement of the senior member of our subcommittee, SAMFARR. He has been on this subcommittee since 1999. In our full committee meeting, we went into detail about Sam’s accomplishments on this subcommittee, including being the architect of the Monterey model, which is now the benchmark for successful publicprivate partnership in a community with a base closure. Sam, wherever you may be, your commitment, passion, and good humor will be missed. All the best to you in your pending retirement. H.R. 4974 demonstrates our firm commitment to fully supporting our Nation’s veterans and servicemembers. Our investment of $81.6 billion for military construction, VA, and related agencies, $1.2 billion over last year’s level, is unprecedented. The bill addresses issues to help veterans in every part of the country—every congressional district—and our troops around the world. This bill provides comprehensive support for servicemembers, military families, and veterans. It supports our troops with the facilities and services necessary to maintain readiness and morale at bases here in the States and overseas. It provides for Defense Department schools and health clinics that take care of our military families. The bill funds our veteran healthcare systems to ensure that our promise to care for those who sacrificed in defense of this great Nation continues as those men and women return home. We owe this to our veterans and are committed to sustained oversight so that programs deliver what they promise and taxpayers are well served by the investments we make. On the military construction side, the bill provides a total of $7.9 billion for military construction projects and family housing, including base and overseas contingency operations funding, OCO funding—an increase of $250 million over the President’s request. This funding meets DOD’s most critical needs, including priority projects for combatant commanders and funding new mission requirements. It provides $304 million for military medical facilities. It provides $246 million for Department of Defense educational facilities, for construction or renovation of four schools. It supports our Guard and Reserve through $673 million for facilities in 21 States. It includes $514 million for projects from the Department of Defense’s unfunded priority list, benefiting the most critical projects—as identified by the services—that were not included in the budget request. 
It fully funds military family housing at $1.3 million. It provides $178 million for the NATO Security Investment Program, which is $43 million over last year’s level, to deal with increasing threats and necessary investments overseas. On Veterans Affairs, this legislation includes a total of $176 billion in combined discretionary and mandatory funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Discretionary funding alone for Veterans programs in the bill is $73.5 billion. Total fiscal year 2017 discretionary funding is $2 billion above fiscal year 2016, which is a 3 percent increase, and $1.5 billion below the budget request. Within that total, VA medical care is provided with $64 billion, a 5 percent increase over last year— again, a 5 percent increase over last year for VA medical care. Again, on VA medical services, the bill funds VA medical services at $52.5 billion. That includes $850 million that VA came back and asked for this year, on top of the advanced funding provided last year. Many Members expressed concerns about medical services, and we were able to fully fund the budget request for hepatitis C at $1.5 billion. We are paying for treatments for so many of our veterans who are being cured from this horrible disease of hepatitis C. The drugs are very expensive. They have come down in price a bit, and that has helped us serve more veterans. Veterans homelessness is at $1.6 billion, longterm care at $8.6 billion, caregiver stipends at $725 million, and Office of Inspector General is at $160 million. For disability claims, we provide the full request for the Veterans Benefits Administration, which is a $118 million increase over fiscal year 2016, and the full budget request for the Board of Veterans Appeals, which is a $46 million increase. The bill will enhance transparency and accountability at the VA through further oversight and an increase for the VA Office of Inspector General’s independent audits and investigations. The legislation also contains $260 million for the modernization of the VA electronic health record and includes restricting all of the funding until the VA meets milestones and certifies interoperability to meet statutory requirements. Major construction, we continue to focus on major construction oversight. The bill includes language that will hold back 100 percent of the funding for the largest construction projects until VA contracts for outside Federal management, and we maintain strict restrictions on transfers, use of bid savings, and scope changes. The bill provides $528 million for major construction projects in Reno, Nevada; Long Beach, California; as well as cemeteries in Florida, New York, and Colorado. We include bill language regarding improved standards for the suicide hotline and certification of mental health therapists to expand access for veterans who need their care. I don’t need to explain to anybody in this body this great need here to help with the mental health needs of so many of our veterans. b2220 VA performance awards. The bill prohibits all performance awards for VA senior executives. This was in response to multiple Member requests to restrict bonuses of various types at the VA. I understand this is controversial. But given the horrendous mismanagement that we have seen at many of the VA facilities across the country, we were compelled to send a strong message about accountability. The prohibition we included has passed as a floor amendment several years in a row, so that is why it is included in the base bill this year. I will tell you that we have, obviously, many great and wonderful employees at the VA who are doing their best every day to provide for our veterans, whether it is through benefits or through the health system or on their educational needs, so I wanted to make sure that we make that point. But there is a need for some accountability, and that is why we had to insert this particular provision. We have received some unfounded criticism from the administration for the actions that we have taken. The administration may not be happy with any change to its budget proposal. But this bill provides very generous funding that adheres to the law and our responsibility to practice fiscal responsibility. Overall, with this bill and the funds that were provided in advance last year, for fiscal year 2017, the VA will have available 98 percent of what it asked for—98 percent of what they asked for is provided. I would wager that there won’t be another Department in that enviable position. This shows the level of commitment we have to our veterans and their families. I think that should be noted. So despite any criticism, we should all be proud of this bill and what we have done in it. Let me tell you, I can say with absolute certainty, the VA’s problems stem from poor management and not too little money. We continue to push for better management, and the Secretary has replaced most of the senior managers at headquarters and in the field. So many VA employees, as I mentioned earlier, are deeply committed— overwhelmingly, they are committed— to the veteran. They are talented, and they work very hard. I have met these folks, and I appreciate them very much. I visit with them in eastern Pennsylvania on a regular basis and in south central Pennsylvania. But the ‘‘corrosive culture’’ that has been cited at the VA remains the root of VA’s problem. I want to briefly discuss the Choice Act or, as we call it, the VACAA, a little bit. I, and probably all of you, fully support the Choice Act, and want veterans to have access to quality health care at a convenient location for them. Veterans want to be served. They want to be taken care of in the communities where they live. It is better for the veteran. It is better for the family. And we want to make sure our veterans have access to some of the finest health care institutions in the world that may not be part of the VA system. We need to do that. The Choice Act was so popular that it brought a lot of demand to the VA, and the VA has been spending both Choice Act funds and discretionary funds to meet the increased demand. The Choice Act expires at the end of fiscal year 2017, and its funding is being depleted sooner than that. Some of the Choice programs are already out of money, and others will be out of money halfway through the year. For example, the Choice Act hires of medical professionals to cut the backlog of appointments runs out of funds to pay those people halfway through the year. We—and when I say we, that is discretionary appropriations—are picking up a $600 million tab to pay them through the end of fiscal year 2017. It is the right thing to do, but it is not something that we had planned for. There will be unprecedented and massive demands on the discretionary side to continue programs started with a $15 billion surge of emergency funding a few years ago through the VACAA. That is a huge issue for fiscal year 2018. Right now, it is incumbent on Congress to reform VA health care with a responsible plan that meets the needs of veterans in a sustainable manner, and I hope that we can take that matter very seriously. It will be a huge issue next year, and it is an issue already this year. With respect to the related agencies, we fund the American Battle Monuments Commission, the Armed Forces Retirement Home, Arlington National Cemetery, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans at the requested funding levels, which total $241 million. In closing, this is a very solid, bipartisan bill that is focused on the needs of servicemembers, veterans, and, most especially, all their families. We are $1.8 billion over the fiscal year 2016 level. That is more than a 2 percent increase. We have provided for our military and veterans to the very best level we can in a manner that is fiscally responsible and consistent with the budget agreement we enacted into law last year. Did we fund every last dime requested? No. But not every idea has merit, and not every project is mission critical. We did not fund some projects, we cut some requested increases, and we rescinded funds. These were fair decisions and part of our responsibility, as appropriators. We will do a lot of good with this bill. It is fair. It is balanced. It is generous. 
And on behalf of our servicemembers, military families, and veterans, I urge support for this legislation. Let’s take care of those who have sacrificed for our country. Again, I would like to thank everybody for their help and support along the way with this bill, both all of the Members and staff. I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to begin by thanking Mrs. LOWEY and Mr. R OGERS , who serve as the distinguished ranking member and chairman of the full committee, and, of course, Chairman DENT, my colleague, on the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. I couldn’t have a better, more collaborative partner in support of our military and our veterans, and I really appreciate the collegiality. And certainly I want to thank our staff. From the minority staff, I would like to thank Matt Washington, as well as Mike Reed and Mike Calcagni from my personal office. From the majority committee staff, I would like to thank Maureen Holohan, Sue Quantius, Sarah Young, Tracey Russell, and Sean Snyder from Chairman DENT’s office. As you all know, this bill has a strong history. Before I begin, I really also want to share the comments and the accolades and salutations for our colleague from California, SAMFARR, who is retiring from the committee; and this, of course, will be his last MILCON/VA bill. He has been a longstanding member of this committee, very insightful, compassionate, and pragmatic. We are certainly going to miss Sam with his valuable, valuable contributions. I would like to point out that this bill has a strong history of finding common ground and bipartisan support across the aisle to provide resources for our men and women in uniform who have chosen to serve and to protect our great Nation’s way of life and our individual freedoms. With this bill, we fund military construction projects in the Department of Veterans Affairs to the benefit of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, both past and present. For those who have given so much of themselves, we owe a great deal. So let me start our consideration of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill by recognizing those in our military who cannot be with us here tonight as they serve across the globe. Thank you for your service. The account taking care of the construction of military facilities is provided $7.7 billion, an increase of $250 million above the fiscal year 2017 budget request. Overall, the Department of Veterans Affairs is funded at $73.5 billion, which is $2.5 billion above the FY16enacted level, and $1.4 billion below the FY17 request. I am pleased with several aspects of the bill. As we saw throughout the markup process, the bill provides robust funding for our military construction and provides adequate funding for both active and reserve military forces. I was pleased that the bill provides $25 million above the FY17 budget request to help speed up the cleanup of former Department of Defense sites. For too long, we have been waiting for an end to the tunnel for the electronic health records integration between the Department of Defense and the VA. To strengthen oversight on the issue, I am pleased to see the bill maintains tough, but fair, reporting requirements for the electronic health records endeavor. To better serve those veterans shortchanged for too long, the bill continues to prioritize the elimination of the VA’s claims backlog and includes healthy funding for the Board of Veterans’ Appeals, though I am concerned with the proposed reforms to the BVA. b2230 Nonetheless, I believe these are positive steps that are necessary to ensure that the VA continues to improve its service for our veterans. Mr. Chair, while the MILCONVA bill has many positive attributes, one item I am not particularly pleased about is the inclusion of bill language that limits performance awards. As I have stated for the past 3 years, this language will not provide a shortterm solution and, in fact, may have longterm consequences, compounding the very problem that it attempts to address. All this language will do is make the VA a less attractive option than other agencies when it comes to recruiting and retaining quality executive leaders, resulting in the Department’s not having the very talent that it needs to solve the problems it faces today. This is an issue that must be addressed as we move through this process. Turning away from the bill for a second, our committee was off to a very fast start. However, because of the budget resolution impasse, we have had to wait a month for the MILCONVA bill to be able to come to the floor. As a result, we will not be able to get back to regular order this year, and with roughly 45 days left in the legislative calendar, it will be nearly impossible to fulfill our obligation to the American people and pass all 12 bills through the House. We are in this situation because an upset, small minority of the House wants to revisit issues that were already decided and acted upon by a bipartisan majority of both Houses and signed into law by the President. That being said, I applaud Chairman ROGERS for honoring the allocation the bipartisan budget agreement set for fiscal year 2017. The BBA will have to suffice until we can get past these unrealistic beliefs that we can cut our way to prosperity. As we are all aware of our level of discretionary resources this year, it will be tough, especially tough for this subcommittee, because our bill advances funds to the medical services account. While we start out in the hole every year, the VA’s annual second bite of the apple makes balancing the needs of nonmedical VA services with other Federal agencies that much more difficult. As I have said numerous times, we must be more strategic about how we handle our Federal budget. Mr. Chair, would I have done some things differently? Of course, but here we are. Nevertheless, with reservations, I urge my colleagues to defeat any poison pill amendments and move to support this bill to fund the construction of military facilities and strive to improve the quality of life and the care afforded to current servicemembers, to our veterans, and to our military families. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS ), the distinguished chairman of the full committee. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. I thank the chairman for yielding the time. Mr. Chair, I rise tonight to support this first bill of the 2017 appropriations cycle. Shepherding through appropriations legislation is the constitutional duty of the Congress, and so here we go. The passage of these bills in a timely fashion is in the best interest of the Nation. It will help provide for our national security, the stability of our economy, and give certainty to all Americans who count on the Federal Government’s programs and services. I believe this bill, in particular, starts off this process on the right foot. H.R. 4974 is a balanced, bipartisan piece of legislation that provides critical funding for our troops, their families, and our veterans. We have made a commitment to our servicemen and women that we will care for them during and after their service, and this bill helps fulfill that promise. In total, as you have heard, the bill provides $81.6 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Defense infrastructure and qualityoflife programs as well as for the Department of Veterans Affairs. This represents a $1.8 billion increase above current levels. This increase is directed to Veterans Affairs programs, which receive a 3 percent bump above fiscal year 2016 levels. Of the total $73.5 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, $52.5 billion will support the VA’s medical services, which is funding that will treat some 7 million patients this year. In particular, I want to highlight funding increases that will address mental health care, suicide prevention, hepatitis C treatment, and homelessness. The increase will also help the VA tackle some of its greatest challenges—reducing the disability claims backlog and continuing the modernization of the electronic health records system to ensure no gaps in care occur as our current troops become veterans. This bill also provides funding to support our Active Duty military and their families whether they are at home or abroad. Funding for hospitals, educational facilities, and housing tells our servicemembers that they have the full backing of their government as they lay their lives on the lines for this

Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
Page 4, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $801,000) (increased by $801,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentlewoman from Missouri and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman DENT for letting me offer this very important amendment. I thank my colleagues from the entire Missouri delegation—Mr. CLAY, Mr. CLEAVER , Mr. G RAVES , Ms. Hartzler, Mr. LONG, Mr. L UETKEMEYER , and Mr. SMITH—for their steadfast support and bipartisan cosponsorship. This amendment is critical to meeting the current and future mission requirements of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and its replacement West headquarters in north St. Louis. This amendment allocates $801,000 for land and transfer acquisition activities associated with acquiring the land for the headquarters, conforming with the Senate’s MILCON–VA bill. After an exhaustive process, the NGA identified the north St. Louis city site as a superior location because of its ability to provide the most technological, academic, and professional environment for the agency to develop the capabilities and solutions necessary to solve the country’s most vital intelligence and national security challenges. Mr. Chair, the City of St. Louis is providing the land for this project at no cost to the Federal Government. Its selection ensures that NGA West’s 70 year history in St. Louis continues and that the 2,000 NGA West employees who live in Missouri remain in close proximity to the headquarters. The St. Louis region has a proven track record in national defense and technology capabilities that make it an ideal choice for NGA’s new home. I ask that my colleagues vote in favor of this amendment to ensure NGA West can continue to perform its critical role in our national security within a community that understands its needs and strongly supports its mission. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri’s First District (Mr. CLAY). b2250 Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ) for yielding. I rise today in strong support of this amendment as offered by Mrs. WAGNER . The National GeospatialIntelligence Agency’s decision to locate their new western headquarters in north St. Louis was the right choice to support their vital national security mission, the best decision for the over 3,000 exceptional Federal employees who work there, and it will transform a great Federal failure into a transformational Federal success. The misguided and shortsighted attempt to withhold funding from this project not only is petty and parochial, it is completely irresponsible because delaying this project would put our national security at risk. NGA Director Robert Cardillo said it best in his message to his employees on April 1. Director Cardillo said: ‘‘The future of our agency and our profession rests on our present talent and that of the next generations we can recruit onto our team. We face tough competition, and offering an environment that appeals to these future generations is critical to our success. Studies point to a desire by today’s millennials to be in urban environments, and this trend is expected to continue.’’ He went on to say: ‘‘Our partnership with industry and academia will continue to grow and expand as we transform some of our work to a more open, connected and transparent environment. Our ability to engage with local universities and innovative, technologybased companies is enhanced by remaining in St. Louis city. I am confident that we will build a facility in St. Louis that will be a remarkable home for us to master our craft and engage with our partners in a flexible, technologically advanced environment that is enticing to current and future generations.’’ I urge my colleagues to support the gentlewoman’s amendment. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. The CHAIR. Does any Member claim time in opposition? Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chair, in closing, I just want to say that NGA chose St. Louis because the location best supports the agency’s mission. The superiority of the urban setting is ideal for recruiting and retaining a highly skilled workforce. When focusing on the most technological, academic, and professional environment to ensure our Nation’s security, the NGA chose St. Louis. The decision has been made, and my amendment supports the NGA’s decision. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and my colleague from the First District of Missouri. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ). The amendment was agreed to. The Clerk will read. The Clerk read as follows: 
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION , ARMYNATIONAL  GUARD  For construction, acquisition, expansion, rehabilitation, and conversion of facilities for the training and administration of the Army National Guard, and contributions therefor, as authorized by chapter 1803 of title 10, United States Code, and Military Construction Authorization Acts, $232,930,000, to remain available until September 30, 2021: Provided, That, of the amount appropriated, not to exceed $8,729,000 shall be available for study, planning, design, and architect and engineer services, as authorized by law, unless the Director of the Army National Guard determines that additional obligations are necessary for such purposes and notifies the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress of the determination and the reasons therefor. 
VETERANS INSURANCE AND INDEMNITIES  For military and naval insurance, national service life insurance, servicemen’s indemnities, servicedisabled veterans insurance, and veterans mortgage life insurance as authorized by chapters 19 and 21, title 38, United States Code, $124,504,000, to remain available until expended, of which $107,899,000 shall become available on October 1, 2017.

Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
Page 29, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $4,000,000)’’. Page 33, line 12, after the first dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $5,500,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment which seeks to redirect scarce resources to important 
mental health programs for our Nation’s veterans. At a hearing just last week entitled ‘‘Combating the Crisis: Evaluating Efforts to Prevent Veteran Suicide,’’ Chairman JEFFMILLER stated that the latest data available from the VA reports that 22 veterans per day are committing suicide. Last fiscal year, the VA General Administration account got a $15.68 million increase for more bureaucracy within the VA. This year, the Obama administration has requested another $81 million increase for that account. The committee wisely chose not to provide funding for the majority of the request in that bill, stating: ‘‘It has doubts about the wisdom of establishing a large new office with regional staffing at this late date in the administration.’’ My amendment simply transfers a portion of the fiscal year 2016 increase for government bureaucrats to important mental health services for our Nation’s heroes returning from combat. Traumatic brain injuries and post traumatic stress disorder have been consistently contributing to behavioral issues amongst our veterans; and all too often, these ongoing mental health issues result in suicide. With an average of 22 veteran suicides per day, more resources are desperately needed. While redirecting funds to where they are needed most, the Congressional Budget Office also states that this amendment would save money and reduce outlays. My amendment also helps bring the level of funding in the bill for mental health closer to the administration’s requests for the fiscal year. The VA doesn’t need more money to hire more paper pushers. Instead, let’s appropriate that money to where and whom the VA was created for: to serve and help improve the mental health of our Nation’s heroes. I applaud the committee for including my language that ensures the Veterans Crisis Line will provide an immediate response from a trained professional and for the resources already directed in this bill towards mental health. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment and help ensure our veterans that are in need get the care they so earned. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I don’t oppose the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I am certainly sympathetic to the intent of the gentleman’s amendment to increase funding for suicide prevention outreach programs. Obviously, we all know this is a very serious problem. These programs already received an 11 percent increase in our bill, for a total of $164 million. So I do not oppose the amendment, and I urge its adoption. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ). The amendment was agreed to. 
Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
Page 29, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $10,000,000) (increased by $10,000,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentlewoman from New Mexico and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Mexico. Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chair, we have a provider shortage in this country, and it is only projected to get worse. The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that the United States could face a shortage of 90,000 physicians by 2025. One of the most common complaints I hear from veterans in Albuquerque is that even with the flexibility they have to see outside providers through the Veterans Choice Act, there just aren’t enough providers—especially behavioral health providers—to treat everyone who needs care. If trends continue, we will be without the workforce needed to treat an aging population that will increasingly live with chronic health care issues. The provider shortages hit rural, poor, and underserved communities and states like New Mexico particularly hard. According to the New Mexico Health Care Workforce Committee, every single healthcare profession in New Mexico has a shortage of providers. In fact, Los Alamos, New Mexico, is the only county in the entire State without a shortage of primary health care providers. And primary care physicians are four more times available in urban areas than in rural New Mexico. The result: longer waits, longer travel, patients not receiving the care they need, and worse health outcomes. We have to educate and recruit more providers, but that will not be enough to keep up with growing demand. We have to do a better job at leveraging the resources we have to put VA providers in the best situation we can to provide quality and timely care to their patients. The Department of Veterans Affairs, the largest healthcare system in the United States, should be leading in using telehealth technology to provide care and promote patient wellness. The VHA’s Home Telehealth Program is growing and provided 2.1 million consultations to more than 677,000 veterans in 2015. But we can do much more. In a report last year, the VA Inspector General’s office found that the VA missed opportunities to serve additional patients with the Home Telehealth Program, which could have ‘‘potentially delayed the need for long term institutional care for approximately 59,000 additional veterans.’’ The VA Inspector General also found that ‘‘telehealth patients showed the best outcomes in terms of patient admissions and bed days of care.’’ It also saves money. Using telehealth instead of placing a veterans in a contract nursing home facility saves approximately $92,000 a year, and the veteran gets to stay independently at home. The VA should follow models such as the University of New Mexico’s Project ECHO and think creatively about sharing expertise among specialists, primary care physicians, and medical centers to ensure patients in underserved communities get the care they need. b2310 Mr. Chairman, the VA should increase its focus on programs that are proven to improve clinical outcomes and expand access to care while reducing treatment costs. I urge Members to support my amendment to prioritize funding for the VA Home Telehealth Program. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, but I do not oppose the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I share the gentlewoman’s concern about the importance of telehealth as a way to provide healthcare services remotely to patients. It is especially useful in the treatment of mental health and behavioral health issues. The VA is a leader in telehealth activities, providing 2.1 million consultations to more than 677,000 veterans in 2015, many of whom were in rural areas. VA funding for telehealth will total almost $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2017. I do not oppose the amendment. I urge its adoption. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. DENT. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I come from a very rural district as well, and I understand the importance of access to quality care. I agree that we need to train and recruit more health professionals. In the meantime, I agree that telemedicine is a great tool to help deal with the shortage of health professionals. 
So I support this amendment, and I urge all of the Members to do so. It will do a great deal toward helping to bring access to care to our veterans in rural communities. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM ). The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIR. The Clerk will read. The Clerk read as follows:

Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
Page 33, line 12, after the first dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $1,500,000) (increased by $1,500,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Massachusetts and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman DENT and Ranking Member BISHOP for their work on this appropriations bill, and for their cooperation with this amendment. I rise today to offer an amendment that will support a requirement of VA prescribers to complement a continuing medication course in pain management. Nationally, about 30 percent of Americans have some form of chronic pain. However, the percentage of veterans who report chronic pain is significantly higher. Over 50 percent of elderly veterans report chronic pain as do almost 60 percent of veterans returning from the conflict in the Middle East. In fact, chronic pain is the most common medical problem experienced by returning combat veterans in the last decade. Of course, pain is not a standalone problem. Pain is something we see as a consequence of physical injury, and sometimes that physical injury leads to cooccurring mental health ailments. We are increasingly more aware of the mental health consequences stemming from time in combat. Veterans with brain trauma are more likely to report physical pain and, in turn, are more likely to receive prescriptions for opioids. Recent VA data shows us that roughly 523,000 veterans are receiving prescriptions for opioids, and the number of veterans with opioid use disorders has grown 55 percent over the past 5 years. Veterans are twice as likely to overdose on prescription opioids as the general population. We are very fortunate to live in a time where quality care can be offered to our military personnel, and it is unparalleled. Now we need to do our part to help these heroes manage their chronic pain in the safest manner possible. Last month I introduced the Safe Prescribing for Veterans Act, which will help those who provide healthcare services to veterans learn the latest pain management techniques, understand safe prescribing practices, and spot the signs of potential substance use disorders. This act works by directing healthcare providers from the VA to take continuing education courses specific to pain management, opioids, and substance abuse. VA healthcare providers already need continuing education to maintain their Stateissued professional licenses, and my bill makes sure they spend some of the alreadyrequired time learning about safe opioid prescribing practices. The bill does not add to the total number of credits that prescribers already have to take, it just insists that they spend their time on this important issue. Only 14 States require their physicians to take pain management education credits. My constituents are fortunate in Massachusetts because we are 1 of the 14 States that ask its doctors to complete pain management training. However, even our neighboring States do not have the mandatory pain management requirements. Veterans in my district, especially those in the South Coast, often find it easy to receive their health care at VA hospitals in Rhode Island. As of now, there is no guarantee that the doctors they see in Providence have taken the same pain management education courses. I rise before you today in an effort to give our veterans that guarantee. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment to ensure our veterans receive the care they deserve. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not opposed to the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is addressing a problem that many Members have contacted us about, the long delays that community practitioners are experiencing in being paid by VA for their care for veterans. Our report requires VA to provide comprehensive information detailing 
the reimbursements owed to providers in each State and the amounts of invoices that are more than 6 months overdue. GAO just released a report with alarming data about VA’s significant problems in managing prompt payment to outside providers. I am sure that we will revisit this issue in conference, and we will welcome any suggestions the gentleman has for us. I have no objection to this amendment and urge its adoption. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ). The amendment was agreed to. 
Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows:

The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman DENT; full respect for what he does and, more importantly, how he does it. Agree or disagree, the gentleman does it the right way, and I appreciate his leadership style. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to offer my amendment to the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. May 30 is Memorial Day, a day we set aside to recognize the tremendous debt of gratitude for those who have selflessly sacrificed for our liberties. From constituent discussions in my district, I am acutely aware that customer service for our vets often falls short of the mark. Far too many of our vets, I am told, simply do not receive timely responses to their healthcare questions. We can do better. My amendment, which I am proposing, is directed at improving customer service problems by improving the information technology at VA facilities. My amendment would enhance veterans’ customer service experiences by funding improved, servicebased, commoditized technology and telecommunications. b2320 For this, my amendment would add $5 million to the information technology systems account, specifically the funding directed at the development, modernization, and enhancement of the current IT infrastructure. In the proposed budget, this account is currently funded at $4.23 billion, $50 million short of the President’s budget request of $4.28 billion in this area. My amendment would offset this $5 million by reducing the general administration account, currently funded at $336 million. The redirected $5 million would be used in acquiring new technologies to provide more acceptable customer satisfaction and delivery measures. I am the proud son of a veteran who served overseas. In my role in Congress, it is a great honor and privilege to serve over 100,000 veterans who call my district home. We all know vets— friends, neighbors, family, and, in my case, a nephew just returning from Afghanistan and a father who served a long time ago. Let’s do right by these brave folks by improving their customer service and response. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I do not oppose the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I certainly know the gentleman from Florida is very committed to improving veterans’ experiences when they deal with the VA, and modernizing infrastructure is certainly an important part of that. I have no objection to the amendment, and I certainly appreciate the gentleman’s deep commitment given his own father’s experience in our Armed Forces. We thank him for that service. Again, I have no objection to this amendment, and I urge its adoption. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CLAWSON ). The amendment was agreed to. 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows:

The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Massachusetts and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, again I would like to thank Chairman DENT and Ranking Member BISHOP for their work on this bill and their cooperation on this amendment. I rise today to offer a straightforward amendment that will improve our understanding of the causes of delays within the Veterans Choice Program. The Veterans Choice Program was implemented to address delays in patient care at the Veterans Administration. However, as of April of this year, data from the VA showed that the number of veterans waiting more than 30 days for an appointment was actually higher than when the Veterans Choice Program was initiated. The wellintentioned and necessary program was initiated and acknowledged. The fact is the Veterans Choice Program was cobbled together very quickly given the time constraints. This led to excessive privatization and contracting through third parties, which has contributed to frequent delays, and we are seeing these delays even today. In my district alone, I have spoken with numerous veterans who live a great distance from VA medical facilities, such as the islands of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket. My constituents rely heavily on accessibility to nonVA doctors the Veterans Choice is intended to provide. Further, an oft cited problem with Veterans Choice is the lack of clear communications regarding the eligibility requirements of the program to both veterans and nonVA providers. Understanding the obstacles around efficient scheduling of appointments of veterans and swift reimbursement for providers would serve as a crucial first step in resolving some of the issues that the Choice Program faces. Without this understanding, the program itself really isn’t beneficial. That is why I am offering this amendment, to advocate for redirected funding toward finding a solution to the delays and the communication errors plaguing implementation of Veterans Choice. I have no doubt whatsoever that every Member of Congress here agrees that our veterans deserve the very best possible care in a timely manner. Ultimately, this amendment is meant to assist the VA in identifying why these delays are occurring and to help recommend solutions. I want to thank the chairman again. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I agree with the gentleman from Massachusetts that we need to take a serious look at the Choice Program. VA’s most recent data show, compared to the last year, there are now 70,000 more appointments that kept a veteran waiting at least a month to get care. Furthermore, a March General Accounting Office report showed that the Choice Program had little impact on getting veterans to see a primary care physician in 30 days. Thousands of veterans referred to the program are returning to the VA for care, sometimes because the program could not find a doctor for them and because the private doctor they were told to see was too far away according 
to VA data. In fact, VA’s own inspector general found that in Colorado, veterans were waiting longer than 30 days for care because staff at the local VA hospital was not adding them to the list of patients eligible for the Choice Program, let alone slow reimbursements. Two years ago, Congress was hearing about the VA concealing wait times at VA hospitals and clinics and about the veterans who were suffering as a result. We were forced to act quickly in this crisis. I believe that Congress will have to revamp the Choice Program to make sure that it is doing what Congress intended for it to do. We are going to need an honest assessment from the VA. Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to support this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, but I do not oppose the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. I will just say very briefly, Mr. Chairman, I know the gentleman is very interested, as we all are, in finding ways to ensure that the VA healthcare providers receive uptodate and comprehensive training in the proper use of pain management medications. So many of our veterans struggle with chronic pain, and we have seen the tragic consequences of overprescription of opioids as a method of treatment. I appreciate the gentleman’s interest and his advocacy. I have no objections to gentleman’s amendment, and I urge adoption. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Again, Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and ranking member. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ). The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIR. The Clerk will read. The Clerk read as follows:

Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
Page 34, line 5, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $5,000,000) (increased by $5,000,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 4974, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 2017. My amendment will help reduce the VA’s claims backlog and help improve the lives of our veterans. California is home to 2 million veterans, and I am proud to represent more than 54,000 veterans in my district alone. There are 40,000 veterans expected to return to California every year for the next several years, including the fastest growing group of returning veterans—women. We must ensure that our veterans have timely access to the critical benefits they have earned and deserve. Unconscionably, thousands of veterans who have sacrificed for our country are struggling to access benefits they have already earned. Due to the lingering claims backlog at the Veterans Affairs Administration, veterans across our Nation are waiting for pensions, prescription drugs, and even lifesaving medical care. Veterans are still waiting for the VA to process 351,676 benefit claims, and 74,589 of those veterans have been waiting longer than 125 days for a decision. b2330 We owe it to our courageous men and women to clear this harmful backlog as soon as possible. Reduced to a claim number in a seemingly endless line, our veterans experience pain, frustration, hopelessness, and despair. Although the backlog has shrunk since Congress last passed a similar appropriations bill, we must not lose sight of the importance of getting veterans their hardearned benefits as soon as possible. That is why I am offering this amendment to advocate for an additional $5 million to fund the digital scanning of health and benefits files to reduce the backlog by redirecting funding within the General Operating Expenses account of the Veterans Benefits Administration. This amendment simply directs funds towards the digital scanning of health and benefits files that will reduce the claims backlog without any new spending. As an emergency medicine physician, I understand the importance of efficiency in health care, and I know how dangerous continued bureaucratic rejection can be for a person with PTSD or depression. By committing resources to digitizing health and benefits files, we will further increase VA’s capacity to tackle the claims backlog, ultimately ensuring veterans receive the benefits they have earned in a timely manner. We must serve our veterans by making certain that Congress focuses on eliminating the claims backlog for good. I encourage my colleagues to stand up for veterans and support my pragmatic amendment to reduce the veterans’ claims processing time. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, on the VA claims backlog, we have fully funded the President’s request. I have no objection to the amendment, and I am prepared to support it. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ). The amendment was agreed to. The Clerk will read. The Clerk read as follows:

Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. Actually, I have four consecutive amendments at the desk. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I reserve a point of order on the gentleman’s amendment. The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved. 
Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chair, parliamentary inquiry. The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MULVANEY. Is it possible, with the approval of the gentleman who is controlling the time for the majority, to combine amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 into a single amendment? The CHAIR. The amendments could be considered together by unanimous consent. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I respectfully object.

Copies will be made available. They are being distributed now. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I reserve a point of order until we get the amendments. The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina. Mr. MULVANEY of South Carolina. Mr. Chair, I have four consecutive amendments that are all very closely intertwined. There are actually four simply for procedural matters that I offered originally as one. I am going to argue all of them together essentially at one time because this is what they do: they get rid of the OCO budget. That is it. They get rid of the OCO budget. Title IV of this bill is the OCO budget, and my amendments seek to simply be done with this thing. Mr. Chair, it has turned into a slush fund. That is not me saying that, by the way. That is folks from both Republican and Democrat administrations, together, saying that is what this is. It may have started with the best of intentions. It may have started out of absolute necessity. It may have been a good thing when it started, but we all know what it is now, which is a place to hide money and a way to get around spending caps. That is it. Mr. Chair, I hope I get a chance over the course of the next couple of appropriations bills to talk more about the OCO and more about specific examples of how it is abused. We actually now admit that we abuse it. We admit that there is money in the OCO budget that has nothing to do with overseas contingency operations. We admit that there is money in the OCO budget right now that has nothing to do with waging war overseas. We admit that we abuse this particular account. Why? Because we can and because it is very difficult to vote against the troops. That is not the right way to appropriate money. JOHN MCCAIN, a man with whom I usually disagree on many, many things, has actually said this is not the way to appropriate money for

Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP ). Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chairman, I would like to raise some concerns I have about VA’s efforts to streamline the catalog of surgical tools that are available to VA Medical Centers. I share the VA’s goals of increasing efficiency and purchasing power. However, I am concerned that there is a reliance on singlesource contracts, and here is why: I believe singleaward contracts are too limited and will reduce choice for surgeons. As a surgeon myself, I know practitioners have specific preferences and a comfort for what tools work best in their hands. Surgical residents learn when they have more options, more techniques in front of them and innovations. Often, when surgeons are restricted, they practice elsewhere. I am concerned that limiting surgeons’ options will have an effect on the morale and retention of surgeons in the VA, and I think the last thing the VA needs right now is to lose more providers. I also know that patients have different needs. Every surgery case is unique due to the individual patient anatomy, comorbidities, et cetera. So I would just like to be assured that surgeons will have flexibility, which means more choice and better care for veterans and for our patients. Unfortunately, in my efforts to get this assurance, I get conflicting information from various sources within the VA. Multiyear, singleaward contracts are irreparable if we get them wrong. I would like to work with the chairman and the authorizing committee to conduct oversight on this issue to ensure that we do get this right because we can’t lose more surgeons and we can’t compromise care for our veterans. b0000 Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, reclaiming my time, I certainly understand the gentleman’s sincere desire to provide better care to our veterans. As it relates to the singlesource issue, single source contracts, obviously he has a great deal of expertise. I would like to work with the gentleman to get more information about the issue and work with him, but also, again, I also commend him to the authorizers, who will have a great deal of say on this matter as well. I pledge to him my commitment to work with him to try to get to a better place on this matter. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . RATCLIFFE  
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman DENT and Ranking Member BISHOP for their hard work on behalf of servicemembers and veterans all across the country. The RatcliffeMacArthurBost amendment that I am offering today with my colleagues, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MACARTHUR ) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST), will prohibit any funds made available in this act from being used to propose, plan for, or execute a new or additional round of base realignment and closure, or BRAC. My congressional district in northeast Texas is home to the Red River Army Depot, which has maintained a steadfast commitment to supporting America’s Armed Forces since 1941. While the depot has endured many challenges over the years, it has remained dedicated to fulfilling its motto: ‘‘We build it as if our lives depend on it. Theirs do.’’ Not only is the depot a vital job creator, employing more than 5,000 people in northeast Texas and southern Arkansas, it is a critical component of our national defense. The depot acts as an insurance policy for America’s security, one capable of bolstering production in a manner that simply can’t be duplicated by civilian industries. So the need for this amendment is clear. In a fiscal environment where every penny is carefully scrutinized, we have to ensure that taxpayer dollars truly address our national security needs, and another round of BRAC certainly won’t help us achieve this important goal. In addition to jeopardizing our defense readiness, BRAC has proven to be incredibly expensive. According to the Government Accountability Office, the last round of BRAC in 2005 cost the American taxpayers a whopping $35.1 billion. At the same time, the expected savings from the last round of BRAC haven’t materialized, and those promised savings have since been revised downward by 73 percent. Mr. Chairman, at a time when the terror threat level hovers at an all time high, it is especially important that we do everything possible to ensure that our military is prepared for the call of duty. The amendment that I have introduced today does just that. I urge my colleagues to support it on behalf of the safety of our Armed Forces and the American people. I yield to the chairman. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say I have no objection to the gentleman’s amendment, and I am prepared to accept it. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Oregon and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. Chairman, one of the great concerns we have is how the 2 million young Americans who were sent to Iraq and Afghanistan reintegrate back into society. Many of them return with wounds visible and invisible. We find that more than 20 percent of those 2.8 million American veterans suffer from PTSD and depression. A recent survey revealed that suicide rates among veterans are roughly 50 percent higher than among civilians. Another study found that the death rate for opioid overdoses among VA patients is nearly double the national average. What I hear from veterans that I talk to is that an overwhelming number of them say that medical marijuana has helped them deal with PTSD, pain, and other conditions, particularly as an alternative to opioids, and I would argue that it is essential that veterans be allowed access to this as a treatment if it is legal in their State. Twentyfour States, the District of Columbia, and Guam have passed laws that provide for legal access to medical marijuana at the recommendation of a physician to treat such conditions, ranging from seizures to glaucoma, anxiety, chronic pain, traumatic brain injury, and the symptoms associated with chemotherapy. Fourteen of these States specifically allow physicians to recommend medical marijuana for the symptoms of posttraumatic stress, PTSD. As a result of these medical marijuana laws, more than 2 million patients across the country, including 
many of our veterans, now use medical marijuana. Unfortunately, the Department of Veterans Affairs specifically prohibits its medical providers from completing forms brought by their patients seeking recommendations regarding a veteran’s participation in a State medical marijuana program. What this means is that those patients who want to pursue medical marijuana have to go ahead and hire a physician out of their own pocket, not dealing with the medical professional of their choice, the medical professional, their VA doctor, who knows them the best. I think that is unfortunate. I have an amendment cosponsored by Dr. JOEHECK, SAMFARR, DANA ROHRABACHER , DINATITUS, TOMREED, and others that would prohibit funds from being made available to the VA to implement this prohibition. I think it is the right thing to do for our veterans, to be able to treat them equitably, to enable them to have access to the doctor who knows them the best, giving them better treatment, and saving them money. I would respectfully request that we approve this amendment to eliminate this unjustified prohibition. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I rise up somewhat reluctantly to my friend in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized. Mr. DENT. Mr. BLUMENAUER is a very genuine and sincere, very thoughtful Member of this body. I understand that the country is evolving on this issue, as many States, including my own, have moved forward on medical marijuana. As a Member of this House, I am a bit uncomfortable, however, in trying to dictate policy on marijuana without guidance from the Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, and other medical professionals. That said, I reluctantly rise in opposition. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close. I am going to close when you have exhausted your speakers. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment that is offered by Mr. BLUMENAUER . Last year in Georgia, the general assembly passed and Governor Deal signed legislation that immediately legalized the use of medical marijuana to treat serious medical conditions. Georgia became the 36th State plus Washington, D.C., to legalize marijuana extracts to treat illnesses. I believe that we should not limit the Veterans Health Administration from providing optimal pain care for our veterans. If medical marijuana is legal in a State, then the VA should be able to discuss that treatment option and allow the veteran to make his or her own choice. I believe that the VA’s published policy guidance related to the use of medical marijuana by our veteran patients, VHA Directive 2010–035, Medical Marijuana, has become outdated. I believe that supporting a veteran’s right to use alternative methods to deal with pain is the right thing to do. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment, and I urge its adoption. I yield back the balance of my time. b0010 Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, as I said, I reluctantly oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, there is nobody who I have more respect for than my friend, the chairman of the subcommittee. But I take modest exception. This amendment does not dictate treatment options. It is not interfering, it is not superimposing anybody’s judgment about the merits of marijuana. It simply enables VA doctors and patients to interact with State legal marijuana systems—systems that this Congress has repeatedly supported through amendment votes, just like everybody else. We should not be limiting the treatment options available to our veterans. I fail to understand what the basis is to force veterans in the State of Pennsylvania who feel that they need to avail themselves of medical marijuana, like any other citizen in Pennsylvania or in Oregon has a right to do, but force them to not use the doctor that knows them best; instead, go to somebody else, hire them out of their own pocket, and be engaging with somebody who doesn’t know their full range of activity. This doesn’t engage the Veterans Administration. There is no marijuana on premises. It simply allows the doctor to be able to deal with the veteran, as a patient, to be able to counsel and potentially prescribe them, like any other person in any other State where it is legal. Bear in mind that these people are suffering from PTSD, chronic pain, depression, conditions that medical marijuana is legally entitled to treat and which veterans, who I have met with literally from coasttocoast, say has transformed their lives. What we are doing now, they are dying at a higher rate than the average member of the population. Their suicide rate is high. Their opioid addiction rate is almost twice as high as the average citizen. I think that is unconscionable. We should have this amendment to try and help address it. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon will be postponed. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . FLEMING  
Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Louisiana and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana. Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would prohibit funds from being used to modify a military installation for the purpose of housing unaccompanied alien children. Our military installations are for training and equipping soldiers to fight our Nation’s wars. The use of DOD facilities to house unaccompanied alien children undermines the readiness of our Armed Forces, which we know to be in extremis at this point. This amendment follows on from a provision included in the National Defense Authorization Act, passed out of the House Armed Services Committee, that prohibits unaccompanied alien children from being hosted on military installations. A similar standalone bill has also been introduced by Judge JOHN CARTER of Texas and has 61 cosponsors. Under recent agreements made by the Department of Health and Human Services, the DOD has provided housing to unaccompanied alien children with certain requirements and preferences being requested by HHS that facilities be able to provide space for security fencing, service trailers, and potential softsided outdoor housing. It is inappropriate for scarce defense dollars, meant to go for the readiness of our soldiers, to be used for nondefense purposes, especially at this time in our Nation’s history when our readiness is so low. Take, for example, the Army Air Defense and Artillery training site at Fort Sill, where unaccompanied minors were housed in 2014. These barracks were used by HHS, and resources had to be expended to ensure HHS contractors and the minors being hosted did not gain access to sensitive areas and live fire training ranges. Fort Hood was also on the short list for hosting unaccompanied minors in 2015. Because of this, the Texas National Guard was unable to stand up a training facility because the base was being considered to host these unaccompanied minors. 
Our military infrastructure is in serious need of upgrading and construction dollars are scarce. Mr. Chairman, the slightest use of resources to modify an installation to meet nondefense missions jeopardizes the readiness of our Armed Forces. Following on the prohibition placed in this year’s House NDAA, I ask my colleagues to support my amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman’s amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, there are no projects in the FY 17 request for this purpose in the United States. There is $33 million in funds to support the naval station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, at the request of SOCOM, Southern Command, to deal with various issues of people, obviously, who were interdicting on the seas or arriving in Cuba. But the point is, I don’t want to preclude the Department of Defense from dealing with an emergency situation, should one arise in the U.S. So that is why I must oppose my friend’s amendment. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP ), my distinguished colleague and ranking member. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chair, we have an opportunity and an obligation to help migrant children who have come across the border to escape the problems with their homeland. The challenges of poverty and violence continue to grow, and it is a moral obligation and one that I support. To not allow the use of military installations for temporary housing for migrants only exacerbates the problem. This is temporary. Why would we prohibit the use of bases only until the adjudication of a migrant’s case, for example? Is my colleague suggesting that we immediately send migrant children back to the countries they fled without due process? Should we send them back to violence? That is not what the United States stands for. It is not what the United States should stand for. It is not consistent with our country’s Christian values. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment, and I agree with the chairman. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Louisiana has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chair, I thank my friends and colleagues for their comments and statements, but I simply have to disagree. Again, this is about military readiness, which we are at a low, low point. We are getting all sorts of reports. We are having hearings from generals, commanders in the field, and generals at the Pentagon, telling us that they are scratching for every little penny they can find for readiness. In fact, just the other night on FOX News, they talked about a Marine Corps F–18. They had to go to a museum just to find a part to put on that in order for it to go into service. Look, if it is important to provide facilities for unaccompanied alien children, then the Appropriations Committee should appropriate those dollars. But they should not take them from the vital military facilities. They shouldn’t take scarce dollars away from our readiness. As a result of that, again, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chair, again, I just ask my colleagues to support this. This is common sense. We need to protect our soldiers, sailors, airmen, as well as marines. We need to make sure that they are safe out there, that every dollar is put into readiness to protect them, and it should not be diverted in this way. Again, I urge support of this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. FLEMING ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. FLEMING. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana will be postponed. b0020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to offer this amendment to the 2017 MILCONVA spending bill, and to stand today with my colleague, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO ), who has offered a stand alone bill on this same subject, along with our colleague from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ). Last year, we all remember the tragic shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, and how it reopened a painful but necessary national conversation about symbols like the Confederate battle flag that represent racism, slavery, and division. Rightfully, leaders in South Carolina and other Southern States, Democrats and Republicans alike, joined together to call on their States to end the display of the Confederate battle flag on government property. The Confederate battle flag, a symbol of hate and opposition to the United States of America, has no place, no place on government property, especially not at VA cemeteries, a place where families and loved ones go to pay respect to our Nation’s veterans. Over 150 years ago, slavery was abolished. Why in the year 2016 are we still condoning displays of this hateful symbol on our sacred national cemeteries? Symbols like the Confederate battle flag have meaning. They are not just neutral, historical symbols of pride. They represent slavery, oppression, lynching, and hate. To continue to allow national policy condoning the display of this symbol on Federal property is wrong, and it is disrespectful to what our country stands for and what our veterans fight for. Mr. Chairman, it is past time to end the public promotion of this cruel, racist legacy of the Confederacy. So let us move forward in a direction of reconciliation, unity, and justice. Symbols matter. Even General Robert E. Lee recognized that symbols of the Confederacy are symbols of treason, which is why he asked that they not appear at his funeral. The United States House of Representatives, in 2016, should be at least as forwardlooking as Robert E. Lee was in 1869. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from California is under recognition. Mr. HUFFMAN. I reserve a point of order. The CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized on his pending amendment. Mr. HUFFMAN. On the point of order? The CHAIR. On his amendment. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, my point is that the House of Representatives, in 2016, should be at least as forwardlooking as General Robert E. Lee was in 1869. Let us do the right thing tonight in this House, and let’s do it together, on a bipartisan basis. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment to the amendment. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order. The CHAIR. Will the gentleman send his amendment to the desk? 
Mr. MULVANEY. Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my amendment. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. The CHAIR. Does any Member seek time in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from California? The gentleman from California may proceed on his amendment. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I request an ‘‘aye’’ vote, and I respectfully yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by recognizing my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. DENT), the chairman of the subcommittee, for his diligence and his hard work in bringing this important bill to the floor and, more importantly, for his work on the bill, and listening to ideas coming from both sides of the aisle, and his fairness in considering all ideas as part of this bill. So I thank the gentleman for that. b0030 I rise this evening in support of an amendment that is common sense. It is a nobrainer. What this amendment would do is say, if a medical device is under review by the FDA over concerns of its harmful impacts on women, the Federal Government shouldn’t be spending taxpayer dollars to offer it to our Nation’s veterans. The medical device I am referring to is the permanent sterilization device, Essure. Essure is a permanent sterilization device that was approved by the FDA in 2002. However, since it was first approved, this device has caused irreparable harm to tens of thousands of women and their families. FDA data shows that Essure has caused the death of at least four women and nearly 300 fetal deaths. Additionally, tens of thousands of women have reported other symptoms which are debilitating. Over 25,000 women have joined together on Facebook to share their stories of how the Essure device has ruined their lives. They call themselves the Essure Sisters. They came together as a group because nobody believed them—for many, not even their doctors. They were told that this device was safe and there was no way the device caused their pain and other symptoms. But that proved to be wrong. We don’t need another study. Their pain is real. Their stories are real. They have been ignored by their doctors, by the device manufacturer, and by the Food and Drug Administration. I rise today as a voice for these women, to tell this Chamber that their stories are real, that their pain is real, and that their fight is real. Working with them over the last year, we have been able to force the FDA to call for yet another review of this flawed device, and this request was made by Democrats and Republicans in this Chamber. Yet the product remains available, sometimes aggressively pushed. And, as it relates to this appropriations bill, Essure remains on the list of federally purchased devices. We know that this device has already harmed female veterans. I want to give a direct quote from an Essure Sister and Operation Enduring Freedom veteran: ‘‘I still live in massive chronic pain, and I’m on pain meds every day of my life. I cannot do the things I used to do with my children and my husband. Each day that I live with this newfound pain and suffering, I grow more and more disgusted at the fact that both he and I traveled to the war multiple times and made it home, only to have a device forced upon us that would ruin our lives and my health.’’ Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not about women’s reproductive decisions or a debate about contraceptives. It is about protecting our female veterans from being harmed by a device that we know has ruined the lives of thousands across this Nation. All I am saying is we should not allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to purchase and implant this dangerous device in our Nation’s veterans. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition of this amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. DENT. I do want to commend Mr. FITZPATRICK for his diligence and his attentiveness to his constituency. I know he feels very sincerely about this particular amendment. It is, of course, disturbing to hear adverse consequences of any drug or device, but we rely on the FDA to be the safety arbiter in these cases. The VA simply follows FDA’s approval of drugs and devices. If anyone wants to go to the source on this, then that individual should work through the Agriculture Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the Food and Drug Administration. But I believe it is not the proper role for Congress to act as doctors in this case, substituting what appears to be anecdotal evidence for the considered judgment of teams of independent doctors and physicians. We also shouldn’t influence the marketing of birth control drugs and devices by targeting one particular manufacturer. Again, I do understand my very good friend and colleague’s sincere desire based on his conversations with constituents, but at the same time, I do think that we should let the medical experts determine the efficacy or the safety of a particular device in this case. So, again, I have to rise in opposition. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP ). Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I join my chairman in opposing this amendment. Why has my colleague again started the war on women’s rights? Why is the gentleman getting involved in the contraception choices of women veterans? Under VA Directive 1331, it is the policy of the VA to provide elective sterilization, for example, salpingectomy, tubal occlusion procedures, vasectomy, and surgery to reverse elective sterilization to eligible veterans as part of contraceptive and infertility services. I don’t see my colleague from Pennsylvania calling for a ban of funding vasectomies or even a tubal ligation, getting tubes tied. Both of these are procedures currently allowed. If a woman has decided that she is seeking permanent birth control, why is Congress going to mandate that she undergo a surgical procedure? It is important to recognize that family planning is the most effective way to prevent abortion and unwanted pregnancies. Study after study show that when women have access to contraceptives, the incidence of abortion decreases. Family planning programs are an extremely effective way to support women in improving their own health and that of their families. Why would anyone insist on government interference in providing health care to women? This amendment also demonstrates the deeply troubling and partisan approach on issues affecting women and families. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FITZPATRICK. In closing, Mr. Chairman, I would say, with all due respect, this is about a dangerous medical device, and there are men and women on both sides of the aisle here in the House of Representatives that have called on the FDA to withdraw 
the device from the market. There are other options. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the time on the floor tonight. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). The amendment was rejected. 
Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, Grayson No. 1. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. GRAYSON (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the reading be waived. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is identical to other amendments that have been inserted by voice vote into every appropriations bill considered under an open rule during the 113th and 114th Congresses. My amendment expands the list of parties with whom the Federal Government is prohibited from contracting due to serious misconduct on the part of the contractors. I hope that this amendment will remain noncontroversial and be passed unanimously again by the House. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I have no objection. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, again, I have no objection to the gentleman’s amendment. He offered the same amendment last year, and it passed by voice vote. So I certainly urge adoption of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GRAYSON ). The amendment was agreed to. 
Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
b0040 Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the gentleman’s amendment. The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Louisiana and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chairman, our veterans have put their lives on the line to protect this country. The very least we can do is keep our promise to take care of them when they return home. But since the passage of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, the VA has demonstrated little progress in addressing the emergency medical claims processing backlog hurting our veterans. When I pressured the VA for statistics on this issue last year, the VA was processing only 14 percent of the claims within 30 days in my home region—14 percent. Since that time, the VA has conveniently loosened their timely processing goal from 30 days to 45 days, making it impossible to measure real progress. Despite this change in internal procedure, not a single VISN has reached a satisfactory timely processing rate. When these claims are not paid on time by the VA, the bill often gets passed onto the veteran—in many cases, threatening their personal credit rating. This is just unacceptable. While the VA wants to claim it is making progress by changing internal metrics to cook the numbers, it has taken constant pressure from my office, providers, and veterans groups just to get this agency to pay attention and try to do their job. American veterans should never have to worry about calling an ambulance or taking a trip to the emergency room and wondering whether this will hurt their finances. They should be focused on their health and their recovery. My amendment is very simple. It prevents the VA from granting bonuses to its emergency medical care claims processing staff until the percentage of claims processed within 30 days reaches 90 percent. Mr. Chairman, no business in my home State of Louisiana, or anywhere in this country, would ever think about rewarding its employees for such a poor performance. It has to change. We must demand the highest standard for America’s veterans. I encourage my colleagues to hold the VA accountable and support this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. POINT OF ORDER  
Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order. The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and, accordingly, violates clause 2 of rule XXI. The rule states in pertinent part: ‘‘An amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.’’ The amendment gives affirmative direction in effect. So I would ask for a ruling from the Chair. The CHAIR. Does the gentleman from Louisiana wish to be heard on the point of order? Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chairman, I respect the gentleman’s call on this with regard to the rules. I would just hope that the members of the subcommittee, as well as my colleagues in the House, would work with us to solve this problem once and for all. This is unacceptable. Veterans are getting hurt day in and day out. Their credit ratings are suffering. This is one more egregious example—— The CHAIR. The gentleman’s remarks must be confined to the point of order. Mr. BOUSTANY. I am not going to defy the point of order. I understand the rule. The CHAIR. Does the gentleman wish to withdraw his amendment? 
Mr. BOUSTANY. No. The CHAIR. Or would the gentleman like a ruling on the point of order? Mr. BOUSTANY. I would like a ruling on the point of order. The CHAIR. The Chair is prepared to rule. The Chair finds this amendment includes language imparting direction; namely, by requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit quarterly data to Congress. The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI. The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the gentleman’s amendment. The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Chairman, it should be pretty straightforward. My friends on the other side of the aisle continue to push forward amendments that seem to want to leave the appearance that the Republican Party still wants to retain some fight that it has never had. The Republican Party opposed slavery. The Republican Party and everybody that I know of in this Chamber on this side of the aisle has never supported slavery, has never supported anything that wreaks of slavery. Daniel Webster, John Quincy Adams, all of those early leaders in this country, had it very right—it is an abomination. It kept God from blessing this country. I am surprised that anyone would wish to reserve a point of order to try to prevent this amendment from going forward. Anything, as my friends across the aisle have repeatedly pointed out, that reminds people of slavery is repugnant and is abhorrent, and I would think that that is something that we could all agree on. If it is an organization that supported slavery, then why would we want to give that organization any more credence and cause those who may have lived through the vestiges of the civil rights problems that lasted after slavery? It is time to put this to an end and let the dream of Dr. King finally come to fruition. I reserve the balance of my time. POINT OF ORDER  
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I must insist on my point of order. The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI. The rule states in pertinent part: ‘‘An amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.’’ The amendment requires a new determination. I ask for a ruling from the Chair. The CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to speak to the point of order? b0050 Mr. GOHMERT. I would address the point of order in that it really doesn’t require any new act or law or activity. The thing should speak for itself unless my friend across the aisle has some concerns that some organization he wants to protect has supported slavery, and he is seeking to protect that. Otherwise, the law will speak for itself as does this amendment. The CHAIR. The Chair is prepared to rule. The Chair finds that this amendment includes language requiring a new determination of whether an organization had ‘‘embraced’’ any form of slavery. The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI. The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair, but given the hour, the fact that there aren’t that many of us here on the floor at this time, that it would require a quorum and would require under the rules an immediate vote, what I will do is withdraw my amendment at this time. I am assured that we will still be taking up limitation amendments in the morning, and I can offer it at that time without dragging all of our friends out of their places of repose at this time. The CHAIR. The amendment has been ruled out of order. The appeal is withdrawn. Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. PERRY ) having assumed the chair, Mr. COLLINS of Georgia, Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4974) making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Mr. SWALWELL of California (at the request of Ms. PELOSI ) for today and the balance of the week on account of a family health emergency.
