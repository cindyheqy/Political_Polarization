Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, it has been a difficult week in northern Illinois. A little over a week ago, torrential rains fell on Wisconsin and northern Illinois. Four Illinois counties have been named disaster areas: Lake County, McHenry County, Kane County, and Cook County. As difficult as it is, it is an incredibly impressive thing to visit these communities, particularly Algonquin, Port Barrington, and Fox River Grove, among others, all in the Sixth Congressional District. What you will witness is literally hundreds of volunteers following through and filling thousands of bags of sand to help their neighbors. Municipal employees, first responders, local leaders, the Governor of Illinois, and members of the Illinois delegation have all come together in order to meet our neighbors’ needs at this time. For those of you who are people of faith, I ask that you would pray for these families as they are going through this difficult time. Also, I commend those at home who have lent a hand. 
HONORING REVEREND DR. HOWARD W. PARKER, JR. (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to honor the Reverend Dr. Howard W. Parker, Jr., who has served as pastor of historic Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church located in Greenville, North Carolina, for more than 35 years, and will soon retire. The son of Howard and Bernice Parker, Dr. Parker excelled academically, attending Shaw University, WinstonSalem State University, Wake Forest University, and United Christian College, ultimately receiving a master of divinity degree and an honorary doctor of divinity degree. Under his devoted leadership, Mr. Speaker, Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church has grown in membership and has become a giant in the Greenville community. In addition to leading his congregation, Dr. Parker served as president of the North Carolina General Baptist State Convention, which represents more than a half a million Missionary Baptists in 1,700 North Carolina congregations. Dr. Parker’s commitment to the community has stretched far beyond the pulpit. He was twice elected to the Pitt County Board of Education and served as the board’s chair. He serves as associate chaplain of the Greenville Police Department and is a member of the Greenville Initiative on Gang Violence. Dr. Parker is married to the former Ruby LaVerna Grantham from Goldsboro. They are the proud parents of two adult children, Kelly and Andrea. His distinguished career and life of unselfish and dedicated service to mankind has positively impacted the lives of so many. His contributions to the community are far and wide, and too numerous to mention. I ask my colleagues this morning to join me in honoring Reverend Dr. Howard W. Parker, Jr., and thank him for his important service to God and humanity. We wish him well in the years to come. 
CONGRESSIONAL PAYER STATE CAUCUS (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce the formation of the Congressional Payer State Caucus. I join my colleague, Congressman BILLFOSTER from Illinois, in leading this bipartisan caucus that will examine the disparity States like New Jersey and Illinois experience by paying more in Federal taxes than we receive in Federal spending. In fact, New Jersey is dead last, with a rate of return of just 77 cents for every Federal tax dollar sent to Washington. The caucus seeks to recommend legislation to ensure that donor States keep more of their hardearned funds. For example, working to maintain the State and local tax deduction when this body considers an overhaul of our Nation’s Tax Code. Eliminating that deduction would further increase the disparity that already exists. Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers about his fear that the Federal Government might monopolize taxation to the ‘‘entire exclusion and destruction of State governments.’’ The caucus will work to address this problem and for a greater return on the tremendous Federal revenue stream from economic activity and innovation in New Jersey and other States. 
ENCOURAGING GIRLS TO TAKE UP COMPUTER SCIENCE (Ms. ROSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, in Nevada and across the country, we are continuing to see a huge demand for workers in the technical industry, including software developers; engineers; and computer programmers, like myself. Despite the progress we have made, fewer than one in five computer science graduates are women. I am proud to introduce my bill, H.R. 3316, the Code Like a Girl Act, because I believe in breaking down barriers and closing the gender gap once and for all. This bipartisan legislation invests in computer science education, opening doors for women to become part of a highly skilled workforce. Funding programs that encourage girls to take up computer science is one of the most important steps we can take to break down barriers and level the playing field for women everywhere. The Code Like a Girl Act will go one step further by teaching our girls that zero is false, one is true, and that we matter, too. I encourage my colleagues to invest in our girls by supporting my bill. 
MADE IN AMERICA WEEK (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the spirit of Made in America Week. Since taking office in January, I have had the privilege and honor of meeting with American workers and smallbusiness owners in my district, from manufacturers to the farmers who feed our community and our world. Unfortunately, we have seen far too many of our jobs leave this country. I am focused on addressing the problems in our economy that are destroying jobs and stalling growth. We have already made significant progress in reducing the regulatory burdens that make it hard for businesses large and small to survive. Congress has passed and the President has signed 14 Congressional Review Acts overturning excessive and ridiculous regulations. I look forward to passing comprehensive tax reform that is simpler and fairer for all Americans so individuals can keep more of their paycheck and for jobs to stay in America. I will continue to advance solutions to help Americans gain skills needed to compete in our changing workforce. Mr. Speaker, let’s remain focused on keeping jobs in America and products made in America. f 
FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF COLORADO SHOOTING (Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, July 20, 5 years ago, we had a terrible tragedy in Colorado. Twelve young people were killed, 70 were injured, and countless suffered emotional trauma. Today I want to recognize these 12. Despite the tragedy we suffered and the impact on our community, there were at least two bright spots: the response of law enforcement, firefighters, ambulance drivers, and medical personnel in dealing with what was a war zone. Over the 5 years, the families have come together and become great friends, recognizing and celebrating the lives of the people who were taken by that crazed shooter. I want to recognize them, I want to recognize the dedicated people who assisted them, and just let everybody know that we won’t forget. Time goes on and the memories dim a little bit, but these were great young people. Our first responders were wonderful. 
RECOGNIZING GREG ELLIOT (Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a truly outstanding constituent in the field of healthcare, Greg Elliot of Charleston, West Virginia. He has been selected this year as one of the recipients of the prestigious Joe Warner Patient Advocacy Award. The National Center for Assisted Living, the Nation’s largest association of professional longterm healthcare providers, bestows this annual award on association members who have worked diligently to educate Members of Congress about the needs of longterm care patients, and to advance the quality in the longterm and postacute care community. Mr. Elliot is a secondgeneration owner of AMFM, which operates 17 longterm, skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers throughout West Virginia. Greg is frequently in Washington visiting my congressional office, advocating on behalf of West Virginia seniors. The thirdparty research institute, My InnerView, has ranked AMFM facilities in the top 10 percent in the Nation 46 times for customer or employee satisfaction. Greg Elliot resides in Charleston with his wife of 16 years, Jennifer; his 10yearold daughter, Elizabeth; and their two dogs. Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Greg for his years of dedication and care to our Nation’s frail, elderly, and disabled. His career reflects the ideals embodied in the Joe Warner Patient Advocacy Award. f 
LET’S WORK TOGETHER ON HEALTHCARE (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, many health insurance executives say they are raising premiums and leaving exchanges because of uncertainty and the threat of not paying the costsharing reductions and not funding them. Brad Wilson, CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina told The Washington Post in May: ‘‘The failure of the administration and the House to bring certainty and clarity by funding CSRs has caused our company to file a 22.9 percent premium increase, rather than one that is materially lower.’’ We need a bipartisan solution to stabilize exchanges. We need to stop threatening not to pay the CSRs. I introduced the Marketplace Certainty Act, which provides stability by permanently funding and expanding eligibility for these subsidies. This is pragmatic, commonsense legislation to stop premiums from skyrocketing, keep insurers in exchanges, and help people struggling to afford healthcare. I urge Republicans and Democrats to put people over partisanship and solutions above ideology by working together, by sponsoring my bill, and helping American families afford healthcare. 
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION FOR RUSSIA INVESTIGATION (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, since last year, when our intelligence community concluded that Russia sought to influence our elections, we have seen a series of terrifying headlines. This has not stopped. Last week, we found out the President’s son took a meeting in which he anticipated receiving from the Russian Government damaging information on the Democratic nominee. This was after it was spelled out in black and white in an email that the information came from the Kremlin. Donald, Jr.’s, response: I love it. But now we must go further. We need an independent commission, which Congress can authorize. Speaker RYAN, these issues go beyond party. They go to the heart of our democracy. The American people deserve the truth. Allow a vote on an independent commission before the August recess. 
b0915 ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, and I want to commend and congratulate my two good friends, Chairman MCCAUL and Ranking Member THOMPSON , and the members of the Homeland Security Committee and their staff for their work on this important bill. This Congress, eight committee chairmen agreed to work together on the Department of Homeland Security reauthorization. I did so because securing our Nation’s homeland is extremely important to the American people. I also believe it is our duty to work together to support fellow chairmen on their priorities, especially large reauthorizations like this. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee marked up two authorizations in our jurisdiction that are included in this bill: the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Coast Guard authorization supports service missions to enforce all Federal laws on the high seas and in U.S. waters. It does so by providing a variety of acquisition authorities to help lower costs, requiring a landbased unmanned aircraft system program, eliminating redundant training requirements, and providing the Coast Guard parity with other armed services in matters related to healthcare and retirement. On FEMA, the bill provides the first ever reauthorization of the agency to ensure accountability and strong congressional oversight. It includes a number of provisions to help address 21st century challenges to disaster preparedness and response and to support energy response personnel. Both of our reauthorizations were bipartisan efforts and approved with bipartisan support. Again, I thought it was important to move these measures through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to support Chairman MCCAULand Ranking Member THOMPSON and their legislative priorities. I want to thank them both again for their work. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. b0930 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS ). Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill, and particularly the provision that creates a new competitive grant program designed to preserve core capability gains achieved with previous Urban Area Security Initiative, UASI, grant funding. The UASI program provides critical Federal support to local law enforcement in large metropolitan areas to help them protect their residents and visitors. I was the police chief in Orlando when Orlando was initially approved for UASI funding, and, therefore, I know firsthand how critical such Federal support is to Orlando and other large metropolitan areas. Orlando, a number one destination, is now where an ISISinspired terrorist took the lives of 49 people and injured many more, the deadliest in our Nation’s history. As first responders from my district responded to the scene, the dedicated staff and analysts of the Central Florida Intelligence Exchange, CFIX, a member of DHS’ National Network of Fusion Centers, sprung into action together and shared information. Together, the courageous first responders and CFIX saved lives and helped to quickly identify the perpetrator. The capabilities that led to their successful response were created through previous grant investments, in particular, the Urban Area Security Initiative. Unfortunately, such Federal funding capabilities and preparedness can be severely diminished or even lost. My concern is this: What will happen to the capabilities developed with previous grant support now that the funding is no longer available? The bill today would create a $39 million competitive grant program for former UASI cities and would make sure that core capability gains achieved with previous grant funding were supported and maintained. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida. Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, as Secretary Kelly acknowledged before the Committee on Homeland Security last month, the threat of terrorism has metastasized around the country. Whether it is New York City, the largest municipality in the country, or some other small town in the middle of Arkansas, the potential is about the same, in my view, for a lonewolf attack. That was how the Secretary described it last week, and I could not agree with him more. The demands on local law enforcement are even more increasing, ever changing, and more complex. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and our ranking member for their vision and commitment to keeping our homeland safe. Do we have any greater purpose? Reauthorization of the Department is long overdue and I commend the Chairmen and Ranking Members for their commitment to working together, in a bipartisan fashion, to accomplish what had not been possible for so many years. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill and particularly the provision that creates a new competitive grant program designed to preserve core capability gains achieved with previous Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) grant support. The UASI program provides critical federal support to local law enforcement in large metropolitan areas to help them protect their residents and visitors. I was the police chief when Orlando was initially approved for UASI funding and, therefore, I know firsthand how critical such federal support is to Orlando and other large metropolitan areas. Orlando, a number one destination, is now where an ISIS–inspired terrorist took the lives of 49 people and injured many more. As first responders from my district responded to the scene, the dedicated staff and analysts at the Central Florida Intelligence Exchange (CFIX)—a member of DHS’ National Network of Fusion Centers—sprung to action to gather and share information. Together, the courageous first responders and CFIX saved lives and helped identify the perpetrator. The capabilities that led to their successful response were created through previous grant investments, in particular the Urban Area Security Initiative. Unfortunately, such federally funded capacities and preparedness can be severely diminished or even lost. My concern is this: what will happen to the capabilities developed with previous grant support now that funding is no longer available? The bill before us today would create a $39 million competitive grant program for former UASI cities, and would make sure that core capability gains achieved with previous federal grant support are maintained. As Secretary Kelly acknowledged before the Committee on Homeland Security last month, the threat of terrorism ‘‘has metastasized around the country, whether it’s New York City, the largest municipality in the [ ] country, or some little town in the middle of Arkansas, the [ ] potential is about the same in my view for a lone wolf attack.’’—that was how the Secretary described it last week. My constituents in Florida know, all too well, the truth of the Secretary’s words. No city in America can afford to go backwards; to lose ground on preparedness. The demands on local law enforcement are ever increasing, ever changing, and more complex than ever before. The federal government must continue to be a strong partner to local law enforcement who are our first line of defense. I thank the Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security for his support of this program The bill would also require the Government Accountability Office to perform an independent review of the risk formula and award 
processes for the UASI program, as well as the State Homeland Security Grant Program. The preparedness of urban areas and the threats they face has changed since the programs were created after the 9/11 attacks, and this report will assess the current process used to collect and evaluate threat information in order to ensure grant funds are provided where they are needed most. I am also pleased that this bill would reject a proposal, put forth earlier this year by President Trump in his first budget, which called for transitioning almost 1,100 Transportation Security Officers currently staffing airport exit lanes to security checkpoints. The elimination of exit lane staffing in budget proposal is problematic for a few reasons. First, exit lane staffing responsibilities and expenses would be shifted to local airport authorities. The primary responsibility for security of the traveling public should remain in the hands of the TSA. Second, elimination of such staffing would directly contradict the statutory language of the Bipartisan Budget Agreement of 2013 that requires TSA to monitor passenger exit points from the sterile areas of airports. As a former Captain of the Airport Division of the Orlando Police Department, and a 27 year veteran of law enforcement, I can tell you: There is no question about it. TSA is responsible for exit lane staffing. Eliminating federal exit lane staffing would not enhance our nation’s security, and doing so would be a contravention of the existing statutory requirement. I offered an amendment in the Homeland Security Committee, which was accepted, that explicitly authorizes funding at the Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 level for exit lane coverage through Fiscal Year 2019. As a result, the bill before us today sends a clear message to the Administration that we will not stand for TSA attempting to foist its Congressionallymandated duties onto its local partners. Again, I thank the Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security for his support of these measures, and I thank Ranking Member Thompson for his vision and commitment to keeping our homeland safe. Do we have any other greater purpose? I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and I want to thank him for his close coordination in getting to this day. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee for yielding and for his longtime work on this authorization. Authorizing all of the Cabinet Departments is important, but it is crucial that Congress reauthorize the Department of Homeland Security. The American people must have faith that DHS will serve to protect this Nation, and this authorization demonstrates Congress’ commitment to the critical missions being performed daily by this diverse Department. This bill is the product of collaboration between several committees, and the Judiciary Committee greatly contributed to this bill as it authorizes three component agencies within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee: the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the United States Secret Service. Make no mistake: we authorize the Department and its agencies to carry out each and every duty and utilize every tool necessary to keep America safe. While the bill does contain much of the authorizing language as reported out of the Judiciary Committee, it does not reflect all of our important work on the ICE and USCIS authorizations. It is critical that these two DHS components have all the tools necessary to carry out their functions. H.R. 2825 should have explicitly included such tools as the clear congressional intent to ensure that these agencies have them at their disposal in order to enforce the laws. I do support this bill because it is an important step in ensuring that ICE and USCIS can continue to perform at a very high level. This Congress must soon finish the job, however, and ensure that these agencies have the resources and legislative support that they need to enforce our immigration laws in the interior of the United States. The House must pass the Judiciary Committee’s enforcement bills, including the DavisOliver Act, the Protection of Children Act, the Refugee Program Integrity Restoration Act, and the Legal Workforce Act, among others. I intend to see these bills on the House floor in the near future, and I look forward to fulfilling our promise so that DHS can truly fulfill its mission. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BARRAGA ´N), who represents the largest container port in the Nation, the port of L.A.–Long Beach. Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 2825. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank my colleagues on the Homeland Security Committee for adopting my amendment to provide $45 million to reimburse local law enforcement at airports. There has been an increase in the tax at airports, including at my home airport of LAX, and this funding is vital to keeping our airports secure and our economy moving. Both sides compromised to move this bill forward, and the programs in it are critical to the security of our ports, our borders, and our homeland. Going forward, we can do more to add more funding at the ports. I represent America’s port, the Port of Los Angeles. Our ports are the Nation’s largest border crossings, so we must invest in funding security at the ports. The port security grants I proposed in my committee are crucial to the cyber and physical safety programs at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, and without increased funding, they have been forced to stop several innovative and important projects. I will continue to fight for increased port security funding. I am determined to fill the staffing and funding gaps in maritime security and give our ports what they need to be safe and efficient. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this reauthorization, but we have more work to do. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ), chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications of the Homeland Security Committee. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2825, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017, which will reauthorize the Department for the very first time. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I am particularly proud of title VI of division A, which includes provisions of my legislation, the PREPARE Act. The bill reauthorizes critical grant programs responsible for helping first responders while measuring the returns on these investments. It ensures first responders in fusion centers receive information on cybersecurity threats. It requires FEMA to assess how homeland security grant funding has closed capability gaps and provides grant recipients with best practices to ensure fiscally responsible use of taxpayer dollars. It requires the Department to consider the impact of emerging technology while supporting efforts to achieve national interoperable emergency communications. The grant’s authorization provisions have received the support of the Police Commissioner of the City of New York, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Fusion Center Association, the Major County Sheriffs of America, and the Conference of Mayors. I include these letters of support in the RECORD . 
THEPOLICE COMMISSIONER , CITY OF NEWYORK, New York, NY, June 12, 2017. Chairman MICHAEL MCCAUL, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAUL: New York City remains the nation’s top terror target because of its large population, historic landmarks, iconic tourist destinations, and unique international status. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is steadfast in fulfilling our mission to protect millions of New York City residents, as well as the millions of people who work in and visit our city each year. The NYPD supports the new funding levels proposed in the PREPARE Act. These levels reflect a willingness to ensure that Law Enforcement is equipped with the tools to keep our communities safe. The bill demonstrates an understanding that we are safest when federal resources are focused where the threats are. 
The PREPARE Act would provide a crucial investment in homeland security preparedness, both for the safety of New York City and the entire nation. This investment is particularly important in light of the recent events in Europe and the expressed goals of a variety of groups seeking to recruit individuals from within our borders to carry out mass casualty attacks. Federal funding is essential to allow law enforcement to adapt to the new challenges by developing innovative technology and enhanced preparedness programs, like the NYPD’s Counterterrorism Bureau Training Unit. I strongly support passage of the PREPARE Act and urge you to continue to place the highest priority on protecting New York and other highthreat urban areas. Increasing funding for these key programs is critical to further ensuring our nation’s security and preparedness. Thank you for your continued support of the New York City Police Department. All the best, JAMES P. O’N EILL, Police Commissioner. 
OFFIRECHIEFS , Fairfax, VA, June 13, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN MCCAUL: On behalf of the nearly 12,000 fire and emergency service leaders of the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I express our support for Title VI of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017 (H.R. 2825). This legislation will play an important role in helping our nation’s fire and emergency service personnel to respond to the escalating number of threats that we face. As recent events have shown, the terrorist threat presents a wide variety of tactics and techniques. For any type of terrorist attack, local first responders will be the first on scene and will have to provide an immediate response. This fact means that local first responders must be ready to respond to explosives; active shooter incidents; complex, coordinated attacks; and threats of biological or chemical terrorism. The federal government can provide valuable training and equipment as incentives to help states and local governments develop multidisciplinary approaches to future threats. Title VI of the substitute amendment has a number of provisions that will help local first responders, including: Annually authorizing $800 million for the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) program and $600 million for the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) from Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 through FY 2022. Allowing the use of SHSGP and UASI funds to develop medical preparedness and surge capacity in case of a biological attack, including medical kits to protect first responders and their families; Protecting the grant programs, like SHSGP and UASI, from consolidation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency without congressional authorization; Authorizing a grant program to help emergency response providers plan, train and prepare for complex, coordinated attacks; Expanding the role of the Chief Medical Officer to authorize the development of policies to protect first responders from the medical effects of acts of terrorism; and Protecting the Office of Emergency Communications, which is a valuable resource for improving public safety communications interoperability, from elimination or consolidation without congressional authorization. The IAFC appreciates your leadership in ensuring that local first responders are prepared to mitigate the increasing number of threats facing our nation. An effective response by local first responders at the beginning of a terrorist attack will help save lives and reduce the success of an act of terrorism. This legislation will help the nation’s fire and EMS personnel prepare for these threats. We urge the committee members to support your substitute amendment to H.R. 2825. Sincerely, Fire Chief JOHND. S INCLAIR , President and Chairman of the Board. 
NATIONAL FUSION  CENTER ASSOCIATION , June 13, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Hon. BENNIE THOMPSON , Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAUL AND RANKING  MEMBER THOMPSON : I write on behalf of the National Fusion Center Association (NFCA) in support of provisions in the PREPARE Act that will strengthen preparedness of the homeland. The PREPARE Act would make meaningful improvements in the way the Federal government supports terrorism prevention activities carried out by fusion centers in collaboration with the larger group of public safety partners including components of the Department of Homeland Security. The bill would reauthorize key preparedness grant programs with improvements in the way the grants are administered, including with meaningful input from the law enforcement communities in each state. It would strengthen the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Activities requirement that is in existing law by fostering enhanced engagement among law enforcement practitioners and key offices within DHS including the Office of State and Local Law Enforcement and FEMA. The bill also takes productive steps to help Federal, state, and local partners share information on cyber threats. Ensuring effective collaboration and preparedness regarding cyber threats is becoming more important, and the PREPARE Act would be helpful on this front by encouraging the timely analysis and sharing of threat information. We commend your consistent and aggressive efforts to find ways for Congress to foster improved collaboration and coordination by Federal, state, local, and private entities to protect the homeland. We have made great progress, but we have much more work to do. The PREPARE Act is the latest example of your dedication to this purpose, and we look forward to working with you and your colleagues to ensure effective legislation is enacted. Sincerely, MIKESENA, President. 
MAJOR COUNTY SHERIFFS OF AMERICA , Alexandria, VA, June 9, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL MCCAUL, House Homeland Security Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAUL: As Vice Presidents of the Major County Sheriffs of America (MCSA) in charge of Homeland Security and Government Affairs, we write to thank you for your leadership and support of local law enforcement through the FY18 grant authorizations found within Title VI of H.R. 2825, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017. MCSA is an association of elected Sheriffs representing the nation’s largest counties with populations of 500,000 people or more. Collectively, we provide public safety services to over 100 million residents and have a unique understanding of the national security challenges facing our nation. Since September 11, 2001, our country has made great progress in our nation’s ability to prepare for, respond to and prevent terrorist attacks; however, in an era of deep budget cuts and reduced federal funding, state and local law enforcement do not have sufficient funds by themselves to support the homeland security mission. Federal funding such as the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) which includes the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) work to address gaps in local agency capabilities for responding to terrorist threats in the homeland. Authorizing UASI at $800 million and SHSP at $600 million is critical to our efforts. Local capabilities that have been built in part through UASI and SHSP funds are not selfsustaining and require consistent federal support to maintain a level of vigilance against threats. This requires an active, and invested level of collaboration with our partner agencies to maintain a level of preparedness that our citizens deserve and expect. There also remains a strong need for the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Activities (LETPA) requirement that is in current law. Under this provision, 25% of all UASI and SHSP funds that are received by a state must be used for LETPA. If this requirement was removed, there would be zero dedicated federal support for terrorism prevention activities, which is a unique role of law enforcement. Based on what we have recently seen all over the world, now is not the time to step away from this critical activity. On a related note, there should be much more formal local law enforcement input into FEMA’s grant guidance and prioritization processes to ensure transparency in the policy directives, grant guidance, and risk formulas. We greatly appreciate your leadership and we thank you and Committee staff for working honestly and collaboratively with the MCSA. Please let us know if we can be of further assistance as we continue our work to protect the homeland. Very Respectfully, Sheriff MICHAEL J. BOUCHARD , Oakland County (MI), MCSA VP—Government Affairs. Sheriff RICHARD STANEK , Hennepin County (MN), MCSA VP— Homeland Security. 
THEU.S. C ONFERENCE OF MAYORS , Washington, DC, June 19, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL MCCALL, Chairman, Homeland Security Committee, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN MCCALL: I write on behalf of The United States Conference of Mayors to indicate our support for the provisions relating to the homeland security grant programs in H.R. 2825, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017. At a time of growing concern about the terror threat to our cities, it is important to have a stable fiveyear source of funding that helps us prevent and respond to attacks. While we appreciate the authorization levels you have included in the bill and understand the funding constraints you faced in drafting the bill, we must be clear that more funding is needed to help keep our cities safe. This applies, of course, both to designated higher risk jurisdictions and to the many areas not in that category, or no longer in that category, which have critical infrastructure and other risk factors which would suggest their need for assistance. 
We also appreciate your inclusion of language that would require authorization from Congress for any grant consolidation proposals and the maintenance of the law enforcement terrorism prevention setaside, a provision of great importance to our police departments. The nation’s mayors appreciate your leadership on homeland security and other issues and look forward to working with you and the Committee to see these provisions enacted into law. Sincerely, TOMCOCHRAN , CEO and Executive Director. 
Mr. DONOVAN. I am also pleased a number of the provisions provided by the Committee on Homeland Security are included in division F of this bill. These provisions authorize FEMA’s senior law enforcement adviser, ensure an appropriate focus on good management practices at FEMA, support vital training programs for first responders, and codify the Office of Disability Integration and Coordination to ensure individuals with disabilities are integrated into disaster preparedness and response efforts. I look forward to continuing to work with Subcommittee Chairman BARLETTA of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee as this bill progresses through the process. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Chairman MCCAULfor his leadership in getting this bill through the committee and onto the floor, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the committee for doing a historic reauthorization of this historic Department that came in the backdrop of the most heinous and singular terrorist act in terms of the beginning part of the 21st century to come together with this important statement about securing the homeland. This year will mark the 15th year of the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland security is defined as ‘‘the national effort to ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards where American interests, aspirations, and ways of life can thrive . . . .’’ This is what I hope this bill will do. I want to take special note of two of the subagencies in this bill in particular, taking note of the killing of Gerardo Hernandez, the first TSA officer in the line of duty to be killed, in Los Angeles, and the machete attack on Carol Richel at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. We owe a great deal of appreciation and thanks to the Transportation Security Administration and the TSOs. I personally thank them for the work that they do to be front line in securing America. I also want to express my appreciation for the Secret Service, who, of course, through challenges, have continued to work to protect America’s most important leadership, the President in particular. I thank them for their service. I also want to make mention of the fact that I was very appreciative of the number of amendments that I was able to get in. The Jackson Lee amendments included mandates that the Department of Homeland Security add a new provision to the duties of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, which directs that the Department recognize as part of their mission to preserve individual liberty, fairness, and equality under the law. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi, the ranking member. Mr. Speaker, my second amendment deals with the multiyear acquisition strategy, keeps pace with changes in technology. This amendment makes sure that the agency’s purchases are most uptodate. My third amendment deals with the fusion centers and will develop, keep uptodate, and make available information on Federal resources intended to support fusion centers across America. My fourth amendment would add to the list of DHS components, including the chief medical officer, to allow them to enter into MOUs so that they can be most helpful across the country. My other amendment deals with preparedness, ensuring that the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium includes a special directive regarding preparedness in urban areas. Finally, let me say that we have oversight over ICE and the immigration services. I think it is important to note that ICE has to be responsible, not seeking to raid and deport individuals who have been in this country, who are paying their taxes, and who have options to be able to stay in this country. I hope this reauthorization recognizes that we need comprehensive immigration reform and that ICE is important, but it must restrain its reckless way of deporting individuals. Mr. Speaker, I rise in speak in strong support of H.R. 2825, the Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017, which is the first authorization bill for the Department of Homeland Security since its creation. I thank Chairman MCCAUL and Ranking Member THOMPSON for working diligently to bring before the House of Representatives the authorization legislation. As a Senior member of the Committee on Homeland Security, and former Chair of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security, now known as the Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee, as well as the former Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, I am very much aware of the importance of the work performed by the men and women who protect us from terrorism. Homeland Security is defined as: ‘‘the national effort to ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards where American interests, aspirations, and ways of life can thrive to the national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce the vulnerability of the U.S. to terrorism, and minimize the damage from attacks that do occur.’’ This year will mark the 15th year the Department of Homeland Security has been in existence and we owe the men and women who serve on the front line of defending our people of the United States against terrorist acts at home. DHS’s mission is to secure the nation from the many threats we face. DHS is securing our nation through the dedication and hard work of the more than 229,000 employees to serve the nation in jobs that range from aviation and border security to emergency response, from cybersecurity analyst to chemical facility inspector. The Department of Homeland Security has many challenges—the greatest of which is overcoming serious morale problems. This authorization will accomplish a great deal, but the underlying central problem for the Department of Homeland Security is morale. The employees of the Department of Homeland Security are on the front lines of our nation’s defense against terrorism. I recall the shooting incident at LAX that killed Gerardo Hernandez, who became the first TSA officer killed in the line of duty; and the machete attack at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport that resulted in injuries to Senior Transportation Security Officer Carol Richel. Their sacrifice and heroism reminds me of what we saw on September 11, 2001. I will never forget that day, which made the creation of the Department of Homeland Security necessary. September 11, 2017 will mark the 16th Anniversary of the attacks that killed 2,977 men, women and children. On September 11, 2001, I stood on the East Front steps of the Capitol along with 150 Members of the House of Representatives and sang ‘‘God Bless America.’’ I will forever recall the Members of this House who stood with each other not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans. I want to thank and commend the work of our first responders across the nation for their efforts to protect and serve their communities and our nation. Our duty as Members of Congress is to support the Department of Homeland Security in meeting its core mission of keeping Americans safe. I am in support of H.R. 2825 for the following three reasons: Terrorists have evolved their means and methods for perpetrating acts of terror that were not envisioned at the time the agency was created; The role of the Internet as a tool for terrorists to recruit and train people around the world who may be drawn to their messages of hate must be calculated into the work to defend the nation; and The Department of Homeland Security has evolved since its initial authorization bill became law on November 25, 2002, and this bill is a necessary step to make sure the agency can benefit from that experience. 
I appreciate and thank the Committee on Homeland Security Members for the inclusion of my bill, the ‘‘Federal Information Resource to Strengthen Ties with State and Local Law Enforcement Act of 2017’’ also known as the ‘‘FIRST State and Local Law Enforcement Act’’ in the Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute for H.R. 2824, the Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, the FIRST State and Local Law Enforcement Act, supports transparency and oversight of the work of the DHS Office of State and Local Law Enforcement by requiring that an annual report of its activities be provided to Congress. This office is the primary coordinator, liaison, and advocate for state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies. This office was created based on recommendations from the 9/11 Commission and serves as the primary liaison between DHS and nonFederal law enforcement agencies across the country. The office also leads the coordination of DHS’ policies related to state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement’s role in preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and responding to natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other manmade disasters. Because this DHS office plays a significant role in the required outreach to state and local law enforcement entities it is important that the Committee be kept apprised of its work. The ‘‘FIRST State and Local Law Enforcement Act’’ will include data about the coordination and information with State and locals, establishing and reporting performance and metrics feedback received from State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies about the Office. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Committee for also including Several Jackson Lee amendments in the final bill: The First Jackson Lee Amendment adds to the list of the Bill’s mandates for the Department of Homeland Security, which the Secretary of DHS shall implement as part of the overall mission of the agency. This Jackson Lee Amendment adds a new provision to the duties of the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, which directs that the Department recognizes as part of its mission to preserve individual liberty, fairness, and equality under the law;’’. The Second Jackson Lee Amendment adds an assurance that the DHS Multiyear Acquisition Strategy keeps ‘‘pace with changes in technology that could impact deliverables.’’ This amendment makes sure that the agency’s purchases are the most up to date technology available. The Third Jackson Lee Amendment would amend the Department of Homeland Security Fusion Center Partnership Initiative section of the bill to make sure that the Department will ‘‘develop, keep up to date, and make available information on federal resources intended to support fusion center access to agency data.’’ The unique and well established relationship between the National Network of Fusion Centers and the Department of Homeland Security is codified in this authorization bill, and important transparency measure. This amendment creates an ongoing mission by the Homeland Security Fusion Center Partnership Initiative to support local and state fusion participation. The Fourth Jackson Lee Amendment adds to the list of DHS components which can enter into Memorandums of Understanding to include the Chief Medical Officer. A memorandum of understanding or MOU is a formal agreement between Department of Homeland Security components and two or more parties regarding a matter of mutual benefit or interest where each party will provide to the other something of consequence. In the case of this Jackson Lee amendment, the Office of Chief Medical Officer will be able to enter into MOUs, which are not legally binding agreements, for the purpose of carrying out its mission. The fifth Jackson Lee Amendment assures that the Department of Homeland Security’s National Domestic Preparedness Consortium includes a special directive regarding preparedness training for urban areas. The Amendment establishes that ‘‘to the extent practicable,’’ the Department of Homeland Security will ‘‘provide training in settings that simulate real response environments, such as urban areas.’’ Urban preparedness planning will include drills, and my amendment allows each urban area to determine the settings and scenarios that will best approximate the challenges that may need to be overcome. Few of us will forget the impact of Hurricane Katrina or what we saw following Hurricane Sandy. None of us will forget the attack on New York City or the months of difficult excavation and recovery at the site of the attacks. Urban centers come with a host of challenges that require adjustments in how preparedness drills are conducted to ensure that lessons learned can be applied to real world conditions. I thank the Committee for adoption of these legislative improvements, which added them to the bill being debated by the House of Representatives. I ask that the members of the House to support H.R. 2825, the ‘‘Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.’’ Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. HUNTER ), chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2825 includes H.R. 2518, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2017, in division E. The Coast Guard Authorization Act is a product of bipartisan efforts of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, specifically through Chairman SHUSTER ’s leadership and the efforts of Ranking Member DEFAZIO and Ranking Member GARAMENDI and our great staff, Dave Jansen and John Clark Rayfield. b0945 The Coast Guard Authorization Act includes an authorization of funding for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 to support the Coast Guard and its servicemembers. It is important to remember the Coast Guard is one of the five Armed Forces, and even though it is outside of the Department of Defense, the service plays a critical role in protecting our country. It is unique in being the only armed force with law enforcement authorities, and this combination allows the service to perform its multitude of missions. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has been overseeing the Coast Guard for more than two decades and moved legislation to support the service in each Congress since 1995. The text of the Coast Guard Authorization Act is a product of hearings, discussions with the Coast Guard, and regulated industries. The bill does four main things: Clarifies acquisition authorities to be used by the Coast Guard; Updates certain service authorities to provide them parity with the other Armed Forces; Amends a variety of Coast Guard regulatory authorities; and Provides regulatory relief for fishing and maritime transportation industries. The Coast Guard Authorization Act is a great bill. I urge Members to support it and the passage of the broader bill, H.R. 2825. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER ), chairman of the Task Force on Denying Terrorist Entry into the United States of the Homeland Security Committee. Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge and thank Chairman MCCAULfor his leadership in undertaking this effort as we take the next step in advancing the 2017 Department of Homeland Security authorization bill. As part of this broader legislative effort, I sponsored the Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program Act because I believe we need to make sure that our Intelligence Committee has the best and most robust training in the world in order to keep our Nation safe. In 2015, the Department’s Chief Intelligence Officer identified the need to strengthen the workforce at the agency by giving intelligence analysts the tools they need to succeed. I served as an intelligence officer for 7 years in the Marine Corps and worked in the Intelligence Committee, including at the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, so I know firsthand the value of intelligence analysts gaining experience in different mission areas in order to broaden their ability to do their jobs more effectively for the American people. This program does that. It encourages analysts to gain experience in all of the various agencies that are part of the larger DHS community. With authorization, this bill will ensure that we are building and strengthening the expertise among employees 
at the DHS in order to keep the country safe. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ), chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective Security of the Homeland Security Committee. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2825. This critical piece of legislation is a chance for Congress to fulfill its duty to oversee the missions, programs, and functions of the Department of Homeland Security and its component agencies. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective Security, I am particularly pleased to support the important provisions of this bill relating to the Transportation Security Administration and the Secret Service. This bill will make measurable and lasting improvements to the way in which we protect the traveling public on both aviation and surface transportation systems. It also provides much needed leadership and continuity to TSA by establishing a 5year term for its administrator. Specifically, the bill provides important streamlining of TSA functions and offices; improves the vetting of aviation workers; enhances emergency preparedness at airports to protect against terrorist attacks and active shooters; and bolsters the Department’s focus on aviation cybersecurity issues. Passing this legislation will ensure that TSA is prioritizing the development and procurement of new passenger screening technologies and ramping of deployment of explosives detection canines for both aviation and surface transportation sectors. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS ), a member of the Homeland Security Committee. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of passage of H.R. 2825, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017, of which I am honored to be an original cosponsor. The threats facing American families are real and rapidly evolving. Since the original authorization 15 years ago, DHS has never been reauthorized, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of congressional oversight. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman MCCAULand his staff for their work on making the reauthorization package a reality. National security is an issue that affects every man, woman, child, Republican, and Democrat in our Nation. This bill will go a long way to ensuring that DHS remains mission ready to continue protecting our homeland. This legislation accomplishes several key things: It creates efficiencies that protect the people’s treasure and holds programs accountable; It offers congressional guidance for agencies within DHS such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to bolster our Nation’s response to illegal immigration; and Supports the bootsontheground and frontline defenders with much needed resources. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES). Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act. America faces mounting threats to our national security from around the globe. This includes the increased threats faced by Islamist terrorism, foreign cyber attacks, and an unsecured southern border. This bill will improve the Department of Homeland Security by making it more efficient and improving its processes so that the DHS can face security threats head on. This bill promotes the domestic sharing of counterterrorism information and calls for regular reports to Congress on costsaving and efficiency activities, including consolidation of facilities and response to operational surges. I believe this bill is vital to ensuring America’s continued safety. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GARRETT ), a member of the Homeland Security Committee. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, there are two amendments to this important piece of legislation that we bring forward. I want to thank the chairman of the committee for allowing us the opportunity to be heard and participate in this process. The first is an amendment that ensures that there is a strategic plan to reduce senior executive positions as it relates to the TSA. Right now, we have more tail of the dragon than teeth of the dragon. We need to make sure that we are focusing our assets efficiently and with responsibility to the taxpayers who give us the money to protect the homeland. This will save over $7 million in salary alone. The second ensures that there is an oversight of the Homeland Security Grant Program, which is intended to protect the homeland, so we demonstrate that we are being good stewards of the public’s dollars, while ensuring the safest possible Nation that we can. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2825 was unanimously approved by the Committee on Homeland Security on June 14, 2017, after 39 Democratic amendments focused on strengthening the underlying bipartisan bill were accepted. To make this legislative package more complete, subsequent to committee consideration, text that was approved by the Transportation and Infrastructure and Judiciary Committees was added. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting passage of this important homeland security legislation that includes provisions that have the support of groups as diverse as the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, National Fusion Center Association, the Jewish Federations of North America, the American Federation of Government Employees, and the American Public Transportation Association. Mr. Speaker, let me compliment the chairman for a job well done. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me give my heartfelt thanks to the ranking member for his work on this important legislation, first ever. It was a real team effort on both sides of the aisle. I want to thank all of the staff on both sides of the aisle, Rosaline Cohen and Jennifer Gorski, who worked tirelessly. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a January 11, 2017, memorandum of understanding, signed by myself and seven other committee chairmen. 
THEDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY  We, the chairs of the committees with jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security or its components, are hereby recording our agreement on the following principles for the 115th Congress: 1. The Department of Homeland Security (‘‘the Department’’) and its components should be authorized on a regular basis to ensure robust oversight and improve its operation. 2. Committees with jurisdiction over the Department and its components will prioritize the authorization of the Department and any unauthorized or expiring component in that committee’s authorization and oversight plan. 3. To the maximum extent practicable, the committees with jurisdiction over unauthorized or expiring components of the Department shall coordinate with the Committee on Homeland Security to produce a comprehensive authorization bill for the Department. 4. The Committee on Homeland Security shall coordinate with the committees with jurisdiction over unauthorized or expiring components of the Department in the development of any comprehensive authorization bill for the Department. 5. The Committee on Homeland Security and the committees with jurisdiction over components of the Department shall jointly develop a process for the vetting and pre clearing of base text and amendments offered at subcommittee and full committee 
Mr. M CCAUL. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion of this debate, it is very important to remember that a comprehensive reauthorization of the Department of Homeland Security has never been done before. While various reauthorization efforts have been tried in the past, we finally have a chance to get it across the finish line and have it signed into law. So let’s stand together as Republicans and Democrats and show the people we represent both parties and that both parties can work with one another by putting our national security above politics. This legislation is not just about good governance or bureaucratic reforms. It is absolutely essential to making sure we are able to defeat the grave and growing threats facing the United States. Once again, I want to thank the ranking member and all of his staff; leadership, as well, and their staff; and, also, all of the members of the Office of the Legislative Counsel, who got us to this point here today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, July 18, 2017. Hon. DEVIN NUNES , Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN NUNES : Thank you for your follow up letter regarding H.R. 2825 dated June 27, 2017. I appreciate your continued willingness to work with me to bring H.R. 2825 to the House Floor. As I stated in my June 22, 2017 letter, the Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing seeking a sequential referral at this time, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence does not waive any jurisdictional interest it may have over provisions in the bill. Regarding the provisions referenced in your recent letter, each of the sections listed were introduced as stand alone bills, as well as included in H.R. 2825, and the Committee on Homeland Security was granted the primary referral on such provisions. As discussed between our staff and in the exchange of letters, I recognize that your Committee could request a sequential referral on those provisions. I reiterate my continued appreciation for the cooperation of you and your staff in moving H.R. 2825 through the legislative process. Per your request, I will include your letters, my response letters, the ‘‘Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the Department of Homeland Security’’ and accompanying January 11, 2017 exchange of letters in the Congressional Record when H.R. 2825 is considered on the Floor. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE , June 27, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAUL: Thank you for your letter dated June 22, 2017, regarding H.R. 2825, the ‘‘Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.’’ I appreciate your recognition of the jurisdictional interest of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) in legislation relating to the National Intelligence Program (NIP), as well as the importance of the ‘‘Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the Department of Homeland Security’’ and our accompanying January 11, 2017 exchange of letters. As you note, your letter of January 11 permits the Committee on Homeland Security to report legislation including ‘‘Department wide provisions that could affect Department elements that happen to receive funding through the NIP.’’ H.R. 2825, however, contains several provisions that are not ‘‘Departmentwide,’’ but instead direct the NIP funded Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) to take specific actions and/or provide Congress with reports—and are therefore within the exclusive jurisdiction of HPSCI. Those provisions include: Section 113—‘‘Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program’’ Section 301—‘‘Homeland Intelligence Doctrine’’ Section 302—‘‘Analysts For The Chief Intelligence Officer.’’ Section 303—‘‘Annual Homeland Terrorist Threat Assessments’’ Section 311—‘‘Department of Homeland Security Fusion Center Partnership Initiative’’ Per my letter of June 21, HPSCI will continue to forego an official request for sequential referral. However, I request that you include a copy of this letter in the Congressional Record along with the other letters and attachments we exchanged last week. Thank you again for your cooperation. Sincerely, DEVIN NUNES , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, June 22, 2017. Hon. DEVIN NUNES , Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN NUNES : Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 2825, the ‘‘Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017,’’ I appreciate your support in bringing this very important legislation reauthorizing the Department of Homeland Security before the House of Representatives, and appreciate the willingness of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to forego seeking a sequential referral. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral on this bill at this time, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence represented for provisions within your jurisdiction on the conference committee. Additionally, the Committee on Homeland Security recognizes and appreciates the importance of the Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the Department of Homeland Security and the letter exchange on January 11, 2017. The Committee on Homeland Security contends that per such agreement the bill reported by the Committee ‘‘does not intend to authorize any elements of the Department that are funded through the National Intelligence Program (NIP) ....  but may include Departmentwide provisions that could affect Department elements that happen to receive funding through the NIP.’’ I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE , Washington, DC, June 21, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAUL: H.R. 2825, a bill ‘‘to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make certain improvements in the laws administered by the Secretary of Homeland Security, and for other purposes,’’ was recently marked up and reported by your Committee. Given that several provisions of H.R. 2825 implicate National Intelligence Program (NIP)funded activities, I am confident that upon request the bill will be sequentially referred to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (the Committee). As you know, we signed a Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the Department of Homeland Security and exchanged letters on January 11, 2017 (January 2017 Exchange of Letter), to clarify the Committee’s exclusive jurisdiction over NIPfunded elements of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The January 2017 Exchange of Letters 
affirmed that, consistent with the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA) is the vehicle that through which Congress authorizes annual appropriations for the NIP, including NIPfunded elements of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Moreover, those letters made explicit that the Committee on Homeland Security would not report to the House any bill that authorizes any elements of DHS funded through the NIP, and that if any such bill is reported by the Committee on Homeland Security, this Committee will request a sequential referral of the bill. In order to expedite the House’s consideration of the H.R. 2825, and in recognition of the unique importance of authorizing legislation for DHS, the Committee will forego an official request for sequential referral or consideration of the measure. This courtesy, is however, conditioned on our mutual understanding and agreement that it will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee with respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matter contained in the bill or any similar measure. It is also conditioned on the Committee on Homeland Security’s adherence to the agreement embodied in the January 2017 Exchange of Letters. In the future, the Committee will not hesitate to take up nonconforming legislation on sequential referral. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding and would request that you include in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 2825 a copy of this letter, your response, and the January 2017 Exchange of Letters, including the Memorandum. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, DEVIN NUNES , Chairman. 
work together toward our mutual goal of ensuring that the Department and its components arc authorized on a regular basis. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2825, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 218. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 454 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 218. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. PALMER ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b0958 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 218) to provide for the exchange of Federal land and nonFederal land in the State of Alaska for the construction of a road between King Cove and Cold Bay, with Mr. PALMER in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP ) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD my statement on the ABCs of Izembek. Alaska’s ardently asking for action and assistance to acquire acute acres to always allow actual access across areas and assuredly avert atrocious aviation accidents after appalling administrative blockades on building basic boulevards between beautiful bays before blizzards. The bill doesn’t bombard birds like Black Brants because Congress can carefully craft conveyances to create consistent courses for certain care in this Cove community. Construction cop outs and crumbling commitments cause a cacophony of complex concerns and constitute considerable consternation when crossing channels in choppy conditions. Don’s diligently doting on his district, dutifully demanding demonstrable developments daily so the Department doesn’t dawdle on their domain. Despite dangerous dashes and emergency evacuations, expanding elevated environmental evaluations exploded expenses. Exact exchanges exempt events to enhance embarking on equally enjoyable exits in eleven expanses. Frankly, fiftyfive frigid flights fleeing fast from freezing fields in furious flurries found frighteningly few fancy facilities for fearful families. Geese gradually got generally greedy, grimly generating genuine grief on giant goals of going great grounds on gravel and grabbing glory from good glacial gateways. Historically, hovercraft hijinks harmfully hampered hurrying to hospitals and hobbled healing, harpooning hope and hardening hardships near the harsh harbors. The House must hastily have a helpful hand in halting havoc and hindering hefty hazards for Izembek inhabitants instead of idling indefinitely. Interior’s indecision impeded infrastructure and informally interrupted implementing instant improvements, isolating irate individuals in increasingly impassible journeys. Jewell jumped into jeopardy when justifying juxtapositions and jarring, jolty jaunts from King Cove that keep killing kind kin without kindling key kernels of keen knowledge. King Cove lacks lifesaving lanes linking lonesome localities on land while lofty liberals lamely lament losing limited landscapes and maroon many who might make mends with medical ministration. Masterful mandatory medivacs must make miraculous moves after miniscule mainland migrations. Narrow native neighborhoods need necessary navigable networks now that nasty neglect notched nineteen needless obituaries. Other offered options outlined aren’t okay or optimal for opening outbound opportunities over a onelane, nonpaved preferred path across a pulchritudinous peninsula. Patients patiently practice peacefully praying to postpone pain and postmortems while partisan panels prioritize protecting a percent of the preserve over the perishing population. Perhaps people quietly question this quixotic quandary, quickly quarreling over quality, quaint routes. Resilient rural Refuge residents require really rapid resolutions to reliably ride on requisite roads routinely in rough situations. Seventy segments of street are still stationed in the sanctuary, so small sections won’t subvert the surroundings. The State swap saves the site’s sheltered status while swelling up safety and security for this scorned society. 1,000 tormented townsmen tempt their tombs in terrifying travels. They take threatening treks that traverse the tough tundra between the two towns in treacherous temperatures. United, we urgently untie this unbelievably unjust ultimatum for a unique unwinding of unfortunately unreliable voyages. Valid in vibrant victory we venture to vote to viciously vanish vanity and vacate this wrongdoing. When we want wins, wavering willfully won’t work. We weigh wishes of wilderness with wild winter weather while ways wane for wandering within windstorms. Xylophone. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you’re yawning and yearning for me to yield and stop yapping like a yelling yahoo while you’re still young. So I’ll zigzag and zoom past zany zealots in Zen like Ryan Zinke. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ), the author of the bill, the only Representative Alaska has here on this floor, and someone who understands this issue because he has been dealing with it for a number of years. (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, this is an issue that should have been settled a long time ago. In 2009, this Congress passed a land exchange piece of legislation, very similar to this, and we made one mistake. We did put into it the ability to have the Fish and Wildlife Service make recommendations. Even then, the recommendations were on a positive side. The last administration decided, under the Secretary of the Interior, not to build an 11mile road to save my constituents, the Aleut people from King Cove, in favor of a goose, and the people who live in King Cove weren’t really considered. b1000 Now, this is a road that is 11 miles long that goes not through the Izembek Refuge, but through some of the areas, mostly just along the edge. And the argument you will hear is that they will disturb the geese. You will hear it disturbs the eelgrass that the geese and the loons live on. The road will bother them. It is ironic; the refuge itself, which this refuge is not a new area, it has been inhabited by man, frankly, in the last generation, and they built about 70 miles of road to supply a military base called Cold Bay, which is the airport we are trying to seek this road to connect it with King Cove. They actually take tourists that arrive in Cold Bay and take the bus and go out the same road, not the one we want to build, but a road right next to the socalled lagoon and the eelgrass for the tourists. And for some reason, tourists don’t bother geese. That is what I can’t quite understand. But it is all right for them to do that, but not allow the people of King Cove to save their lives. Since the refusal to build this road, 19 people, my constituents, Aleut people from King Cove, have died because they could not be evacuated to the airport so you could fly them out. Now, some people will say, well, they have got an airport. Yes, 1,600 feet, winds are blowing 90 miles an hour, you try to get off. Or put yourselves on a boat and go across in 30foot waves. And you will hear, well, we built them and they got a hovercraft. They never wanted it. They knew it wouldn’t work. The Clinton administration said, 
oh, this is our solution and it is better than a road that would disturb the geese, so they accepted the use of it, and it did fail. The hovercraft does not work, yet we will have an amendment later on, the area that did not ask for it is going to be requested to pay the money back. I didn’t hear anybody, by the way, say, because a levee failed and we put money into it, they had to pay the money back. So let’s really consider what we are talking about here. We are talking about 11 miles, single lane, gravelcovered road to provide access to Cold Bay for people in the community who do not have access to a hospital, which is 600 miles away in Anchorage. We had one lady evacuated at a cost of $250,000 by the Coast Guard. The helicopter crashed, and she lost her life. We had two other elders that went across with a crab boat. They had to put the people into a crab pot because there was no way to get to this airport. So, Mr. Chairman, I am suggesting to my fellow colleagues, let’s do what is right. This does no harm to the refuge. It, in fact, saves lives, gives them an opportunity to take and experience the medical care that all the rest of us have. Let’s do the right thing today. Let’s not be caught into special interests that say it is going to hurt the refuge. I know many even got phone calls: Oh, this is going to be terrible. The truth of the matter is it is not terrible. It is the right thing to do. So I am asking my colleagues, let’s vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. Let’s vote ‘‘no’’ on the amendments. Let’s do what is right today in the House of Representatives. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today we are being asked to mandate a land exchange that will put a road through a designated wilderness area inside the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. If that sounds familiar, that is because we have been down this road before. After years of prodding from the Alaska delegation, the Public Land Management Act of 2009 authorized this exchange and the eventual construction of the road. However, that 2009 authorization was contingent upon a determination by the Secretary of the Interior that the road was in the public interest. The Fish and Wildlife Service then spent nearly 5 years preparing a full environmental impact statement in order to analyze the environmental impacts of the proposed road, and to determine if viable alternatives existed. During the lengthy and public process, the agency held 130 public meetings, reviewed thousands of public comments, 97 percent of which were opposed to the road. Ultimately, the Interior Department determined that building a road through the oneofakind wilderness area is not justified because it will destroy an irreplaceable ecosystem, and there are other ways to improve transportation in the area. This is not just a simple trail through the woods. It is a road through a narrow chain of islands and lagoons. Its construction requires the development of bridges, installation of culverts and pipes, and the dredge and fill of nearly 4 acres of wetlands. The Izembek National Wildlife Refuge supports numerous species of migratory waterfowl that we have international treaty obligations to protect, including nearly the entire global population of the Pacific black brant, and one of the only populations of nonmigratory tundra swans, in addition to providing prime habitat for bears, caribou, and other wildlife. Now, before the point can be made, let me just say, I want to be clear, I have never been to the refuge. Opposition to this road is not based on personal opinion or spite, or ignorance, or because we love birds more than people. Opposition to this road is based on extensive public comments and a long, careful, scientific review of its merits conducted by conservation professionals. The table of contents for the environmental review—not the review itself, but just the table of contents—is 28 pages long. The EIS comes with 10 appendices. The Department of the Interior did its homework. They weighed the costs and the benefits and made an informed decision. Now we are being asked just to ignore that scientific analysis and ram this road right through the refuge, despite knowing the damage it will do. The consequences of a decision like that are known. They are not unintended. The road through an Alaskan wilderness is not justified. This particular road is not justified, and it is not necessary. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN ), who is hurriedly making his way to the front podium. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 218, the King Cove Road Land Exchange Act. I thank Congressman DONYOUNG for his tireless work on this pressing issue. Nineteen people: the cost of decades of inaction by the Federal Government, Mr. Chairman, is 19 American lives. Expedient access to a hospital is something most Americans can, fortunately, take for granted. For many, emergency services are an ambulance ride away. Not for the citizens of King Cove, Alaska. Adjacent to the Aleutian Islands, the 1,000 residents of King Cove, Alaska, are connected to hospitals in the region via a small runway and a ferry. Harsh winter storms ground planes and prevent safe sea travel, cutting off residents from hospitals and necessary supplies. In truly dire emergencies, King Cove residents have but two choices. Number one is to pray a boat captain will brave enormous seas. Or wait until the Coast Guard can dispatch a medivac helicopter. Mr. Chairman, allow me to read some of the stories of those who have braved the sea, or held out until help arrived. Take, for example, Lonnie Brandell, who had to hoist his ailing father out of a fishing boat during a blizzard. After a perilous 3hour journey to Cold Bay, the sea was so rough his boat could not dock. Brandell had to tie a rope around his father and allow him to be pulled to safety. To quote Brandell: ‘‘It was not a good scenario at all. But if we had stayed here one more day, even 10 or 12 more hours, he would not have lived.’’ Or take Etta Kuzakin, who went into labor early. Unable to safely leave King Cove during a storm, it took the Coast Guard 8 hours to arrive to rescue her. ‘‘I was lucky,’’ she says. ‘‘The Coast Guard was in the area. That is really what it was. They were in the area.’’ Mr. Chairman, this is shameful. Our citizens should not have to wait hours for a medivac, or brave treacherous seas while we sit here and debate this issue. No American should have to perish while we argue whether or not a refuge would be better off with 81 or 70 miles of gravel road. I urge my colleagues to listen to the stories of Etta Kuzakin, Lonnie Brandell, and others. I urge my colleagues to think about the 19 Americans who perished for want of a gravel road. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support H.R. 218. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ), a subcommittee chairman of the Natural Resources Committee. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 218, the King Cove Road Land Exchange Act, introduced by my good friend and Western Caucus ViceChairman for Indian Affairs and Oceans, Mr. DON YOUNG . H.R. 218 authorizes a commonsense land exchange between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the State of Alaska that will save lives and taxpayer money. The bill provides significant benefits for all parties, including tribal members, supporters of fish and wildlife, supporters of the environment, supporters of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge and, most importantly, the people living in the surrounding areas that need access to critical medical and healthcare services. Local communities in the State of Alaska have been trying to build a one lane, 11mile gravel road to link King Cove and Cold Bay for nearly 3 decades. The bill authorizes the transfer of more than 43,000 acres of Alaska State land in exchange for just 206 acres of 
Federal land. These 43,000plus acres will be added to the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in order to protect fish, wildlife, and the environment. The onelane, 11mile noncommercial road that will be built as a result of this legislation is necessary in order to provide access to emergency medical assistance for American citizens and native populations. The bill will save taxpayer money. Since 2013 alone, 55 emergency medivacs have been required to get people in need of significant medical attention to hospitals. Many of these medical evacuations have required the Coast Guard, as inclement weather prevents aerial flights on an average of 100 days per year and results in cancellation of more than 40 percent of flights in King Cove. In order to receive lifesaving care, local residents often must fly 600 miles to Anchorage. Connecting King Cove to Cold Bay Airport will allow the Agdaagux Tribe and local residents to receive the emergency services they need and deserve. The National Congress of American Indians has testified before Congress multiple times in support of this legislation and on the need to construct this road. NCAI has also passed formal resolutions of support in 2007, 2014, and 2015. The 2015 NCAI resolution stated: ‘‘The Aleut people of King Cove are continuing to seek justice for this basic right to safe and dependable transportation access for emergency and routine medical health, which is an expectation that most Americans, Indian and nonIndian take for granted ...  ‘‘Because of public health, safety, and quality of life factors, the NCAI does hereby support the rights of the Aleut people of King Cove for this basic expectation of dependable transportation access, and calls upon Congress to immediately pass new legislation approving a land corridor for the construction of a permanent lifesaving road linking the community of King Cove to Cold Bay Airport.’’ I couldn’t agree more with the National Congress of American Indians. These people in these local communities have a fundamental right to basic healthcare. Let’s pass this bill so that we can build an 11mile gravel road and ensure they receive these basic services. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Alaska for his leadership in sponsoring this muchneeded legislation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in support of this commonsense bill. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We have heard the argument, and we will repeatedly hear the argument that the road connecting King Cove to Cold Bay is needed for health and safety purposes. While it is true that the road will be used for medical emergencies, there is a lot of evidence pointing to another objective. b1015 If you look at the decadeslong effort to build this road, it becomes clear that there has always been a commercial purpose in mind. King Cove is home to one of the largest fish processing facilities, operated by Peter Pan Seafoods, a subsidiary of a Japanese company that is one of the largest seafood companies in the world. Fishing is the backbone of the King Cove economy, and it has always been one of the reasons for the road. Let’s look at the facts. In 1994, the city of King Cove passed a resolution to emphasize the positive socioeconomic impacts of a 20mile road linking King Cove to the Cold Bay Airport. The resolution did not mention any need to use the road for health or safety or for emergency situations of residents. In 2005, the Aleutians East Borough participated in public scoping meetings and presented their vision for a hub airport for Cold Bay. This plan included cold storage capability for fish from King Cove and other communities awaiting air freight. In 2010, as part of a Fish and Wildlife EIS for the land exchange we are debating today, an Aleutians East Borough assemblyman stated that Peter Pan Seafoods would use the road to transport fresh product. And finally, on May 25 of this year, Alaska Governor Bill Walker sent a request to the Trump administration. He asked for: ‘‘Access for isolated King Cove residents to the airport in Cold Bay in all weather conditions, enabling access to health services and the movement of goods and people between King Cove and Cold Bay.’’ When you add all this up, the evidence is pretty convincing. Sure, the road will be used for emergency evacuations, but it will also be used to transport fresh product to Cold Bay to be sold throughout Asia and the rest of the world. Despite language in the bill seeking to prohibit commercial use of the road, once it is built, this prohibition will be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to enforce. This is an incredibly remote area, and the Fish and Wildlife Service does not have the resources or staff capacity to police the use of the road. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ), the chairman of the Federal Lands Subcommittee. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Mr. Chairman, we have just heard a very familiar theme from the Democratic side of the aisle. It is a theme they have sounded for the past decade and goes a long way to explain why America’s prosperity has been stagnating. It has literally been on hold during these past 8 years. God forbid there should be more jobs to support struggling families in this little community. God forbid our roads should ever be used to get products to people who desperately need them. Now, it is hard for me to understand how a onelane gravel road is going to accommodate all of that commerce. What it is going to accommodate are people who desperately need access to the neighboring city of Cold Bay. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of this bill, Mr. YOUNG ’s H.R. 218, on behalf of the people of King Cove, Alaska. I want you to imagine being a resident of that tiny little community. Its only outside access is by a gravel airstrip and a little tiny harbor. It is just 20 miles from the city of Cold Bay. Cold Bay has got a regional airport, they have got medical facilities, but there is no road connecting that little town with the lifesustaining civilization just 20 miles away. We all know of the exceptionally harsh weather conditions in that area; they routinely prevent air and sea travel out of King Cove. If you are in trouble in that weather, there is help just down the road, but there is no road. Why is there no road? Well, we have just heard a sampling of why. It is not because of natural barriers. It is not for lack of need or financing. It is because a national wildlife refuge in a section of the Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge is in between these communities and the Federal Government and leftwing environmental activists just won’t hear of it. For over 20 years, the people of King Cove have begged for this lifesaving road for their safety—not a major interstate, not a parkway, just a one lane road. It requires only 206 acres out of the 59 million acres of designated Federal wilderness in Alaska. Just in the last 4 years, this has been pointed out, 55 emergency medical evacuations have been made, a number of which required Coast Guard involvement or extended patient waiting times or both. Mr. WESTERMAN has told us just last year of the King Cove woman in her seventies suffering from heart issues medevaced from King Cove to Cold Bay by Coast Guard vessel after high winds prevented an air ambulance from landing at King Cove. In the end, it took the woman over 7 hours to reach a hospital in Anchorage. A road between King Cove and Cold Bay would go a long way to preventing similar situations from recurring, and it would provide a potentially lifesaving evacuation route for King Cove citizens in the event of an emergency. And if it helps provide additional jobs for that little community, well, I say so much the better. Congressman YOUNG has tried for more than a decade to get this done, but it has been stymied by leftwing environmental activists and by ideological zealots in the bureaucracy. During 
our hearing on the bill, opposition came not from any of the communities involved, but from environmental activists hundreds of miles away from King Cove, although they seemed to have mouthpieces here in this House. In exchange for use of the 206 acres of Federal land for this road, the State of Alaska is willing to transfer 40,000 acres of State land to the Federal Government. This bill facilitates that transfer and, after two decades, finally gives permission for this little road to be built. It is long overdue. I salute Congressman YOUNG for his persistent pursuit of justice for the longsuffering people of King Cove. Mr. Chair, I ask for speedy adoption of this bill by this House. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, we are not saying that the residents of King Cove do not deserve reliable transportation options, and neither did the EIS. The EIS included an analysis of nonroad transportation options that would piggyback off the $37.5 million Congress has already invested in King Cove’s infrastructure. The Interior Department also asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to analyze the nonroad transportation options to connect King Cove with Cold Bay. The Army Corps published a report in 2015 that identified three viable alternatives. These included a new airport that is capable of supporting aircraft that can fly directly to Anchorage, a heliport for emergency evacuations, and an icecapable marine vessel that is able to make the trip to Cold Bay in weather conditions that the taxpayerfunded hovercraft could not. Options exist, and that is why I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ). Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chair, I thank my friend from Arizona for yielding me time. Mr. Chair, I rise to oppose this bill today for a number of reasons, but building a road through a congressionally designated wilderness area is without precedent. There are lots of other reasons. I would note that at least today’s debate shifts the focus of this Congress in the right direction because, when we look to Alaska, it requires a gaze just a little bit further into Russia, and I only wish that what we were debating today was the sanctions bill that passed the Senate by a vote of 98–2. The reason that we should be debating that bill today is readily apparent to anyone who has been paying attention to recent events. Just this morning, we read of the President’s interview with The New York Times, and we think about a President who took action to fire the acting Attorney General, to urge the FBI Director to go easy on Flynn in the Flynn investigation, who fired the FBI Director because of the Russia investigation, and who just now, in this interview yesterday, threatened the acting FBI Director, the Attorney General of the United States, and the person carrying out the investigation of Russia and the potential ties between his administration and Russia. All of this gets to the larger point, which is we are getting ready to go home at the end of next week for August, and if we go home without passing the sanctions bill and getting tough on Russia, we will have failed the American people on a vital national security issue. We will be showing weakness at a time when the American people expect to see strength, expect us to stand up to Russian attempts to interfere with our election, to stand up when we learn about an eightperson—for now, eightperson— meeting that was put together with the sole purpose, according to the emails, of providing information to help President Trump, then candidate Trump, get elected with the assistance of the Russian Government. We don’t know where this will all lead. I acknowledge that. But it is because what we do know about Russia that we have to act not against the administration—it is a mischaracterization to suggest that. The bill passed 98– 2 in the Senate. This is a bill that will enable us to move forward in a bipartisan way, which the American people desperately want, to stand up to Russia. It is for that reason that is I ask unanimous consent that the House bring up H.R. 3203, which is the Russia sanctions bill that passed the Senate 98–2—98–2. When has this body seen that kind of bipartisanship? I ask that that bill be brought up so that we can vote on it and not disappoint the American people before we leave here in August. That is what we ought to be doing. I hope we will have the chance to do it now. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that we bring up the Russia sanctions bill to debate and to pass that bill today. The CHAIR. The gentleman’s request cannot be entertained in the Committee of the Whole. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chair, a point of parliamentary inquiry. The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. DEUTCH. May the request that the Russia sanctions bill, H.R. 3203, that passed the Senate 98–2 be brought up for consideration when we are no longer meeting as the Committee of the Whole? The CHAIR. A request may be made at that time. Mr. DEUTCH. And one further point of parliamentary inquiry. The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. DEUTCH. When we have an opportunity to make the unanimous consent request to bring up the Russia sanctions bill so we can get tough on Russia, as the American people expect us to do, is that something that would require, when I ask for unanimous consent, can the Speaker alone refuse to grant that consent? The CHAIR. The Chair will not respond to a hypothetical question. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, may I inquire of the ranking member if he has any germane speakers left on this issue. Mr. GRIJALVA. Other than myself, no. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, let me deal with one claim. The claim that people will die if we don’t pass H.R. 218 is wrong. The claim is wrong because there is no evidence to back it up, and it is wrong because using this kind of overthetop rhetoric is irresponsible. We do not oppose this bill because we think animal life is more value than human life, and throwing accusations like that around on the House floor should be beneath all of us. We do not have to rely on one Member’s claim that the sky is falling. These concerns have been assessed for years through public process, and the conclusion was that there were viable alternatives that will address any legitimate public safety concerns. People’s lives do not hang in the balance. We can protect public health and the refuge if we abandon this bill and work together on a better solution. This is, indeed, a remote area. That is why many of the residents choose to live there in the first place. They are fully accustomed to the challenges that come with living in the last frontier. To address these challenges, the Federal Government has appropriated tens of millions of dollars to this community for better medical and transportation facilities. We have remote communities in Arizona, especially Tribal communities, that would surely appreciate $37.5 million to address their health and safety concerns as well. The local government used some of that money to buy a hovercraft that could make the airport run much faster than this road will ever allow. The local community, not the Federal Government, elected to stop using the hovercraft. Surely, if people’s lives were at stake, the local government would not have made that kind of a decision. We have legitimate policy differences on this bill. The EIS has convinced many on our side that this is not a worthwhile proposal. Let’s debate these findings calmly and rationally that would serve the public in this debate and look for a solution that both protects people’s health and the refuge. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. b1030 Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. This is an issue that people have, for three decades, been trying calmly discuss and find an alternative. Unfortunately, the people of Alaska, who have been engaged in this effort for the last threeplus decades, have been rebuffed at every turn in which the only answer they got was the Federal Government here in Washington giving them an alternative, and forcing upon them an alternative that flat out didn’t work, and it hasn’t worked in the last 7 years. One of the things we should realize is that this idea of building this road is not new. The House has voted to build this road. The Senate has voted to build this road. Unfortunately, they didn’t vote it on the same bill, except, in 2009, when there was a piece of legislation that went through both the House and the Senate, which was very clear at the time that it was the intent of both the House and the Senate to build the road, but it did require the Interior Department to do the NEPA process. They took 4 years. Now think of that. It was in 2009 when the bill was passed and the intent of Congress was very clear. Four years later, the Interior Department finally got around to doing the study, a study which, I might add, had five options that were added to it, one of which was to do nothing, and the Interior Department chose, after 4 years of study as their preferred option, to do nothing. Therefore, all of the efforts and anguish of these people in Alaska went to naught because a bureaucracy here decided, despite what the House had said and despite what the Senate had said, that they knew best, despite what the people of Alaska needed, they knew best and their option simply was to do nothing. This bill, let me remind you, all of the masses of people who are here, is not about a road. It is about a land transfer for a road. The State of Alaska is putting up 43,096 acres for new wilderness in exchange for 200plus acres— 240, I think, acres to be a road, a road that already exists. There is a 30mile road that exists. The only problem is, only 19 of the 30 miles are constructed. They exist. They are there now. What Alaska is asking is: Simply give us the last 11, so the road that does exist can be used. It can be used for them, for their medical needs, for their recreation, if they want to. I mean, it has been brought up that, heaven forbid, this might be used for economic advantage. I don’t know why this community of around 1,000 people, about 80 percent are Native Alaskans, would ever have the audacity to think that they ought to have a job, or the audacity to think that maybe they should try and use something that is there to further their economic ability to actually earn a living. How uppity can you get, when we realize that those of us sitting here 6,000 miles away really have the superior wisdom to tell those people living in King Cove how they actually should live their life, and we did it. We did it in the 1990s. We said: No, you can’t have a road because we have a philosophical opposition to it. Instead, we will spend a heck of a lot of money to come up with a hovercraft that doesn’t work, and is too expensive, and is useless, and it no longer exists. And now you are saying, ‘‘No, no, no, you can’t have access to the mainland. You can’t have access to an allweather airport. You can’t have access for medical care; you can’t have access for jobs. You can’t have access for anything. Instead, let’s work together to come up with another really stupid idea that won’t work as well,’’ when the solution is simply to build a road, 11 miles to connect an existing road so people who live in King Cove can do it. You have already heard the data that has been presented. In the last 30 years, 19 people have died. Nineteen people have died, and it can be traced specifically to the fact that they didn’t have access to healthcare. In the last 3 years, they have had over 50 cases when medevac had to be used, very expensively, by the Coast Guard to try and help people out there. You wouldn’t have to do that if you simply had the silly road; the 70year old woman who had to wait 7 hours, suffering a heart attack before she could get medical care; the woman in labor who had to go 6 hours before she could get someplace to have medical care; the man who had the saw accident, who had to wait 12 hours before he was able to get any kind of medical care, simply because there is not an 11 mile singlelane gravel road to connect to the rest of the 30mile road that already exists. And we sit here and try and tell these people in Alaska what is best for them, what is good for them? And that is emotional? And that is irrational? No. What is irrational is that we are going through this again, the same thing we did last decade, the same thing that happened in the 1990s. And it is going to continue until we finally say: People should have a right to decide for themselves what is best for them. The people who live in this community want a road. It is not going to hurt anything. It is 200 acres, and this is a land exchange. Actually, I have to admit, I don’t like that. Alaska is giving up 40,000 acres—40,000 acres—so they can do 200 acres of a road. I think that is an exorbitant fee that is being extracted from the State of Alaska just so they can give these people, the overwhelming majority of whom are Native Alaskans, the opportunity of having access to their community so they can get medical care or whatever else they need so they can have it. And we are sitting here because we don’t want to do a precedent. This is the right thing to do. We should do this. We should have been done it back in the Clinton administration when it first came up. We should have gone through with it in 2009 when they finally passed it in both the House and the Senate, and then had to wait 4 years for the Interior Department to study the issue, and their conclusion was: let’s not do anything. That doesn’t exist. It is time for us to do something to help people, to put people above ideology, to pass the bill. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–27. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows: 
H.R. 218 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘King Cove Road Land Exchange Act’’. 
Congress finds that the land exchange required under this Act (including the designation of the road corridor and the construction of the road along the road corridor) is in the public interest. 
The route of the road corridor shall follow the southern road alignment as described in the alternative entitled ‘‘Alternative 2Land Exchange and Southern Road Alignment’’ in the final environmental impact statement entitled ‘‘Izembek National Wildlife Refuge Land Exchange/Road Corridor Final Environmental Impact Statement’’ and dated February 5, 2013. 
The exchange of Federal land and nonFederal land and the road to be constructed under this Act shall not constitute a major Federal action for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). 
The CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in part C of House Report 115– 235. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MS . TSONGAS  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part C of House Report 115–235. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 454, the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. TSONGAS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Massachusetts. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My amendment is very straightforward. It restores a bipartisan provision to the bill, one that was actually approved by Congress and signed into law by President Obama. In 2009, Congress approved the King Cove Land Exchange under the condition that it be found to be in the national interest by the Secretary of the Interior. After a transparent 4year review that included over 70,000 public comments and 130 public meetings, Secretary Jewell ultimately concluded that it was not in the national interest, and the land exchange was not approved. Nevertheless, the legislation that was approved and signed into law in 2009 with Democratic and Republican support included language that, should the road be approved, it would have required the State of Alaska, Federal agencies, and local residents to develop a mitigation plan for the road so that impacts to migratory birds, wildlife, and wetlands are minimized. The land exchange language that was passed by Congress in 2009 is similar to the legislation that we are considering today, with a few notable exceptions, including the removal of the section requiring this environmental mitigation plan. It is common practice for any new road construction project to include an environmental mitigation plan, especially a road through such a sensitive area. Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my commonsense amendment to reinsert this bipartisan language, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This amendment is mischievous and trying to defeat what we are trying to do today. The amendment is wholly unnecessary to mitigate impacts of migratory birds in Izembek Refuge. Again, the singlelane noncommercial 11 miles has no affect upon the wildlife, the waterfowl, of any kind. It would allow, again, the Secretary, or one of the other Secretaries of a lesser part, like Fish and Wildlife Service, to delay the project. It is an effort, again, to delay the project. We didn’t expect—by the way, when we say there are 70,000 or more public comments, there was less than 100 from Alaska. These are outside comments. This whole idea of public comments sometimes doesn’t make sense when they are nowhere near the Izembek Refuge or this road. Sometimes I think we get caught in this idea that, oh, we have got all of these public comments against something or for something, let’s look at where they are from. This amendment, again, as I say, is mischievous. It is trying to kill the project. It should not be done. It is being pushed by the environmental community, again, to kill this project. As I mentioned in my opening statement, you probably got some phone calls. Frankly, they don’t know what they are talking about. So I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, which is an attempt, again, to stop this road. Let’s build this road for the people of King Cove. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I think it is important to keep in mind that the lands that this road seeks to cross are Federally protected public lands. They are managed and protected on behalf of all Americans to specifically protect wildlife habitat. And, as such, when changes like this are being debated, all Americans have the right to register their opinion. They are also designated wilderness, the highest level of protection that the American people bestow upon a piece of public land, and we in Congress are stewards of that mandate. The road proposed by this legislation could do irreparable harm to the fragile environment of this wildlife refuge 
if mitigation steps are not taken. As the Department of the Interior stated in 2013, this area is ‘‘a globally significant landscape that supports an abundance and diversity of wildlife unique to the refuge that years of analysis shows us would be irretrievably damaged by construction and operation of the proposed road.’’ The Department also found that construction of the road would lead to ‘‘significant degradation of irreparable ecological resources that would not be offset by the protection of other lands to be received under an exchange.’’ My amendment simply reinserts bipartisan language that was approved by Congress and signed into law by 2009 that will help mitigate some, but not all, of the negative environmental impacts in the event that the road is constructed. Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim my time. I made a mistake and I said ‘‘yield,’’ when I should have said ‘‘reserve.’’ The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alaska? There was no objection. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for allowing me to speak on this again. I stress the fact that the Federal Government is going to receive 43,000 acres for additional wilderness in exchange for 42 acres. I mean, I don’t know how many deals you can ever work that you get that kind of deal. This is a great thing for the refuge. It is the right thing for the refuge. Again, as we go about this bipartisan legislation, we expected in 2009 to have this road built. That is why we are back here. It is not the first time. For 40 years this community has been trying to get this road built. We thought that we had it in 2009, but because of the administrations that were unfavorable to it, and the slowness of the report of the Fish and Wildlife Service, and then having Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell say, ‘‘No, there are other alternatives,’’ when they did not work. So I am suggesting, respectfully, that, again, this amendment is trying to kill the bill. It is not trying to provide a solution to anything. Respectfully, I would say this again: vote against this amendment. Let’s defeat this amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chair, I have no other speakers, and I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair, may I just inquire how much time is remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Alaska has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Massachusetts has 2 minutes remaining. b1045 Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to first remind my distinguished colleague from Alaska, who I know cares very deeply about his constituents, that in 2009, he did vote for the omnibus land package that included the language that I would like to see become part of the legislation before us today. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It restores bipartisan language that was passed by Congress and that Congressman YOUNG supported and signed into law on similar legislation authorizing this land exchange back in 2009. The road through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge is expected to have a significant detrimental impact on lands that are protected for the benefit of all Americans. This amendment will help mitigate some, but not all, of these impacts in the event that the road is constructed. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP ) who is the chairman. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I can say I don’t support this because even though I had three bills in that package, I voted against it. It was a bad package going through. But the problem is that this amendment does nothing more than reinsert the language that caused the problem in the first place. This language is the reason that we don’t have the solution right now. Remember, the solution was no action, not to do anything whatsoever. I understand sometimes we have distance issues that come here. The gentlewoman from Massachusetts has not an inch of BLM land in her entire State. Only 3 percent of the land is controlled by the Federal Government, which is much different than having 90 percent controlled by the Federal Government as in Alaska. I would contend that if there was any other area in the Nation—especially the eastern part of the Nation that had a situation like this—they would not tolerate this existing. They also had the ability of actually solving the problem on the local level, which is what they are asking in this bill to simply do. Eighty percent of these people are Native Alaskans. They don’t have the lung power to come up here and express for themselves. They don’t have the resources to hire special interest groups to come express for themselves. They are depending on us to do it for them. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman has 1
1⁄2 minutes remaining. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Again, may I suggest we talk about this legislation. We thought 9 years ago or 8 years ago that we would have this road built. There is no Federal money involved in it. It is a road that needs to be done, and if we reinstate this language, what will happen is there will be a time where the road again will be studied and won’t be built. For forty years, they have waited and lost lives, and we are talking about letting the Federal Government get involved again. Mr. Chairman, I am saying this is the time to build the road. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. TSONGAS). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Massachusetts will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . YOUNG OF  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part C of House Report 115–235. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I have an amendment at the desk, Mr. Chairman. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 6, line 21, insert ‘‘(including the issuance of any permit that may be required from any Federal agency to construct the road)’’ after ‘‘under this Act’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 454, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, in order to fully ensure that this emergency route will not be slowed down by unnecessary regulatory delays, my amendment makes minor changes to section 7 to conform to the text of H.R. 218 with the Senate text of S. 101. Section 7 of the underlying bill waives the NEPA process because the NEPA process had already been completed in 2014 under Secretary Jewell. An environmental impact statement has already been published. Secretary Jewell ignored the public health and safety aspects that killed people because we don’t have a road. There is no reason to make the people of King Cove go through the time consuming and expensive process again when it was done so recently. The people of King Cove have fought for this road for 40 years. People have literally died, again, because of the lack of this road to Cold Bay which has a 6,000foot airstrip. Mr. Chairman, again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. 
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. While it was described as a technical amendment to conform the bill to the Senate version, it does much more than make a simple technical correction. Mr. YOUNG ’s amendment expands the NEPA waiver in the underlying bill to exempt all permits associated with the construction of the proposed road from environmental review and public input. It is bad enough that the bill waives NEPA for the land exchange, but under this amendment, any and all improvements would be exempt from review. This could include a Clean Water Act permit necessary to move forward with the construction. Mr. Chairman, this amendment makes the bill worse. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Again, Mr. Chairman, let’s not wait again for 40 years or 9 years or 10 years. This has already been done by the study. The impact statement has already been done. The NEPA process has already been done. It has been done recently, and this is not a cheap effort for a small community. So I am suggesting, respectfully, this amendment be adopted so we can build a road. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . GRIJALVA  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part C of House Report 115–235. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment made in order under the rule at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 454, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, acknowledging that I am running the risk of being uppity on this particular amendment, but thankfully never smug, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 218, the King Cove Road Land Exchange Act. My amendment simply requires the State of Alaska to repay $20 million appropriated in 1999 to support the town of King Cove before the bill can take effect. The American taxpayer has already provided the town of King Cove with a total of $37.5 million to improve transportation access and medical facilities in the area. That included $20 million to build a road, construct a dock, and purchase marine equipment. Part of this money was used to purchase a $9 million hovercraft. This Federal funding was provided as an alternative to building a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. The hovercraft worked as it was designed. It carried up to 49 passengers at a time, an ambulance, and even cargo, making the trip between King Cove and Cold Bay in 20 minutes—a trip that would take 2 hours on the proposed road when it is not shut down by extreme weather conditions. After operating for 3 years and performing at least 30 medical evacuations, the local government stopped using the hovercraft. The Aleutians East Borough is now trying to sell the hovercraft on the open market for $5 million. As we speak, House Republicans are seeking massive and dangerous cuts to spending on things like education, assistance to working families, and even Medicaid and Medicare. Before we mandate construction of a road through congressionally designated wilderness, it is only fair that American taxpayers are reimbursed for Federal funding that was intended to avoid the construction required by this legislation. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would penalize the State of Alaska for a Clinton administration decision by making them pay back grant money for the costly and often unreliable emergency hovercraft system. Residents of King Cove never wanted this system and only agreed to the compromise when it became clear the Clinton administration would oppose any effort to authorize the construction of this lifesaving road. After years of working in good faith to make the solution work, King Cove had to abandon the system due to exorbitant cost and, frankly, mechanical failures on the craft. It was very expensive to run. Very frankly, the amendment attempts reparation but it targets the wrong group. The amendment puts a price tag on the safety of King Cove residents who have sought more reliable access to medical care for decades. Congress does not require Louisiana to pay the Federal Government for the failed levees in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina before building new ones and should not be charging the residents of King Cove for constructing this road. By the way, furthermore, the amendment seeks repayment from the State of Alaska that did not receive money; however, the grant money is for temporary emergency relief efforts which were largely awarded to the local governments. Mr. Chairman, again, I think this amendment is a punitive amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, let me remind, the point of the amendment is that the money, the $37.5 million, and also the decision by the local residents to purchase the hovercraft, that was not mandated by the Federal Government. It was their decision, again with Federal money, $9 million, and so that was all in lieu of construction of the road. This legislation mandates a construction of that road, and I think it is only fair to the taxpayers that if the purpose was in lieu of to deal with the medical evacuation situations that we have heard about here again today, then the American taxpayers should be reimbursed for that. This was not an error caused by, as the levees in New Orleans, faulty design and construction that bore responsibility to the Federal Government. These were local decisions made on the use of that money. Now that the use of that money is moot, then the taxpayers deserve to be reimbursed. Mr. Chairman, I urge support of my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP ) who is the chairman of the committee. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, as we close on this particular amendment, let me say I would never consider this amendment uppity. I would consider it cute and a gotcha amendment because the reality is, unlike what has been alluded to, the community did not want this hovercraft. They wanted what was promised them in the bill, which was an 11mile road to connect to the rest of the road. It was forced upon them by the Clinton administration that said: This is it; take it or leave it. They tried to make it work. The bottom line is the system didn’t work. But the Clinton administration here, 6,000 miles away, forced on to local residents who knew they would have a problem something that did not work, and they quit doing it simply because they could not afford to maintain that hovercraft. The hovercraft is for sale; but no one needs a hovercraft. That is why this community now is stuck with the decision that we made 6,000 miles away because we know what is right for King Cove, Alaska, instead of allowing them to have some kind of control over their own lives. What Mr. YOUNG said is accurate. When the levees broke along the Mississippi and the Missouri, we didn’t go 
to those States to insist on it. When there are wildfires that take place in the West, including the gentleman from Arizona’s home State, we don’t go back to Arizona and force them to pay for all of it. This is simply an amendment that is cute, and it is a gotcha amendment. But it is also wrong. It was also pointed out the grants went to the community. The community is not being required under this amendment to pay it back, it is the State, which simply means the amendment is also poorly written if it ever was indeed supposed to be a sincere amendment. This is one of those things that we don’t need to go through. The options are very clear. We have gone through the process. Vote against this particular amendment. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Vote ‘‘yes’’ on the bill and ‘‘no’’ on the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. b1100 Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. HOLDING ) having assumed the chair, Mr. PALMER , Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 218) to provide for the exchange of Federal land and nonFederal land in the State of Alaska for the construction of a road between King Cove and Cold Bay, had come to no resolution thereon.

The Acting CHAIR (during the vote). There is 1 minute remaining. b1144 So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. BOST). The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia) having assumed the chair, Mr. BOST, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 218) to provide for the exchange of Federal land and non Federal land in the State of Alaska for the construction of a road between King Cove and Cold Bay, and, pursuant to House Resolution 454, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on the amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. GARAMENDI. In its current form, I am. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Garamendi moves to recommit the bill H.R. 218 to the Committee on Natural Resources with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Page 6, after line 24, insert the following: 
‘‘yes’’ so that the very clear ear of our Speaker can hear a ‘‘yes’’ vote from all of us, and let’s go home. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the efforts of the gentleman from California. I would remind him, when he was in the Clinton administration and the Clinton administration forced the community to buy a hovercraft instead of building this road, that was made in Canada. However, I want you to know that I am actually livid for the people of King Cove, Alaska, because they lack a lifesaving lane on the land to link this lonesome locality that has been left alone while lofty litigious liberals lamely lament losing a little landscape. Mr. Speaker, the arguments are limited and they lack love for the Aleuts who are there. This amendment is a loser. Vote ‘‘no.’’ Vote ‘‘yes’’ on passage, and let’s get out of here. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, without regard to the argument in opposition to my amendment, I think we ought to go home and let it be. I am not going to ask for a recorded vote. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is not recognized for debate. The motion to recommit was rejected. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

b1209 So the bill was passed. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I was absent during rollcall vote Nos. 403 through 406 due to my spouse’s health situation in California. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 2825—DHS Authorization Act of 2017, ‘‘yea’’ on the Tsongas Amendment, ‘‘yea’’ on the Grijalva Amendment, and ‘‘no’’ on final passage of H.R. 218—King Cove Road Land Exchange Act. 
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 620 Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my name be removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 620. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. 
ANNOUNCING THE PASSING OF THE HONORABLE RALPH REGULA (Mr. CHABOT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, as dean of the Ohio delegation, I am greatly saddened to inform the Members that our former colleague, Ralph Regula, who was the dean of the Ohio delegation, has passed away. Ralph was 92 years of age. He had the honor of serving his constituents back home in Ohio for 36 years. He was a key player on the Appropriations Committee for many years. He will be truly missed. I wanted to inform the Members that Congressman BOBGIBBS—Ralph was a 
constituent of Congressman G IBBS— will be organizing a Special Order next week. So Members who are interested, on either side of the aisle, in participating in that should contact Representative GIBBS’ office. 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come, and I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), the majority leader. (Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Madam Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow. Now, one suspension worth highlighting is H.R. 3218, the Forever GI Bill, sponsored by Representative PHIL ROE. This bipartisan legislation will remove the 15year cap for benefits that forces veterans to use it or lose it, while enabling vets to take advantage of innovative new models like nanodegrees and massive open online courses. Education in the 21st century is a process of lifelong learning, and I look forward to the House passing this important reform on behalf of the men and women who bravely serve our Nation. In addition, the House will use the Congressional Review Act to disapprove of the CFPB rule on arbitration agreements. This rule hurts consumers at the expense of classaction trial lawyers, and we will work with our colleagues in the Senate to overturn this misguided regulation. The House will also consider H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, sponsored by Representative RODNEY FRELINGHUYSEN . b1215 Madam Speaker, this is vital that we demonstrate our commitment to America’s servicemembers and uphold our constitutional duty to provide for the common defense. This security package includes the committee’s marked and reported bills for Defense, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. Among many positives, the bill gives a 2.4 percent pay raise for our troops, increases funding for our Capitol Police, ensures greater oversight and accountability at the VA, and fully funds the President’s request for a wall along our southern border. As always, Members are advised that latenight votes are likely next week during the consideration of this appropriations package. Finally, Madam Speaker, additional legislative items are possible in the House, and I will be sure to notify Members of any additions to our schedule. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader for the information that he has given us. Suffice it to say there are a couple of these bills, obviously, that give us great pause. But having said that, the Appropriations Committee, over the last few weeks, has marked up, I think, all of its bills now, 12 bills. There was discussion about bringing an omnibus with all 12 bills in it. That has obviously not happened, and so we have what we refer to as a minibus. We only have 17 legislative days left, Madam Speaker, until the end of the fiscal year on September 30. First, I would like to ask the majority leader if he can tell us the process under which the minibus will be considered. As the gentleman pointed out, there are four distinct appropriations bills that are included in the minibus. Is this going to be an open rule? Will all of these bills be open to amendment, or will they be considered under a rule so that our Members can prepare for the consideration of these appropriations bills? Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend, the majority leader. Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time, and I thank him for his question. Madam Speaker, he is correct that, as of today, all 12 appropriations bills will be done from committee, marked up in subcommittee and full committee, and I want to thank the Appropriations Committee for their work. They achieved something that has not been achieved before in the timeline that they were given, and it is extraordinary the work they were able to do. It is correct in the Make America Secure minibus package that we are bringing, that that package covers over 66 percent of our total discretionary spending. As the Rules Committee has noted, the bill will come under a rule, so it will be a structured rule. We assume that there will be hundreds of amendments, as the gentleman knows, just like in the NDAA, more than 200 amendments. I would like it noted there were more Democratic amendments than there were Republican amendments in the process that we worked through, and that is why I expect there will be late votes next week as well. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Madam Speaker, the gentleman made an observation about there were more Democratic amendments. That is unusual for your bills. We usually find more Republican amendments to your bills than we do Democratic amendments. But having said that, I think the gentleman’s observation is correct. I want to make it clear to Members of the House, perhaps, who have not served here very long, the first year I was majority leader in 2007, it wasn’t just consideration in committee. We passed through the House of Representatives all 12 appropriations bills and sent them to the Senate prior to the August break so that the Senate had a full month to consider them. We didn’t get them all done, as you have suspected. But in any event, I don’t think I have ever seen, Mr. Leader, an omnibus passed prior to the August break. Individual bills being passed, but a minibus of this nature with, as you point out, 66 percent of the discretionary spending, which, by the way, there is no budget, and, therefore, this breaks the sequester level. It breaks the agreements that we have had in the past under Ryan Murray for 4 years, two Congresses, and the number that is being used is a number that was simply taken out of the air. There has been no vote on the floor, no other way to have set that number. We also believe that the amendments that are going to be offered are going to be offered in a very short space of time, and that is going to be a problem, but we will see what the rule says. Can the gentlemen tell me, do we expect to bring the other eight bills to the floor in September? Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time, and I thank him for his note that sometimes we have more Republican ideas usually that come to the floor, and I think ideas are good. Madam Speaker, I do intend to bring the rest of the appropriations bills through this floor and get them done to send them to the Senate. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Now, the gentleman mentioned that the border wall was going to be fully paid for. The Homeland Security bill is not a part of the package that includes four bills. Madam Speaker, can the gentleman tell me what bill that will be included in? I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Madam Speaker, as the gentleman knows, the President campaigned across America to the American public about making sure our borders are secure. Many Members on both sides of the aisle know the challenges we have along the border. The President requested and this fully funds the President’s request. As I look back in history along this line about border security, there are 
many times in history it shows, just a short history ago, of those who have voted for it. Hillary Clinton has voted for border security as well on the wall, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and CHUCK  SCHUMER . This will be an amendment made in Rules for the bill. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. It is an amendment made in Rules. Is that going to be an amendment that will be made in order for full consideration and debate on the floor of the House of Representatives? Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, as the gentleman knows, I do not speak for the Rules Committee. It will be their process and their determination. It is a committee. They will decide as a committee. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that answer. Given the fact that, as the gentleman has pointed out, this was made a major issue by the administration during the campaign, in light of the fact that there are many members of his own administration who believe the wall will not work and is not the most effective way to do what all of us agree ought to be done, and that is to keep our border secure and to make sure that we know who is coming into the United States of America—I think that is a unanimous position, frankly, of the Members of this House. This border wall, as I understand it, is in none of the four bills that have been marked up by the committee. Therefore, my presumption is the Rules Committee is, in some fashion, going to add this. If they add it, frankly, to the rule and that it is adopted as a result of the adoption of the rule, that will preclude a vote on the wall. Now, I know the gentleman doesn’t like me to quote his book, but it seems to me, in the book, every issue was going to be taken on its own, discretely, and that Members of the House would be able to work their will. If it is in the rule, that is, I think, not consistent with that ability of Members of the House to fully debate whether or not we ought to be putting billions and billions and billions of dollars into a wall and whether or not that wall would be effective to accomplish the objective. Madam Speaker, can the gentleman assure me that it will not be simply included and assumed to be adopted by the adoption of the rule itself and will, in fact, be an amendment on which the House can engage and work its will? Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. He brings up a point about the security of our border. It was a debate nationally, but it wasn’t a new debate. It is a debate that actually happened on this floor a short amount of time ago. We all remember the Secure Fence Act. It was actually debated right before I was elected. We got vetoproof majorities in both the House and Senate. Sixtyfour Democrats voted for that bill on this floor, 80 of 100 Senators. I would like to note once again, who were those Senators who voted for this? It was Hillary Clinton; at the time, Senator Barack Obama; Senator Joe Biden; and Senator CHUCK SCHUMER. So it is not a new challenge. But the gentleman will be thankful that we have taken the new technology and also applied it within this bill for border security. We have levees. We have dams as well. We have taken the ideas on all sides. The American public has requested this. I can’t promise what the Rules Committee will do, just as I would never ask you to promise what one of the committees is going to do. Just as you quote my book—and I don’t get upset with you quoting my book. You should buy it and read it more. Buy more books. The whole staff should be reading my book. Mr. HOYER. I am enthralled by it, Mr. Majority Leader. Mr. MCCARTHY. And just to clarify, I get no royalties. The Wounded Veterans get the money, and I am thankful that you buy it. But if I may finish with this, the Rules Committee will act. The American public expects us to act. We utilize technology. We utilize levees. We utilize dams. And I will tell you, many of those ideas come from your side of the aisle. It is requested not just from Members on your side of the aisle, but Democrats and city councils and others that are along the border. So, yes, we are taking action, just as we said we would do. The Rules Committee will find the right place to apply it, and we will be able to have the discussion on the floor. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I understand the majority leader’s reticence to answer the question because he says he can’t speak for the Rules Committee. I understand that. But the fact of the matter is this is an important issue. It ought to be considered by the House. It ought to have every Member’s ability to speak to the issue of whether or not we ought to build that wall, not whether we ought to have security—we all agree that we should and must have security—but whether we do it with a wall, as I said, in which many members of the current administration do not believe it will work and have been quoted as saying so in the past, and there are many Members on our side who feel that. I would hope that the majority leader would at least make it known to the Rules Committee that we ought to have that as a freestanding amendment, not incorporate it in a rule that the vote for the rule or a vote against the rule is, of itself, a vote on the wall itself. Lastly, Mr. Leader, I want to say that you and I are both very concerned about the Russian sanctions and Iranian sanctions bill that is pending. We have been working very hard on that, very constructively on that, and I look forward, over the next 24 hours, more or less, to see whether or not we could get that resolved. We have introduced, as you know, the Senate bill as a House bill. We would be for that if it would be brought to the floor. But we want to make sure that we move a bill, as you do, as quickly as possible and get agreement with the Senate and move that bill to the President’s desk. I thank you for your work on that, and I look forward to working with you over the next day or two to see if we can achieve that objective together. Madam Speaker, unless the gentleman wants further time, I yield back the balance of my time. f 
ADJOURNMENT FROM THURSDAY, JULY 20, 2017, TO MONDAY, JULY 24, 2017 Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, July 24, 2017, when it shall convene at noon for morninghour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. CHENEY). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. 
b1230 RECOGNIZING GABRIELLA BOFFELLI (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, last night I was proud to present my legislative director, Gabriella Boffelli, with the Vermillion Award of the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute, CHLI, named after the late Steve Vermillion, the former chief of staff to Congressman Lincoln DiazBalart. This award is presented each year to two staffers who exemplify Steve’s huge heart and dedication to freedom. None are more deserving than Gaby, and her fellow honoree, Angela Ramirez. Since starting as an intern in my Miami office 6 years ago, Gaby has risen through the ranks, year after year, serving our south Florida community with wisdom, grace, and integrity. Now completing a master’s degree at Johns Hopkins University, Gaby is the consummate public servant, selflessly working on behalf of our constituents, while constantly fighting for democracy and human rights in places like Nicaragua. It has been an honor to have Gaby Boffelli on my team, and I know this is just the beginning of an extraordinary career. 
BRING AMERICA TO 100 PERCENT RENEWABLE ENERGY BY 2050 (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, to quote Ronald Reagan: ‘‘Preservation of our environment is not a liberal or conservative challenge; it’s common sense.’’ Yet, this week, my Republican colleagues continued the trend of pushing through bills that deeply undermine critical environmental protections. H.R. 806, the ‘‘Smoggy Skies Act,’’ is an attack on the Clean Air Act that will lift protections against harmful pollutants that put the health of our communities at risk. Republicans also made it clear that they are prioritizing dangerous pipelines while shirking environmental review processes. But despite their efforts, we are looking ahead and putting forward a bold vision for protecting our environment and our economic future. I am proud to introduce, with Congressmen POLIS, GRIJALVA , and H UFFMAN , the 100 by ‘50 Act, which aims to bring the United States to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050. Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet, our economy, our children, and our communities, and our bill lays out a bold roadmap for ensuring that we transition to a clean and renewable energy economy while prioritizing good jobs for workers and investments in our communities. This is the time to be bold. 
HONORING HABITAT FOR HUMANITY OF BUCKS COUNTY (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Habitat for Humanity of Bucks County, which is an organization dedicated to eliminating substandard housing, locally and worldwide, through constructing, rehabilitating, and preserving homes. This global, nonprofit housing organization, with a local chapter in my district, operates on the principles that seek to put God’s love into action. Habitat for Humanity of Bucks County advocates for fair and just housing policies that provide training and access to resources to help families improve their living conditions. The Bucks County chapter of Habitat for Humanity is a motivated team, driven towards service, where they build communities and empower families. I am grateful for the work of Executive Director Florence Kawoczka, Laura Blair, B.J. Breish, Colleen Brink, Stefanie Clark, Candace Clarke, Mike Fallon, Susan Harrity, Josh Hilliker, Theresa Leonard, Sam Martin, Tracy Mulvaney, Karen Reever, and all of the associates and volunteers who make this organization possible. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to work with the Bucks County Habitat for Humanity, driven by the conviction that every man, every woman, and every child should have a simple, durable place to live in dignity and safety, and that decent shelter and decent community should be a matter of conscience for all of us. f 
PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR UNDOCUMENTED FARMWORKERS (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I represent the central coast of California, known to many of my colleagues as the salad bowl of the world. It is where agriculture is the number one industry, and it is where the farm labor movement was partially founded. Now, as many Republicans and Democrats know, in agriculture, undocumented farmworkers do a majority of the laborintensive work needed to put food on our dinner tables. That is why I am a cosponsor of H.R. 2690, the Agricultural Worker Program Act, also known as the ‘‘Blue Card’’ bill. This bill would provide a majority of our farmworkers with a path to legal permanent residence. Now, it doesn’t allow people to jump the line. It doesn’t just give them benefits. In fact, there are certain obligations that they must undertake in order to receive those benefits. They have to work in agriculture for at least 100 days, and then they have to commit to working in agriculture for 100 days over the next 5 years. Our farmworkers, whom we employ and critically need, are now living in the shadows for fear of deportation. This bill would provide legal protections for our farmworkers to ensure a better future for their families, our farms, and our communities. While it is my hope that this bill would again be incorporated into a larger comprehensive package negotiated by Republicans and Democrats, just like it was in 2013 when Congress nearly passed comprehensive immigration reform, the people who help feed our families deserve this opportunity, and that is why I support it. 
‘‘MADE IN AMERICA’’ WEEK (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to show my support for the ‘‘Made in America’’ Week initiative. It is an initiative to highlight the contributions of American workers and job creators. Made in America brings to mind a combination of the American spirit of innovation and perseverance that is required to turn raw materials into manufactured goods. I am proud of the contributions that my home State of Arkansas makes to the American economy. In Arkansas, 13 percent of the State’s workforce is employed in the manufacturing industry, which is the second highest percentage in the South and the third highest percentage in the Nation. Twentyeight percent of those jobs in Arkansas are in the Fourth District. In 2016, manufacturers contributed $2.2 trillion to the American economy. For every dollar spent in manufacturing, an additional $1.80 is added to another part of the economy. With abundant resources, a strong infrastructure, and a secondtonone work ethic, Arkansas is working to train the next generation of technicians and visionaries so that manufacturing can expand, promoting better careers, stronger families, and thriving communities. f 
THANKING UNSUNG HEROES IN WAKE OF ILLINOIS FLOODING (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, this week, torrential rains caused record flooding in many parts of Illinois, and, in particular, in my district. I had the chance to visit some of the affected areas over the weekend, joined by my colleagues from Illinois, Mr. HULTGREN  and Mr. ROSKAM , as well as Senator DURBIN , Fox Lake Mayor Donny Schmit, and Lake County Chair Aaron Lawlor. We spoke with residents and saw firsthand some of the many challenges these communities are facing. I rise today, however, to recognize the many unsung heroes who have stepped up to help their neighbors, and often helped total strangers, in the wake of this disaster. This includes our first responders, dedicated government workers, and volunteers, many coming from towns far away and unaffected by the floods. As the rains fell and then in the days after, these people worked tirelessly around the clock to lend a hand and try to hold off the rising waters. We are not out of the woods yet, and the people who serve our communities day in and day out in our local governments, our police and fire departments, and our emergency agencies are continuing to work with professionalism and quick coordination. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to use my time today to say ‘‘thank you’’ to these people working behind the scenes without due recognition. They represent the very best of our communities and our Nation and make us all very proud. 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF DIETRICH SCHMIEMAN (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory of a constituent and distinguished soldier in our Nation’s Armed Services, U.S. Marine Corps Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman of Richland, Washington, who passed away on July 10, along with 15 of his fellow servicemen. Sergeant Schmieman served honorably as part of an elite Marine raider battalion stationed at Camp Lejeune and was on his way to complete his predeployment training in Yuma, Arizona, before being deployed to the Middle East. Our Nation owes a debt of gratitude to individuals like Dietrich who, through their service, have preserved the freedoms that form the cornerstone of our Nation. Sergeant Schmieman’s death is a tragedy. The hole he leaves in the lives of his friends and his family can never be filled. I join the Nation in sending prayers to his family during this very difficult time. Please join me in remembering Sergeant Schmieman and his dedication to selfless service to our Nation. Again, our prayers are with his family and his loved ones. 
REPEAL OF OBAMACARE STATISTICS (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, next week we will see consideration of the repeal of ObamaCare without a replacement. This would be a lifeanddeath issue for most Americans. First, we would see skyrocketing uninsured rates: 18 million people would lose insurance next year; 32 million people would lose insurance by 2026. We would also see skyrocketing premiums: 20 to 25 percent by next year, 50 percent by 2020, and 100 percent by 2026. Seventyfive percent of Americans would live in a place where there would be no marketplace insurer. We know that for every 455 people who gain coverage across the United States, according to the New England Journal of Medicine, that at least one life is saved. So if we lose coverage for 20 million people next year, we would be looking at 43,000 to almost 44,000 avoidable deaths in the United States. That is why this is life and death. TrumpCare has had its shot, and it has failed. It is time for the parties to come together now. It is time to have a bipartisan bill to fix the ACA. The American people deserve nothing less. 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF OFFICER MIOSOTIS FAMILIA (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the memory of Officer Miosotis Familia. Officer Familia was a member of the New York City Police Department’s 46th Precinct in the Bronx who lost her life in the early hours of July 5. She was targeted by a deranged exconvict who assassinated her in cold blood. As New York City Police Commissioner James O’Neill said at Officer Familia’s funeral: ‘‘Everything our government stands for—freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear—everything starts with public safety. Miosotis knew this, and she wanted all of to us play our part. ‘‘That is why violence against police and what we represent is a dishonor to civilized society.’’ With a renewed dedication to law enforcement and the communities they serve, we pledge to keep Officer Familia’s legacy alive. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  Commissioner O’Neill’s remarks. 
REMARKS BY COMMISSIONER O’NEILL FOR  OFFICER FAMILIA ’SFUNERAL  Good morning everybody. Barbara [NYPD Chaplain Rev. Dr. Barbara WilliamsHarris], I’m not sure if I’m ready to celebrate yet. I have to work on it. Members of the NYPD Chaplains Unit; Pastor Davidson and the staff and congregation of World Changers Church—I love the name; Mayor de Blasio; Adriana, Gennie, Peter, Delilah; Inspector Phil Rivera and all the men and women of the 4–6 Precinct in the Bronx; law enforcement officers from all across our nation and the world, many of whom traveled great distances to support us in this time of incredible sorrow; and all other friends and family gathered here this morning: On behalf of the entire New York City Police Department, I extend our most profound condolences. Police Officer Miosotis Familia was a kind and authentic woman. One of 10 children raised in Washington Heights before she and her family moved together to the Bronx, she was serious but sharpwitted. And though she was the youngest, her siblings say she was never spoiled. Miosotis was the glue that held her large family together. She would mediate any dispute, especially among her six feisty sisters. Known as a lovable goof, they playfully called her ‘‘La Loca,’’ or Crazy Girl. And later, as a mother, she would teach her own children life lessons—like being kind to strangers, blessing others with a smile, and respecting those less fortunate. I’m told that Valentine’s Day was her favorite holiday. She’d really go overboard with the hearts and the decorations in their Kingsbridge apartment, just so the kids could see all the love that was theirs. Like every New Yorker, Miosotis just wanted to do her job, work hard, live without fear, improve her life, and the lives of 86 yearold mother, her two daughters, and her son. But she also wanted to do something else: She wanted to improve the lives of other families, as well. When she made that decision 12 years ago to become an NYPD cop— a Bronx cop—she epitomized why many people choose to become police officers. Gennie, Peter, Delilah: I can talk forever about the great things—the fantastic things that police officers do every single day for millions of people—but nothing I can say will bring your mom back. I’m sorry for that. But I can make you this promise: Your mom didn’t die in vain. Your mom’s legacy will never fade from importance or memory. Your mom made it her mission to make your home—New York City—a better and safer place for everyone. And I vow to you we will continue to find our way forward in her honor. Because that’s what cops do. Cops are regular people who believe in the possibility of making this a safer world. It’s why we do what we do. It’s why we run toward, when others run away. Your mom believed in the possibility of being part of something larger than herself. She accepted the vast responsibility that came with her decision, knowing that it would be challenging, recognizing that someone has to do this job, and believing she was willing and able to fill that role. And she was right. Miosotis wanted other people to know her, to work with her, and to help her make this a better city for all of us. Everything our government stands for— freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear—everything starts with public safety. Miosotis knew this, and she wanted all of us to play our part. That is why violence against the police and what we represent is a dishonor to civilized society. We should be outraged that any single person had so little regard for your right to public safety. On the night our nation celebrated its independence, the coward who committed this atrocity did not walk down the street after midnight and shoot just anybody. He shot a cop. Mental illness and medication may have played a part—I don’t know. What is certain, however, is that he hated the police. He saw us as the ‘‘bad guys’’ because countless times he heard it in conversation, saw it on television, read it in the newspapers. Combine that toxic blend with his special brand of evil, and you get . . . this funeral. Hate has consequences. When we demonize a whole group of people—whether that group is defined by race, by religion, or by occupation—this is the result. I don’t know how else to say it: This was an act of hate, in this case, against police officers—the very people who stepped forward and made a promise to protect you, day and night. This amazing woman, this mother, this daughter, this sister, this friend, this New York City police officer, was assassinated solely because of what she represented and for the responsibility she embraced. All her killer could see was a uniform, even though Miosotis was so much more. He blamed the police for his own terrible choices in life. And for the way he emerged after our society agreed he should go away to prison for a while. As a city, and as a country, I don’t believe we’re in the same place we were at the end of 2014, when Detectives Rafael Ramos and WenJian Liu were assassinated under similar circumstances in Brooklyn. We are on firmer ground now, with police and communities working more effectively together. But in mid2017, there unquestionably is a creeping apathy among the public about the work and role of its dedicated police officers. I think of it this way: You don’t really notice the lights are on . . . until they go out. If we do wrong, we are vilified. If we do right, we are ignored. There is little attention paid to positive changes in policing, in general, and in this police department, in particular, no matter how effective they may be. 
But the manner in which Miosotis was killed should remind everybody that the civility of our society balances on a knife’s edge. And the 36,000 uniformed members of the NYPD are just regular people who made a selfless decision to help maintain that balance. There is nothing more human than a 48 yearold mother of three, living in the Bronx, who decided to swear an oath, put on a uniform, and live a life with meaning. Fighting crime and keeping people safe is not a responsibility that the police take lightly, and neither should the public. While crime continues to go down, year after year, that provides little comfort when the fabric of our society, the blanket of public safety we provide, is torn by a senseless, direct assault on one of our protectors. Here are the numbers we don’t talk about nearly enough: Since our start in 1845, more than 840 New York City police officers have died in the line of duty. Miosotis is our seventh cop to be shot and killed in just the last five years. And she’s our third female officer ever to be murdered on the job. Across our nation, 135 police officers were killed in the line of duty last year, the sharpest spike in the last five years. And just yesterday, New York State Trooper Joel Davis was killed in the line of duty while responding to a radio run of a domestic dispute in upstate New York. Each of these murdered officers has one thing in common: They lost their lives while protecting the lives of others. Some people say: ‘‘Well, that’s what cops signed up for, right? That’s their job.’’ Let me tell you something: Regular people sign up to be cops. They sign up for this job of protecting strangers, knowing there are inherent risks. But not one of us ever agreed to be murdered in an act of indefensible hate. Not one of us signed up to never return to our family or loved ones. So, where are the demonstrations for this single mom, who cared for her elderly mother and her own three children? There is anger and sorrow, but why is there no outrage? Because Miosotis was wearing a uniform? Because it was her job? I simply do not accept that. Miosotis was targeted, ambushed, and assassinated. She wasn’t given a chance to defend herself. That should matter to every single person who can hear my voice, in New York City and beyond. We know there’s evil in this world. That’s why we need the police. But as New Yorkers, we can decide that people like Miosotis’ killer will ultimately fail. He will not drive us apart. We can decide to come together and make our city reflect the good inside all of us, the hopes and simple dreams we share. I’m asking the public to make a commitment to support your police, to work with us. Commit to watching the backs of those you call when you’re scared, those you call when you’re in trouble. NYPD cops answer about fourandahalf million radio runs a year, and are flagged down countless other times. AnAfor good or bad, only a tiny handful of our actions make the news. That tiny handful—some when things go right, others when things go wrong—because that’s what sells newspapers—those are the ones that define us. And the millions—literally millions—of our other actions go unnoticed. But we don’t turn away from criticism, because we know it comes handinhand with the possibility of making the safest big city in America even safer. We know you need us. And we need you. We want all our neighborhoods to be safer places for our children, for our elderly, for ourselves. But without peace and safety, we have nothing. It’s a shared responsibility. You must participate. You must not retreat. It seems that we put all our societal failures on our police to solve. If there’s not enough drug addiction funding, many say it’s the police who should change their tactics. If there’s not enough money for mental health, many say it’s the cops who need to alter what they’re doing out on the streets. If our society hasn’t adequately invested in schools, the cops need to figure that out. We tell our police: ‘‘You’re the counselor, you’re the parent, you’re the social worker, you’re the referee.’’ But policing was never intended to solve all those problems. It’s our obligation to continually drive down crime and keep people safe. That’s what Miosotis vowed to do. And that’s the work we vow to continue in her stead. What we are left with are the memories, moments shared, lives touched, friendships forged. There is no making sense of what is truly senseless. There is no explaining the unexplainable. Words do not do it justice. We cannot fix the hurt. We have to put that in the hands of a higher power. And the higher power I’m talking about is you. We need the public to take a moreactive role in our city’s safety. I’m asking you to connect with your police. Listen to my words: Your police. We are yours. We’re here to help. We’re here to make things better. But we nee your assistance. We need it now, more than ever. Because no one knows what’s going on a street, or a block, better than those who live and work there every day. That’s how your neighborhoods will keep getting better. And that’s how we’re going to continue to keep driving crime down and keep everybody safe. And that’s how we’ll find our way forward, together. That’s Miosotis’ legacy. The pain we feel today will not soon pass, but we know she did not die in vain. Our anger can be transformed into effective change. Our sorrow can make us a better society. We may not ever match the sacrifice made by Miosotis, but surely we can try to match her sense of service. If we cannot match her courage, we can strive to match her devotion. In the last few days—the 46 Precinct, Police Plaza, all across New York—we’ve received many, many messages of hope and support. They tell us that people around the nation and around the world love the police very much, and mourn with us. They tell us they need us, and that they are proud of us. I, too, couldn’t be more proud of our cops. To the men and women of the NYPD who bravely put on that uniform every day—and they do, it takes courage—and to all those who have come before us: Thank you for your dedication, your leadership, and your powerful example. And I also couldn’t be more proud of—and thankful for—Miosotis, whom I promote today to DetectiveFirst Grade. Please rise and applaud her life and service. To Gennie, Peter, and Delilah: Here we are, today, literally surrounded by a sea of blue as far as the eye can see outside this building. And know this: Our family will always be with yours. We don’t ever forget. We will always be here for you and this city. And to all the members of the NYPD: Do not ever forget why you chose to become a police officer. Be proud of who you are and what you do. Always remember that Miosotis lived to protect all New Yorkers, and her legacy protects us still. We pray that she now finds rest, and that her beloved family finds solace and peace and the strength to live the lives their mother fought to give them. God bless Miosotis. God bless her family. God bless every member of the New York City Police Department, who will forever carry on her most important work. Thank you. 
Mr. FASO. I also include in the RECORD my full statement. May God bless Officer Miosotis Familia’s memory. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, today I rise to honor the memory of Officer Miosotis Familia. Officer Familia was a member of the New York Police Department’s 46th Precinct in the Bronx who lost her life in the early hours of July 5th. She was targeted by a deranged exconvict who assassinated her in cold blood. All of New York was affected by this evil act. The 48yearold loving mother devoted her life to helping others. Sadly, she becomes the third female NYPD officer to be murdered on the job; the first in New York since 9/11. Officer Familia had two daughters and a son. She wanted to leave them a better future, a safer city. Every one of the 36,000 uniformed members of the NYPD goes to work every day for this vision. They sacrifice. They risk bodily harm, and worse. Too often they do so despite a hostile media and an indifferent public. As New York Police Commissioner James O’Neill said about her, and all law enforcement personnel, at Officer Familia’s funeral: ‘‘Cops are regular people who believe in the possibility of making this a safer world. It’s why we do what we do. It’s why we run toward, when others run away.’’ He remarked, furthermore, ‘‘Everything our government stands for—freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear—everything starts with public safety. Miosotis knew this, and she wanted all of us to play our part. That is why violence against the police and what we represent is a dishonor to civilized society. We should be outraged that any single person had so little regard for your right to public safety.’’ Through it all, Officer Miosotis Familia carried love in her heart: love for the Bronx neighborhood she patrolled; love for the people of her city and state; and love for the oath she swore all those years ago when she made the decision to enter law enforcement: To serve and protect. Her killer—and I refuse to mention his name—was driven only by hate. This is the hate which in 2016 resulted in the sharpest spike in police killings in five years. It is the hate that robbed three children of their mother with a single gunshot on a dark Bronx street. I want to share with this Chamber a recollection by Officer Familia’s oldest daughter, delivered at her funeral. She said that Miosotis came into her room on July 4 before going to work, a regular person believing in the possibility of bringing about a safer world. She said, ‘‘I’m going to work now. And I love you.’’ She hugged her daughter, twice, and left to join her fellow officers. Now Officer Familia joins those lost in the line of duty. With love in her heart, she kept us safe. With a renewed dedication to law enforcement and the communities they serve, we pledge here to keep Officer Miosotis Familia’s legacy alive. 
WISHING JOHN M CCAIN A SPEEDY RECOVERY (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I left an event and went straight to my 
cellphone. The first thing on it was a notice that JOHN MCCAIN had brain cancer. I literally stopped in my steps and thought about JOHN MCCAINand was saddened. Senator JOHNMCCAINis a true American hero who served our country in Vietnam and has served our country in this House of Representatives and the United States Senate. When he ran for President, he had a bus called Straight Talk, and that wasn’t just a name on a bus. He is a straight shooter. He has been a voice of reason and honesty, standing up and speaking truth to power during these last 6 months of this current Presidency, and somebody whom we need as a voice. It seems that Arizona produces those voices. They produced it with Barry Goldwater, and they produced it with JOHNMCCAIN. He is a nice guy, too. The few opportunities I had to interchange with JOHN MCCAINor go up to him and say something to him about an issue, he was always very easygoing, very pleasant, a good human being. I urge you, if there are people in your life that you think well of, that you care about, let them know it now, and keep JOHN MCCAIN in your prayers. Hopefully, he will come back and continue to serve the United States as he has throughout his entire life. 
b1245 HIGHLIGHTING HALL GROWS (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the success of my friends and neighbors at the Hall County Chapter of the Georgia Farm Bureau. This past year, the Farm Bureau launched Hall GROWS, an educational initiative designed to help students expand their knowledge of agriculture. In my home State of Georgia, agriculture is the largest industry, contributing $74 billion to the State’s GDP. Our young people represent the next generation of farmers, agricultural experts, and consumers. It is our duty to ensure that these young students possess an understanding of the strategic advantage that agriculture represents for the United States. The Farm Bureau is donating time, funding, and other resources so that schools can cultivate gardens, hold workshops for educators, and have classroom activities to help students. Because of efforts like these, Hall GROWS can continue to make an impact both in the lives of students and on the future of the industry. The Farm Bureau’s willingness to support students attests to the generosity of the American farmer. I am excited to see this program make a positive difference in communities like my own in Hall County in Gainesville, Georgia. Again, congratulations to the Hall County Farm Bureau for their work and effort and Hall GROWS. f 
REMEMBERING AND HONORING CONGRESSMAN MARK TAKAI (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago today, we lost a brother, a friend, and a colleague, someone who made a great impact on my home State of Hawaii and this country. My friend, Congressman Mark Takai, was someone who lived his entire life with a full heart committed to serving the people of Hawaii and his country. Always ready with a helping hand with creative new ideas and a hearty laugh, Mark was someone who was always on the move. I had the honor of serving with Mark all the way back in the Hawaii State Legislature, through our time serving together in the Hawaii Army National Guard and then, again, here in Congress where we both served on the Armed Services Committee. Mark, time and time again, made his decisions based on how best he could serve the people of Hawaii, and he took a lot of pictures along the way. Mark led by example with respect and with aloha understanding and passion building partnerships focused on seeing how he could get the job done. So on this day commemorating Mark, my heart is with his family: his wife, Sami; his kids, Matthew and Kaila; his parents, Naomi and Erik; our entire National Guard ‘‘family,’’ ‘‘ohana,’’ and the people of Hawaii as we remember Mark and honor his entire life and legacy of service. 
OBAMACARE (Mr. DESANTIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DESANTIS. Mr. Speaker, Republicans have promised for years to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and this effort has seemed to have stalled in the Senate. The best way to restart the ObamaCare repeal process is simple. Make Congress live under it. The President can make this happen. ObamaCare included a provision dropping the congressional health plans for Members of Congress and diverting Members to the ObamaCare exchanges where they would have to pay their own premiums. Yet an Obama administration regulation gutted this provision and provided lucrative taxpayer subsidies for Members thereby creating an illegal exemption for Congress under ObamaCare. Mr. President, cancel this regulatory exception. Make Members live under ObamaCare as written. If you make them live under ObamaCare, my guess is that they will vote to quickly repeal ObamaCare. f 
FREEDOM FROM BURDENSOME REGULATIONS (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, last week, I started ‘‘Freedom Friday’’ to highlight freedomkilling regulations currently in effect. Congress used the Congressional Review Act to overturn 14 regulations implemented in the waning days of the Obama administration. The repeal of these rules alone could save the economy millions of hours of paperwork—as much as $3.7 billion in regulatory costs to Federal agencies and up to $35 billion in compliance costs for industries. This is a nice start, but we are not done yet. My main priority here in Congress is to restore the constitutional parameters of the Federal Government and end overregulation. The first regulation that I will be highlighting for ‘‘Freedom Friday’’ is an overly burdensome restriction on our trucking industry. California and the Ninth Circuit have imposed more stringent standards for truckers than those established by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. There are some issues over which Congress has clear constitutional authority. This is one of them. We simply cannot allow our vital interstate commerce to fall victim to an incoherent patchwork of burdensome regulations. Our economic and national security depend on resisting this ominous trend. 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COMER ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I want to follow up on what my friend from Florida, Congressman RONDESANTIS , was saying: Under ObamaCare—that passed without a single Republican vote—Congress was expressly put under all of the conditions of ObamaCare, and it expressly took us out from the insurance that we liked, the insurance plans we had and liked, and 180 degrees contrary to what President Obama said and so many of our friends across the aisle. Even though we liked our insurance and we wanted to keep it, it turns out that was not true what they had been saying for so many months. We didn’t get to keep our insurance. I know emails keep circulating that Members of Congress have some special ‘‘pie in the sky’’ health insurance, but, actually, it is exactly the same insurance options that every single Federal employee from—well, I started to say 
from the President down, but, actually, the President does have his own special healthcare. But I guess that is why ObamaCare seemed so appealing. It wouldn’t affect the President and his family, or he might have looked at it a little bit differently. But since he has his 24/7 physician, it seemed okay to him to force the rest of the country under it. Every Federal employee before ObamaCare had the same options we did. The major change in congressional healthcare came since the provision was put in there. Although every single Federal employee had employer—which means Federal Government, which means taxpayer—assistance in paying the premiums for their health insurance, we had to pay part and the Federal Government paid part—taxpayers, in other words, paid part. That was pretty common across the country. But in ObamaCare, for some reason, Speaker PELOSI and Majority Leader Harry Reid thought it was a good idea to stick it to Members of Congress that were not in leadership so that there would be no Federal supplement. No Federal employer was going to pay part of the cost of the insurance, health insurance, for Members of Congress. That is in the bill. Originally, we thought that meant every single Member of Congress would not get the employer part paid by the Federal Government. But it turns out the Speaker and certain of the leadership and leadership staff who must have helped draft the bill, that the way it was worded did not include the funds they were paid for them so they would continue to get the Federal portion paid by the government and taxpayers as that is. But then Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader Reid, and President Obama got together, and they worked out a deal. Like my friend, Congressman DESANTIS  from Florida, pointed out, they made a deal to completely ignore what was in black and white print in ObamaCare that Members of Congress, other than the leadership, would not have the Federal Government paying any part of theirs. All the rest of the Federal employees in the country, yes, they would still have the Federal Government pay part of their insurance, only Members of Congress wouldn’t. They made a deal to specifically ignore what our Democratic friends put in the law, in black and white expressly there, and so we had gotten so many calls and so much information. Going all over east Texas, I’ve heard from so many people who have lost their insurance who now could not afford their insurance and now were forced into a network that did not have the doctor who was saving their lives or the medication that was saving their lives, didn’t have Mayo Clinic and didn’t have the certain cancer facility that they had been using to keep their lives going. I had heard so many of those horror stories from constituents I just could not—I mean, I went and talked to the personnel here that are supposed to help us sign up for healthcare, and I just could not bring myself to sign up for ObamaCare that was being illegally interpreted. It is not even an interpretation; it is very clear. We didn’t get the Federal subsidy, yet they agreed to do it despite what they put in the law and agreed to in the law. So I went without insurance at all for a few years and then have to pay extra to have insurance through my wife’s employer. RONDESANTIS made a great point. If we went ahead and enforced ObamaCare exactly the way it is written, the Speaker and the leaders would be taken care of in the House and Senate, but the rankandfile Members of the House and Senate, I think, would more quickly have come to the conclusion: we have got to have a change, and we have got to have it quick. Perhaps that is what President Obama was thinking when he agreed to have the taxpayers fund the huge part of the congressional health insurance that, gee, if he did that, then they wouldn’t be as quick to want to overturn it. I think it is very important as we hear friends across the aisle talk about how devastating it will be if we repeal ObamaCare. Yeah, what happens? Think about it. What happens if we repeal ObamaCare? We would go back to the way it was before ObamaCare passed. I didn’t remember it being quite this high, but one of our friends mentioned this week, I remember the polls were saying 75 percent of Americans were satisfied with their health insurance before ObamaCare was shoved down every Americans’ throat. So if we repealed ObamaCare, what would happen is we would go back to a health insurance—or a healthcare situation—where 75 percent of Americans were satisfied. What many of us were saying, as we were in the minority on this side, we were begging our friends across the aisle, look, don’t just throw out the entire healthcare system the way it is even though you have got people in the health insurance business and the big pharmaceuticals helping you write ObamaCare so they are going to make billions and billions more than they have ever made—yes, it is true, a lot of health insurers have gone out of business, but the big ones that helped write ObamaCare and sign on to it—happy to endorse it and embrace it—made record profits. So much for opposing crony capitalism. We see it at its best in ObamaCare. So Americans should be a bit skeptical when they see some of the people who helped write ObamaCare and made billions and billions saying: oh, no, let’s not throw it out. Well, just remember, if we did that, if we just voted to end ObamaCare and have our system exist as if ObamaCare had never passed, it would immediately put us into a situation where the vast majority of Americans were satisfied with their health insurance and with the healthcare they got. b1300 I have noted over the years that one of the things that has helped with the acceptance by the minority that has accepted ObamaCare as being a good thing has been that politicians here in Washington have skewed the difference between health insurance and healthcare. I know people have said: Oh, gosh, people were dying on the sidewalks. Actually, if you are on the sidewalk and you have got a health problem, you do as people that I have seen in the emergency rooms have done: they go to the emergency room. I am standing in line behind them, waiting to get care for one of my children. So it wasn’t a matter of not getting that healthcare. Those people did not have health insurance. What good is ObamaCare insurance when your deductible is $7,000, $8,000, and you are paying $10,000, $12,000 a year for your insurance and you don’t have enough to put aside in savings to even pay $1,000 to $2,000 of your deductible? Yes, you have health insurance, but you sure don’t have healthcare because now, because of ObamaCare, you cannot afford it. Yes, from time to time I hear people say: Yeah, but the subsidy is working out so well, I am able to have insurance. Well, what is your deductible? Well, it is pretty high, but I am satisfied with it. You know what we keep finding? They are satisfied with it because they have got cheap health insurance and it works out fine until they have something catastrophic happen and they find out they don’t have the money to cover what they have got to cover. We have got to do something. I submit it wouldn’t be so bad to go back to a system that a majority of Americans said they were satisfied with and then work from there. Don’t throw out the whole system again and make the Federal Government, Big Brother, have its fingers in every aspect of your supposed care. When the Federal Government has that role, whether you want to call them death panels or not, there are bureaucrats who will make decisions to decide what they are going to allow you to have and be paid for. That should never, ever be the role of the government. Some say to go to a singlepayer system. I despise that term because it masks just how evil the system is. It is socialized medicine, which is also another way of saying you have rationed care. Everybody is not going to get what they need, and the government will decide who they think has a life valuable enough to get a new knee or to get a new hip or to have back surgery or to have lifesaving surgery. The government will decide that. 
That is the same reason I have heard from numerous seniors now. Before ObamaCare passed, they had Medicare as supplemental coverage. But even so, after ObamaCare passed, which cut $716 billion out of Medicare, they could not get timely surgeries that they needed before ObamaCare. If we don’t repeal ObamaCare, it will continue with those wait times that many seniors are now experiencing. Whereas, it used to be: When do you want to do this? Tomorrow? Next week? When do you want to do it? Now it is: I know you need it now, but it is going to be 2 or 3 months before we can work you in. It is rationed care. That is what ObamaCare causes. There is going to be more and more of that unless we get ObamaCare repealed. I just don’t think that is an option. A majority of Americans did not want ObamaCare, and, after it passed, still didn’t want ObamaCare. They gave us the majority in the House, now in the Senate, and now the Presidency on a promise that we would get rid of ObamaCare. So we start from the premise that healthcare will be better and more affordable once ObamaCare is repealed. There needs to be reforms, but you have got to start from the premise that you have to get rid of the system that is skewing and basically destroying the greatest healthcare system ever produced in the history of the world. Medical historians, as I noted before, have indicated there was probably some point in the early 1900s—it can be debated when that point may have occurred; some say around the protocols in the early 1900s, around World War I—or whenever it was, around 100 years ago, for the first time in human history, someone who needed healthcare had a better chance of getting better if they didn’t go see a doctor. That point was in the early 1900s. After that point, you started having a better chance of getting well if you went to see a doctor. So you look at that time, whether it is 100 years, 120 years, and to think that just in the thousands of years of recorded history in our lifetimes, you have not only had a chance of getting well after seeing a doctor, but you have a great chance of being cured. Think of all the diseases and conditions that we found cures for. We have so many yet to go. There will always be something else that needs to be researched and cured, because that is the state of this world. But we had a system here in America that produced more lifesaving medications and treatments and surgeries, more lifesaving and enhancing procedures of all kinds because, for one thing, we had competition, we had a free market system. Our Founders so wisely put in the Constitution provisions for rewarding people, because of original thoughts or inventions, copyrights and patents. Congress has done a lot of damage to that system in recent years, but it still provides an incentive to create something that is lifesaving or lifeenhancing. We simply cannot build a healthcare system that helps people based on the foundation of ObamaCare. More and more—until it is complete, socialized medicine will be, if we leave ObamaCare in place, there will be more and more rationed care, which means less and less care for individuals. For 6 years, Republicans have been united in our support for fully repealing ObamaCare. Congress has voted—at least the House has—more than 60 times to repeal ObamaCare. So it is not the time to get timid. Now is the time to support the President’s efforts to get rid of ObamaCare. If what we have to do is bring forth the bill that we passed in the last Congress and put it on the desk of the President to get rid of the thing that has, at least informally, President Obama’s name and that he says he is proud of—people are getting hurt, people can’t afford what they have got. More and more are losing insurance. We are losing more and more insurance companies. I still continue to be quite concerned to just say there is a great panacea in buying insurance across State lines because, unless we end the exemption from the monopoly laws, the antitrust laws, then we could very easily end up with only one or two insurance companies in the whole country instead of having only one in 30 or 40 States. Far better it is to just end the exemption from antitrust laws, end the ability for a health insurance company to monopolize and have monopolistic tactics that keep entrepreneurs from developing new insurance companies, different ways of paying for healthcare. We have got to end that so that people that come up with new ways and better ways to provide healthcare end up doing well because of their great idea to provide more affordable healthcare. One thing in my mind that is absolutely certain: if we can just get rid of ObamaCare, then one of the steps we have got to take is to get back to a system that we had 50 years ago or so, when I was growing up in Mount Pleasant in east Texas, and you knew what things cost. All the different times I had to be taken in for stitches because I got involved in activity that was going to get somebody hurt—and I was often the one—all those times I went in for stitches, my parents always knew what it was going to cost when the doctor put stitches in my head or above and below my eye. All the different places I have got them, they knew. Of course, on one occasion—he can’t get in trouble now because he is gone— a dear friend of the family that was a family physician at the time let my mother, since she was such a good seamstress, put in maybe three of my five stitches. Mother said: That is just basic sewing; I can do that. He said: You sure could. I have seen you sew. That is all it is. I don’t encourage that kind of thing, but mother did a nice job, and he closed it up. She knew she was still going to pay the fee. Even though she put a couple of stitches in, she knew she was going to pay the fee. Anyway, he was shorthanded on nurses that day, and mother was the nurse because it was a weekend and he came in special. Anyway, you don’t see people anymore, like they did when I was young, who say: I am going to a different doctor because the other doctor raised his prices and that one is just as good. You don’t see that. Nobody knows actually what the doctors are getting paid. I have asked for answers from wonderful healthcare providers that are really trying to take care of people: How much is this? How much is that? Well, LOUIE, I can’t really tell you. It depends. Is it Medicare, Medicaid, cash, Blue Cross, Anthem, an HMO? You have got to tell me. And what is the diagnosis? Sometimes it is a different charge, depending on what the disease is. Why is that? Because the government has put different payment schemes on these things. We have got to get rid of a system where nobody knows what anything costs. You can’t have competition and spur healthcare and healthcare providers on to the very best they can possibly do to innovate new ways and better ways to treat people and to provide healthcare if we don’t have actual competition and people knowing what they are paying for. That is one of the things we have got to get back to. I know there are some physicians who have said: Well, my contract with the insurance company doesn’t have that provision. I have heard some do, but some have told me: Yes, my contract as a doctor with that insurance company said I specifically cannot let somebody who is paying cash pay as low an amount as I am taking as full payment from this insurance company. Well, that shouldn’t be the case. But as long as an insurance company can monopolize, violate antitrust laws, then they will be able to do that kind of thing to keep people from being able to pay cash as readily as they could if they were one of the major insurance companies. b1315 We ought to get out of that. How do you get out of that? Well, the first thing is you never ever will as long as ObamaCare continues to be the law of the land. So I am so proud we have a President that continues to push the idea of getting rid of ObamaCare so that we can have a better system providing healthcare. And I do use the word ‘‘healthcare’’ and not ‘‘health insurance.’’ And it bothers the heck out of me that the CBO makes this grandiose 
claim of how many people will lose their insurance, because they are too ignorant, under the models they create, to distinguish the difference between somebody who chooses not to buy a policy that costs them a fortune, has a huge deductible, and is going to not help them when they need it, and someone who says: Gee, I want to keep this insurance, but I can’t afford it. The CBO has made themselves—put themselves in such a blind position, they can’t tell the difference. The CBO says, ‘‘Well, if somebody says, I am not paying for this insurance policy. The deductible is too high. The premiums are too high. I am going to put my money in a savings account, and I will have, in 3 years, $40,000 to cover healthcare problems, if I have some in the future, and that will keep growing,’’ well, they will say that poor person that now has a huge growing health savings account is like a poor homeless individual, and the government yanked away their insurance. No. They just chose to quit rewarding a health insurance company for not providing them insurance that they need. There is a difference between losing insurance and just refusing to buy insurance that is worthless. I am hoping that we are moving closer to the day when we can get rid of this Democrat Congress contrived group called the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. I have been convinced for a number of years that we will never be able to get this country on sound footing with a driving economy, all boats being lifted, getting the country out of debt as long as the CBO is the official scorer for the bills in this building. It seems clear to me. Yes, I understand. They have come to my office a couple of times. I understand. I get it. You create models, and then you feed this information in that you think is important to the models you created that hardly ever rely on actual historical performance. And then you just dutifully report what the model says the cost is and what is going to happen as a result. Try living with history and using absolute historical evidence of what happens instead of creating some goofy model that, as best it appears now, when they—well, first, I think $1.2 trillion, they estimated ObamaCare. And then after President Obama woodshedded Elmendorf, the director— and I know he doesn’t like that term— but whatever you want to call it, he called him over to the Oval Office, met with him; Elmendorf comes out, redoes his numbers—Oh, it was under a trillion dollars. $800 billion, just like President Obama said. How about that? And then as soon as it passes, shortly thereafter, well, you know, it is actually probably more like 1.7, 1.9. And now more modern estimates say it is not $800 billion; it is now 1.2. It is at least $2 trillion, maybe $4 trillion, maybe $4
1⁄2trillion. It is just through the roof. So I don’t think it is unrealistic to say that the CBO’s margin of error on ObamaCare wasn’t plus or minus 2 or 3 percent. It was plus or minus 200 to 400 or so percent. No entity that cannot have a better margin of error than 200 percent has any business scoring anything considered official in this building. And I know Dr. Arthur Laffer got a private grant to figure out a way to have competitive scoring of bills in the House and Senate so that these scorers could have a score on their accuracy, their success rate for accurate scoring of bills. So as you go along, this Republican idea of competition being a good thing—you have competitive scoring instead of one official group that will never allow this country to get on a proper footing because it was set up in 1974 as Nixon was going out. And the Democrats were having a heyday, and they got a little giddy and left 2 million people in southeast Asia to die instead of having an orderly transition, and, at home, were wreaking havoc with the way we pass laws in this building. I will continue to urge the President of the United States, as we take up a tax reform bill, not to give in to the pressure from people in Congress toward the top to go more to a 20 or 21 percent corporate tax because the corporate tax really is about the most insidious—one of the most insidious taxes because it is based on a lie. We tell the American people, ‘‘Oh, you don’t have to worry. We are going to sock it to these evil corporations and make them pay all this big tax,’’ when the fact is that corporations don’t exist, don’t continue to exist if they don’t have the customers pay that corporate tax. That charge is ultimately paid by Americans across the country. It is another way of sticking it to the little guy when you have a high corporate tax. And I am fully aware there are people in this country that think it is a great thing that they think we are evolving from a manufacturing country to more of a service economy where we just provide services and don’t get engaged in this lowlife manufacturing. Well, guess what, that lowlife manufacturing is how a country survives for centuries. Any nation that is considered to have power in the world loses that power after the next war if they cannot produce the things that they need to defend themselves from hateful, evil leaders in the world. Some people didn’t seem to mind when we were losing the tire manufacturing, steel manufacturing, steel product manufacturing, losing all that to China. They didn’t seem to care. Oh, Louie, don’t worry about it. We are a service economy. Well, as a historian, I am telling you, if we don’t get back to manufacturing the things that we have to have to defend ourselves successfully against evil tyrants—whether in Iran, North Korea, totalitarian in Russia, wherever, if we don’t manufacture what we need to defend ourselves and our freedoms, we won’t have them past the next war. And be sure of this. Don’t believe me. You know, Jesus said there will always be wars and rumors of wars. They are going to exist. But Reagan was right. You know, the best way to avoid a war is to have so much strength that people will not attack you. They don’t want to challenge you because they know you can take them out. Unfortunately, we have had the ability to take out evil empires and evil tyrant leaders for a long time. But just as occurred when I was in the United States Army, Active Duty for 4 years, was at Fort Benning, and our embassy was attacked in Tehran, hostages were taken. We had a President—well, he had hailed the Ayatollah Khomeini as a man of peace when he took power, so it was kind of tough on him to turn around and attack him. But the Iranians said the students did it. But it became very clear very soon, they stopped saying the students had the hostages, and started saying, ‘‘We have the hostages.’’ It was a governmentorchestrated attack. They could have and should have protected our embassy, and Carter should have made it clear: You either get our people out unharmed or we are bringing the full power of the United States military to Iran. And it wouldn’t be a bluff. I think they would have let them go. That is why they spent at least 3 days talking about the students having them. That was a way out. If Carter had said, ‘‘We are coming if you don’t get those folks out,’’ I think that they would have let them go. But you can’t bluff in a situation like that. But we should have made it clear that we are not tolerating attacks on United States land—and that is what an embassy is. And because we didn’t defend ourselves there, the stories started: Well, they ran from Vietnam. You know, didn’t do anything, the paper tiger. One after another we got hit and didn’t properly respond. And I understand President Reagan acknowledged that he let the Congress intimidate him into pulling our forces out of Beirut after 300 marines or so precious lives were lost to a terrorist attack. So the story built and continued: The United States is a paper tiger. They won’t defend themselves. And it became attractive to be attacked. So we need a 15 percent corporate tax. Meeting with different CEOs in years past over in China: Why did you leave America? I thought they would say: Because of all the regulations. Yeah, those were problems. And sometimes unions are too—demand too much, and we can’t stay in business, so we move. But no. The number one answer over and over is: You know, we got a deal cut, and now we are at an effective rate between 15, 20 percent corporate tax. 
And in America, you know, they say, cumulatively, corporations are probably paying around 40 percent for corporate tax. It is time to undercut the tax that China pays. Bring back our steel industry. Let’s get back to having Detroit— after so many of the great Midwestern States had cities that were model cities, and people were working, and there weren’t the big slums because things were going great, that day can come back. But it will not come back to the extent it could with a 20 or 21 percent corporate tax. But, oh, my goodness, if we cut our corporate tax to 15 percent, this United States economy will explode. This less than 2 percent that we had growth under President Obama, lowest for any 8 years in our history, that would end overnight. Mr. Speaker, if I might ask how much time I have left? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 23 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I want to direct attention to this ongoing narrative about collusion with Russia. We still desperately need an independent counsel to investigate the Mueller ComeyLynchClinton relationships. It appears Mueller is on a tear and he is going to do everything he can to divert attention from his collusion with James Comey. They were buddies. They colluded about so much. Comey is trying to get an independent counsel appointed. He was able—by leaking illegally, pulling these shenanigans, he consulted with Mueller even on his testimony. And Mueller is the guy who is supposed to judge the testimony. And under current Federal regulations, Mueller should have recused himself. We got to have somebody investigate Mueller. It is getting out of hand. b1330 In the meantime, the new developments seem to make clear to some of us that Donald Trump, Jr., seems like a nice guy, but he appears to have been the target of a Democratic action to try to take down the Trump campaign. They point to this meeting between Donald Trump and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Moscow attorney. Some of this is in an article written by Scott McKay, July 14, The American Spectator. She was trying to meet with Donald Trump, Jr., and when they actually had the meeting, she didn’t have anything to give him. She brought up about the bill that was passed that helped some extremely wealthy Russians who were buddies with Putin, but, as this article points out, the evidence of collusion between Trump, Jr., and the Russians seems to be based on a timeline which included the WikiLeaks disclosures of hacked Democratic National Committee emails and Trump’s request that the Russians make public the 30,000 emails of Clinton supposedly that she deleted from her illegal private server. But it is a smoking gun that Trump was the beneficiary of this Putin regime intelligence arm hacking the 2016 elections, so our friends across the aisle seem to say, but that doesn’t make sense. He got nothing out of the meeting. At some point, everybody in this room had to run for election, and if they had an opponent, if somebody said, ‘‘Hey, you need to know this about your opponent,’’ you know, at some time or another, everybody in this room has listened to something, and many times it is just garbage, and you say, ‘‘I don’t want anything to do with that.’’ And essentially that is what Donald Trump, Jr., did after he got lured into a meeting. But when you think, wait a minute, what was this Moscow attorney even doing in this country? This article points out that her presence in the United States alone ought to be the source of suspicion, that not only is the TrumpRussian collusion narrative suspect, but the real inquiry ought to be whether the encounter was a small part of a larger attempt to trap the Trump campaign. The Russian lawyer wasn’t even supposed to be in the United States. She had been denied a visa for entry into the United States in late 2015, but given a rather extraordinary parole by the Obama administration to assist preparation for a client subject to an asset forfeiture by the Justice Department. She could not be in the United States unless someone who answered directly to the President of the United States said: We are going to let her in. She is working on something special, so we are going to let her in. Even though we knew previously she is not somebody we should let in, she is doing something special right now. We want her in. And the story is that Loretta Lynch had to approve her coming in. So the client, Prevezon Holdings, that this Russian attorney was allowed to come in to help, was suspected of having paid some portion of $230 million stolen by Russian mobsters. When Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer representing a company that had been the victim of the theft, reported it to authorities in Moscow, he was promptly jailed and beaten to death by the Russians. The American response to this atrocity was the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which sanctioned several individuals connected to human rights abuses. The Russian Government retaliated by preventing American adoptions of Russian children. Who did that hurt? The Russian children, but Putin didn’t care. Why would he care? He is making billions, he has got people like this Russian lawyer who Loretta Lynch let in. So then we find out in June the Russian lawyer was permitted to fly back to the U.S. to have the meeting with Trump, Jr., at Trump Tower, no less, and then ends up in the front row for a congressional hearing. She was sitting right there behind the Obama Ambassador. In my experience, all the hearings I have seen, when you have somebody from the administration of the caliber of an ambassador, they are very careful to make sure people behind him are those who can hand a note to help him answer a question. That is what is normal. Yet there she is, right behind Obama’s Ambassador to Russia. Then she turns up at a D.C. showing of a documentary film on the negative effects of the Magnitsky Act and later appeared at a dinner involving another couple of representatives, and she is now a lobbyist for the Russians overtly. Maybe she was then. The repeal of that legislation is a priority item for the Russians and a personal objective for Veselnitskaya, the Russian attorney. So rather than any Clinton dirt, as was reportedly the primary subject brought forth at the meeting with Donald Trump, it appears she was here with the approval of Loretta Lynch, with the approval of the Obama Department of Homeland Security. They knew what she was about, just like they knew what the member of a terrorist organization was about when they approved him coming to the White House and Janet Napolitano lied at our hearing, said that that wasn’t happening. So she did all of this without a visa. She did not file a Foreign Agents Registration document, which is required, and the Obama administration gave her a pass on those things: Sure, let her in. She is doing important work. We are not giving her a visa; we are just letting her in. We are not going to pick her up, because she is doing important work. Really? She is setting Donald Trump, Jr., up, and the Obama administration considered that important enough to let this person who they previously realized should not be allowed in the country to come in to do that kind of important work, set up Donald Trump? Well, anyway, turns out Veselnitskaya was connected to Fusion GPS. That is the Democrat opposition research firm, which employed a former British spy who used Russian contacts to produce the infamous and now debunked ‘‘urinary dossier’’ smearing Trump. Veselnitskaya hired Fusion GPS head, Glenn Simpson, to work on behalf of Prevezon, the company she was allowed into the country to represent. Fusion then hired Christopher Steele, the British spy who drew on Russian sources to produce his dossier, and then they made him available for private briefings on the dossier with leftleaning media sources such as Mother Jones, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Yahoo, The New Yorker, CNN. And, by the way, there is Veselnitskaya’s social media account, which is decidedly more aligned with the Fusion GPS side of the equation 
than with Trump. She was no friend of the Trumps. Every indication was she wanted the Trumps taken down. Trump, Jr., met with her. It appears to be a setup. I was guest hosting Patriot Tonight the other night. Some people say: Why do you do this media? One of my jobs is to not only be aware of what is going on here, try to vote properly, argue the right way on different bills, but it is also to make sure that people in America know what is going on. And a guy called in, very interesting, but he seemed to have a pretty good grip on all of this. It is just amazing how many American citizens across the country—they are not confused by the smokescreen that we get from the mainstream media. So if timelines are interesting to you, there is this: reportedly the Obama administration sought permission to electronically monitor Trump Tower in early June, and the FISA court refused to grant it, but in October, they allowed it. Isn’t that something? Once they set up Donald Trump, Jr., with this friend of the Obama administration, this Russian attorney who was using the Democrats’ own opposition research firm, she was helping them, they then convinced a judge: Go ahead and let us monitor everything going on in Trump Tower. When the judge initially refused to do that. The article said: ‘‘So if you’d like to don your tinfoil hat and play the collusion game, try this on for size—when the Obama administration couldn’t get permission from the FISA court to surveil Trump, they allowed Veselnitskaya back in the country to take part in those Washington activities’’—meeting up with Donald Trump. ‘‘ . . . and in the meantime’’—she used—‘‘the administration’s pals at Fusion’’—GPS—‘‘with attempting to hook Trump, Jr.’’—into a basis for them getting a warrant. There was nothing to that meeting, yet they used it, got a warrant to further monitor everything going on in the Trump Tower in October. It just keeps pointing back to the fact we have got to get an independent counsel to investigate Mueller and his ties to Comey and Lynch and the Clintons, and get to the bottom of this mess. Yes, I want an investigation, because this is looking pretty lurid right now. Just in the time left, I do need to mention, this continuing push by friends across the aisle and the Obama holdovers in our executive branch, they think net neutrality is something we have got to have. Maureen Collins in The Federalist has a great article on July 19, and she points out regarding net neutrality: ‘‘The debate over net neutrality can easily turn into techiejargon that no one understands. Here is the basic gist: the internet is made up of bits. Proponents of net neutrality want to make sure these bits are all treated equally, meaning all web content appears on your computer at the same speed and with the same quality. ‘‘That sounds like a good thing, right? Supporters say that net neutrality would make all content equal by ensuring that internet providers cannot buy faster or higher quality content. The free market, they say, is inherently unfair and only a third party—the government—can determine how content should be treated. But that sounds exactly like textbook New Deal progressivism. ‘‘You see, this is not a question of whether or not internet content should be equally available. Rather, it is the much older question of who should determine that content is equally available: consumers, or the government?’’ ‘‘Even the background of net neutrality is straight out of the New Deal playbook. Like many administrative programs, the fight for net neutrality began when similar provisions failed in Congress. After legislative failures, what is a good progressive to do?’’ ‘‘Progressive,’’ that term bothers me, kind of like ‘‘single payer.’’ Single payer means socialized medicine, governmentrun and rationed healthcare. What does progressive mean? Well, it actually is a throwback. It is socialism. Some socialists are even hardcore communists, not all are, but they want an Orwellian government where they watch and know everything going on, and they know better than Americans do. Let the government decide your future. b1345 ‘‘The Bush FCC adopted principles for ‘preserving internet freedom’ in 2005, but did not go through a formal rulemaking process. In 2008, the FCC went after Comcast for going against these principles, only to get struck down by the D.C. Circuit, where bad administrative law goes to die. ‘‘The entire process repeated itself under the Obama administration. In 2010, the FCC adopted an ‘Open Internet Order.’ Verizon Wireless sued the commission and, again, the commission lost at the D.C. Circuit. ‘‘By now, it may seem that there must be something legally wrong with the FCC’s net neutrality regulations.’’ And that is exactly right. ‘‘Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress can give a specific power to an executive agency, like the FCC— usually through statute. Here’s the kicker: the FCC claimed Congress gave them the power to regulate the internet through the Communications Act of 1934. The observant reader will notice this law was passed a long time before the internet even existed, though the act did give the FCC power to regulate ‘common carriers’ like radio, wire communication, and telephone companies.’’ But not the internet. ‘‘Not only does net neutrality follow the New Deal’s progressive formula, it literally derives its power from a New Dealera law. Right before the 2016 Presidential election, the Obama FCC created a third set of net neutrality rules.’’ The bottom line is, if there is net neutrality, the government will decide what you get to see and hear on your internet. When I had family living in China, I knew what it was to be censured and have the government deciding. You can’t learn anything negative about the government. We cannot allow this pleasant sounding net neutrality to become a reality because, though it goes along perfectly with ObamaCare, with the government controlling our healthcare, why shouldn’t they control what we get to see and hear on the internet? And the bottom line is, this is the United States of America and it was created to control government, not to let the government control our free choices. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Today, we also pray that You would guide our lawmakers around the obstacles that hinder their progress, uniting them for the common good of this great land.
