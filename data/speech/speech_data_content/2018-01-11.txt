Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share Fabiola’s story and continue to demand a vote on the Dream Act. Fabiola and her family moved to Oregon when she was just 6 years old. When DACA was announced, it gave her the strength to come out of the shadows and pursue her goals. She earned a driver’s license, took out a loan for a car, got a job, and started working towards an associate’s degree in early childhood education. Fabiola currently works as a bilingual preschool teacher for Early Head Start and will soon earn her bachelor’s degree in early childhood education, focused on special education, from Western Oregon University. DACA has given Fabiola the opportunity to make her dream of becoming a special needs teacher a reality. Because leadership in Congress refuses to act on DACA, however, she will lose her status, and Fabiola will not be allowed to maintain her teaching license. Every day, 122 DACA recipients lose their ability to have a job and go to school. We don’t have until March 15. It is happening now. 
Stop delaying. It is time to get it done. Let’s include a clean Dream Act in next week’s funding package. 
HONORING THE 2018 NORTH CAROLINA MARCH FOR LIFE (Mr. ROUZER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend and encourage the thousands of great, noble North Carolinians participating in the 2018 March for Life this weekend. We know from God’s Word, the Holy Scriptures, that life begins at conception. Unfortunately, since the Supreme Court decision of Roe v. Wade, more than 59 million innocent lives have been terminated through abortion. That is almost six times the population of North Carolina. Without question, it is our moral obligation to fight for and protect the lives of those who cannot speak for themselves, the talented and able lives of those who are no different than our own. Today and every day, I am honored to stand with those who so bravely fight to protect the most vulnerable among us. With each passing day, we shall continue to advance this very noble cause. 
FOR DREAMERS, THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, every day, 122 DREAMers lose their protections from deportation. Every day, 122 young people in this country still consider whether they should go to class, whether they should show up for work, whether they should put on the uniform of our military in service to our country, because every day that Congress delays and does nothing means more bright, hardworking young people who know no other home than the United States are being asked to leave or risk being arrested. Our inaction is creating an impending crisis for workforces, families, and communities around the country. We must pass a permanent, bipartisan solution to enable DREAMers to continue to live, work, and contribute to this country and that provides a pathway to full citizenship. We have seen time and time again that the overwhelming majority of Americans on both sides of the aisle in both parties agree that we should protect our DREAMers. Yesterday, 115 business leaders, including CEOs from Amazon, Facebook, General Motors, and Verizon, asked Congress to act immediately. DREAMers don’t have the luxury of time. Hundreds of thousands of deserving young people are counting on us. We can’t wait until March to make sure that our DREAMers are protected and included and welcomed. Mr. Speaker, the time to act is now. f 
DO YOUR JOB (Mr. GALLAGHER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I don’t often make these 1minute speeches, but I am concerned about where we might we headed next week in terms of the budget. Last week, the House took another weeklong break instead of staying here in order to talk about fulfilling our fundamental duty of passing a budget and funding the government. Yet here we are once again, for the third time in 2 months, just 10 days away from government funding running out, and once again we are scheduled to leave town. Mr. Speaker, Congress is paid to do a job, and so we shouldn’t leave town until that job is done. This constant cycle of careening from one budgetary deadline to the next is irresponsible and embarrassing. Only in Washington is doing a basic task like keeping the lights on considered such a difficult achievement. It doesn’t have to be this way. The solution is simple: No more breaks. Lock us on the House floor until we reach a budget deal that does right by our constituents, does right by the military, does right by all these different programs. Passing a budget is not just our job, it is the law, and no one, including this body, is above the law. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to end the partisan stall tactics. Let’s work together and do the job we were elected to do. 
THE BLANK CHECK OF SECTION 702 (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, since 2001, the civil liberties of the American people have been trampled on under the blank check of section 702, a program that exists to allow our government to surveil foreigners on foreign soil, but which also allows our government to collect, retain, and search communications of everyday Americans without a warrant and with blatant disregard for our Fourth Amendment constitutional rights. Now, we have a very important responsibility here in Congress to strike a balance between national security and keeping the American people safe while also protecting our constitutionally protected freedoms. I urge my colleagues to vote for our bipartisan USA Rights amendment today, which maintains necessary authorities to keep the American people safe while also, simultaneously, protecting our civil liberties. Now, unfortunately, opponents of this USA Rights amendment are pushing fear tactics and misinformation. Don’t fall for it. Let us make this critical choice. Vote to keep our country safe. Vote to uphold our constitutional rights that so many have fought and died to protect. f 
RECOGNIZING TANIA PRATNICKI YOUNG (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent a large number of dedicated autoworkers who live and work in Michigan’s Seventh Congressional District. Today I want to recognize one of the truly exceptional ones, Tania Pratnicki Young, the plant manager at Dundee Engine Plant in Dundee, Michigan. Tania has been the plant manager since 2013 and recently reached a remarkable milestone: 40 years with the company. The Fiat Chrysler plant employs about 700 people and produces engines for various Dodge and Jeep products, including the Jeep Cherokee. Under Tania’s leadership, Dundee was the first U.S. facility to be awarded silver status for implementing the principles of World Class Manufacturing. It shows her commitment to excellence in productivity, quality, and safety. Tania calls Dundee ‘‘the family plant.’’ I have had the privilege of touring the factory floor with her and was impressed by the efficiency of the plant and the friendliness of her team. Thanks to people like Tania Pratnicki Young, the auto industry is thriving in Michigan. Tania, congratulations on your 40 year anniversary. 
HONORING DANA MARSHALL BERNSTEIN (Ms. ROSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am here today not only to mourn the loss of a family friend and lifelong Las Vegas resident, but to let Congress know what an amazing young woman she was. Dana MarshallBernstein died in December at the age of 28 following a lifelong battle with Crohn’s disease. She spent most of her life in and out of the hospital, but even while she was undergoing countless surgeries, she never let her disease define her. She never stopped feeling optimistic about her future. She believed in kindness, and she used her experience to comfort others who were also affected by Crohn’s disease. She shined in more ways than one, and I know she will continue to shine in the memory of each and every life she touched, and her memory will be a blessing to all those who knew and loved her. 
I encourage all Members here today to carry with them the courage and determination that Dana brought into this world: to always think and live life with positivity and never ever stop believing in doing good by others. 
NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS DAY (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as a judge in Texas, I saw it all: rape, robbery, murder, kidnapping, child abuse. Now, in Congress, we are learning about the horrors of human trafficking, sex slavery. Many groundbreaking laws have been passed to increase resources for victims and crack down on traffickers and buyers, but like all criminal enterprises, traffickers constantly stay ahead of the law. Fortunately for victims, there is an army of individuals, NGOs, religious and other advocacy groups fighting on behalf of victims. The people serving in these organizations are New Friends New Life, RAIN, Polaris, Rights4Girls, Shared Hope, Coalition Against Trafficking, and Demand Abolition, just to name a few. They have all dedicated their lives to serve and save victims of trafficking on the front lines. On this National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, I want to thank all those warriors—the victims’ posse, as I call them—battling the injustice of human slavery. We will not give up this fight until this scourge has been eradicated. And that is just the way it is. 
b0915 COMMEMORATING KOREAN AMERICAN DAY (Mr. GOMEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commemorate Korean American Day, which celebrates the arrival of the first 102 Korean immigrants to the United States on January 13, 1903. The first Korean immigrants came in pursuit of the American Dream and initially served as farmworkers, wage laborers, and section hands. Through resilience, effort, and sacrifice, they established the foundation for their children and future generations. Today, nearly 2 million Korean Americans have honored their ancestors’ legacy and achieved the American Dream by transforming all aspects of American life: from Roy Choi, who joined Latino and Korean culture to create new cuisines that have won the stomachs of all Americans; to the first Korean American elected to Congress, Jay Kim; and to the countless Korean Americans who run successful small businesses. I am honored to represent the largest Korean population in the country and to reintroduce this resolution on the 115th anniversary of the first Korean immigrant arrivals. I call upon my colleagues to join me in acknowledging the Korean Americans who helped strengthen and shape our country. f 
RAPID DNA ACT OF 2017 Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 682, I call up the bill (S. 139) to implement the use of Rapid DNA instruments to inform decisions about pretrial release or detention and their conditions, to solve and prevent violent crimes and other crimes, to exonerate the innocent, to prevent DNA analysis backlogs, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 682, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–53, shall be considered as adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: 
S. 139 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or a repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or other provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.). TITLE I—ENHANCEMENTS TO FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION AND SAFEGUARDS, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND OVERSIGHT 
If any provision of this Act, any amendment made by this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of the Act, of any such amendments, and of the application of such provisions to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected thereby. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for 1 hour, with 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After 1 hour of debate on the bill, as amended, it shall be in order to consider the further amendment printed in House Report 115–504, if offered by the Member designated in the report, which shall be considered read, shall be separately debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for a division of the question. The gentleman from Utah (Mr. STEWART) and the gentleman from California (Mr. SCHIFF ) each will control 20 minutes. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MARINO ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah (Mr. STEWART ). 
Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill, S. 139. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 139. On January 19, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 will expire. This vital legislation includes section 702, which permits the government to target foreign citizens located overseas to obtain foreign intelligence information. Section 702 is one of the most, if not the most, critical national security tool used by our intelligence community to obtain intelligence on foreign terrorists located overseas. Now, some claim section 702 vacuums bulk information without due regard to the intended target. This assertion is simply false. Section 702 is a targeted program, with roughly 106,000 foreign targets worldwide. Given that the worldwide population is about 7.5 billion, this program can hardly be described as bulk collection. Section 702 targets spies, terrorists, weapons proliferators, and other foreign adversaries who threaten the United States, and locating them is crucial to protecting our troops and our homeland. As an example, Hajji Iman, who was the secondincommand of ISIS, was located via section 702 and later removed from the battlefield. While the vast majority of examples remain classified, this is just one instance that demonstrates the necessity of this authority. Subject to multiple layers of oversight by all three branches of government, section 702 is one of the government’s most rigorously overseen foreign intelligence collection authorities. To date, while compliance incidents occur and are dealt with appropriately, there has never been a known, intentional abuse of this authority. Nevertheless, the program should be subject to regular adjustments, as necessary, to ensure the effectiveness of privacy protections. Therefore, after careful consideration of the best way to strengthen privacy protections without hindering the program’s effectiveness, the committee supports S. 139, a bipartisan bill that includes provisions and addresses concerns raised by the House Judiciary Committee and the Senate. The bill’s reforms include: Requiring specific section 702 query procedures, separate from existing minimization procedures, which must be reviewed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court every year; Limiting the instances in which the government can use section 702 information to prosecute U.S. people; Requiring the inspector general of the Department of Justice to conduct a review of the FBI’s interpretation and implementation of the FBI’s section 702 query procedures; Temporarily codifying the end of the NSA’s section 702 upstream ‘‘abouts’’ collection until the government develops new procedures and briefs the congressional Intelligence and Judiciary Committees; And, finally, improving transparency by mandating the publication of section 702 minimization procedures and requiring additional reporting to Congress on how the intelligence community is using other FISA authorities. Mr. Speaker, during discussions over the past several months, both the House and the Senate have made several concessions to achieve this compromised language in order to reauthorize this critical national security authority. Accordingly, S. 139 now includes a probable causebased order requirement for the FBI to access the content of a section 702 communication during FBI criminal investigations on Americans, unrelated to national security. This order requirement does not reflect the committee’s belief or intent that law enforcement access to lawfully acquired information constitutes a separate search under the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment, as interpreted by numerous Federal courts, does not require the FBI to obtain a separate order from the FISC to review lawfully acquired 702 information. Though not required by the Constitution, this compromise is meant to provide additional protections for U.S. 
person information that is incidentally collected under section 702. Along with the restrictions on the use of section 702 information in criminal prosecutions, this should provide further assurances to the American public that this vital national security tool is used strictly to discover and mitigate foreign threats to the United States, and the handling and use of any incidental U.S. person information is carefully controlled and monitored. Mr. Speaker, America faces an array of international threats more complicated than anything we have endured in the past. b0930 Speaking for the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, I cannot emphasize enough that now is not the time to draw back on key national security authorities. I am dismayed by the amount of disinformation being propagated by those who oppose section 702 for purely ideological reasons. When Congress must reauthorize this program again in 2023, we hope those who debate these issues, both inside and outside this Chamber, do so with intellectual honesty and integrity. The USA RIGHTS Act, which has been offered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute, is an attempt to kill this compromise. In its place, the amendment would begin resurrecting the informationsharing walls between national security and law enforcement that the 9/11 Commission identified as a major factor in the failure to identify and thwart the 9/11 plot. If individuals in this body cannot learn from history, they are doomed to repeat it. There is no support for this bill in the majority of the committees of jurisdiction whose members understand that this amendment would render section 702 inoperable. Therefore, in order to keep the U.S. interests and troops abroad safe from harm, we must ensure that the intelligence community has the tools it needs to provide intelligence to our soldiers abroad. Section 702 is critical in that regard, and S. 139 provides the intelligence community with the authorities needed to protect the homeland while implementing key privacy enhancements. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of S. 139, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as HPSCI’s ranking member and a former member of the Judiciary Committee, I have long advocated for reforms to surveillance authorities to balance the imperatives of national security and counterterrorism with the privacy rights and civil liberties of Americans. Today, the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act seeks to reauthorize the program while making changes to protect privacy interests. Nonetheless, and I indicated before we took up the bill, in light of the significant concerns that have been raised by members of our Caucus, and in light of the irresponsible and inherently contradictory messages coming out of the White House today, I would recommend that we withdraw consideration of the bill today to give us more time to address the privacy questions that have been raised as well as to get a clear statement from the administration about their position on the bill. Mr. Speaker, I do this reluctantly. Section 702, I think, is among the most important of all of our surveillance programs. Nonetheless, I think that the issues that have been raised will need more time to be resolved, and I think we need to get a clear statement from the administration of whether they are in support of this legislation or they are not. This morning, as my colleagues are aware, the President issued a statement via Twitter suggesting that this authority was used illegally by the Obama administration to surveil him. Of course, that is blatantly untrue but, nonetheless, casts an additional cloud over the debate today. In light of these circumstances, I think the better course would be for us to defer consideration, give us more time to address the issues that have been raised by the privacy community within my own Caucus, but also within the administration about its inaccurate, conflicting, and confusing statements on the morning of debate. Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly urge my colleagues to postpone consideration so that we can take up this bill when it is more ripe for consideration. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY ). Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Utah. While I am not unappreciative of my colleague from California’s comments, I do think we are at a place where we do need to move forward. If we succumb to the emotions of what is going on around us and don’t stick to the facts, stick to what we are trying to get done, I think that we do that to our detriment. So I have great respect for my colleague and his opinions, but I personally believe that plays into the emotions of what is going on rather than the facts of what is going on. If we can, I believe we should just continue to push forward. First, let me say that the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act is a bipartisan compromise bill that preserves the operational flexibility of section 702 while instituting key reforms to further protect U.S. personal privacy. One of the major issues discussed over the past year has been NSA’s ‘‘abouts communication’’ collection—a tortured title, but, nevertheless, we will stick with the phrase, ‘‘abouts communication.’’ So ‘‘abouts communication’’ collection takes place in NSA’s upstream collection and, due to how the internet communications work, allows NSA to collect the communications that may reference a section 702 target’s email address. Despite what some of my colleagues may push in their propaganda, ‘‘abouts’’ collection does not collect names of targets, just selectors. Some of my colleagues also suggest that ‘‘abouts communication’’ is inherently in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. While the FISA court has raised concerns about ‘‘abouts communication’’ collections in the past, NSA has been able to conduct such collections with the approval of the FISA court. This type of collection is at issue today because it was the subject to a compliance incident in 2016. NSA selfreported a problem to the FISA court and decided to cease ‘‘abouts communication’’ collection until a fix could be implemented and demonstrated to the court. I would like to note that that type of selfreporting of compliance incidents is expected of the intelligence community elements and proves that oversight mechanisms are in place and that they work. Other potential legislation, including the amendments to today’s base bill, would seek to permanently end ‘‘abouts communication’’ collection. This is a shortsighted and a dangerous proposition that will limit the NSA’s ability to identify threat networks in the future. Rather than ending ‘‘abouts communication’’ collection, S. 139 strikes, I believe, that right balance. If NSA wants to reestablish ‘‘abouts communication’’ collection, NSA would first need to go back to court, convince the judge that it has satisfied the court’s concerns. After achieving judicial approval that NSA has made the necessary technical changes, NSA would then brief congressional Intelligence and Judiciary Committees on how they plan to reinstitute this type of collection. Barring congressional action, NSA can then start ‘‘abouts communication’’ collection, 30 days after those briefings. Some of our opponents to S. 139 claim that 30 days is not enough. To the folks that claim that 30 days is not enough, there is nothing stopping Congress from acting after that 30day window. However, NSA should not be penalized and America’s security should not be compromised and prevented from obtaining valuable foreign intelligence information that the FISA court has deemed consistent with the Fourth Amendment just because Congress can’t pass legislation in 30 days. This compromise of the bill that is on the floor today, I believe, is the right answer, and I hope my colleagues will support S. 139. Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, once again, I would reluctantly urge that we withdraw consideration of the bill for today. I certainly have been working as hard, I 
think, as anyone to try to agree to a compromise that would move forward this very important surveillance authority but would strike the right balance between our security interests and our privacy interests, but I do think we need more time to work on this bill. And I think that it was only underscored this morning with the contradictory statements coming out of the administration. An issue of this magnitude and this seriousness really deserves serious and sober consideration. I think we need more time to discuss this with our Members, and I would urge my colleagues not to bring this to a vote today to give us more time to work on it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, some of my colleagues believe that Congress should go above and beyond what is required by the Fourth Amendment and institute additional safeguards on how the government handles any potential U.S. personal information that may be incidentally collected under section 702. While the varying committees may have different ideas as to how to strike the right balance between additional privacy measures and national security, the art of the compromise brings us to the current junction. Under S. 139, if the bill conducts a U.S.person query into its database during a criminal investigation not related to national security and conducts a section 702 communication, the FBI must obtain an order from the FISA court prior to assessing the content of the communication. The committee does not believe that such an order is necessary under the Fourth Amendment, but it is adding more protections, as a matter of policy, in order to address unfounded concerns by opponents of section 702 that the authority is being used to investigate U.S. people. Proponents of the USA RIGHTS Act amendment will say that S. 139 does not go far enough in its current form and that they have crafted a great compromise that allows the intelligence community to do its job. Unfortunately, they are selling a poison pill that is extraordinarily harmful to our national security. Per the office of the Director of National Intelligence, under the USA RIGHTS Act amendment, the FBI would not be able to look at lawfully collected data related to suspicious activities similar to that of the 9/11 hijackers. This is unethical to the 9/11 Commission Report, and anyone who thinks about voting for the USA RIGHTS Act amendment should pick up a copy and skim it prior to voting. Unlike the USA RIGHTS Act amendment, S. 139 is able to balance national security and privacy while adhering to the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission reporting. I echo the White House statement last night strongly opposing the USA RIGHTS Act amendment, and I urge all of my colleagues in the House to support S. 139. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1
1⁄2minutes to make a statement. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 139, the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act. As a former United States attorney, I know firsthand the enormous value that programs like section 702 provide in protecting our country. The worst threats have been thwarted due to our intelligence and law enforcement communities having tools like section 702. Chairman GOODLATTE , along with the members of the Judiciary Committee, worked diligently on legislation to implement meaningful reforms while ensuring the law enforcement and Intelligence Committee still had the necessary tools available. This bill includes many other reforms from the USA Liberty Act, enhances section 702 protections, and maintains law enforcement abilities. Mr. Speaker, I would ask all Members to join me in voting ‘‘yes’’ on this legislation to implement real reforms, while ensuring that we still provide the tools necessary to keep American citizens safe. In conclusion, as a U.S. attorney, I have used this section. My office used this section. We followed the law to the letter. There were no complaints, and I want the American people to realize something: we in law enforcement, law enforcement throughout the U.S., we have to be right and on spot every second of every day. It only takes a terrorist a moment to get lucky and set off a bomb killing Americans. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b0945 Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong opposition to the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017, which reauthorizes section 702 of FISA for 6 years without enacting adequate protections for our privacy. Supporters of this measure want to convince us a new, incredibly narrow warrant provision actually constitutes reform. It does not. Our right to privacy does not begin when the Department of Justice has a fully formed criminal case against us, nor does it begin when prosecutors enter our emails and text messages into evidence against us in court. The Constitution guarantees far more than this. Our right to privacy protects us when the government first makes its decision to search our private communications for information it might find useful. S. 139 falls well short of this basic guarantee. We, therefore, cannot—we must not—support this bill. Make no mistake: S. 139 is not a compromise. The Judiciary Committee, the technology companies, civil society, and other critical stakeholders were shut out of this conversation long ago. S. 139 does not include a meaningful warrant requirement. The rule in this bill does not apply to most searches of the section 702 database. It does not apply to a query for any information that ‘‘could mitigate a threat,’’ an exception that threatens to swallow the entire rule. As a result, S. 139 allows the FBI unfettered access to this information for purely domestic nonterrorism cases without a warrant. What does that mean in the year of Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump? It means that absolutely nothing stops the Department of Justice from trolling the database for evidence that you use marijuana or failed to pay your taxes or may be in the country unlawfully or possess a firearm that you should not have. None of these cases have anything to do with the core purposes of section 702, and all of them should require a warrant based on individualized suspicion and probable cause. I agree with Chairman GOODLATTE  that section 702 should be reauthorized. I understand its importance to the intelligence agencies. But none of us should support this bill which pretends at reform while codifying some of the worst practices of the intelligence community in domestic crimes. When we came to Congress, each of us took an oath to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States. I ask that each of my colleagues honor that oath today and that we work together to defeat this bill and to bring the right set of reforms to the floor without delay. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am a former prosecutor and a former judge. I despise terrorists. We ought to go after them and get them. Section 702 was written to go after terrorists, but it is being used to go after Americans. Normally, when I was a judge, I would sign a warrant. Before the government could go into your house, they had to have a warrant to go into the house and to seize something based on probable cause. Under FISA, as it is used against Americans—forget the terrorists—as it is used against Americans, government has already seized your house of communications, all of it. They look around, and sometimes—sometimes— they go back to a secret judge in a secret court and get a secret warrant by a FISA judge, and they come in and seize something and prosecute based on something irrelevant about terrorism. That is why this bill violates the Fourth Amendment. Get a warrant before you go into the house of communications and effects 
and papers of Americans or stay out of that house. These documents have been seized. Communications have been seized by government. They are kept forever. Keep government out. Without a warrant, you stay out, because government, as we learned from the British, cannot be trusted. Get a warrant. Stay out of the house of communications. Vote against this bill. Let’s redraft it and protect Americans. And that is just the way it is. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOFGREN ). Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, like the ranking member, I oppose this bill. It does not meet the standards that we should have for adhering to the Constitution. Now, this is a confusing debate in some ways because what is it we are talking about? We are all against terrorism, and we have authorized the collection of data of terrorists communicating with each other. In section 702, if they communicate with somebody here, we can collect that, too. But because of the architecture of the internet, we are collecting vast amounts—we can’t go into the numbers here in open session—vast amounts of data. It is not metadata; it is content. It is the content of your phone calls, content of your emails, and the content of your text messages and video messages. Under section 702, you can search that for Americans for crimes that have nothing to do with terrorism. We should change that. As Judge POEhas said, you need a warrant to go after Americans for a nonterrorism crime. There is a reason why a leftright coalition—the NAACP and FreedomWorks, Color of Change and Gun Owners of America—has joined together on the same point of view. We should stand up for the privacy rights of Americans and reject this bill and have a warrant requirement for searching for the information of Americans that is in this vast database. Just one further point: The very weak predicate criminal investigation trigger for a warrant which is at the end of the investigation would apply only to the FBI. So if you are the ATF, you would never have to get a warrant. If you were the DEA, you would never have to get a warrant. This bill is inadequate, and it ought to be defeated. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to control the time of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MARINO ). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as you all know, the Judiciary Committee worked diligently for a year on legislation that does two things: one, protect Americans’ civil liberties by requiring a court order to access section 702 data during domestic criminal investigations; and, two, reauthorize the 702 program, which is our Nation’s most indispensable national security tool. We achieved that by passing the USA Liberty Act in the House Judiciary Committee last year by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, which is no easy task; however, we were able to responsibly balance civil liberties with national security. The bill we will vote on today was drafted in the spirit of the USA Liberty Act. It is not perfect and the process getting here was not ideal, but the bill requires, for the first time, a warrant to access section 702collected communications on U.S. persons in criminal investigations. Moreover, in routine criminal cases, when the FBI accesses U.S. person communications that were incidentally collected without first obtaining a warrant, the FBI will not be permitted to use those communications in a criminal prosecution. This will prevent a national security tool from advancing runofthemill criminal prosecutions. These are meaningful reforms. The bill that was presented to us before Christmas with its optional warrant construct was not real reform. The bill we are debating today, however, contains meaningful reforms. I would have preferred to include additional reforms, but I cannot stress to my colleagues enough that our choice cannot be between a perfect reform bill and expiration of this program. The 702 program is far too important for that. With this bill, we can have meaningful reform and reauthorization. In its current form, this bill will pass the Senate. I also want to caution everyone that we cannot go too far in seeking to alter this program. There is an amendment that will be offered sponsored by Mr. AMASH and Ms. L OFGREN that would prevent the FBI from ever querying its 702 database using a U.S. person term. Imagine the FBI getting a tip from a flight instructor whose student acts suspiciously by expressing great interest in learning how to take off and fly a plane but has no interest in learning how to land the plane. This could be innocent behavior, but we want law enforcement to at least be able to perform a search to see if they already have, in their possession, any communications between the student and a foreign actor involved in organizing terrorist plots. The Judiciary Committeepassed bill would have allowed the search and allowed law enforcement to view the metadata without a warrant while requiring a warrant to view the content of the communications. The AmashLofgren amendment, which was rejected in the Judiciary Committee, goes too far and would prevent such a search from even being done. It would, thus, kill this critical program by preventing the FBI from even looking at its own databases without a warrant, rendering it ineffective in preventing terrorist attacks and stifling its ability to gather necessary intelligence. It must not be adopted. I will vote to support this bill. I will oppose the AmashLofgren amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me. Vote for reform and reauthorization. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, many of us are opposing this bill and supporting the amendment because it is very different from the Judiciary Committee bill that we reported, which was a good bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ). Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. Supporters of this bill have called it reform. This is not reform. It is a massive expansion of the government’s ability to pry into the private lives of innocent people. If you need proof, just look at the bill’s section 702 which is supposed to authorize spying on foreign adversaries, but it has emboldened some in law enforcement to collect and read private communications of American citizens without a warrant. Instead of curbing these practices, S. 139 would codify and expand some of the most abusive of surveillance practices used in recent years, including ‘‘abouts’’ collection and backdoor searches. There is no more important responsibility that we have than keeping the American people safe, but we have to do it in a way that is consistent with our values and our Constitution. This bill undermines our values of privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures. I urge my colleagues to oppose S. 139 and to support the AmashLofgren amendment, which allows intelligence agencies to do their jobs without undermining our values as Americans. We can do both things, Mr. Speaker: keep the American people safe and honor and respect our Constitution, which protects the privacy of all American citizens. Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of this bill and support of the amendment. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ), who is a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership in ensuring that a number of important reforms to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act were included in this legislation. I rise in support of this modified version of S. 139. While this does not go as far to reform FISA section 702 as the USA Liberty Act, which passed out of the Judiciary Committee in November with my support, the reforms that are included help to provide a more appropriate balance between protecting our 
civil liberties and providing the intelligence community an important national security tool for another 6 years before its expiration this Friday. FISA section 702 is a critical tool used by the intelligence community to protect American citizens from foreign threats and has been successfully used numerous times to prevent terrorist plots. Since we last reauthorized FISA section 702, much has changed not only in who our foreign threats are, but also in the methods that they use against us. The bottom line is we need to protect the safety of the American people. We need to make sure constitutional protections are in place, and this is the proper balance. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me repeat the refrain of those of us who are members of the Judiciary Committee who have gone through this process since 9/11, and that is that we support the integrity and the importance of section 702 as a national security tool, and we want it reauthorized, but we want it right. Our job and our task is also to be the protectors of the Fourth Amendment, and that is the protection of the American people against unreasonable search and seizure. No matter how much my friends on the other side of the aisle argue, we know that the FBI can have the tools that it needs; but, in the instance of this underlying bill, similar to the bill that was passed in 2007 by the Bush administration, on which the Judiciary Committee came back and amended it and made it a bill that provides the tools that were needed by those who are on the front lines in the United States military and the FBI, ultimately, it was changed to deny those rights. In this instance, the warrant that my friends are talking about is revised only to fully predicated cases. It does not apply to the searching of documents that will have information about Americans. I ask my colleagues to postpone this. Let us work together on behalf of the American people. Who are we if we cannot uphold the Constitution? It is not protected in this bill. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I rise in strong opposition to S. 139, the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017.’’ S. 139 reauthorizes Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is scheduled to expire on January 19, 2018. Section 702 authorizes the Justice Department and NSA to collect nonU.S. persons’ communications that are sent while abroad. The collection programs have to be approved each year by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court). The FISA Court was set up by the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA; Public Law 95–511) to oversee intelligence gathering activities and ensure compliance with the U.S. Constitution. Under FISA, the term ‘‘U.S. person’’ covers citizens, green card holders, associations with a ‘‘substantial number of members’’ who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents, and U.S.incorporated companies. Title VII also allows intelligence agencies to conduct surveillance on a specific U.S. person reasonably believed to be outside of the country, with the approval of the FISA Court. The NSA’s use of section 702 authority to collect Americans’ information from their communications with foreign surveillance targets was revealed by former government contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. Snowden also revealed that the NSA obtains communications from U.S.based providers such as Google, Verizon, and Facebook. Although Section 702 is a critical national security tool set to expire on January 19, 2018, events of the recent past strongly suggest that Section 702 should not be reauthorized without necessary and significant reforms that are not included in the legislation before us. So as the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I oppose the bill for several compelling reasons: 1. S. 139 fails to address the core concerns of Members of Congress and the American public—the government’s use of Section 702 information against United States citizens investigations that have nothing to do with national security. 2. The warrant ‘‘requirement’’ contained in the bill is riddled with loopholes and applies only to fully predicated, official FBI investigations, not to the hundreds of thousands searches the FBI runs every day to run down a lead or check out a tip. 3. S. 139 exacerbates existing problems with Section 702 by codifying socalled ‘‘about collection,’’ a type of surveillance that was shut down after it twice failed to meet Fourth Amendment scrutiny. 4. S. 139 is universally opposed by technology companies, privacy, and civil liberties groups across the political spectrum from the ACLU to FreedomWorks. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us comes from the Intelligence Committee, where it was passed on a strict partyline vote. This stands in stark contrast to H.R. 3989, the USA Liberty Act the bipartisan bill reported by the Judiciary Committee after multiple hearings, an open markup process, and a bipartisan vote of approval. The USA Liberty Act enjoys much broader support, contains meaningful reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and is far superior to the bill before us. Inexplicably, the House Republican leadership did choose the best option, which was to bring the USA Liberty Act to the floor for debate and vote; instead, they chose the worst option, which is S. 139, the bill before us. For this reason, I urge all members to join me in supporting the AmashLofgren Amendment, the best option remaining before us. The AmashLofgren strike the text of S. 139 in its entirety and substitutes in its place the text of the ‘‘Uniting and Strengthening America by Reforming and Improving the Government’s HighTech Surveillance Act’’ (‘‘USA RIGHTS Act’’). In contrast to S. 139, the ‘‘USA RIGHTS Act’’ enacts necessary and meaningful reforms to Section 702, which are necessary in light of the past abuses of surveillance authorities, contemporary noncompliance with this authority, and the danger posed by potential future abuses. First, the USA RIGHTS Act creates a search warrant requirement that closes the so called ‘‘backdoor search loophole’’ through which the government searches, without first obtaining a courtissued warrant based on probable cause, for information about U.S. persons or persons inside the U.S. The ‘‘USA RIGHTS Act’’ provides an exception for emergencies, but requires a court warrant afterward. Second, the ‘‘USA RIGHTS Act’’ prohibits the collection of domestic communications and permanently ends ‘‘about’’ collection, an illegal practice the National Security Agency recently stopped because of persistent and significant compliance violations. This is important because while ‘‘reverse targeting’’ is prohibited under the Jackson Lee Amendment incorporated in the USA Freedom Act enacted on June 2, 2016 (Pub. L. 114– 23), this prohibition was often skirted by collecting information from communications that merely mention an intelligence target. Under the ‘‘USA RIGHTS Act’’, collections would be limited to communications that are ‘‘to’’ or ‘‘from’’ a target, and the intentional collection of wholly domestic communications is prohibited. Third, the ‘‘USA RIGHTS Act’’ requires the government give notice when it uses information obtained or derived from Section 702 surveillance in proceedings against U.S. persons or people on U.S. soil which will enable a defendant to assert his or her constitutional rights and help ensure that foreign intelligence surveillance is not being misused. Fourth, under the ‘‘USA RIGHTS Act’’, Section 702 authority sunsets in 4 years, which will obligate the Congress to exercise regular oversight and provide the opportunity to make necessary reforms before reauthorization. Mr. Speaker, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was enacted to protect the liberty and security of Americans, not to diminish their constitutional rights. All Americans want to find the common ground where commonsense rules and regulations relating to fighting terrorism at home and abroad can exist while still protecting the cherished privacy and civil liberties which Americans hold close to our collective hearts. That is why Section 702 should not be reauthorized with reforms to prevent the government from using information against its political opponents or members of religious, ethnic, or other groups. One way to do that without interfering with the national security objectives of 702 surveillance is simply to reject S. 139 and support the USA RIGHTS Act by voting for the AmashLofgren Amendment. Mr. Speaker, I noted in an oped published way back in October 2007, that as Alexis de Tocqueville, the most astute student of American democracy, observed nearly two centuries ago, the reason democracies invariably prevail in any military conflict is because democracy is the governmental form that best rewards and encourages those traits that are indispensable to success: initiative, innovation, courage, and a love of justice. And the best way to keep America safe and strong is to remain true to the valued embedded in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 
S. 139 does not strike the proper balance between our cherished liberties and smart security. We can do better; we should reject S. 139 and support the AmashLofgren Amendment. b1000 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER ), a member of the Judiciary Committee and the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee. Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, and I will speak later on some of the other parts. I want to talk about the ‘‘abouts’’ stuff that is reauthorized in this bill after the NSA itself stopped doing it earlier last year. What ‘‘abouts’’ collection means is that, for example, if you have two jihadists that are in Pakistan and are communicating with each other that they didn’t like something that Mr. NADLER said against jihadists, the FBI can pick up the name ‘‘Nadler’’ and go into all of his emails, all of his texts, all of the information that they have on him and be able to see what Mr. NADLER had said about jihadists and much, much more. That is why this bill opens the door to something that the NSA has closed itself. We will hear from people who support ‘‘abouts’’ collection that Congress has got a chance to review it. They give us 30 days to do it. We can’t get anything done in 30 days. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the bill. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr. TEDLIEU). Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, having served on Active Duty in the United States military, when it comes to foreign terrorists on foreign soil, we need to track them down and kill them. That is why I support the FISA Act, as applied to foreigners. But, unfortunately, this act has now been used to apply to Americans. If you are going to do that, you need to follow the Constitution, you need to put in a warrant requirement. Unfortunately, the Nunes FISA bill does not do that. That is why I support the USA RIGHTS amendment. At the end of the day, this is not about terrorists or terrorism. It is about: Can you use warrantless information against Americans in a domestic court? That is what this issue is about. Don’t let the intelligence agencies scare you. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the Nunes bill and ‘‘yes’’ on the USA RIGHTS amendment. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. CARTER of Georgia). The gentleman from Virginia has 2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from New York has 2
1⁄4 minutes remaining. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ). Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, our times are this: the President is abusing his authority. He is stacking the courts with incompetent and ideological judges. He is usurping the powers of the Justice Department and the FBI. He is turning them into political animals. At the same time as he is doing this, we are considering this legislation, which leaves the door wide open for the abuse of Fourth Amendment rights of Americans. This is a bad bill for a particularly bad time. I am asking my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ We can do better than this. I am asking my colleagues to vote in favor of the USA RIGHTS amendment. If that amendment is not passed, then I ask Members to vote ‘‘no’’ on this overall bill. We can’t afford to let this happen. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, in response to those who advocate for the AmashLofgren amendment, this amendment will very, very seriously damage our national security. Section 702 is a program for which there is no evidence of abuse and is used to gather information about nonUnited States citizens outside the United States. In a targeted fashion, they have to go to the court and get approval for the selectors to gather information on a quarterly basis. They gather information incidental to that. Sometimes there is information about United States citizens. But guess what. The information does not come with little labels attached saying: this is a United States citizen communicating here, or the communication involves someone in the United States. Therefore, it is absolutely vitally important that we not impair the most important electronic intelligencegathering mechanism that the United States has to keep us safe. Oppose the Amash amendment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ). Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill that does nothing to stop the unconstitutional collection of Americans’ international communications without first obtaining a warrant, and it codifies the practice of indiscriminately sweeping up massive amounts of domestic communications. What makes us different from those who would harm us is our commitment to our constitutional values: that we are innocent until proven guilty and that our government must obtain a warrant and show probable cause that there is a legitimate reason to listen in on our conversations. This bill will further expose people to warrantless prosecutions or detention and deportation in cases that have absolutely no connection whatsoever to national security. I hope we reject this bill, unless we approve the AmashLofgren amendment. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I have only one speaker remaining to close, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the distinguished Democratic leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the House of Representatives for coming together on the floor of the House and in our various caucuses and conferences to discuss the important challenge that we all face: the balance that we have to protect the American people. That is the oath we take: to protect and defend. As we defend the Constitution, we defend the privacy and the civil liberties of the American people. It is difficult. Over 20 years ago, I was on the Intelligence Committee for the purpose of protecting civil liberties and privacy, and also to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, two really important overarching issues. So I come to the floor today as one who has worked on this issue for a very long time. I thank our men and women in the intelligence community for the work they do. We are so proud of what they do. In those days, almost 25 years ago, when I was first on the committee, it was about force protection and trying to have enough intelligence to avoid conflict, but if we were to engage, we would have the intelligence to protect our forces. It was about force protection. In the nineties, it became more about fighting terrorism and other overarching issues as well. We live in a dangerous world and force protection on the ground, in theater, is still an essential part of what the intelligence community does. Again, I thank the men and women in the intelligence community for their patriotism and their courage. The issue that relates to fighting terrorism is one that sometimes has a frightening manifestation on our own soil. But as we protect and defend the American people and the Constitution and their rights, we have to have that balance. It was Benjamin Franklin who said: If we don’t fight for security and freedom, we won’t have either. I want to particularly thank our ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. He has made us all proud in going across the country to honor our Constitution, talking about undermining our election system, talking about protecting the American people in ways that is consistent with our Constitution. I thank Mr. SCHIFF and I support him today in his support of the bill that came from his committee. 
Is it perfect? I have never voted for a perfect bill in this House. I also thank Mr. NADLER , a genius on all of these issues that relate to our Constitution. I also thank the members of the Judiciary Committee. We have very few members on the Intelligence Committee who are deputized by the Speaker and by the leaders of each party to go to the Intelligence Committee to deal with issues that relate to the balance between security and privacy. With all the respect in the world for the magnificent members of the Judiciary Committee, all of whom I respect, it is not right to say there is nothing in this bill that protects the privacy of the American people. In fact, when I was supporting the Judiciary Committee bill, outside groups were complaining. They wanted the Zoe Lofgren amendment. They didn’t want that bill. They were complaining about it. Now, today, they are saying that is what they want. Studying the issue, I think one of the differences along the way is when it is appropriate in terms of a warrant. That is why I am so pleased that we will be offering a motion to recommit that addresses just that concern, which is what I am hearing about from folks. The amendment, the motion to recommit, addresses concerns of people on both sides of the aisle, certainly in our Democratic Caucus, that seeks to secure the highest possible protections for American civil liberties. At the same time, it ensures that the intelligence community and law enforcement can continue to keep Americans safe. This amendment would go a step further from the modified bill that is on the floor under consideration to ensure law enforcement secures a warrant before accessing Americans’ information. Let me repeat that. The amendment will go a step further than the modified bill under consideration to ensure law enforcement secures a warrant before accessing Americans’ information. Under this amendment, a court order would be required to access Americans’ data in connection with any nonnational security criminal investigation by the FBI. This amendment removes predicate— that is the operational word—standards and it expands the universe of investigations that would require a warrant. A vote for this amendment—and I hope it would be bipartisan, especially from those who are objecting to the bill on the floor—is a vote for privacy protections and for civil liberties. We would have preferred to have this in the original bill that is coming to the floor. We couldn’t get that in committee. Hopefully, we can get it on the floor. Voting against the motion to recommit means fewer protections, less oversight, and more risk that Americans’ rights will be violated. In the course of this, I mentioned this issue about the warrant and arrest. I talked about the Judiciary Committee’s bill. At the offset of all of this, we all opposed the first Intelligence Committee’s bill. We supported the Judiciary Committee’s bipartisan bill being criticized by some outside groups for supporting it, rather than the Lofgren amendment. But changes were made in the Intelligence Committee’s bill to this effect. We asked the Speaker to take out the masking provisions, which have no place in this bill. The chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Mr. NUNES , foolishly put that in this bill. It made it a complete nonstarter. I thank the Speaker for removing it. By the way, somebody should tell the President because he thinks it is still in the bill. With that being said, I personally directed the unmasking process be fixed. It isn’t fixed in the bill, Mr. President. That would be a second tweet of the day, confusing matters even worse, unfortunately. The administration, although they probably would like an extension of the status quo, understands we have to do more than that. The other provision that was in the bill was an expansion of agents of foreign governments. Agents of foreign governments opened up more people who would be subjected to surveillance. We said: That doesn’t fly. That has to be closed. The Speaker did that. Then, on the ‘‘abouts’’ language, I think most people who understand that—it is a complicated issue—understand that it is really not a factor in this discussion. People don’t want it mentioned, but the fact is that it had to be addressed. It is not being used and it is unconstitutional. Until it can be proven to be constitutional, it can’t be used. When it is used, they would have to go to the FISA court to get permission, and then come to Congress for ratification of that. So there are many protections there. It is hard, I know. I had a hard time when I was Speaker and we passed a bill to address the gross violations of Vice President Cheney doing the Bush Cheney surveillance. It was appalling, in my view. I considered it unconstitutional, others did not. But, nonetheless, we put in many, many protections where there were none, and then renewed and improved them when we renewed the bill subsequently in its reauthorization. b1015 This isn’t about the other side of the aisle that is saying you don’t care about privacy if you support this bill. It isn’t about that. It is about where you strike the balance when you weigh the equities. We have to come down in favor of honoring our Constitution and our civil liberties, but we cannot do that completely at the expense. And I believe that the Members and Mr. NADLER understand that full well, and I commend him for his deep understanding of the vital national security issues and the invaluable work that his committee has done to strike a balance between security and privacy and has made a difference. But the choice we have today is to pass something that is—defeat this bill. Okay. You have done that, if you want to do that. Pass an amendment that won’t go anyplace, you can do that, and we will be left with extension of the status quo of the current law. As one who has participated in writing it those years ago, I understand its merit. I also understand the changes in technology, of tactics of terrorists who are out there, and that we have to improve the bill. I don’t consider it a reform bill. It is not that vast. It is some improvements in how we can collect, protect, again, keep the American people safe as well as protect their civil liberties. Just a couple other things about it. Since this legislation was designed to address concerns related to the use of information collected under FISA section 702, an important foreign intelligence collection authority—we have to keep that emphasis on ‘‘an important foreign intelligence authority.’’ So, my colleagues, to that end, this modifies that it requires a court order based on probable cause for FBI criminal investigators to view Americans’ communication in the section 702 database and mandates an inspector general study of 702 data. So let’s keep the vigilance on, even as we go forward. It contains refined language related to ‘‘abouts’’ collection. It requires the executive branch to secure explicit approval from the FISA court for collection. It further objects ‘‘abouts’’ collections to—subjects a 30day congressional review process. I know Mr. SENSENBRENNER said nobody can do anything in 30 days, but I think we can. The bill strengthens the privacy and civil liberties oversight board. That was something I was instrumental in establishing when I was on the Intelligence Committee. I know it is important, but I also know that it has to be strengthened and it has to be respected as a watchdog. So, I mean, the list goes on requiring public reporting on the use of 702 data, just saying to the intelligence community: Don’t try to minimize any violations that may have occurred; we want the facts; we want the truth. And that is why I am so glad it has expanded whistleblower protections and briefings to the Oversight Committee, which we have required. Unlike the original House Intelligence bill, which I oppose, this bill does not include language that would have likely expanded the universe of FISA targets who are now, as I mentioned before, agents of foreign policy powers. It excludes the language on unmasking; somebody tell the President. It gives me great pride in our Caucus, if you could have heard the beautiful debate between Mr. NADLER and Mr. 
SCHIFF on this subject. We are not that far apart. I think that the motion to recommit addresses most of the concerns we have been getting from the outside groups, and communities have dedicated their—whose organized purpose is to protect the civil liberties of the American people. But, again, with great respect for everyone’s opinions and whatever they have put forth, again, saluting our men and women in the intelligence community for the work that they do, we want to be sure we strengthen their hand in terms of protecting the national security of our country, which is our first responsibility, keep the American people safe, and, as we do so, to honor our oath of office to the Constitution, to honor the principles of the Constitution. Our Founders knew full well the challenge between security and civil liberties. They lived in a world when they were under attack. The War of 1812 came very soon after the establishment of our country, so this was not a foreign idea to them, and they bequeathed to us the responsibility to protect, defend, protect our liberties. And, again, respectful of this debate on this issue, I myself will be voting to support my ranking member on the Intelligence Committee, Mr. SCHIFF , our ranking member, and Members will follow their conscience on this. I just wanted you to know, from my experience in all of this and with weighing the equities involved, that that is the path that I will take. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING), a member of the Judiciary Committee, to close the debate on this side. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and I also thank the minority leader for her remarks in support of 702. I rise in support of the 702 reauthorization. It is critical to our national security. You would see the color drain out of the faces of all of our security personnel, the entire national security community, if we lost the ability and went dark on 702. We have got to follow through in this Congress. We have got to provide the flexibility for them to use the tools that we have available to us, and we have set up procedures that will approve of this annually under the FISA courts. We have got a probable cause requirement for any criminal investigation. That protects U.S. persons. And we don’t need to be protecting anything but U.S. persons when it comes to this. The gentlewoman spoke of civil liberties, and I stand in defense of those civil liberties as well and in defense of the national security. We have got an IG report that is written into this bill. But I would remind the people who are concerned about this focus on these civil liberties that Google and Facebook and Verizon and AT&T, they hold more data than the U.S. Government has. That is where the real information is, and if they are concerned about that, they should raise that issue. Meanwhile, I am going to oppose the Amash amendment and support the reauthorization of 702. Our people in this America, U.S. persons, deserve that protection for national security reasons. I urge its adoption. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired. AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . AMASH  
Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 1, strike line 1 and all that follows and insert the following: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 682, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. AMASH ) and a Member opposed each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, my amendment replaces the underlying bill with the USA RIGHTS Act. Like the base bill, under the USA RIGHTS Act, the government can still use section 702 for its purpose of surveilling foreigners overseas; and the government can continue to store, share, and access that data to investigate national security threats. The key difference is, in USA RIGHTS, it has to do with the collection and use of innocent Americans’ data, not foreign intelligence. This means the amendment cannot harm section 702 programs if, as the government says, they are designed solely for foreign intelligence rather than domestic surveillance on Americans. We all want the intelligence community to be able to do its job, and I have offered the USA RIGHTS amendment to give them the tools to collect foreign intelligence while also protecting the Fourth Amendment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 10 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This amendment, plain and simple, would disable 702, our most important national security tool. If passed, any chance of reform through the underlying bill is dead on arrival in the United States Senate. We cannot risk 702 collection ending. This Chamber cannot be complicit in allowing terrorists to fly under the radar if this amendment kills 702, and I sincerely urge you to oppose the Amash amendment and not lose the opportunity to successfully balance national security and civil liberties, which is what the underlying bill does. We definitely need to have a move toward more protection of our Fourth Amendment rights, and a warrant requirement in domestic criminal cases and a requirement that if you are doing a national security investigation and you find that the information is useful in a criminal case and it is precluded from court are two major improvements to our 702 law that protect Americans’ civil liberties. This bill must be passed. It is absolutely essential for our protection. It surveys people outside of the United States who are not United States citizens. The fact that it collects incidental information about U.S. citizens should not be a prohibition on this effort. But if you apply this amendment, you are not going to be able to have our national intelligence officials looking at this information carefully, and they are going to have to, in many instances, get a warrant when they need to act because they think it is a national security concern. A warrant either will be unattainable or it will be in a circumstance where it is too late, and, in both instances, we cannot allow that. This bill provides balance. That bill goes too far. The amendment goes too far. I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOFGREN ). Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, it is important that we pass this amendment. The government conducts 702 searches and broadly defines foreign intelligence investigations that may have no nexus to national security, and we are using this database for just criminal investigations that are domestic. When you say ‘‘incidental collection,’’ it sounds like it is not much. Well, the fact is it is a huge amount of data in its content. What this amendment says is: if you are going to search for the information of an American who has been collected in that database and it is not terrorism but domestic criminal investigation, get a warrant. Get a warrant. That is what the Fourth Amendment requires. Now, I took exception to the comment that 702 would go dark. We know that this existing FISA order goes through April, so the 702 program is not going dark. We have time to do this right. We have time to make sure that the Fourth Amendment is adhered to in the reauthorization of 702. Put the ‘‘foreign’’ back in the FISA bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. STEWART ). Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to emphasize how dismayed I am by the amount of disinformation being propagated by opponents of section 702. I have heard some things over the last couple of days, and I just wonder, how in the world can someone believe that. Let me tell you why this amendment must be opposed. Under the USA RIGHTS Act, the intelligence community would not be able to query the name of the suspected terrorist supporter in the United States to see if he is in contact with terrorist recruiters. It would not be able to query the name of a person in the United States who has been suspiciously approaching U.S. Government employees with security clearances to determine if that person is part of a foreign espionage network. We would not be able to query the name of a registered owner of a suspicious vehicle parked in front of the Washington Monument to see if that person is in contact with terrorist operatives overseas. We would not be able to query the name of a person in the aftermath of a mass casualty attack on the United States to see if he has terrorist connections, or as a follow on, if potential followon attacks are imminent. We would not be able to query the name of a foreign national who travels to the United States to take flight training but doesn’t care about learning how to land. Individuals in this room who want to end section 702 know that they have an opportunity to do with their vote, but they would be putting troops and American lives at risk. And if that is okay with you, then go ahead and vote for the USA RIGHTS Act amendment, but I promise you, you will regret it when, some day, in this dangerous world we live in, we have to answer to our constituents for our votes here today. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, my amendment protects the rights of Americans consistent with the Constitution. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). b1030 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we are not talking about terrorism. We are talking about the protection of Americans and their information. All of the rhetoric and the fear tactics that this will destroy our ability to go after terrorists is wrong. The USA RIGHTS Act is important to protect Americans. The other side talks about protecting Americans. Let’s protect their Fourth Amendment rights. We can protect them against terrorists if we amend this legislation with the USA RIGHTS Act and protect their rights under the Fourth Amendment. Every American’s data is being seized by the Justice Department, the CIA, and the NSA. We have asked them how many times that has been queried. They will not tell us because the information is massive. All we are saying under the USA RIGHTS Act is that, if you want to go into that information on Americans, get a warrant from a judge, not a query. You can’t go search it. Get a warrant under the Fourth Amendment or stay out of that information and still go after terrorists under 702 and under FISA. 
We need to have this amendment to make the bill better to protect Americans overseas and at home. And that is just the way it is. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. SCHIFF ). Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I respect and share the sponsor’s commitment to privacy and civil liberties, but this amendment would go vastly beyond the legislation advanced by either the Intelligence Committee or the Judiciary Committee. It would prevent the intelligence community from querying lawfully collected 702 information, even in situations directly related to counterterrorism and national security. It would make section 702 a far less effective tool at a significant cost to the national security of the United States. The amendment would require a probable cause warrant or its equivalent before the government can query lawfully collected 702 data in an effort to find communications concerning someone who may be a U.S. person or a foreign person located in the United States even when such person is communicating with foreign terrorists or intelligence targets. Probable cause will be lacking in many, if not most, intelligence and counterterrorism contexts. In such situations, the USA RIGHTS Act would prevent the government from detecting and disrupting plots against Americans or identifying and preventing foreign espionage on our soil. It would also require publication of information related to 702 certifications that would disclose the sources and methods of intelligence gathering, imperilling our ability to obtain foreign intelligence information. That, to me, poses an intolerably high risk. Instead, the underlying bill strikes a far better compromise. In the underlying bill, a warrant would be required in most nonnational security and nonterrorism cases when there is an open investigation. In the absence of such a warrant, the bill provides that evidence that would be obtained would be excluded from use in court. That seems, to me, a very sensible balance: requiring a warrant in most nonnational security and nonterrorism cases and providing, in the absence of such a warrant in an open investigation, that information or evidence would be barred from use in court. That addresses the gravamen of the concern over this program that it could be used for fishing expeditions against ordinary Americans. This amendment, on the other hand, would largely cripple the program. Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I urge opposition to the amendment and support for the underlying bill. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ). Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, any responsible effort to authorize section 702 must pass three tests: It must include a meaningful warrant requirement; It must end the ‘‘abouts’’ collection until Congress says otherwise; and It must not restrict the government’s ability to collect intelligence on valid targets operating outside of the United States. The underlying bill does not include a meaningful warrant requirement, and it does not end ‘‘abouts’’ collection. The AmashLofgren amendment, on the other hand, passes all three tests: It includes a warrant agreement that comports with the Fourth Amendment; It puts an end to ‘‘abouts’’ collection; and It leaves the core functionality of section 702 perfectly intact. It would be harder to use this authority to spy on United States citizens, but the government’s ability to gather intelligence on suspected terrorists and others overseas will not be affected. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and make a meaningful change to section 702. Mr. Speaker, I thank the many sponsors of this amendment for their leadership in this important fight. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RUPPERSBERGER ). Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment being offered and in support of the underlying bill and the increased oversight in transparency it provides to the body of the intelligence community and the American public that it protects. I thank the ranking member and also Chairman GOODLATTE for allowing me to have this time. Mr. Speaker, I want Americans at home to know what this program is not. It is not a dragnet surveillance program; it is not a program that could ever be used to target Americans; and it is not an unchecked intelligence tool. In fact, it may be one of the most heavily overseen programs that we have. This bill strengthens that accountability. As former ranking member of the Intelligence Committee and Representative of the district that is home to NSA, I have taken many of my colleagues in this Chamber on trips to NSA so that they can see firsthand how these programs work to protect Americans and also to protect our freedom and civil liberties. This is not a debate on constitutionality. The Federal courts have affirmed that this program’s current authorization and operation are legal and consistent with the Fourth Amendment. This body has voted several times with bipartisan majorities to reauthorize it. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr. TEDLIEU). Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, let me make this issue really simple for the American people: spying on foreigners without following the Constitution, that is okay; spying on Americans without following the Constitution, that is not okay. The Fourth Amendment does not have an asterisk that says our intelligence agencies don’t have to follow it. The Constitution applies to all of government. That is why I support the USA RIGHTS Act. Support this amendment. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ). Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this amendment—I think it is in the wrong direction—and to support the underlying bill. The bill, I think, strikes a balance. Americans cherish and strongly want us to protect their privacy. We all agree on that, and I think this bill threads the needle. The underlying bill protects our Fourth Amendment through the FISA process through this improved effort. We know we live in a dangerous world. Terrorism is a constant threat that we all clearly understand. When we take our oath of office, we swear to protect and defend our Nation from all enemies, foreign and domestic. I believe this underlying bill does that with increased transparency. Clearly, it is not perfect. We never vote on any perfect legislation. But this is an improved piece of legislation. The amendment is an overreach in the wrong direction. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER ). Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speaker, when James Madison wrote the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, one of his overriding concerns was to prevent any branch of the three in government from becoming too powerful. That is why he put the checks and balances in the Constitution, so that the other branches could oversee and make sure that a branch that was trying to push the edge of the envelope would not be able to succeed in that. The warrant amendment that has been talked about quite a bit today during the debate really is not effective. It is nothing at all. It ends up putting James Madison’s legacy into the trash bin of history, and it does not deserve to go there. Yesterday, The Washington Post reported that FBI officials told aides of Mr. NADLER that, under the proposed bill—meaning the underlying bill— they anticipate rarely, if ever, needing permission from the FISC to review query results. So this warrant requirement of the supporters of the bill and the opponents of the amendment basically doesn’t mean anything at all because the FBI told Mr. NADLER ’s aides that that was the case. Now, we have a debate here today on whether to put the F back into the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The F means ‘‘foreign.’’ That is why 
the amendment should be adopted, or, if it fails, then the underlying bill should be defeated. This is a time to stand up for the oath of office that every one of us took a year ago to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. The only way we can do that today is by supporting the Amash amendment and defeating the underlying bill. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time each side has remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 3
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP ). Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amendment and support the underlying bill. I served a year in Iraq, and every day we got foreign intelligence information to us. Why? Because it helped us prepare. It helped us plan. It helped us deter. It helped us save American lives—not only the lives of our troops in theater, but the lives of people at home. I am all in favor of protecting American citizens and their privacy; do not get me wrong. I hope that, in the information we collected in theater, there were no Americans involved. But guess what this amendment will do. It will virtually guarantee that terrorists are going to make sure that they have an American, complicit or otherwise, involved with every one of their communications, email, or through a phone call. Why? Because that protects them. That will protect terrorists. That is what this amendment would do. That is why I oppose the amendment and stand in favor of the underlying bill. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, my amendment protects the rights of Americans consistent with the Constitution. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON ). Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Amash amendment and in strong opposition to the underlying bill. As a former Army ranger, I know the importance of section 702 in defeating the enemies of our country. The foreign enemies of our country are not subject to the protections of our Constitution; American citizens, however, are. The supporters of the underlying bill would have you believe that the only way to secure America is by ignoring the Fourth Amendment, and I strongly disagree. It is the data of American citizens that is at subject here. The Fourth Amendment does not change when communications shift from the Postal Service, also in the hands of the government, to a database. It should be protected by the Fourth Amendment. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge support of the Amash amendment. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, Congress has sometimes made the difficult job of the intelligence community harder by not providing adequate controls and oversight. We have created a vast Department of Homeland Security, a vast security sprawling intelligence network that results in the collection of data that my friend, Mr. POE, talked about. Yes, warrants can sometimes be inconvenient, but we have judged it as a small price to pay to protect Americans from government overreach. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this amendment. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ). Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, servicemembers in the combat zone depend on 702 to keep them safe. 702 must continue to gather information on foreign terrorists to keep us and servicemembers safe. However, Americans in uniform serve to preserve an ideal that the Constitution protects the rights of Americans. The bill, unamended, enshrines in law the abuse of the Fourth Amendment rights of American citizens, and it just cannot happen. This is not only about criminal prosecution but about political persecution. Mr. Speaker, that abuse and the associated persecution is unfolding on the front pages and on TV right before us today. Don’t lower the bar any further. Vote to preserve the rights of American citizens. Vote for this amendment. b1045 Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 1
3⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GARRETT ). Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the patron of this amendment for yielding. Mr. Speaker, we have covered many things in the past year, to include tax policy, healthcare, helping eviscerate ISIS, but I would argue this is the most important moment in the time that I have been in this building. Not only is the Fourth Amendment at stake, so, too, I would argue, are due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth. We must stand strong for individual liberty and privacy. That is who we are as a nation. If we do not put the ‘‘F’’ back in FISA, it becomes ISA, and all eyes are on you. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this body cannot be afraid of the Constitution. It has been our guiding moral force for this Nation for all of our beginnings and our nows. This amendment is truly an amendment that will protect and provide for the FBI to do its work and to protect our men and women around the world who are wearing the uniform unselfishly. But let me be very clear: all this amendment does, frankly, is provide a roadmap for the FBI to utilize when it is surveying and it is using the private data of Americans. All the amendment does is ask the FBI and the Attorney General, where there is probable cause, that such communication provide evidence of a crime; and, as well, if there is a foreign power or foreign agent, to be able to utilize a warrant, and that is the protection of the Fourth Amendment. Uphold the Constitution. Vote for the AmashLofgren amendment and let’s move forward on this legislation. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to whether the gentleman has additional speakers? Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Michigan has 1 minute remaining. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, let me pose a hypothetical about the Amash amendment. In the criminal world, if an FBI agent is told through a tip that someone has just purchased unusual amounts of fertilizer that could be used to make a bomb, the Amash amendment would prevent that FBI agent from looking at the FBI’s databases to determine if the suspicious individual’s email address or other identifier—not the content of the email, just the email address or identifier—is located in the 702 database. What would the American people say if we hamper our law enforcement from protecting them? What would people of this country say if we had another Murrah Building blow up and the FBI couldn’t look at even an email address? Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time each side has remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 1 minute remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 1 minute remaining. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill and the USA RIGHTS amendment present a stark choice. 
The underlying bill allows the government to warrantlessly collect an astounding volume of Americans’ communications, makes no material reforms to the collection and use of that data against Americans, and explicitly allows even more surveillance than the law currently permits. In contrast, USA RIGHTS allows the government to conduct broad foreign surveillance and share intelligence throughout the relevant agencies, but it also adds protections to prevent the erosion of Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights. These are two very different options, Mr. Speaker, but for all of us who care about civil liberties, who believe the United States can protect itself without retiring the Fourth Amendment, and who believe Congress has an independent obligation to protect the Constitution, the choice is clear: support the USA RIGHTS amendment. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. RYAN), the Speaker of the House. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, first, I just want to say to all my colleagues that I respect the passionate views that are on display here. I think this has been a very passionate and interesting debate. What I would like to do is try and bring a little clarity to this debate. I want to thank the minority leader for coming up and speaking against the Amash amendment and in favor of the underlying bipartisan amendment. We, on a bipartisan basis, have been working with the Senate and the White House to get this right, to add even more privacy protections to the law, even more than the status quo, to add the warrant requirement that this underlying bill has. Let me try and clear up some of the confusion. There has been wide reporting and discussion here in the House about parts of the FISA statute that affect citizens. It is a big law. It is a big statute with lots of pieces. Title I of the FISA law is what you see in the news that applies to U.S. citizens. That is not what we are talking about here. This is Title VII, section 702. This is about foreign terrorists on foreign soil. That is what this is about. So let’s clear up some of the confusion here. Let me give you two examples of what this program has done to keep our people safe, two declassified examples. Number one, this program, in March of 2016, gave us the intelligence we needed to go after and kill ISIS’ finance minister, because of the intelligence collected under this program, a foreign terrorist on foreign soil, the number two man at ISIS who was in line to become the next leader. This program helped us get the information to stop him. I came here before 9/11. I remember hearing upon hearing in the 9/11 Commission about the old firewall. We were seeing what was going on overseas, terrorists like Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan were doing all these things, and we couldn’t pass that information on to our authorities here in America. We had this firewall that prevented us from connecting the dots. That was the big phrase we used back then in the early 2000s. If we pass the Amash amendment, we bring that firewall right back up. You pass the Amash amendment and defeat this underlying bill, we go back to those days where we are flying blind on protecting our country from terrorism. Let me give Members an example. This program has not only stopped many attacks, but let me tell you about one: a plot in 2009 to blow up New York’s subway system. This was used to understand what people were planning overseas and what they were trying to do here in America so that we could connect the dots and stop that particular terrorist attack. That is why this has to be renewed. That is why, among many other reasons, section 702, a program designed to go after foreign terrorists on foreign soil, is so essential. If this Amash amendment passes, it kills the program. If this underlying bill fails, there is one of two things that will happen. The status quo will be continued, meaning no additional privacy protections, no warrant requirement—status quo. That doesn’t do anything to advance the concerns that have been voiced on the floor or, even worse, we go dark; 702 goes down. We don’t know what the terrorists are up to. We can’t send that information to our authorities to prevent terrorist attacks. The consequences are really high. One of the most important things we are placed in charge to do is to make decisions, not based on TV, not based on internet, but based on facts, based on reality, and we are supposed to make those decisions to keep our country safe. This strikes the balance that we must have between honoring and protecting privacy rights of U.S. citizens, honoring civil liberties, and making sure that we have the tools we need in this day and age of 21st century terrorism to keep our people safe. That is what this does. That is why I ask everyone, on a bipartisan basis, to vote ‘‘no’’ on the Amash amendment and to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the underlying bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. AMASH ). The question is on the amendment by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. AMASH ). The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on adoption of the amendment will be followed by 5 minute votes on: A motion to commit, if ordered; Passage of the bill, if ordered; and The motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 4578. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 183, nays 233, not voting 16, as follows: [Roll No. 14] YEAS—183

b1116 Ms. SINEMA, Messrs. THOMPSON of California, FRELINGHUYSEN, MARCHANT, and Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ changed their vote from ‘‘yea’’ to ‘‘nay.’’ Mr. WALZ, Ms. CLARKE of New York, Messrs. O’ROURKE, WELCH, and MEEKS changed their vote from ‘‘nay’’ to ‘‘yea.’’ So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be read a third time, and was read the third time. MOTION TO COMMIT  
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to commit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. HIMES. I am opposed to the bill in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to commit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Himes moves to commit S. 139 to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: Page 4, line 3, strike ‘‘predicated’’. Page 4, line 4, strike ‘‘opened’’. Page 6, line 21, insert ‘‘or’’ after the semicolon. Page 7, line 5, strike ‘‘; or’’ and all that follows through line 12 and insert a period. Page 42, strike lines 15 through 19 (and redesignate the subsequent paragraphs accordingly). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Connecticut is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, members of the Intelligence Committee, on which few of us have an opportunity to serve, lead very odd lives. Every single day, we descend in the bowels of this Capitol, four floors down. We surrender our iPhones, we surrender our BlackBerrys, and we go into windowless rooms where, on a daily basis, we hear about some of the most grotesque threats to American safety and interests that you can imagine: threats to American lives, threats to American interests, and threats to our very way of life. We see, every day, how essential 702 authorities are. The intelligence that we gather under this authority is critical to our safety, our security, and our lives. It saves lives. This program cannot be interrupted, and, if it is, God forbid, we will have much to answer for. Even if this motion fails, the base bill, to those of you with substantial civil liberties concerns—and I count myself amongst you—the base bill makes important and meaningful civil liberties improvements over the status quo. I deeply appreciate the efforts of many in this Chamber that oppose this bill, the efforts that they have made. Each and every one of us swears an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, and no one should ever be criticized for working hard to make sure that that process is served; not Mr. NADLER , not Ms. L OFGREN , not Mr. AMASH , not Mr. P OE. Mr. Speaker, I have spent much of the last several days trying to improve this bill with respect to civil liberties. I presented amendments to the Rules Committee which were, sadly, not made in order. But the fact is that these protections exist. There are strict processes and procedures in place at the FBI as to how exactly U.S.person information can be queried and used. On top of that, the entire 702 program is reviewed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the PCLOB, and is subject to meaningful congressional oversight by each and every one of us. To authorize this program each year, a Federal judge must find it has met all statutory requirements and is consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Mr. Speaker, three district courts and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals have deemed this program constitutional. But, Mr. Speaker, no bill is perfect, and so the motion I offer would encompass all FBI matters—not just predicated investigations, but all FBI matters not related to national security— and require court orders founded on probable cause before the FBI could access U.S.person information under 702. Mr. Speaker, this is a critical national security asset. It is as important as our best operator, as our best technology, as our most powerful weapons, and I appreciate the efforts that have been made to secure our civil liberties. This motion to commit pushes this bill slightly in that direction, building on the meaningful improvements to the status quo, and I urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I will just be really brief today. I want to thank all of my colleagues. There are a lot of strong opinions on both sides of the aisle on this issue, and we have taken many steps at the House Intelligence Committee to take Members out to the agencies that are doing this work. We have offered time for Members to come down to the SCIF to read all of the information because, at the end of the day, we all take the American people’s constitutional liberties seriously. I think the robust debate that has occurred in this House over the last year on this issue, through many markups, through many committees, and then even today on the floor here in the House of Representatives, has been a tough fight because it is a tough issue. But in closing, this really is a compromise. We worked with the House Judiciary Committee for many months. I can’t thank Chairman GOODLATTE  enough for all of his very difficult work in trying to find a compromise. At the same time, the House Intelligence Committee, we have worked to come to a compromise with the Democrats on the other side of the aisle. So with all of that said, this is one of those days, if we get this bill passed, I think we can walk out of here proud that we all stood our ground for stances that we really believe in, but, at the end of the day, the House is going to work its will in a bipartisan manner. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), my friend and the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring about the schedule for the week to come. (Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow. In addition, the House will consider two measures from the Financial Services Committee: first, H.R. 2954, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act, sponsored by Representative TOM EMMER . This bill would provide targeted regulatory relief to our local community banks and credit unions; second, H.R. 3326, the World Bank Accountability Act, sponsored by Representative ANDYBARR. Mr. Speaker, next week, our Nation’s Capital will also welcome tens of thousands of Americans to Washington for the annual March for Life. In conjunction, the House will vote on H.R. 4712, the BornAlive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, sponsored by Representative MARSHA BLACKBURN . This bill simply states that doctors must provide medical care to any child born alive after a failed abortion. Finally, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are expected, including legislation to address government funding and other expiring priorities. I will be sure to inform all Members as soon as any additional items are added to our schedule. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information. I presume the CR, or continuing resolution, is anticipated, as the gentleman referenced. Is that accurate? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. As the gentleman knows, we have been in discussions to try to get a budget agreement. We have hopes we can get that done this time. If we are able to get that budget agreement, we will need some time for the appropriators to do their work, so we would have a continuing resolution. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that. Will that continuing resolution be clean, from the gentleman’s standpoint—that is to say, it will not include other items on it—or does the gentleman have any anticipation that other items might be included on that? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am hoping he is asking this question so he will return and start voting for this. But in the past, that has been what we have done, the last two, and I don’t see any change in what we are moving forward with now. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman and I had the opportunity to be at the White House with the President earlier this week. He and I are attempting to work on seeing if we can make sure that we protect our DREAMers. I think we saw a unanimous opinion in the White House among the 17 Republicans and 7 or 8 Democrats who were there that it ought to be done. I was pleased the President said that it ought to be done, and ought to be done quickly. I appreciate the gentleman’s efforts on that score. Obviously, we also need to do something with the Children’s Health Insurance Program. We have talked about that before. We need to do something with respect to the supplemental for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, as well as Florida and Texas. Obviously, we passed a supplemental here, and it did not pass in the Senate. Hopefully, the Senate will address that, and we can address it coming back across the aisle. In addition, we are going to have to, as the gentleman referred to, establish caps. We still, at this late hour, late date, do not have a figure for the Appropriations Committee to use in terms of what they will mark their bills to. You mentioned it, but does the gentleman have any update or degree of confidence that will be done within the next few days? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, the negotiations have been progressing further, as they have for the last month or so. I believe, as we both know, in the need of this funding for our military. I believe that the military should not be held hostage for any other issue. So I believe we can get to a solution here, and I am hopeful that those who have been negotiating can find common ground in the next day or two so that we can move forward. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, nobody has any intention, of course, of holding the military hostage. Secretary Mattis and his predecessors have all believed that a CR is damaging to the military’s ability to move forward and plan. I would suggest to my friend, the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, that it is equally damaging to the nondefense side of the budget. Administrators and secretaries cannot plan for what resources they will have a month out, 2 months out, or until September 30 and the end of the fiscal year. Reaching agreement is important on both sides of the budget. In addition, I would respectfully hope that we can pursue the policy and agreement that we made and on which Speaker RYANwas a principal on your side of the aisle and Senator MURRAY  was the principal on our side of the aisle and reached agreement on the parity of increase—not parity of expenditures, because we spend more on defense, but parity of increase. Mr. Speaker, I would hope we could pursue that. It would accelerate agreement on how we are going forward. I know the gentleman is going to be working on both of those efforts. I appreciate that and look forward to working with him. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10 a.m. tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from North Carolina? There was no objection. 
ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, JANUARY 12, 2018, TO TUESDAY, JANUARY 16, 2018 Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns tomorrow, Friday, January 12, 2018, it adjourn to meet on Tuesday next, when it shall convene at noon for morninghour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from North Carolina? There was no objection. 
DIRECTING THE SECRETARY OF THE SENATE TO MAKE A CORRECTION IN THE ENROLLMENT OF THE BILL S. 139 Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent resolution and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: 
H. C ON. RES. 98 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That in the enrollment of the bill S. 139, the Secretary of the Senate shall make the following correction: Amend the long title so as to read: ‘‘An Act to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to improve foreign intelligence collection and the safeguards, accountability, and oversight of acquisitions of foreign intelligence, to extend title VII of such Act, and for other purposes.’’. The concurrent resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
RESIGNATION AS CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following resignation as chairman of the Committee on the Budget: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, January 10, 2018. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMR. SPEAKER , It has been my great honor to serve as Chairman of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. I am proud that we completed our work when the House passed the most conservative budget in two decades, with $203 billion in cuts to mandatory spending and paved the way for tax reform. While I do wish the Senate had adopted our resolution, I believe that we have begun to change the culture of excessive spending in Washington. With the FY18 Budget and tax reform complete, I am now respectfully stepping down as Chair of the House Budget Committee, effective Thursday, January 11, 2018. Last summer, I announced that I would run for Governor of Tennessee in 2018. I had previously forestalled that decision to devote myself to the duties of serving as Budget Committee Chair in 2017—an opportunity that I did not foresee, but one that I felt honored and committed to undertake to ensure this House Republican majority passed a bold, conservative and balanced budget. I would like to thank President Trump and Vice President Pence for their support of our House budget and leading the way on tax reform. It has been an honor working closely with both of them this year. I am grateful to the people of the Sixth District for giving me the privilege of fighting on their behalf in Congress. Sincerely, DIANE BLACK , Member of Congress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the resignation is accepted. There was no objection. 
RESIGNATION AS MEMBER OF COMMITTEE ON ETHICS The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following resignation as a member of the Committee on Ethics: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, January 10, 2018. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN: Thank you for the privilege of serving for the past 5 years on the House Ethics Committee. While few, if any, members seek this assignment, the collegiality of the members coupled with the 
seriousness of the jurisdiction have made it an experience I will treasure. When I became Chairperson of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform I knew I would not be able to keep all other committee assignments to include Judiciary, Intelligence and Ethics. Four committee assignments, including a Chairmanship, is a challenging workload. I was happy to finish out the calendar year and conclude some matters then pending before the Committee. Accordingly, I tender my resignation from the House Ethics Committee pending your designation of a replacement. Thank you again for this opportunity and thank you to my colleagues on the Committee for their hard work and friendship. Sincerely, TREYGOWDY , Member of Congress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the resignation is accepted. There was no objection. 
ELECTING MEMBERS TO CERTAIN STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the House Republican Conference, I offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 685 Resolved, That the following named Members be, and are hereby, elected to the following standing committees of the House of Representatives: COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES : Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia. COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET : Mr. Womack, Chair. COMMITTEE ON ETHICS : Mrs. Mimi Walters of California. Resolved, That the following named Member be, and is hereby, ranked as follows on the following standing committee of the House of Representatives: COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET : Mrs. Black, after Mr. Womack. 
Ms. FOXX (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be considered as read. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from North Carolina? There was no objection. The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SPOTLIGHT ON RURAL AMERICA (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank President Trump for shining a big, beautiful spotlight on rural America. My district has 17 rural counties, and for far too long, our hardworking farmers in these communities have felt forgotten by past Presidents. But thanks to the Trump administration’s new policies and renewed support, that is no longer the case. This week, President Trump highlighted rural America when he addressed the American Farm Bureau Federation’s national convention, making him the first President to do so since George H.W. Bush in 1992. In his address, President Trump pledged to work with Congress to pass the farm bill on time, critical legislation that supports our farmers. I am a proud member of the House Agriculture Committee, and we have already been hard at work crafting this year’s legislation. The President also signed an executive order expanding access to rural broadband. In today’s world, broadband is not a luxury; it is critical and a necessity. My constituents need accessible, affordable rural broadband in their homes, schools, and businesses. It is critical for economic development. President Trump is implementing concrete solutions to make a difference for my constituents in rural Georgia as well as Americans across this Nation. Together with the Trump administration and my colleagues in Congress, I will continue my hard work to ensure that rural America is never forgotten. f 
b1200 SUPPORTING TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS DESIGNATION FOR EL SALVADORANS (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak against this administration’s choice to end the temporary protective status designation for El Salvador. Because of this disheartening and potentially dangerous decision, 200,000 people who have been legally living and working in the United States will be forced to go back to a country they don’t know, a country that still hasn’t fully recovered from the devastating earthquakes but is in the grips of widespread gang violence with one of the world’s highest murder rates. These families have chosen to stay here. In my district, the TPS recipients from El Salvador have become ingrained and embedded in our communities. They are longtime loyal employees; they have started families; they have started businesses; and yes, they pay taxes. If they are removed, our country would lose over $100 billion over the next decade, billions would be lost from Social Security and Medicare contributions, and employers would experience hundreds of millions in turnover costs. Congress should right this wrong and pass the American Promise Act so that these TPS recipients can continue to work and live in our communities and contribute to our country. 
VENEZUELA’S GROWING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to a growing humanitarian crisis, one that is often forgotten in news around the world. Venezuela is suffering through a collapse of its economy and Venezuela’s children are starving to death. According to a recent media report, the number of cases of severe malnutrition has nearly tripled in the years since the economic collapse, and doctors believe that 2018 will be even worse. The Venezuelan Government has taken pains to hide the impact that the collapse has had on its population and the role their own repressive policies have played, but the recent statistics tell the true story. From 2012 to 2015, the mortality rate of infants under 4 weeks old has increased tenfold. In 2016, 11,446 children under the age of 1 year old have died, an increase of 30 percent. Families and children now dig through trash in the hopes of finding food. This is a crisis we cannot turn a blind eye to. We must work together to address it. I urge my colleagues to keep this at the forefront of our consideration. f 
SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ABOUT TAX BY HOLDING TAX TEACH (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise to set the record straight about the TrumpRepublican tax scam recently signed into law. Middleincome and working people in Georgia would see a minimal gain, and eventually they will see their taxes go up, while the richest 1 percent of Georgians will get an annual tax cut of $83,000. In fact, Georgia millionaires could receive a cut of more than $130,000 a year. In fact, the TrumpRepublican tax cut bestows 83 percent of the $5.5 trillion tax cut to the wealthiest 1 percent who don’t even need it, while blowing a $1.5 trillion hole in the Nation’s debt. That is obscene, and that is why I am holding a tax teach this Saturday in my district to communicate with my constituents about what this tax scam means to them, what it means for their families, and what it means for jobs and economic growth. 
EXPRESSING DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY (Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment in the Democratic Party and to express my concern for the safety and security of the American people. 
It has become evident that Democratic leaders and the rest of their party are more interested in protecting illegal immigrants and foreign nationals than protecting American citizens and passing a budget to avoid a government shutdown. As a government, we are charged with supporting the wellbeing and safety of all American citizens. In order to fulfill this responsibility, we must secure our borders, end chain migration, and mandate EVerify as a national practice. We don’t need to promote the practice of rewarding illegal aliens by providing jobs and safe havens, but, rather, our obligation is to lawabiding American citizens. We cannot take care of the rest of the world if we are unable to take care of America and its citizens first. 
AFL–CIO 2018 MLK CONFERENCE (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, I will join the AFL–CIO’s 2018 MLK Conference dealing with civil and human rights. At that time, we will discuss the GOP tax scam that stops the labor movement in its tracks because 83 percent of the tax cuts goes to the wealthiest 1 percent and raises taxes on 86 million. I invite my constituents to join me from 1 to 3 at the Hilton Americas, where we will be talking about the labor movement and the devastation of the GOP tax scam on the American people. At the same time, I am glad that I live in a nation that welcomes those who want to serve coming from other countries and live up to the ideals of this country. I want to pay tribute to Rose and Jose Escobar. Jose came to this country under TPS from El Salvador. It is important that this family not be broken up. Jose was unfairly deported and deserves humanitarian parole to come back to be with his loving wife, a citizen who works for the Texas Medical Center, and his two wonderful children. TPS, again, is not violating or jeopardizing the American people’s security. It is a reflection of our compassion, our humanity, and our respect for those who come to this Nation fleeing persecution and devastation. To send back Haitians, to send back El Salvadorans will be a terrible tragedy, and to send back our DREAMers will be worse. Let’s work as Americans to make this country what it is, our greatest country in the world. 
102ND ANNUAL PENNSYLVANIA FARM SHOW (Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, this past Saturday I attended the 102nd Annual Pennsylvania Farm Show. It was great to speak to and see so many constituents there supporting and learning about our agriculture community. The farm show is special to Pennsylvania. It is the Nation’s largest indoor agricultural event. It showcases more than 12,000 competitive exhibits, more than half of which are animal exhibits. More than 1,000 exhibitors and competitors were from my congressional district, like Natalie Eberly, who was showing Polled Hereford beef cattle. It is well known for its delicious food, which I enjoyed and which raises money for nonprofits that support our agriculture community. This farm show highlights just a sliver of the industry that employs nearly half a million people in Pennsylvania and contributes $185 billion to our economy each year. Special thanks to Congressman G.T. THOMPSON , my colleague from Pennsylvania, who is vice chair of the ag committee who conducted a listening session with other members of the Pennsylvania delegation, as well as members of the ag committee. I was very pleased to welcome to Pennsylvania ROGER MARSHALL from Kansas and Ranking Member COLLIN PETERSON . It was a great session with many members of the ag community from across Pennsylvania. I also would like to thank Farm Show Executive Director Sharon Altland for once again putting on a fantastic show. I also thank PA Ag Secretary Redding and U.S. Department of Agriculture Under Secretary Greg Ibach for attending and participating in the listening session as well. Once again, fabulous show. I look forward to attending again next year. 
RECOGNIZING HEATHER RICHARDSONBERGSMA (Mr. BUDD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize High Point native Heather RichardsonBergsma for qualifying for the 2018 Winter Olympics in speed skating. Holding multiple world records, she will be competing for her first Olympic medal this year. Heather’s hunger for speed skating began at an early age. Growing up just a few minutes from our local High Point roller rink, Heather’s talents were recognized by a local coach who suggested she start taking inline speed skating classes. Although she was told she must wait a full year before she could compete, her passion and dedication for the sport did not waiver, and a year later she competed in her first race. The Olympics mark crowning achievements in every Olympian’s career. The many years, hours, minutes, and seconds they have devoted to training all come down to fulfilled dreams and broken records. Heather’s dedication, passion, and perseverance demonstrate the characteristics found in every great athlete. I am proud to recognize Heather today and I wish her the best of luck next month. f 
RECOGNIZING JAVASCOUTS ROBOTICS TEAM (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the JavaScouts, a youth robotics team from my hometown of New Hartford, New York. In December, the JavaScouts competed in the regional qualifier for the FIRST Tech Challenge at Sauquoit High School, where they qualified for the regional championship in New York. The JavaScouts also received the FIRST Tech Challenge Inspire Award, which is presented to the team that judges feel acted as a positive role model to other teams and embraced the challenge of this program. I would like to extend my congratulations to the JavaScouts team personally: Keegan Birt, Liam Evans, Kyle Grover, Ari Sprague, Kyle Tuttle, Jimi Wadnola, and Leon Zong. I wish the JavaScouts continued success as they move forward to the regional championship. I take great pride and it is a great honor in representing these young constituents who place such an emphasis on determination, ingenuity, and education in achieving these many worthy goals. 
CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE WINNERS (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the winning team for the 2017 Congressional App Challenge for the First District of Georgia: Cole Goldhill, Luca Dichiera, Joseph Kim, and Ryan Cranford. Over the last 4 months, 190 Members of Congress hosted the Congressional App Challenge in their districts, where students compete to code original apps. 4,100 students participated, submitting over 1,000 original apps. The winning team in Georgia’s First Congressional District is from Richmond Hill Middle School and created the app, ‘‘Wing Finder.’’ This app enables individuals who enjoy viewing butterflies to find more information about those butterflies, comparing their wing colors to a database containing numerous facts about them. I am proud of these students in Richmond Hill for doing such a great job coding and creating this app. Seeing what these students can achieve 
through technology truly gives me great hope for the future of our country. 
REGULATORY REFORM RESULTS IN 2017 The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address the House this afternoon. Beginning in 2013, I began discussing how our economic recovery was subpar in comparison to postWorld War II recoveries. That is, in part, due to, as I argued, the wet blanket of the avalanche of new regulatory costs imposed by the previous administration. Since Congress has a poor track record of regularly enacting all of our appropriations bills, funding the government, and directing agency priorities, the administrative state, that unelected portion of our government, has expanded in authority and filled that void. b1215 The House turned a corner this year, Mr. Speaker, by passing all 12 spending bills, fully vetted through our committees, prior to September 30, 2017. Sadly, only the first time since 2010. Further, it has been more than 21 years since Congress has passed all 12 funding bills and had them signed into law before the start of a new fiscal year. Likewise, the Supreme Court, in their case, Chevron U.S.A. v. the Natural Resources Defense Council, back in 1984, set up a concept now referred to as the ‘‘Chevron deference.’’ This, too, has empowered the unelected, Big Government Washington authorities deferring to their authority, rather than the People’s Congress. This has further emasculated the Article I powers of the Constitution. I disagree with this concept of Chevron deference. Before he died, Justice Scalia regretted his defense of Chevron deference and said that it, in fact, ‘‘contravened separation of powers.’’ This combination of the Chevron deference and the lack of the regular, predictable oversight and appointments have resulted in this wet blanket of a growing leviathan of a centralized Federal power, negating State authorities protected under the 10th Amendment and curbing freedom for our families and individuals. Noted New York lawyer and author, Philip Howard, calls this ‘‘The Rule of Nobody.’’ In the 2014 book, Howard argues that our administrative state is wearing people out. The process is devoid of human judgment and common sense. Many of us, in the Congress, are pushing back insisting, like in the VA Accountability Act, that—a shocking idea—bad employees should be fired and, through the public oversight of our committees or in my own Golden Fleece Awards, that we demand accountability of the personnel of the Federal Government and commonsense in the application of our policies. Howard recalls the U.S. Open golf championship, back in 2011, out in Bethesda, Maryland, when county officials shut down a children’s lemonade stand near the course because it didn’t have a vendor’s license, Mr. Speaker. This mindless, boxchecking approach is not limited just to the beltway’s Federal mandates. So enters President Trump, our new President. Last year, I wrote then Presidentelect Trump asking him to create a regulatory relief task force to address the overly burdensome regulations from our Federal agencies that, in my view, have hurt, over the past decade, our economic growth, our job growth, our productivity, and, hence, our wage growth. In February of 2017, President Trump ordered Federal agencies to create a regulatory reform task force to identify rules within their agency that needed elimination or modification. I rise today to recognize the improvements in the regulatory process in the past year and the significant reductions in cost to the economy, as a result, and I commend the new administration for seeking to continue this momentum into 2018, with the recent release of its regulatory plan and agenda for 2018. As Phil Howard has demonstrated, and we experience daily, the Federal administrative state is lacking in accountability. It is not just vast and costly; it is unnecessarily intrusive into the everyday lives of hardworking Americans. In Arkansas, we have seen agency regulations that have had devastating economic impacts on our farmers, small businesses, nonprofits, schools, colleges, universities, and State agencies. President Trump set the proper tone for reining in this regulatory state by issuing an executive order, in the first 10 days of taking office, directing agencies to eliminate two existing regulations for each new one issued. Common sense. In 2017, Federal agencies have withdrawn or delayed 1,579 planned regulatory actions, leading to over $8 billion in lifetime net cost savings. In 2018, the Trump administration plans to raise the bar by issuing 448 deregulatory actions and 131 regulatory actions, a better than 3 to 1 ratio, resulting in more than $9 billion in lifetime costs savings for the economy. This chart shows the annual cost of new regulations reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget every year, beginning in 2009. You can see the wet blanket that I described growing between 2009 and 2012. But you can see, in the last column, 2017, that there is actually a decline: a $570 million reduction in the cost of new regulations proposed by Washington. During 2017, here in Congress, we have passed 13 congressional review acts, 11 of which President Trump signed into law this year. By repealing these 11 damaging, large rules, the economy will save some $10 billion over the next 20 years. These savings and cuts put the control back in the hands of the American people and ensure more accountability and muchneeded transparency to the rulemaking process is assured, while providing that local businesses, local farmers, and communities have relief. Also, we are working with the administration to rightsize regulatory costs through the use of costbenefit analysis and asserting our Article I oversight authority. Thus, Congress is working, through our committee process, also, to lower and remove the costs and burden of that wet blanket of an overburdened regulatory state. Naturally, this cost benefit work must be done responsibly by balancing labor and capital, clean air and water, energy security, clean energy, future safe banks, and protected consumers. All that is the responsibility of our elected Members in the House and Senate and their oversight of the executive. I commend President Trump for cutting the red tape in Washington and giving control back to our States, local communities, and hardworking taxpayers. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise, today, to discuss my recent resolution here in the House, H. Res. 673, which expresses concern over attacks on Coptic Christians in Egypt. I had the opportunity to travel to Egypt last year. In the course of preparing for that trip, and during the trip, as well as after I returned back to the United States, I repeatedly heard about the plight of Coptic Christians in Egypt. ISIS named the Copts their number one target, and we all know their brutal atrocities against them. In Libya, back in 2015, ISIS beheaded 21 Coptic Christians, sending shock waves from that photo around the world. Scores were killed in the bombings of St. Peter and St. Paul’s Church in Cairo, in December 2016. Most recently, on December 29, 11 were shot and killed outside of Saint Menas Church in Helwan. These are just a few of the atrocities carried out against Copts by terrorist groups like ISIS. I had the opportunity to walk the halls of the St. Peter and St. Paul Cathedral. I reflected on the Gospel of Matthew, when Mary fled to Egypt with baby Jesus to save him from King Herod. The Copts are the Egyptians. In fact, the word ‘‘Coptic’’ in Greek means Egyptian. But there in St. Peter and St. Paul’s beautiful cathedral in Cairo, murdered by a coward, as women and children prayed, blood splattered on the walls 
marked the horror and chaos of that place of worship and serenity. Although Coptic Christians have repeatedly been victims of numerous attacks from terrorist groups and extremists, it has been most disturbing to me to learn of the attacks carried out against Copts and Christian churches that are carried out by their fellow Egyptians. On December 22, 2017, just after Friday prayers, dozens of Egyptian Muslims assaulted a Coptic Christian church south of Cairo in an act that started out as a demonstration. While unsanctioned by the Egyptian Government, this church had been holding services for some 15 years. According to reports, the individuals called for the church’s demolition, destroyed its contents, and assaulted those worshipping inside. Based on similar attacks, it is unlikely, Mr. Speaker, that the Egyptian Government will hold those perpetrators accountable for this egregious action. This is just the most recent example of the ongoing trend of assaults on Copts, their churches, and their property. I believe that many of us in Congress were pleased to see Egyptian President elSisi join Coptic Pope Tawadros II in participating in last Saturday’s Orthodox Christmas mass at the recently opened Nativity of Christ Cathedral in Egypt’s new administrative capital east of Cairo. President elSisi’s words of tolerance and hope are appreciated by all those who respect peace for all those who live in Egypt and all who favor religious freedom across the globe. However, while President elSisi spoke words of tolerance, there are, in my view, greater actions that both he and the Egyptian Government can take to protect the rights of Egyptian Christians seeking merely to raise their families, pursue their work, respect their leaders, and love their ancient nation. For this reason, I introduced H. Res. 673 to urge continued progress in religious tolerance in this very important country. There are many constructive steps that will enhance tolerance, provide better security for Christians, and improve the education and opportunities for all Egyptians. My colleagues and I offer this resolution because of our long friendship and partnership with Egypt. We are partners in regional peace efforts, regional economic growth, and in our mutual desire to defeat militant terrorist groups and nations and those who finance them. President elSisi has set the right tone at the top level of his government, and I believe he has a respectful partnership with the leadership of the Copts and other Christians in Egypt. But that respect and the resulting legal protections must be passed down to all levels of government and society because the streets, sadly, tell a different story. The Egyptian people are a proud people with an extraordinary civilization, and I believe this is a great opportunity for Egypt to emphasize the importance that Copts can play in Egyptian society as full Egyptian citizens. As Coptic Pope Tawadros II told me on my visit to Cairo, all Egyptians, Muslim and Christian, take their water from the Nile. Egypt is an essential partner in the efforts toward a lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors and in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism. President elSisi told me on two occasions how important counterterrorism is to the Egyptian Government. It is their number one concern, without any doubt, and I commend the President for his partnership with the United States, and especially with Israel, in the field of counterterrorism. With ISIS carrying out two terrorist attacks last year in Egypt within a month of each, in November and December, that killed Muslims and Christians, the Egyptian Government’s concerns about terrorism are legitimate and real. However, in my view, I do not believe Egypt’s march toward modernization and progress and focusing on counterterrorism should come at the cost of sacrificing advances in human rights, education, and religious freedom. I urge swift consideration of my resolution by the House Foreign Affairs Committee and on the floor of the House so that we can continue to advance religious freedom and civil society with our partner, Egypt. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

.S143 Vol. 164 WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JANUARY 11, 2018 No. 7 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was called to order by
