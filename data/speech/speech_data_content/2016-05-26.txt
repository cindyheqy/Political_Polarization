Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HULTGREN ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. HULTGREN led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the long and fruitful public service of a member of my staff, Ruth Richardson. With degrees from Aurora and Northern Illinois Universities, Ruth began her career as an admissions counselor at Aurora University. In 1990, she started her service to the U.S. House of Representatives as a caseworker in the office of Congressman Dennis Hastert. The caseworker plays a central role in a congressional office as the primary advocate for constituents having challenges with the Federal Government, and Ruth excelled at her job. For 26 years, she worked tirelessly to help seniors who were having trouble obtaining their Social Security benefits or to help veterans in search of medical care or military acknowledgement of their service, and she spearheaded the U.S. annual Congressional Art Competition to showcase the young talent in Illinois. To many, Ruth has been a strong ally navigating the intricate and arcane Federal bureaucracy. I was thrilled Ruth joined my team when I first entered Congress in 2011, and she has delivered professional and caring service to the 14th District residents. Everyone who comes in contact with Ruth is warmed by her selfless heart and willingness to help. In many ways, she is irreplaceable, and we will greatly miss her as she retires at the end of this month. Ruth, it is now time for you to enjoy your family and your next adventure in life. Don’t be a stranger to the office. And may God bless you in your retirement. f 
REMEMBERING AUBURN POLICE OFFICER RONALD TARENTINO (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Officer Ronald Tarentino, a member of the Auburn Police Department in Massachusetts, who was tragically shot and killed in the line of duty this past weekend. Officer Tarentino exemplified the courage and dedication that defines our incredible men and women in blue. His neighbors and friends described him as a ‘‘gentle giant,’’ a ‘‘great guy,’’ and ‘‘always willing to help.’’ He always kept an eye out for the 91yearold widow living across the street. Remembering Officer Tarentino this week, Auburn Police Chief Andrew J. 
Sluckis said: ‘‘He got along with everybody. He was somebody who was always smiling. He was an outstanding guy, and we’re going to miss him.’’ Mr. Speaker, that is how he will be remembered. In the days since this tragedy, it has been truly inspiring to see the Auburn, Leicester, and surrounding communities come together to support Officer Tarentino’s wife and three children. My heart goes out to them, and I know I am not alone in saying that Officer Tarentino will never be forgotten. 
RECOGNIZING SCOTT MEADOR (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a local act of courage. Earlier this week, in my hometown of Newburgh, Indiana, a car wreck at a local gas station quickly turned into a lifeordeath situation. In what was described as a scene from an action movie, Boonville native Scott Meador, who was a bystander to the incident, bravely pulled the driver to safety before the car was consumed by flames, saving the driver’s life. Scott Meador is a hero and an example for us all. Because of his selfless action, a family remains whole. That is what it means to be a Hoosier—to come to the aid of your fellow citizen when they are in need. Mr. Speaker, it is important to highlight the positive things that happen daily in our country. Regardless of what may be going on around us, events like this remind us what is really important in life. 
VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, Platte, South Dakota, September 17, 2015: Nicole Westerhuis, 41 years old; Connor Westerhuis, 14; Michael Westerhuis, 16; Jaeci Westerhuis, 10; Kailey Westerhuis, 9.

REMEMBERING HILLIARD POLICE OFFICER SEAN JOHNSON (Mr. STIVERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Hilliard, Ohio, Police Officer Sean R. Johnson, who passed away last week in a tragic training accident. Officer Johnson’s dedication to public service was evident when he made the decision to join the Air Force right out of high school in 1988. After serving in the military and earning the rank of senior airman, he was hired at the Fairfield County Sheriff’s Department, where he served until 1997. Officer Johnson joined the Hilliard Division of Police in October 1999 and would stay with the department for the next 16 years. Throughout his 16 years with the Hilliard Division of Police, he was distinguished as one of the most valuable members of the police department. He was awarded multiple achievement citations during his time for his service above the normal call of duty in dangerous circumstances. He earned his associates degree in law enforcement from Columbus State Community College and was a father of two children, all while working to keep our community safe. I want to recognize Officer Sean Johnson for his incredible service to our community in Hilliard. I also want to offer my deepest condolences to his family at this difficult time. 
ZIKA VIRUS (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, a new CDC study shows a 13 percent risk that the Zika virus will result in microcephaly, causing incomplete fetal brain development. Already, nearly 300 pregnant women in the United States have acquired Zika. In light of these risks, how can this Congress continue to obstruct, delay, and deny the necessary funding for a response? On many issues, this Congress is divided. I get it. But this is our most basic job. This emergency will test us as Americans, and it will test us as an institution. Will we come together to prevent a Zika outbreak? Will we protect these families? Will we act in the common good, or will we continue to play politics, ignore the science, and disregard these serious risks? The study’s author, CDC biologist Michael Johansson, said: ‘‘We need to do whatever we can to help women avoid Zika virus infections during pregnancy.’’ Let’s listen to him. Let’s do our job. IN SUPPORT OF VERIZON WORKERS AND UNITED STATES CALL CENTER WORKER AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 39,000 Verizon workers currently on strike. These hardworking members of CWA and IBEW are on strike for a number of reasons, but the number one reason is to keep their jobs and prevent them from being shipped overseas to the Philippines or India. What Verizon is doing is not unique. In fact, it has been the experience of too many families in my district in Houston and Harris County and families throughout the country. As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to fight for these jobs and improve the lives of average Americans. This spring, I introduced bipartisan legislation, the United States Call Center Worker and Consumer Protection Act, H.R. 4604, that would make companies that offshore American jobs ineligible for Federal grants or loans and put them at the back of the line for Federal contracts. This legislation will not stop all offshoring, but it is a strong first step to protect these middle class jobs. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bipartisan legislation, H.R. 4604. f 
RELATING TO CONSIDERATION OF THE SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2577, TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 751 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. KELLY of Mississippi). The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), 
pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and reported a rule to expedite consideration of legislation that would deal with the imminent threat of the Zika virus. The rule provides that the House concur in the Senate amendment with a further amendment consisting of the text of H.R. 4974, H.R. 5243, and H.R. 897, as passed by the House, and provides a motion from the chair of the Committee on Appropriations to request a conference with the Senate. Mr. Speaker, as I said last week, the debate between Republicans and Democrats is not over whether or not to address the Zika threat, but whether to pay for it or just to add it to the national credit card. This rule would provide for a conference between the House and the Senate on the Zika response legislation, as passed by the House. As opposed to the Senate approach, which adds an additional $1.2 billion to the national debt, the House approach acts responsibly by using existing funds designated for Ebola and other infectious diseases to pay for our response to the looming Zika threat. b0915 Mr. Speaker, many of my friends on the other side have claimed that the House Republicans’ response to the Zika threat has been wholly insufficient. Frankly, I disagree with that view. In our view, our response is, really, the second of three tranches of funds directed at Zika. First, Chairman ROGERS , Chairman GRANGER , and I directed the administration to use existing funds for Ebola and other infectious diseases to deal with the immediate threat. Thus far, the administration has used nearly $600 million to support efforts to combat Zika. The second tranche of money that is included in this legislation would provide an additional $622 million for Zika. Finally, I want to assure my colleagues that we will commit additional resources in the FY 2017 appropriations process to ensure that the administration request is fully fulfilled, providing nearly $1.9 billion, which is the amount requested by the administration to combat Zika. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to reiterate that I do not disagree with my friends about the need to confront the Zika virus quickly. In fact, I have been to Brazil. I have been to Argentina. I have visited the infected areas and have spent a lot of hours in talking to our people on the ground there who are both investigating the disease and working with local governments to try and take care of some of the outbreak down there. We have visited extensively with our friends up here at the National Institutes of Health and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The only difference I have with my friends is whether or not we pay for the activity. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that, if we already have the resources to confront the crisis, which we do, we should do so within our existing capabilities as opposed to adding to the deficit. I look forward to working with my colleagues in conference, through regular order, to ensure a bipartisan agreement can be reached. I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying how disappointed I am by the inadequate and long overdue response by this Republican majority to the Zika crisis. With nearly 1,400 Americans, including more than 275 pregnant women who are currently infected with the virus and well over a million cases expected before the end of the year, it is absolutely shameful that this House has failed to act on legislation to adequately fund a response to this potentially devastating crisis. Mr. Speaker, Zika is not coming to the United States. It is here. As summer arrives, along with mosquito season, the mosquito that carries the Zika virus will be active and knocking on the doors of our southern States and territories. This is an emergency, and it should be treated as such. But my friends on the other side of the aisle have spent months in delaying action and in making excuse after excuse after excuse about why we don’t need to provide the full funding that our Nation’s public health experts say we need. I appreciate the fact that my friends on the other side of the aisle consider themselves public health experts, but there are people who are trained to be public health experts who tell us that what we are doing here today is underfunding an adequate response to this crisis. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised by this, as my friends in the majority have made it a habit of ignoring the advice of scientists and of experts in favor of appeasing a small group in their Conference on the extreme right. In February, President Obama requested $1.9 billion to address the public health threat that is posed by the Zika virus. Instead of taking the swift action that was needed to confront this crisis, the House delayed and delayed and delayed as the Zika crisis continued to spread. We should have sent a bill to President Obama’s desk months ago, but, instead, this leadership allowed months to go by without there being any action on this issue until last week, when they brought to the floor a completely inadequate $622 million package that provides only onethird of the funds that have been requested by the administration. House Democrats, under the leadership of Leader PELOSI and Appropriations Committee Ranking Member LOWEY , have tried to bring to the floor meaningful emergency funding to address Zika, only to be blocked by House Republicans five times. While the administration has taken significant steps to help keep Americans safe from the Zika virus, significant additional appropriations are needed. In a letter to Speaker RYAN, OMB Director Shaun Donovan and National Security Advisor Susan Rice said, without emergency supplemental funding, mosquito control and surveillance may need to be suspended. State and local governments that manage mosquito control may not be able to hire personnel for mosquito mitigation efforts, and vaccine developments, which require multiyear funding commitments, may be jeopardized. To make matters worse, Mr. Speaker, House Republicans sent to the floor last week and again this week a bill to undermine the Clean Water Act and protections for our waterways under the guise of helping to contain the Zika virus. But the truth of the matter is that the legislation is nothing more than a carveout for pesticide special interests and it would have absolutely no effect on spraying pesticides to combat the spread of the Zika virus. It is a bill my friends have brought to the floor in the past, but they just couldn’t help themselves in using this crisis as an excuse to further undermine environmental protections. Instead of working with Democrats to address this public health emergency in a serious bipartisan way that puts the health and safety of the American people first, the Republican leadership has once again brought to the floor partisan legislation that will not adequately meet the needs of the CDC, of the NIH, of the USAID, and of other governmental agencies that are on the front lines in responding to this crisis. Let me close, Mr. Speaker, by saying that I have great respect for the gentleman from Oklahoma. When he says that he intends to support every effort to make sure that adequate funding is available, if I thought this whole decision were up to him alone, I don’t 
think I would be as nervous as I am at this particular point, but his party that is in control has shut this government down. We have seen them lurch from one crisis to another crisis and underfund one priority after another priority. Quite frankly, I don’t trust the people who are running this House to do the right thing, to be able to get a majority of their majority to go along with providing the appropriate funding. Yes, we all want to be fiscally responsible, but let me tell you this: if all you are worried about is the bottom line—and that is the cost—by not adequately funding what is needed to combat this crisis, the costs that will result if this crisis gets out of control will be prohibitive. You ain’t seen nothing yet. So we can nickelanddime this all we want, but we do so at our own peril. We ought to be concerned primarily with the safety and wellbeing of the citizens of this country. But if that is not enough to prompt my friends on the other side of the aisle to support the President’s request, I would suggest that the cost of ignoring this problem of not adequately funding an appropriate response will be a cost like you have never seen before. I urge my colleagues to defeat this rule and to bring up strong bipartisan legislation that will fully fund the administration’s request. This is a public health emergency, and we must act now. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I begin by pointing out to my good friend that, actually, we are doing, in a sense, what he is urging us to do right now. We are moving expeditiously to go to conference with our friends in the Senate, who have passed one version of the Zika response. We will have our version. We will sit down and work out a compromise, and I suspect we will be able to move pretty smartly through this. What we are doing here today is exactly what I know my friend wants us to do, and that is to move and respond. I also point out—and it gets lost in the rhetoric sometimes around this issue—that there is not one thing the Federal Government has proposed to do about Zika that it has been unable to do because of a lack of money. The Federal Government has had every cent that it has asked for. Frankly, it was HALROGERS , the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who solicited Ms. GRANGER , the chairman of the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies, and I, as the chair of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, to write the administration and tell them to start spending money immediately from the things they had. Then that money would be backfilled as needed during the normal appropriations process. That is exactly what has been done. No measure has failed to be implemented because of a lack of money. There has been no delay in money for the Zika response, and there are substantial efforts to move ahead in this regard. My friend made the point that we sometimes seem to ignore the advice of scientists. That is just simply not true. For Ebola last year, the administration got the response it wanted out of this Congress immediately. Frankly, it has gotten an immediate response out of Zika. I point out to my friend—he may not be aware of this because he is not on the Appropriations Committee—that last year the President of the United States asked for $1 billion for additional research at the National Institutes of Health. We gave him $2 billion. He asked for a certain amount of money—forgive me for not remembering the exact figure—for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We gave him more money than he asked for. This year we will do that again. He has made requests for additional money. We will go beyond what he has requested at both the National Institutes of Health and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So in suggesting we are not funding these efforts robustly, the truth is, if you look at the numbers, we are actually spending more money than the President asked for because we think these are national priorities. While we listen to scientists, we also listen to economists. They tell us that running up a national debt willynilly is not a very good thing to do. In this case, we have the money and we have the time to deal with this in a thoughtful and prudent way and to advance the efforts without running up the national debt. It is the appropriate way to proceed. I would just ask my friend to think back. When we hear this figure, this is only a third of the response. Somehow my friends on the other side have forgotten that the first third is already done. That was the first $600 million that is being deployed as we speak. This is the next third. Frankly, it reaches not only the balance for the remainder of this fiscal year, but it reaches into next year. This is more money, once we pass this, than the administration has proposed to deploy in this fiscal or even this calendar year. Then, in the normal appropriations process, which is underway right now— the bill will probably be presented sometime in the middle of June to the Appropriations Committee—you will see additional money in both the State and Foreign Operations bill and in the LaborH bill that is targeted toward Zika. The one difference is it will all have been paid for. I think that is what shocks my friends the most. They would much prefer to save that money so as to spend it someplace else. We think it is a crisis. We have the money. We ought to spend the money right now and take care of Zika. We are going to continue to work with our friends, and I think we will arrive at a good place. My hope is that that measure that we enact at the end is fully paid for. That is what we are trying to achieve here. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I think what we are concerned about on this side of the aisle—and I know some thoughtful Republicans are also concerned about this—is the fact that, without certainty, a lot of the research projects and a lot of initiatives that need to be done at the Federal and State levels will not happen because no one knows whether the money is going to follow for what is needed. I think there is a lack of certainty because we are in a House of Representatives that has shut the government down before. If people don’t get their way, people have a tantrum and they shut the government down. That is the history of this House of Representatives. I quote here from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, whom I actually have a great deal of trust in. He says: 
If we do not get the money that the President has asked for—the $1.9 billion—that is going to have a very serious, negative impact on our ability to get the job done. 
That is Dr. Fauci. That is not I. That is a highly respected scientist, whom I think we all have a great deal of respect for in this House. We ought to listen to him more than to the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party. Mr. Speaker, I ask my friends to defeat the previous question. If we do, I will offer an amendment to the rule that modifies the House amendment by replacing the Zika virus provisions with the text of H.R. 5044, which is the Democratic alternative that fully funds the administration’s request. The Republican majority’s current plan is to pass creatively named bills that have nothing to do with Zika and to offer shortterm spending commitments that will, unfortunately, fail to properly incentivize the private sector to help develop a vaccine. b0930 Our alternative would give our scientists and our doctors the resources they need to mount a longerterm, robust response to the growing Zika crisis. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, before I make my statement, I just want to respond to our distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. Has the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations introduced subcommittee allocations for either the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies or the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs? The answer is no. Has the chairman set markup dates for either the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies or the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs bill? The answer is no. So there is no chance that Congress will send either appropriations bill to the President by September 30. This really is a charade. CDC Director Tom Frieden says 3 months is an eternity for control of an outbreak. There is a narrow window of opportunity here, and it is closing. So, Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so we can support a robust and aggressive response to an imminent public health emergency. Researchers at Harvard and CDC reported that pregnant women who contract the Zika virus in their first trimester face as high as a 13 percent chance that their baby will have microcephaly. Nearly 300 pregnant women in the United States and its territories are terrified that their child will have a devastating birth defect, and that number increases every day. Every day we learn more about the devastating virus, and each piece of news is more alarming than the last. That is why President Obama acted responsibly and requested $1.9 billion to research and develop vaccines and diagnostic tests, invest in mosquito vector control, and implement an aggressive public education and outreach campaign. Yet, the House Republican Zika bill would provide a mere $622 million, which is less than onethird of the $1.9 billion that public health experts tell us is necessary to protect American communities. To make matters worse, the bill robs Peter to pay Paul, stealing funding still needed to protect against Ebola and increase public preparedness at home. The spread of the Zika virus is taking a severe toll on Brazil and other South and Central American countries. It has spread to Puerto Rico, and the outbreak is knocking at our door. Why are my friends in the majority acting more like bureaucrats and accountants than responsive representatives of hardworking Americans? Protecting American communities is the foremost responsibility of the Federal Government. Yet, the majority has failed to lead the way to a response worthy of this emergency. If the previous question is defeated, Mr. MCGOVERN will amend the rule to offer my bill, H.R. 5044, as a substitute, providing the full $1.9 billion the administration requested, without offsets, to ensure an adequate response to Zika that doesn’t rob our Ebola response. I urge me colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. DENT), the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies. Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. He is obviously a very thoughtful member of the Committee on Rules and a fine member of our Committee on Appropriations. I believe we have something really important to discuss today, and that is that today really does mark a return to regular order for our appropriations bills and process. That statement is so significant that we need to pause and recognize it as a tremendous achievement. This has been the intense focus of Appropriations Committee Chairman HALROGERS for more than 5 years. And the committee’s esteemed ranking member, too, Mrs. LOWEY , has been equally determined to have regular order restored. They have worked relentlessly to get us to this place, which is, in fact, a better place. So I commend Chairman ROGERS and Mrs. LOWEY and appreciate the support of the House leadership to make this happen. This is the best way to serve our citizens, our Federal agencies, our veterans, our military services, and the members and their families. It is also my honor to have the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies appropriations bill move forward as part of the conference committee. That is very significant to me as chairman of that subcommittee. Of course, we are also going to deal with the Zika threat as we must and as we should, and that will be part of these discussions. I am sure we are going to be able to come to an agreement with the Senate just on how we will proceed on that very important issue, and I think everybody here is committed to moving forward both on the MILCON piece of this as well as Zika. H.R. 4974—and that is the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies bill—demonstrates our firm commitment to fully supporting our Nation’s veterans and servicemembers. Our investment of $81.6 billion for Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, at $1.8 billion over last year’s level, is unprecedented. The bill will address issues to help veterans in every part of the country, every congressional district, and our troops throughout the world. The bill provides comprehensive support for servicemembers, military families, and veterans with $7.9 billion. It supports our troops with facilities and services necessary to maintain readiness and morale at bases here in the States and, again, overseas. It provides for the Department of Defense schools and health clinics that take care of our military families. For the VA, this bill includes $73.5 billion in discretionary funding. The bill funds our veterans healthcare systems to ensure that our promise to care for those who sacrificed in defense of this great Nation continues as those men and women return home. We owe this support to our veterans and we are committed to sustained oversight so that programs deliver what they promise and taxpayers are well served by the investments that we make. So I certainly support this motion to go to conference. I certainly urge adoption of this motion so we can deal with taking care of our servicemembers, our veterans, and their families. We must do this. Of course, we must also deal with the Zika threat that is affecting so many of us. I commend everybody involved in that issue. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to commend Chairman COLE for his efforts on this issue. I serve with him on the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. I know he has been in constant communication with our friends at the NIH and the CDC to make sure we get the resources necessary to them so they can help us deal with this very real threat. Again, I am very pleased that we have returned to regular order and that we are going to conference this bill on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, and on Zika. It is great for the Congress, great for the country, and we need to move forward. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I have great respect for the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and I agree with him that there are a lot of issues that he has championed here. He used the words ‘‘regular order.’’ We have no allocations, no budget resolution. We know that many of the appropriations bills will never see the light of day on the House floor. There will be this mad rush after the election to put together some big omnibus package that most people will never be able to read. If that is regular order, we have a very strong difference of opinion of what regular is all about. Mr. Speaker, I insert into the RECORD  a letter that was sent to the House leadership signed by close to 70 health organizations—every major health organization in the country—calling for 
new funding rather than repurposing money from other highpriority programs to combat Zika, also supporting the President’s request. It talks about how we have a brief window of opportunity to slow the spread of the Zika virus and avert a wave of preventable birth defects and urging Congress to act certainly in a much more aggressive way than what we are doing here today. 
APRIL 5, 2016. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. FREDUPTON , Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. Hon. HALROGERS , Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. FRANK PALLONE , Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. Hon. NITALOWEY , Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN AND MINORITY LEADER  PELOSI , CHAIRMAN UPTON AND REPRESENTA TIVE UPTON , ANDCHAIRMAN ROGERS AND REPRESENTATIVE LOWEY : The undersigned organizations committed to the health and wellbeing of our nation’s families and communities urge you in the strongest terms to immediately provide emergency supplemental funding to prepare for and respond to the Zika virus here in the United States. We also urge that Congress provide new funding rather than repurpose money from other high priority programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other federal agencies that ensure our health security and public health preparedness. As you know, the Zika virus has been linked to microcephaly, a serious birth defect of the brain, in babies of mothers who contracted the virus while pregnant. Thousands of devastating birth defects have been observed among infants born in South and Central America in recent months. Zika has already been diagnosed in travelers returning to the U.S. from these areas. As the summer months approach and we enter mosquito season, our nation can expect to be exposed to mosquitos that can spread this virus. Over four million babies are born in our nation each year, and many of their mothers could be at risk for contracting Zika during pregnancy. With emergency supplemental funding to respond to the Zika virus, state and local public health professionals would have access to increased virus readiness and response capacity focused on areas with ongoing Zika transmission; enhanced laboratory, epidemiology and surveillance capacity in atrisk areas to reduce the opportunities for Zika transmission and surge capacity through rapid response teams to limit potential clusters of Zika virus in the United States. Moreover, supplemental funding will assist the CDC and USAID in efforts to contain the Zika virus in Zikaendemic countries and ensure that there are resources for surveillance, vector control and services for affected pregnant women and children. If we take immediate action, we may be able to dramatically slow the spread of Zika, giving scientists time to develop and test a vaccine. Without action, however, we fear the number of newborns born with debilitating birth defects will only continue to rise. In addition to the human toll on children and families, the CDC estimates that the average lifetime cost of caring for each child born with microcephaly will likely be millions of dollars per child. For hardhit communities, an epidemic of severe birth defects could quickly overwhelm health care and social services systems, and put extreme pressure on educational and other institutions. The President has requested emergency funding to educate Americans about protecting themselves, reduce the mosquito population, and accelerate Zika vaccine research. Each of these steps is vital to reducing the likelihood that pregnant women will be exposed to the Zika virus. Our nation has a brief window of opportunity to slow the spread of the Zika virus and avert a wave of preventable birth defects. We urge you to act immediately to provide the emergency resources necessary to protect pregnant women, infants and children from this devastating infection.

Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ), the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to take meaningful action to address the public health crisis that the Centers for Disease Control recently called scarier than we originally thought, and to support the President’s request for supplemental funding for the Zika virus as outlined in H.R. 5044, the FY16 Zika supplemental appropriations. I thank Appropriations Ranking Member NITALOWEY and Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Ranking Member DELAURO for their ongoing leadership to help protect our constituents. More than 120 Floridians now have the Zika virus, including 36 pregnant women. Last week there were an estimated 157 pregnant women in the continental United States and 122 more in the territories who have contracted Zika. The House must take real action to protect our citizens. It is an outrage that we are not adequately responding to the calls of public health officials at the Federal, State, and local levels who are clanging the alarm bells, imploring Congress to act. Last week the House approved a Zika bill that is absolutely unacceptable. The bill the House passed would raid existing public health accounts, a dangerous precedent to set for appropriately responding to public health crises. This is an approach that Dr. Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, the socalled Zika czar, has called illogical. Furthermore, it only authorizes use of funds through September 30th. Let me assure you that mosquitos carrying the Zika virus do not adhere to a congressional calendar. The Republican bill does nothing to specifically help Puerto Rico where Zika is wreaking the most havoc and where close to 1,000 people have been infected. We need more funds now to equip our local health centers with testing kits. We need to assure the National Institutes of Health that there is sustained funding to develop a vaccine as well as a cure, and we need to protect our constituents. That is our responsibility. It continues to baffle and frustrate so many of us that the majority wishes to address this crisis, this public health crisis, by combatting Zika through robbing Peter to pay Paul. That is irresponsible. It is immoral. And the majority will have to look in the eyes of the mothers who have contracted the Zika virus beyond the point of which we will have lost control of the ability to contain this virus and this public health crisis, look those mothers in the eye and explain why they did nothing to ensure that their babies were not born with birth defects. It is unconscionable, and we need to act now. 
I urge the House to support the full request for funds and vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, what is unconscionable is to make charges that are simply untrue, and to suggest that there is money that has not been deployed that would otherwise have been spent is untrue. Everything the administration has wanted to spend, it has been able to spend. Now, we hear a lot of talk about raiding funds. Let’s talk about raiding funds. The administration took $500 million out of emergency response money—I believe in December or earlier this year—and redirected that to the global climate fund. That is money that was set aside that could have been used for Zika. Instead, it is in a global climate fund. The administration, in its own budget, took $40 million out of the Ebola fund and directed it into a worthy cause, malaria suppression. So we don’t have objection, but the idea that this money isn’t used is untrue. Now, when we hear discussions about the Ebola money, that is money that was not to be spent in the next weeks or the next months, but in future years. We don’t even know if it is enough or if it is too much. So the idea that using some of it now in an immediate emergency is wrong with the idea and the commitment that that would be replenished later, as needed, is the responsible thing to do. As for NIH funding, in the Zika bill that this House passed, there are $230 million that fully funds the NIH’s request for vaccination research for all of next year. So, again, the idea that money is not available and they don’t know what to do if we pass this legislation is untrue. b0945 So I would just suggest again we look at the real difference here. It has nothing to do with Zika response. It has everything to do with whether or not you want to pay for it when you have the money available or you just want to add another $1.9 billion to the national credit card. It is thinking like that that got us into a situation where we were running $1.4 trillion deficits when my friends were in control on the other side. Where we still have a $450 billion, roughly, deficit for this fiscal year— and it will go up next year—we ought to be doing this in a prudent way. Now, Zika response does not happen in a single day. It is something that will last, frankly, over multiple months and years. The administration’s request for $1.9 billion is not for just today. It is for at least a period of 2 years. So they have the money they need right now. The bill provides the next amount of money they need, and we will provide additional money in the course of the appropriations process. I want to assure everybody that nothing will not be done because the money was not available. To date, the administration has been able to do everything it wanted to do. This debate that we are having here today is actually another step in that process. This moves us toward conference. My friends probably look on the Senate bill with more favor than they do the House bill. Fair enough. We will go to conference with the Senate. So the process is underway. It is moving as it should. When the administration asked for emergency funding, they immediately got a response from Chairman ROGERS , saying: Spend whatever you need to spend right now. We will back you up. We have made good on that commitment. We are going to continue to make good on that commitment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. LOWEY ). Mrs. LOWEY. As my colleague knows, I have great respect for the distinguished chairman of the LaborHHS Subcommittee, for which we don’t even have a number right now, so we don’t know how much we have to spend. But I also would like to respond to your comments about we have enough now, we may have enough next year. We don’t in the United States of America respond to crises on the installment plan. As you well know, Dr. Frieden and Dr. Fauci have said: This is the request. We need the money. This isn’t extra money that we are requesting. This is what the experts have requested to address this crisis now. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me just again make clear so that everybody understands this that this House Republican Zika bill provides less than onethird of the funds requested by the President to respond to the Zika threat. The House bill also cuts the request for research and development of vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics by $132 million, or 28.4 percent. The House bill does not replace the more than $40 million taken from States and cities for public health and emergency preparedness that HHS was forced to move into the Zika response due to the inaction by Congress. The House bill also does not replace the more than $500 million taken from Ebola funds that HHS was forced to move into Zika response due to Congress’ inaction. Finally, to make matters worse, the House bill rescinds $622 million to pay for the Zika package, including taking an additional $352 million from Ebola. So the total being taken from Ebola efforts under the House Republican approach reaches nearly $900 million. Now, I appreciate the fact that we don’t want to keep on adding to our national credit card, but we have no problem adding tens of billions of dollars to the national credit card for war. Well, this is also a war, a war for the health and welfare of the American people and for the health and welfare of many women and children in this country. This is a big deal. This is an emergency. Shame on us for not stepping up to the plate and doing what is right. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, there has been a great deal of discussion this morning about the Ebola fund and how it is being used and in what ways it is going to be used. Let me just go back and make a few points to clarify that situation. When Congress acted, it appropriated almost $6 billion for Ebola. That money was to be spent over years. It wasn’t really clear whether it was too much or, frankly, not enough. We simply didn’t know. Now, the reality is, even after the amounts of money that my friend has talked about that have been shifted from Ebola to deal with Zika, that fund still has over $1.7 billion in it, more than enough to finance all the planned activity not only for this fiscal year, but all of next fiscal year. This is a multiyear fund. When you are in an emergency, it makes sense to take money like that and move it over, particularly with the assurance that that money will be replaced, as needed, in the regular appropriations process. The administration itself is doing the same thing. In its own budget, it proposed taking money out of the Ebola fund and spending it on something else that it thought was more immediate. So the idea that this is somehow unprecedented or different than what the administration is doing is simply not true. Now, the reality is—again, my friends seem to imply or perhaps believe that there is something that hasn’t been done to date that the Federal Government wanted to do on Zika. That is not true. They have had the funds to do everything they have wanted to do. They will continue to have the funds to do everything they want to do. So to suggest that somehow they are not being funded is just not the case. Frankly, we have effectively in the Zika bill advance funded money for the NIH to actually begin research and have given them all the money in that bill they asked for for next fiscal year on the vaccine side of this. So we will continue to work the process. We will continue to make sure that the resources are available to fight Zika because we all believe it is a danger. We will continue to do it in a responsible way by using the funds that are available, putting them on an immediate problem, and replenishing accounts as we need to. Again, I remind my friends that that is something the administration itself has been doing not only with Ebola funds, but with other funds, when it has moved emergency response money to the global climate fund. I mean, goodness, that was $500 million that, 
had it been left there, would have been available right now for Zika for the response in other parts of the world. So it is easy to get lost in the thicket of numbers here and this much from this pot and this much from that pot. The reality is, number one, everything that the Federal Government has wanted to do to date they have had the money to do. Number two, it has been paid for. Number three, we are proposing to continue that, making sure they have all the funds that are needed, as needed, but we pay for them. Number four, we are actually moving the process forward to sit down with the Senate by passing this rule and the underlying legislation and going to conference and actually hammering out a common bill that will be acceptable to all sides. I appreciate the concern. I know it is genuine, quite frankly, but I also know that we are acting and acting effectively to deal with the problem. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the Democratic leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his forceful arguments against this reckless rule that is before us today. I rise, Mr. Speaker, in strong opposition to the rule and, really, in a state of wonderment, wonderment about how on earth this Congress of the United States can be so insensitive to a challenge to the American people. It is our responsibility to honor our preamble to the Constitution, to promote the general welfare. That is in the preamble of our Constitution, which we take an oath to defend. The distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma, whom I respect, said just be patient. No. No. Ninetyfour days since the President of the United States asked for the amount of resources necessary to address the Zika crisis, an amount of money that was requested by the scientists, documented by the urgency of this challenge for the research and for the prevention and for the resources needed to address this public health emergency. I rise not only as the House Democratic leader, I rise as a mother and a grandmother, and I speak to parents and grandparents in this body because that is all I am allowed to speak to. The questions that I have for you are: How can we ignore the President’s scientifically based request expressed in the words of Dr. Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, a person, a healthcare leader in our country, a researcher, a scientist who has been described by President George Herbert Walker Bush as a hero—as a hero—in his work for the American people and their public health? Dr. Fauci says: If we don’t get the money that the President has asked for, the $1.9 billion, that is going to have a very serious negative impact on our ability to get the job done. Another scientist, Dr. Tom Frieden, Director of the Centers for Disease Control, the public health agency to stop this threat, said: Never before in history has there been a situation where a bite from a mosquito can result in devastating fetal malformation. Testimony went on to say that we are talking about children with irreversible brain damage who will never be able to walk, talk, see, or hear, children whose care over a lifetime is estimated to cost more than $10 million. The money is one thing. The devastation to that child and to that family is far more consequential. So the $1.9 billion is a great deal of money. It is an emergency. It is a small price to pay to prevent irreversible brain damage in our children. It is a small price to pay instead of saying to families: Don’t think about having children now because of this epidemic. The Republicans are treating the threat of Zika with so little seriousness that they decided to use the crisis as an opportunity to eliminate protections for the water that our children drink. The socalled Zika Vector Control Act the Republicans are adding to this package this morning that they are asking you to vote for is nothing but a longstanding and craven repackaged Republican effort to gut the Clean Water Act. It is a pesticide Trojan horse that will do nothing to protect Americans from Zika. This is really a dishonoring of our responsibility to protect and defend our fellow Americans. As our distinguished member of the Committee on Rules mentioned, this is a defense issue. It is about protecting the American people. This proposal today puts forth one third of what the President has asked for—onethird. People say: Aren’t you happy with onethird of a loaf? It is not onethird of a loaf. It is onethird of a shoe. You cannot get there from here with onethird. It is really an insult to the scientists who have spoken out. Actually, it is onethird of the President’s request, but it is onefifth of what the CDC has requested for the public health activities. We must elevate the importance of the public health responsibility that we have. If we had a natural disaster, FEMA has funds to come to the rescue of the American people. That is our compact with the American people, to help them in ways that they could never help themselves because of the scope of the challenge. This is no less a challenge. In fact, it would probably result in more loss of life, malformation of unborn children. On top of that, think of the negative impact it will have, distrust to travel to certain regions in our country. This is so reckless. Just when I thought I had seen it all on the part of the Republicans in the Congress to disregard meeting the needs of the American people, along comes this incomprehensible explanation to anybody why this might be a proposal worthy of the floor of the House, worthy of the public health challenge to the American people, worthy of our concerns about the American people. b1000 My Republican colleagues, you have outdone yourselves today. What you are doing is reckless. In this bill, we should be meeting this challenge the way we meet emergencies: with adequate resources, which will end up saving money because they will be an investment in the health of the American people. It has been over 90 days since the President has made the request. I will just say this one other thing. It is not our role to instill fear, but we have to face the challenge in a very cleareyed way. The virus from this mosquito is sexually transmitted. We have no idea—it could be as long as 18 months—how long it would reside in a gentleman who might be bitten by the mosquito. It could be over a year, it could be shorter, but it is not one night. Secondly, if you get bitten by this mosquito when you travel someplace where it might be pervasive, you not only get bitten yourself, you bring it home. Again, it is sexually transmitted. It is transmitted in even more pervasive ways. Any other garden variety mosquito that would bite you, who have already been bitten by the other mosquito, now is a carrier of that virus. We turn garden variety mosquitoes into an army on the assault of the public health of the American people. So, again, as a mother and a grandmother, as a parent, and for the fathers and grandfathers who serve here, think of the children, think of the risk, think of the responsibility that we have. Think of the irresponsibility of this bill before us today and the reckless disregard for public health in our country that the Republicans are putting forth in this legislation, and vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time we have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma has 13 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 11 minutes remaining. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by saying I also have a great deal of respect for the distinguished minority leader. She used in her remarks and made the point that the President had asked for a number of things. Last year, the President asked for a billion dollars more for the NIH. We said: You know, we didn’t think you asked for enough, so we are going to give you $2 billion. Somehow, that seems to get lost. Last year, the President sent down his request for the Centers for Disease 
Control. We said: You know, we don’t think you are spending enough on public health, Mr. President. We are going to spend more money than you asked for. This year, when the President submitted his budget, he decided: I am going to take a billion dollars of discretionary spending away from the National Institutes of Health and spend it someplace else. We said: No, Mr. President; we think that is pretty reckless. By the way, my Democratic friends agreed with that, too. We said: We are not going to let you take a billion dollars of discretionary money away from the NIH and spend it someplace else. We are going to keep it right there. And, by the way, we are going to put more money than you asked for in this agency when the bill comes out, and we are probably going to do the same thing for the Centers for Disease Control. So, to suggest that the President hasn’t gotten what he has asked for is to, frankly, misstate the facts. We have had a great deal of mention that the President has had the request for 94 days. What we have not had is one shred of evidence that, in those 94 days, he has not had the money to do every single thing he wanted to do. Indeed, the chairman of the committee urged him to start spending money immediately to do that. So there has been no loss of effort, and the bill in front of us now funds it for the rest of the fiscal year. It also funds the research on the vaccine at the NIH into next year. So, again, I am just going to simply disagree with my friend that money has not been available. It has been available; and, frankly, to the appropriate agencies, more money has been available than the President has asked for. More money will be available next year than he asked for. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ), the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee and my good friend. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman, not only a member of the Rules Committee, but an appropriator who is directly in line with and understands the needs of not only the American people as it relates to the NIH, but also the funding mechanisms. Mr. Speaker, I stand up to really disagree with the gentlewoman from California. To call my party and our efforts reckless and irresponsible, I believe, is unfair. I believe it is unfair because, last night at the Rules Committee, we had this virtually same discussion. And the discussion started with me when I said that I had Republicans and Democrats, only Monday, with the Director of NIH, Dr. Francis Collins, and the Director of the Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and we talked directly about this issue. What we learned, Mr. Speaker, is that there was a request for additional money and that the NIH had some $600 million that was sitting in a fund from Ebola that had not been completely used. A determination was made—including the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), H ALROGERS , and N ITA LOWEY , who were engaged in the decision—that said we will allow the money to be switched over if you would like to do that. Switch it over and use that money for this specific event that we are now looking at. What happened is they used the money very quickly. They accelerated spending the money— that is fine; we want them to do what they need to do—some $600 million. As soon as that was known, the gentlewoman Mrs. LOWEY , the gentleman Mr. ROGERS , and the gentleman Mr. COLEwent about looking at a request to fill for the next 5 months what would be some $1.2 billion that would be spent just this year remaining—we are in May—just until the end of September. The President asked for $1.9 billion for 5 years, and we gave $1.2 billion of that $1.9 for 5 months. We are accelerating the money that is necessary to NIH. The minority leader outlined how terrible this destructive behavior can be to a child, to an embryo. We agree. But to suggest that Republicans are reckless is not fair. What is fair to say is that we are responding appropriately, we are responding immediately, and we are putting it together before we are gone next week on a district work period. We are doing it this week. We are moving it as quickly as possibly. If we weren’t, we would be accused of the reverse, evidently. Mr. Speaker, the Republican Party, the gentleman Mr. COLE, the gentleman Mr. ROGERS , and our Speaker care about people. We are doing the right thing. Now, in the Rules Committee, the gentleman Dr. MICHAEL BURGESS , acknowledged some other frailties that he sees from the administration’s point, and that would be: Where is the alert to cities? Where is the administrative action to say let’s do something about alerting travelers? Where is the information that is going to public health officials? Where are we preparing ourselves to look at what would happen in Brazil? What is the administration doing other than just accusing us of not spending more money? Mr. Speaker, we all live in glass houses. We need to look at this the same way, and calling each other names is not a way to get there. So, Mr. COLEwill be responsible and reasonable; HALROGERS , the chairman of our Appropriations Committee, will responsible. I said to my committee last night, as quickly as we need to get together, the Rules Committee will come in, even if it is on an emergency basis, to handle this, based upon a request. And that is what we are going to do. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ), the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I just will say, what my colleague, Mr. SESSIONS , just said: that the NIH had $600 million in unused Ebola money, that really is false. The NIH has used all of its Ebola funds that Congress allocated. So the statement of the gentleman from Texas is not factual. The Zika virus is a public health emergency. It is a crisis, and we must treat it as such. As of last week, there were almost 1,400 confirmed cases of Zika in the United States and its territories. Nearly 300 of them are pregnant women. And one person has died. This Congress, when we appropriate money for defense or defense spending or for wars, Republicans say: Listen to the generals in the field; they are the ones who know best. Well, we are in the midst of a war against the Zika virus, and we should be listening to the generals and the experts in the field. And who are they? They are at the Centers for Disease Control; they are at the National Institutes of Health; and they are the scientists in our country. We need to give them the resources that they need, and they have told us that they need $1.9 billion. We should do the right thing. We should fund their request. Onethird of that request, which is what the House Republicans have proposed, is not adequate. Typically, microcephaly occurs in 0.02 percent to 0.12 percent of all U.S. births, but The Washington Post reported yesterday that, among Zikainfected pregnant women, that risk is as high as 13 percent. This summer, every woman who is pregnant or trying to get pregnant will be afraid: afraid to go out on the patio, afraid to take your kids to the Little League, afraid to go to a barbecue. It is our duty here to do everything that we can to ease those fears, to stop this disease from spreading any further. We must not put American women in a predicament of choosing whether or not they should get pregnant or, if they are already pregnant, wondering whether or not their baby is going to be okay. Ron Klain, the Ebola czar, wrote in The Washington Post: ‘‘It is not a question of whether babies will be born in the United States with Zikarelated microcephaly—it is a question of when and how many. For years to come, these children will be a visible, human reminder of the cost of absurd wrangling in Washington, of preventable suffering, of a failure of our political system to respond to the threat that infectious diseases pose.’’ According to the CDC, pregnant women are already facing unacceptably long delays in learning Zika results. CDC Director Tom Frieden has said that experts estimate a single child with birth defects can usually cost $10 million to care for—or more. That says 
nothing about the life of that child with microcephaly. They cannot eat; they cannot speak; they cannot walk. I do not often quote Senator MARCO  RUBIO, but last week, he said: 
It is a mistake for Congress to try to deal with the Zika virus on the cheap. If we don’t spend money on the front end, I think we are going to spend a lot more later, because this problem is not going away. 
We could not agree more. We have stolen $44 million from our States to deal with this crisis, and the Republican bill does not reimburse our States for the money that they need for dealing with emergencies such as this. We should defeat the previous question, and we should consider the LoweyDeLauroWasserman Schultz amendment and fully fund the President’s request of $1.9 billion. It is the responsible and moral thing to do. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LUCAS ). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. DELAURO. Months from now, when the results of our inaction become apparent, we will ask ourselves: Why did we delay? Why did we wait? We must take appropriate action now. We must reject the previous question. We must do what is the morally right thing for the people of this country who put their faith and trust in us to come and represent their best interests and the public health. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma has 7 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 6
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the Democratic whip. b1015 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to thank Ms. DELAURO , the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. Mr. Speaker, this is the story in The Washington Post. It is front page. It is about the crisis that we confront, about the danger to Americans’ health, about the dangers that young children will be born with microcephaly. Dr. Frieden, the head of our communicable disease operation and defense force, if you will, says it will cost $10 million per baby born with microcephaly; $10 million per child. That does not count the heartache that will be counted. I want to tell my friend, Mr. COLE— and he is a dear friend and a good legislator—the action you take today belies the representation you have made. What do I mean by that? If there is enough money now, as Mr. COLEargues, why take this action? This was not scheduled earlier this week. This was not have a rule until 9:30 last night. So if the gentleman’s proposition is correct, that there are sufficient funds right now, we don’t need to act on this bill today. So why, my friends, are we acting on it today? Because the public believes we ought to act. And the Republicans are trying to protect themselves against the attack, that they took no action until 94 days into the President’s request because, if Mr. COLEis right, we need not worry: there is plenty of money available. But they know the American people don’t agree with that. So 9:30, in the dead of night, they passed this rule, brought it to the floor so that they can say: Oh, we have acted. Nothing, my friends, will happen as a result of what we do today. The Senate passed a bill with 69 votes, $1.1 billion, not taking from Ebola defense, not taking from the other health needs of America, as our bill does, but saying: this is an emergency. Now, very frankly, my friends on your side of the aisle, Mr. COLE, when you want $18 billion from defense, you have no problem not paying for it. You take it from OCO, which is not scored. No problem. But when the President asks for $1.9 billion, about a tenth of that, well, my goodness, this is a problem. It is, after all, not the Taliban. It is not Iran. We have to protect against that. It is a health crisis in America, and we have fiddled for 94 days. If, in fact, Mr. COLE’s representation is correct, there is no need to act. But if the actions that they are taking speak loudly that, yes, there is a need to tell the American people: we get it; there is a crisis; we are going to act, the problem is nothing will happen as a result of this action, other than a bill will go over to the Senate, with which the Senate does not agree. They passed a bill with 69 votes. Half of the Republicans, all of the Democrats, said we need the $1.1 billion. Now, the President asked for $1.9 billion, but what they didn’t do is steal from Ebola, steal from other health priorities. And I hear the gentleman talking about how much money is out there, but if that is true, why did we need to act in the dead of night last night and today, just as we walk out the door? We have not dealt with Zika. We will not have dealt with Zika. We haven’t acted on the Puerto Rican debt. We haven’t acted on a budget resolution. We haven’t acted on the Flint water crisis. We haven’t acted on criminal justice reform. And we haven’t acted on the Voting Rights Act. This is a cover vote. Vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to reply to my very good friend from Maryland, whom I have not only great esteem for, but, frankly, great personal affection for, and I want to respond to his question. This is not a cover vote. First of all, the main item here is actually veterans and military construction that is over $83 billion; that, through normal order, is moving forward. Now, to also move the Zika bill with it makes a lot of sense. Frankly, one of the things in this bill—and I disagree with my friend’s characterization—we want to make sure that misguided environmental regulations don’t stop us from deploying pesticides that we may need. That is in this bill. That is pretty important to move forward. The funding is also important. Now, my friends seem to forget, again, the long record here of who has been willing to support the NIH and who has been willing to support the CDC. We gave the NIH twice what the President asked for in additional new money last year. That is being spent right now, by the way. We also gave the Centers for Disease Control more money than the President asked for. This year, when the President tried to take $1 billion of discretionary money away from the NIH, both Republicans and Democrats on the Appropriations Committee said: No, Mr. President, we are not going to let you raid NIH and take money away and weaken the healthcare apparatus of the United States. I made the point then—and I can assure my friends we will be happy to back it up—that we will put more money into NIH this year for next fiscal year than the President actually requests. Now, in terms of Zika, the moment there was a crisis, the chairman of this committee, HALROGERS , immediately sent a letter to the President and said: Spend all the money you need. There are whole pots of it in different spots. We will replace the dollars as they are needed. So taking money out of funds that were meant to be spent over years and using them in immediate crises is not unusual. Indeed, the administration itself has done this twice in recent months: once taking $500 million from the Emergency Response Fund in the Department of State and spending it on climate change, instead of an emergency response; $40 million in their own budget out of Ebola money that they were going to spend on malaria money. I don’t condemn them for that, by the way. They just simply were using something and they said: This is an account that is going to take several years. We want to deal with malaria right now. Let’s take some of that money. If we have got a problem later, we will fix it. That is all that is going on here. At the end of the day, the amount of resources that are necessary will be made available. The only difference here is one side wants to pay for it and not add to the national debt. The other side really doesn’t think that is a big consideration. That is a debate worth having. I don’t mind having that debate. 
But we heard the word ‘‘reckless’’ earlier. It is also shameless to exploit a crisis for political gain, and I think we are seeing some of that here today. Some of it is sincere, but some of it is great theatrics. It doesn’t change the fact that when the President made his request, he has had every dime he has needed for that 94 days. When my friends say the Republican bill only provides a third of the money, they somehow forget a third had already been provided. This is the second third. The rest of it will come. The money is to be spent as the administration requested, not over weeks or days, but over months and years. That is how they have proposed to deploy it. So giving them the money as they need it instead of writing them a blank check and not even paying for it ahead of time seems to us to be the prudent and responsible thing to do. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Thomas Frieden, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just recently said in response to the way this House has handled funding for the Zika crisis: ‘‘This is no way to fight an epidemic. Three months is an eternity for control of an outbreak. There is a narrow window of opportunity here and it’s closing. Every day that passes makes it harder to stop Zika.’’ So whether it is Dr. Frieden, or Dr. Fauci, or any of our Nation’s leading scientists or medical experts who all say that what is going on here today is grossly inadequate, my friends on the other side of the aisle seem to think that they know more than our scientists and medical experts; at least they have convinced themselves that they know more. Well, they haven’t convinced me and they haven’t convinced the majority of the American people who are watching this in disbelief. This is an emergency. This is a crisis. Why aren’t we acting more aggressively? I include in the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD a letter to Congress from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and our National Security Adviser, in which they talk about the importance of multiyear funding, longterm funding because they have multiyear commitments that they need to make to the private sector in order to prioritize Zika, in order to develop vaccines and other prevention to protect the American people. 
THEWHITE HOUSE , Washington, DC, April 26, 2016. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN: As you are aware, on February 22, the Administration transmitted to Congress its formal request for $1.9 billion in emergency supplemental funding to address the public health threat posed by the Zika virus. Sixtyfour days have passed since this initial request; yet still Congress has not acted. Since the time the Administration transmitted its request, the public health threat posed by the Zika virus has increased. After careful review of existing evidence, scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. The Zika virus has spread in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and abroad. As of April 20, there were 891 confirmed Zika cases in the continental United States and U.S. territories, including 81 pregnant women with confirmed cases of Zika. Based on similar experiences with other diseases transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito— believed to be the primary carrier of the Zika virus—scientists at the CDC expect there could be local transmission within the continental U.S. in the summer months. Updated estimate range maps show that these mosquitoes have been found in cities as far north as San Francisco, Kansas City and New York City. In the absence of action from Congress to address the Zika virus, the Administration has taken concrete and aggressive steps to help keep America safe from this growing public health threat. The Administration is working closely with State and local governments to prepare for outbreaks in the continental United States and to respond to the current outbreak in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. We are expanding mosquito control surveillance and laboratory capacity; developing improved diagnostics as well as vaccines; supporting affected expectant mothers, and supporting other Zika response efforts in Puerto Rico, the U.S. territories, the continental United States, and abroad. These efforts are crucial, but they are costly and they fall well outside of current agency appropriations. To meet these immediate needs, the Administration conducted a careful examination of existing Ebola balances and identified $510 million to redirect towards Zika response activities. We have also redirected an additional $79 million from other activities. This reprogramming, while necessary, is not without cost. It is particularly painful at a time when state and local public health departments are already strained. While this immediate infusion of resources is necessary to enable the Administration to take critical first steps in our response to the public health threat posed by Zika, it is insufficient. Without significant additional appropriations this summer, the Nation’s efforts to comprehensively respond to the disease will be severely undermined. In particular, the Administration may need to suspend crucial activities, such as mosquito control and surveillance in the absence of emergency supplemental funding. State and local governments that manage mosquito control and response operations will not be able to hire needed responders to engage in mosquito mitigation efforts. Additionally, the Administration’s ability to move to the next phase of vaccine development, which requites multiyear commitments from the Government to encourage the private sector to prioritize Zika research and development, could be jeopardized. Without emergency supplemental funding, the development of faster and more accurate diagnostic tests also will be impeded. The Administration may not be able to conduct follow up of children born to pregnant women with Zika to better understand the range of Zika impacts, particularly those health effects that are not evident at birth. The supplemental request is also needed to replenish the amounts that we are now spending from our Ebola accounts to fund Zikarelated activities. This will ensure we have sufficient contingency funds to address unanticipated needs related to both Zika and Ebola. As we have seen with both Ebola and Zika, there are still many unknowns about the science and scale of the outbreak and how it will impact mothers, babies, and health systems domestically and abroad. The Administration is pleased to learn that there is bipartisan support for providing emergency funding to address the Zika crisis, but we remain concerned about the adequacy and speed of this response. To properly protect the American public, and in particular pregnant women and their newborns, Congress must fund the Administration’s request of $1.9 billion and find a path forward to address this public health emergency immediately. The American people deserve action now. With the summer months fast approaching, we continue to believe that the Zika supplemental should not be considered as part of the regular appropriations process, as it relates to funding we must receive this year in order to most effectively prepare for and mitigate the impact of the virus. We urge you to pass freestanding emergency supplemental funding legislation at the level requested by the Administration before Congress leaves town for the Memorial Day recess. We look forward to working with you to protect the safety and health of all Americans. Sincerely, SHAUN DONOVAN , Director, The Office of Management and Budget. SUSAN RICE, National Security Advisor. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, what we are doing here today represents a failure, a miserable failure. This represents a failure of this Congress to do everything humanly possible to protect the people of this country. It is shameful. It is unbelievable. A rigid, rightwing ideology is trumping common sense, is trumping doing what is right, what I think most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle understand. We need to aggressively fight this crisis. And here is the deal: if we don’t get this right, all the talk about fiscal responsibility and controlling the debt goes out the window because the cost of this crisis getting out of control is astronomical. Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle can explain away or rationalize or justify this inadequate response all they want, but it is reckless and irresponsible. And for the life of me, I can’t understand why on this issue, as we are confronted with this health crisis, we all can’t come together and do what is right. When it comes to wars halfway around the world, nobody cares about paying for it; but when it comes to a war to confront a healthcare epidemic, crisis, to confront an epidemic, my friends can’t find the money. Please vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question so we can actually have an amendment to properly fund this. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
I want to respond quickly to some of my friend’s points, Mr. Speaker, and I want to go back to the essential reality that we are facing. Number 1, last year, when the President asked for $1 billion more for NIH, we said: That is not enough. We are going to give you two. Last year the President submitted a request for CDC. We looked at it and said: You know, it is not enough. You evidently don’t care enough about public health, Mr. President. We are going to spend more money. This year he brought us a request to try and take $1 billion of discretionary funding away from NIH. My friends on the other side were as appalled as we were. We said: No, Mr. President, you are not going to take $1 billion out of NIH in a dangerous time of disease. We are not only going to keep that money there, we are going to put more money, additional money than you asked for. We said the same thing about the CDC, and so we will do it. In terms of what has been done, the minute the Zika virus appeared and the administration asked for emergency money, HALROGERS , the chairman of the committee, responded and said: Spend whatever it takes. And, indeed, the administration has done that. My friends seem to suggest that there is something that hasn’t been done, yet they never tell us what that one thing is. The reality is the administration has had the money to do everything it has wanted to do. This bill provides more money on top of that. Our Senators are proposing even more, so we go to conference to figure out the appropriate amount and whether or not and to what degree it should be paid for. I would hope it is all paid for. It should be because we have the funds to do that. So to suggest that there is some sort of failure of funding is simply not true, and my friends know it is not true. To suggest that we are not willing to put the money here would suggest that recent history has no relevance, because we have put more money here than the President asked us to put, and we have committed to put even more going forward. The only difference here, and what drives my friends into a frenzy, is that we actually want to pay for this. They simply don’t. They think, let’s just put another $1.9 billion on the national credit card. This is a great excuse to do that. Well, we are not prepared to do that, but we are prepared to respond to the legitimate needs of the American people and use the resources that we have. So, Mr. Speaker, in closing, I agree with my colleagues on the other side. We should address the issue. We disagree with the other body on how to do it, and we will go on from there. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues in conference on these important issues. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 743 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 5055. Will the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. RIBBLE ) kindly take the chair. b1030 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 5055) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, with Mr. RIBBLE (Acting Chair) in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The Acting CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole House rose on May 25, 2016, an amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DESANTIS ) had been disposed of and the bill had been read through 80, line 15. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I move that the Committee do now rise and report the bill back to the House with sundry amendments, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. LUCAS ) having assumed the chair, Mr. RIBBLE Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5055) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, directed him to report the bill back to the House with sundry 
amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under House Resolution 743, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. The amendments were agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. LANGEVIN. I am opposed to the bill in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Langevin moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5055 to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: In the ‘‘Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation’’ account on page 53, line 11, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $20,000,000)’’. In the ‘‘Federal Salaries and Expenses’’ account on page 54, line 14, after the dollar amount relating to the National Nuclear Security Administration, insert ‘‘(reduced by $20,000,000)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Rhode Island is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which would not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, this amendment is simple. It adds $20 million to nuclear nonproliferation accounts so that nuclear materials do not fall into the wrong hands. The possibility that terrorists or rogue nations will acquire nuclear weapons, fissile material, or radiological material that could be used in a dirty bomb are among the gravest threats facing our Nation and the international community. Right now, luckily—though there are, of course, exceptions—these most dangerous weapons are in the hands of responsible actors. We cannot allow that dynamic to shift, and we must ensure that these weapons never fall into the hands of bad actors who would seek to do us or the rest of the international community harm. However, today, there is more fissile material in the world than at any other time in our history, and the bad actors are taking notice. According to several studies conducted at Harvard, at least two terrorist groups—al Qaeda and the Japanese terror cult Aum Shinrikyo—have made serious efforts to buy, steal, or otherwise obtain nuclear weapons in recent years. There is clear evidence that ISIL would, if given the opportunity, strive to do us great harm. After all, it only takes a grapefruitsized amount of highly enriched uranium to make a nuclear weapon, and there are hundreds of metric tons of material out there, some of which is still vulnerable to theft. Now, according to reports, ISIL has been monitoring a senior official of a Belgian facility, by way of example, with substantial stocks of highly enriched uranium. We absolutely cannot assume the risk that the United States would be ambushed by a rogue nuclear threat, and we must not leave ourselves exposed to a threat that would forever change our American way of life. While we can never protect against every threat, we can, however, mitigate it by working with our international partners, Federal agencies, national laboratories, and the private sector to more quickly secure and eliminate vulnerable nuclear materials. Small investments, such as the ones offered in this amendment, can yield significant national security benefits. By moving $20 million into the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account, we would ultimately make our country— and the world—a safer place to live. Mr. Speaker, Congress has worked across the aisle on this issue many times before, and we have seen some incredible success stories that have a profound impact on the security of our nuclear materials. During the fiscal year 2012 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, the House approved an amendment—by a voice vote, no less—offered by Congressman FORTENBERRY and Congresswoman SA´NCHEZ to do exactly what this motion to recommit seeks to do today. Their amendment to increase appropriations for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative under the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account was enthusiastically supported on both sides of this Chamber, securing an important bipartisan victory for the international effort to secure vulnerable fissile material and keeping our Nation safe from the threat of nuclear terrorism. Mr. Speaker, this House did not cower when faced with this challenge back then, and we must not do so today. Let today be another one of those bipartisan success stories. Let us redouble our efforts to prevent the proliferation and catastrophic abuse of sensitive nuclear materials and technologies across the globe and here at home. I beseech my fellow Members, adopt this amendment, keep our Nation safe, and deny the nuclear terrorists who would seek to do us harm their own success story. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5055, is a good bill that invests $37.4 billion in priorities we can all support— national security, critical water resources, infrastructure projects for our districts, and energy independence— through an alloftheabove approach. First and foremost, this legislation is a defense bill. $19.44 billion out of the 37.4 billion, or 51 percent, is dedicated toward our national security. Carrying out our Nation’s nuclear deterrence mission is, in part, the responsibility of the Department of Energy; while DOD provides delivery vehicles and operators, DOE provides nuclear warheads themselves. Congress provides funding for this critical defense mission through the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. As we drafted this bill, we carefully considered 2,700 Member requests. This legislation addresses 95 percent of those requests in one form or another. This included four requests from Democratic Members to fund nonproliferation programs at the budget request level of $1.8 billion, which this bill does. I agree that nonproliferation is a critical part of our overall nuclear defense strategy. We need to be doing everything we can to keep dangerous nuclear materials away from rogue nations and terrorists. Extra funding for DOE nonproliferation programs, however, is not the only way to do this. We must also provide for a strong defense capability, and this bill accomplishes that. While I appreciate the passion for the nonproliferation and securing these materials abroad, I would also like to see the same passion for securing these materials at home. While the prospect of a terrorist getting hold of nuclear materials in the Middle East, Africa, or East Asia is terrifying, the prospect of them getting ahold of these materials in Tennessee, Texas, or California is even more so. In 2012, three peace activists—a drifter, an 82yearold nun, and a house painter—penetrated the exterior of the Y–12 National Security Complex in Tennessee, supposedly one of the most secure nuclear facilities in the United States. If they had been terrorists armed with explosives, that scenario would be frightening to imagine. That is why this funding in this bill is so critical. The bill increases funding $30 million above the request to improve security at aging nuclear weapons facilities to make sure our own nuclear materials are secure on our home soil and address a backlog of $2 billion in security upgrades needed at nuclear weapons facilities. In a tight fiscal environment, we need to be making these investments at our own nuclear facilities, not spending American taxpayer dollars to perform work in Russia’s nuclear facilities. 
In addition to these investments, the bill also continues prohibitions on funding for nonproliferation projects in Russia, which is spending billions of dollars on its own nuclear modernization. In all, this is a fiscally responsible, economically smart, and critically important national security bill. It deserves to be passed quickly without further changes or delays. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this motion and to support the underlying bill. Lastly, let me say, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate every Member of this body, on both sides of the aisle, for the 2 days of debate we have put in for the amendments that we have debated and the respectful debate that we have had on a lot of important issues. It has been a good debate, and I look forward to seeing my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who had some of their amendments adopted now voting for this bill because of the amendments that were adopted in the Committee of the Whole. So I would urge my colleagues to vote against this motion to recommit and vote for passage of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5minute votes on passage of H.R. 5055; ordering the previous question on House Resolution 751; and adoption of House Resolution 751, if ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 178, nays 236, not voting 19, as follows:

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10 a.m. tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arkansas? There was no objection. 
CELEBRATING THE LEAGUE AGAINST CANCER (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, today I rise to support La Liga Contra El Cancer—the League Against Cancer—and celebrate its 41st year of service. The League Against Cancer was founded in Miami in 1975 and provides free medical care for children and adults who have no financial means to combat their cancers. The league relies on doctors who volunteer their time to perform screenings and medical procedures. Since its founding, more than 60,000 people from 50 different countries have been served by La Liga Contra El Cancer. The league’s annual telemarathon will take place this Saturday, June 4, at the MiamiDade County Fairgrounds. I encourage all south Floridians to take note of the great work that the League Against Cancer has accomplished for our community and consider supporting their mission. 
FOSTER YOUTH SHADOW DAY (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, this week I was thrilled to participate in the fifth annual Foster Youth Shadow Day. It was truly an honor to host Randy Colon, a young man from my home State of Rhode Island, as my shadow. He is a bright young man full of potential despite the many challenges he has faced. Randy is now studying to become a veterinarian while working full time. Unfortunately, success stories like his are all too rare, and we need to make sure that every child has the opportunity to reach his or her full potential. This week I introduced the All Kids Matter Act, which directs funds to help children and families avoid the trauma of foster care placements in the first place and promotes family unity and stability. I would like to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS) for organizing Foster Youth Shadow Day, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us in this endeavor next year. 
MEMORIAL DAY (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Madam Speaker, as we approach Memorial Day weekend, we learn from the Book of Wisdom that ‘‘the souls of the just are in the hand of God, and no torment shall touch them.’’ They seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be dead; and their passing away was thought an affliction; and their going forth from us, utter destruction. But they are in peace. ‘‘For if before men, indeed, they be punished, yet is their hope full of immortality; Chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed, because God tried them and found them worthy of himself. ‘‘As gold in the furnace, he proved them, and as sacrificial offerings he took them to himself. In the time of their visitation they shall shine, and shall dart about as sparks through stubble; They shall judge nations and rule over peoples, and the Lord shall be their King forever. Those who trust in Him shall understand truth, and the faithful shall abide with Him in love: Because grace and mercy are with His holy ones, and His care is with the elect.’’ As we gather with our families this Memorial Day weekend, let us always be mindful of those who gave their lives for our country. May God bless them and their families always. 
LOOKING FORWARD TO ELECTION SEASON (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, during this season when the American people are selecting the next Commander in Chief, I would like to offer that this is a time to discuss the issues of economic opportunity, a time for discussion of furthering health care, and working to create jobs for the American people. This is not the time for the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party to call for debates that are frivolous and for entertainment. We in the United States Congress have to do our jobs. We need to confirm the next United States Supreme Court Justice. The Senate needs to do its job under the Constitution. We need to pass $1.9 billion for the Zika virus because right now 200plus pregnant women are infected with the Zika virus here in the United States of America, and one child born with the impact of brain damage, no brain, will cost us $10 million, $1 million a year. It is time now that we respond in a responsible manner, and those who are seeking the Presidency of the United States must stop the frivolousness and the downgrading of the Constitution and the denigrating of the people of the United States of America. I look forward to a vigorous debate, and I look forward to an election in November befitting the American people. 
IN MEMORY OF MS. JANE MAHARAM (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, Jane Maharam was, above all, a survivor. She always rose above adversity. She was a teacher, a music producer, a textile owner, a mother, a grandmother. She was happily married to her childhood sweetheart, but 31 years after her marriage, her husband took off in the darkness of the night with the property. After a 15year court battle, her ex husband was ordered to return her assets, but instead of following the court order, he snuck off again, hiding in another State. Jane was left with nothing. She was forced to rely on public assistance. There are many spouses like Jane who find themselves victims of this injustice. Jane’s Law provides Federal enforcement to retrieve stolen marital property that is illegally taken across State lines. It targets stealing spouses who have deliberately evaded payment. Jane’s motto, though, was: Don’t give up. Her passion drove me and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN ) along with a number of other House Members to champion Jane’s Law. Jane Maharam died recently on April 28, 2016, at the age of 85. She was a strongspirited woman but, Madam Speaker, she died without justice. To honor her memory, we must pass Jane’s Law to rectify this injustice that she had to live through. And that is just the way it is. f 
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H. RES. 752 Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove my name as a cosponsor of H. Res. 752. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California? There was no objection. 
HIGHLIGHTING ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH AND THE HARMFUL IMPACT OF POVERTY ON THE COMMUNITY (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month, but also to highlight the harmful impact of poverty on the AAPI community all across our Nation. In my home district—the beautiful East Bay—and across the Nation, the achievements of Asian Pacific Americans are front and center. By serving in elected office, advocating for equality and justice, and creating new businesses, they are an integral part of our vibrant community. But far too many Asian Pacific Americans are just making ends meet. It is a struggle, and the American Dream seems far out of reach. The sad reality is that in 2016, poverty rates for Asian Americans is over 12 percent. And this problem is getting worse. Since the Great Recession, the AAPI community has had one of the fastest growing poverty rates in the Nation. There are also enormous disparities in healthcare access, treatment, and outcomes for the AAPI community. Too many Asian Pacific Americans still lack the fundamental human right that is health care. As chair of the Democratic Whip Task Force on Poverty, Income Inequality, and Opportunity, I will continue to fight to help all hardworking Americans—all hardworking Americans—including the Asian Pacific American community, achieve the American Dream. 
b1145 ZIKA VECTOR ACT (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend my colleagues for passing H.R. 897, the Zika Vector Act. This legislation works to remove duplicative and costly permitting requirements that create barriers to fighting the Zika virus, barriers put in place by one of America’s most political agencies, the EPA. It is another classic example of the Federal Government finding problems in every solution. Now is not the time to nitpick policies for politically charged reasons. The Zika virus is a public health emergency that deserves our immediate attention. This is close to home for me. My youngest daughter is in her first trimester with her third child. We need an allhandsondeck approach to deal with Zika. We cannot let it get caught up in Washington politics. With the summer months approaching rapidly, we need to harness our resources and wipe out this virus. I would hope that we can all agree that the Federal Government should not be making it harder for people to kill mosquitoes, which could be carrying Zika, with pesticides. I strongly support this legislation, and I encourage the administration to change their position on this legislation. The public’s health deserves it. f 
REMEMBERING THOSE WHO KEEP US SAFE (Mr. BENISHEK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BENISHEK. Madam Speaker, today I rise in celebration of our servicemen and women, past and present. With Memorial Day right around the corner, there is no better time to remember the people who have kept our Nation safe. Yesterday I was proud to welcome a UP Honor Flight of veterans to the World War II Memorial and thank them for their service. I am always deeply touched by the joy and humility I see on their faces as they visit the memorials erected in their honor. Memorial Day is when we remember the heroes America has lost defending our freedoms and thank the families that have borne the brunt of that painful loss. One of the best ways we honor those we have lost is to care for those that came home. We have made progress at the VA, but we can do better. Our veterans deserve better. I am committed to breaking down the barriers to high quality veterans’ health care. To all our veterans and servicemembers, on behalf of all the citizens of Michigan’s First District, I say thank you. We remain forever in your debt. 
B’NAI ISRAEL 150TH ANNIVERSARY (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Congregation B’nai Israel on its 150th anniversary in Little Rock. Established at the close of the Civil War, B’nai Israel was founded by Jewish immigrants in the United States. Over the past decades, Jewish immigrants have enhanced our State and 
our Nation, including the first Jewish Federal judge in the United States, Judge Jacob Trieber. B’nai Israel was a founding member of the Union for Reform Judaism and is the home for Reform Judaism in central Arkansas. The congregation has a strong link to the American civil rights movement and has embraced diversity and inclusiveness in actions and words. In the heart of Little Rock, B’nai Israel’s current temple building has been a beacon for Jewish faith and empowerment in Arkansas for over 40 years. I would like to extend my congratulations to Congregation B’nai Israel and wish it much continued success for generations to come. 
MENTAL HEALTH MONTH (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of National Mental Health Month, which is being observed during the month of May. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, or NAMI, approximately one in five adults in the United States, or more than 43 million people, experience mental illness in any given year. Mental illness is responsible for lost earnings of nearly $200 billion each year. In addition, mood disorders, including major depression and bipolar disorder, are the third most common cause of hospitalization in the United States for both youth and adults between the age of 18 and 44 years old. National Mental Health Month was created to draw awareness to these conditions and attention to the efforts to help those who are suffering. As someone with a background in the mental health care industry, including 28 years as a therapist, a rehabilitation services manager, and a licensed nursing home administrator, this is something that is very important to me. I signed on as a cosponsor to the resolution declaring May as Mental Health Month and remain committed to helping improve, through legislation here in Congress, the mental health of people all across this Nation. 
REMEMBERING BEN HATFIELD (Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart and with profound sadness to remember West Virginian Ben Hatfield, who we tragically lost last Sunday. Born and raised in Williamson, Ben knew the value of hard work. He went into the mines to help pay for college and then continued his work in mining for the rest of his life. He was a mentor to so many in the coal community who remember him as a friend and as a brother. Ben cared deeply about giving back, donating anonymously to many charities and causes. He was also a man of deep faith, attending River Ridge Church and supporting the Ambassador Christian Academy in Williamson. Ben lived for his family. For more than 12 years, he stood by his wife Debbie as she battled cancer. You might say he never left her side and was with her to the very end, where she lay waiting for him. I send my prayers to his children, his mother, his brothers and sisters, and everyone who called him a friend. Ben will be laid to rest this weekend. We will miss him. May he rest in peace. f 
INDIANAPOLIS 500 (Mr. ROKITA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROKITA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a uniquely Hoosier event that will be taking place this weekend in honor of those who have given the ultimate sacrifice. Every Memorial Day weekend since 1911, with the exception of a few years around World War II, hundreds of thousands of race fans have come to Speedway, Indiana, and millions more have tuned in on their TVs and radios to partake in what has been called the greatest spectacle in racing, the Indianapolis 500. This year marks the 100th running of the 500mile race and gives another chance for Indiana to showcase our Hoosier hospitality to the world and all that our State has to offer. Though it is true every weekend when I head back to my beloved Indiana, this weekend it will be especially wonderful, Madam Speaker, to be back home again in Indiana. 
TAKE AN EXAMPLE FROM DISNEY (Mr. FARENTHOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Speaker, I rise today, disgusted that the Secretary of the VA this week compared veterans waiting in line for muchneeded health care to waiting in line at Disney. People don’t die waiting in line for Space Mountain. The Secretary said: We care about the overall experience, like Disney does, not the specifics. Well, guess what. Disney cares about wait time. In fact, there is an app for that. I can get on my phone right now and tell you it takes 90 minutes to get on Space Mountain in Florida. The VA needs to take an example from Disney. They are legendary for their customer service, cleanliness, efficiency, and the fact that they never say no to anyone. Our VA right now is a national disgrace. Despite Congress passing numerous reform laws giving the VA virtually everything they ask for, including billions of dollars in appropriations, our veterans are still waiting for the health care they earned. Madam Speaker, it is absolutely imperative that the VA learn from Disney. We have to get the President and the Secretary of the VA to deal with this national disgrace. Americans, our veterans especially, deserve better. f 
MEMORIAL DAY (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, we recognize Memorial Day, this last Monday of May. We remember those who have given their lives in service to our Nation’s Armed Forces. Recognition of this sacrifice began following the bloodiest conflict in our Nation’s history, the Civil War, and today remains as significant as ever. From the Revolutionary War to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, from Vietnam to today’s struggle against the tyranny of ISIS, Americans have dedicated their lives to protecting freedom at home and abroad. As we contemplate this weekend as a holiday, we also need to remember what this really looks like for those that we are truly remembering. This morning a group of us were able to visit Arlington Cemetery and take that in and remember that sacrifice as we laid a wreath. It was a unique opportunity to visit with spouses of those who have fallen and see what it really feels like. They were grateful not just for our visit, but also that people across America take time to pause and remember and be grateful for their service and say thank you to those Gold Star families whom we will never be able to repay. Madam Speaker, we ask for God’s blessings on those families. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
RESIGNATION AS MEMBER OF PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE The Speaker laid before the House the following resignation as a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, May 26, 2016. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN: I, Luis V. Gutie´rrez, am submitting my resignation from the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence effective immediately. It has been a privilege and honor to have served the last three Congresses on this Committee, whose work and service is absolutely vital to the security of the United States and whose oversight over the Department of Defense and the intelligence community safeguards the civil liberties and safety of all Americans. Stepping down from the Committee will allow me to commit more time and energy to other priority issues of my constituents, as well as allow another one of our colleagues the opportunity to serve on this important Committee. Serving on the Intelligence Committee has been one of my greatest honors while in Congress and I am deeply grateful to have had the chance to serve in this capacity. Sincerely, LUISV. G UTIE´RREZ , Member of Congress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the resignation is accepted. There was no objection. 
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, since December 15, 1791, nearly 225 years, our Congress has operated under the constitutional requirement to do the following. Amendment 1 of the Bill of Rights to the Constitution of the United States of America: ‘‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or the press; or the right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition the government for a regress of grievances.’’ I am saddened, Madam Speaker, that, in our current day, the greatest assault on the free exercise of religion is being perpetuated, seemingly, by those most responsible to protect it: those who are sworn to uphold the law. Worse still, we see our Armed Forces, whose singular purpose is to support and defend the Constitution, now perpetually being used as the vehicle to subvert the very document that they risked their lives to defend. In a recent example, we have seen executive guidance with regard to religious corporations, religious associations, religious educational institutions, and religious societies placed in jeopardy. More than 2,000 Federal Government contracts a year are awarded to religious organizations and contractors that provide essential services in many vital programs. Now many of these services are being impacted due to conflicting, ambiguous executive guidance. Here are some examples: Chaplain services. Multiple organizations provide chaplains and related services to the military and other government agencies. b1200 Chaplains have faced significant religious liberty challenges in pursuing contracts with religious education directories, youth ministers, musicians, and other religious service providers who adhere to the teachings of their particular faith. Without protecting free exercise of religion, chaplains have been forced to hire people that work directly against their teachings, tenets, and faith. This is a clear violation of the First Amendment. Here is another example: refugee service providers. The vast majority of refugee and suffering vulnerable population relief is done by religious service organizations. I have worked with many on battlefields in my time as a career soldier. Because of bad agency guidance, now these organizations are facing mounting liability related to their performance under grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements. Sadly, when these organizations cannot partner with the government, the relief of human suffering just goes away, seldom being replaced. The groups under assault are often the best—if not the only—organizations able to offer the assistance they perform, doing invaluable work to relieve the suffering, aid the returning combat warrior, assist in the rehabilitation of substance abuse for those not adjusting well, and many other such services that have been going on for many decades. To curtail the blatant discrimination against these groups, I offered a simple amendment to protect them under existing law which passed in the National Defense Authorization, and that existing law upheld is the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. You would have thought I had killed someone’s mother. Instead of upholding the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, we have now seen this body continue its assault on faith in America. It is not enough to level accusations of injustice by some. They will not be satisfied until their assaults of intolerance on people of faith in this country has produced an elimination of God in public life in America. We are accused of hatred, called out as shameful on this floor, and enjoined to use the whole Constitution to support an opposing view that embodies behavior, mores, and outcomes that not only violate our conscience, but have been prohibited under the laws of nature and nature’s God. In the last 50 years, we have seen the Constitution used by these ideologues to kill American children in the womb, eliminate family structure, elevate behavior over belief, redefine marriage, and assault into silence and inaction any who may oppose them. Not satisfied, we see them without rest on their quest to eliminate free exercise of faith in the United States. Do we really want a Nation without God? They would call it progress, yet our conscience knows differently. The Apostle Paul explains why when he said this: For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. For since the creation of the world, His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools. Therefore, God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves, who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature, rather than the Creator. 
The Creator, our Nation has always been anchored in the Creator, from its inception throughout our history. God has been the foundation of our Republic as seen in the sweeping lines of the Declaration of Independence, when it drove our Founders to proclaim ‘‘the separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and Nature’s God entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the Separation. ‘‘We hold these Truths to be selfevident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.’’ That life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness could not be realized without God in our Republic. George Washington spoke for all Americans in his first inaugural address, that ‘‘No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than . . . the United States.’’ Our Nation’s survival and prosperity in the future were understood to be dependent upon faith. When Washington left office in the most remarkable, peaceful transfer of power the world had seen, he warned of a future that somehow supposed that we could have order and prosperity without faith. In his last address to the Nation, he declared: 
Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to the political prosperity, religion and 
morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that men claim the tribute of patriotism, who would subvert the great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and cherish them. And let us with caution indulge in the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. 
None of the Founders of this country believed that a governmental connection to religion was an evil in itself. They opposed the establishment of a national religion because it could prohibit the free exercise of faith but that faith would and should be freely exercised. This same foundational belief extended to a prohibition of a national press so that it could express freely, so people could speak and assemble freely, and that their grievance would not only become known, but redressed. This was embodied in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights. The Framers of our Constitution understood that restriction on religious conduct should not be from application of general laws but, rather, should be applied to those laws that target religion. Laws that ‘‘substantially burden’’ religion, even if they are generally applicable, must be justified as the ‘‘least restrictive means’’ of achieving a ‘‘compelling interest.’’ The same day the Bill of Rights was introduced, July 13, 1787, this Congress also introduced the Northwest Ordinance that laid guidelines and instruction on new territory acquired for a future United States. Article 3 of that Ordinance stated: ‘‘Religion, and morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall be forever encouraged.’’ ‘‘Forever be encouraged.’’ Some in this body today, Madam Speaker, would believe forever stops in 2016 and should have stopped much sooner. They claim that Congress grants these unalienable rights and uses the powers of the government, without the consent of the governed, to regulate and diminish faith and eliminate it from public life. In 1798, in response to the claim that Congress could regulate First Amendment freedoms without abridging them, James Madison condemned it saying: the liberty of conscience and the freedom the press were completely exempted from all congressional authority whatever. Every constitution of our Thirteen Original States, and all thereafter following their example, understood this and embodied such language in their State constitutions, which survive today. New York, article I, section 3: ‘‘The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed in this State to all humankind.’’ New Hampshire, article 5: ‘‘Every individual has a natural and unalienable right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and reason; and no subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained, in his person, liberty, or estate, for worshipping God in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience; or for his religious profession, sentiments, or persuasion.’’ Vermont, article 3: ‘‘That all persons have a natural and unalienable right, to worship Almighty God, according to the dictates of their own consciences and understandings, as in their opinion shall be regulated by the word of God; and that no person ought to, or of right can be compelled to attend any religious worship, or erect or support any place of worship, or maintain any minister, contrary to the dictates of conscience, nor can any person be justly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a citizen, on account of religious sentiments, or peculiar mode of religious worship; and that no authority can, or ought to be vested in, or assumed by, any power whatever, that shall in any case interfere with, or in any manner control the rights of conscience, in the free exercise of religious worship.’’ Massachusetts, part 1, articles II and III: ‘‘It is the right as well as the duty of all men in society, publicly, and at stated seasons to worship the Supreme Being, the great Creator and Preserver of the universe. And no subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained, in his person, liberty, or estate, for worshipping God in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience; or for his religious profession or sentiments . . . As the happiness of a people, and the good order and preservation of civil government, essentially depend upon piety, religion and morality; and as these cannot be generally diffused through a community, but by the institution of the public worship of God, and of public instructions in piety, religion and morality.’’ Connecticut, article I, section 3: ‘‘The exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination, shall be free to all persons in the state.’’ Rhode Island, article I, section 3: ‘‘Whereas Almighty God hath created the mind free; and all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness; and whereas a principal object to our venerable ancestors, in their migration to this country and their settlement of this state, was, as they expressed it, to hold forth a lively experiment that a flourishing civil state may stand and be maintained with full liberty and religious concernments; we, therefore, declare that no person shall be compelled to frequent or to support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatever, except in fulfillment of such person’s voluntary contract; nor enforced, restrained, molested, or burdened in any body or goods; nor disqualified from holding office; nor otherwise suffer on account of such person’s religious belief; and that every person shall be free to worship God according to the dictates of such person’s conscience, and to profess and by argument to maintain such person’s opinion in matters of religion; and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect the civil capacity of any person.’’ Pennsylvania, article 1, sections 3 and 4: ‘‘All men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences; no man can of right be compelled to attend, erect or support any place of worship or to maintain any ministry against his consent; no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and no preference shall ever be given by any law to any religious establishments or modes of worship . . . No person who acknowledges the being of a God and a future state of rewards and punishments shall, on account of his religious sentiments, be disqualified to hold any office or place of trust or profit under this Commonwealth.’’ b1215 New Jersey: Article 1, sections 3–5: ‘‘No person shall be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping Almighty God in a manner agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience; nor under any pretense whatever be compelled to attend any place of worship contrary to his faith and judgement; nor shall any person be obliged to pay tithes, taxes, or other rates for building or repairing any church or churches, place or places of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry, contrary to what he believes to be right or has deliberately and voluntarily engaged to perform. ‘‘There shall be no establishment of one religious sect in preference to another; no religious or racial test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust. ‘‘No person shall be denied the enjoyment of any civil or military right, nor be discriminated against in the exercise of any civil or military right, nor be segregated in the militia or in the public schools, because of religious principles . . .’’ North Carolina: Article 1, section 13: ‘‘All persons have a natural and inalienable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences, and no human authority shall, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience.’’ Maryland: Article 36: ‘‘That as it is the duty of every man to worship God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to Him, all persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty; wherefore, no person ought by any law to be molested in his person or estate, on account of his religious persuasion, or profession, or for 
his religious practice . . . nor shall any person, otherwise competent, be deemed incompetent as a witness, or juror, on account of his religious belief; provided, he believes in the existence of God, and that under His dispensation such person will be held morally accountable for his acts, and be rewarded or punished therefor either in this world or in the world to come.’’ Virginia: Article 1, sections 11 and 16: ‘‘That religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and, therefore, all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is the mutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other . . . all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their opinions in matters of religion, and the same shall in nowise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities . . . it shall be left free to every person to select his religious instructor, and to make his support such private contract as he shall please.’’ South Carolina: Article 1, section 2: ‘‘The general assembly shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . ’’ Last among them, the State of Georgia: Article 1, section 1, paragraph 4: ‘‘No inhabitant of this state shall be molested in person or property or be prohibited from holding any public office or trust on account of religious opinions.’’ These constitutions are still in effect in each of these States today. All speak of the exceptions on maintaining the peace and safety of each State. Forever—forever—be encouraged. That is the way it was phrased. Is that where we stand today? Shall religious freedom, the hallmark of Columbia’s shores, continue to be forever encouraged or do we who are so humbly honored to serve in these Chambers now just step aside and see the indispensable supports of religion and morality knocked from under our foundation? Madam Speaker, I cannot be silent. Since I was 18 years of age, I have pledged to support and defend the Constitution of this great Republic. I have been moved by conscience and dictates to speak out against the coercion of people of faith who are being discriminated against because they merely hold to the laws of nature and nature’s God. Our institutions, once based on the Creator of life, have now appointed themselves to usurp the authority of God, who is the author of life, marriage, and family. The most elemental sovereign unit, our families, has been destroyed by our foolish decisions. We are told instead by those of us sworn to uphold the law that murder is not murder, marriage is not marriage, and family is not family. We have allowed constitutional constructs to kill a child and call it a choice. We have seen discreet behaviors and private sexual preferences promoted to public display while what is constitutionally guaranteed to be able to express—religion—is now being publicly prohibited. This Nation, at its highest level, has taken a position against God. Is it possible, if that be the case, that we can form a more perfect union? Can we establish justice absent the giver of law? Can domestic tranquility be ensured that when we abandon His precepts? Can we provide for a common defense absent a mighty fortress and an unfailing bulwark? How do we promote the general welfare when every American is unanchored, adrift to do what seems right in his own eyes? Do we suppose that we can secure the blessings of liberty without Him? Can those of our posterity expect to obtain His blessing without acknowledging His existence? So, Madam Speaker, like our forebears, I cannot be silent. My faith directs that I act with love and civility in a gentlemanly manner. As a warrior on battlefields, I have seen the worst that human beings have to offer. But my optimism is secured by eternal hope and everlasting truth. My conscience speaks to God’s eternal Being. So I am without excuse. His love and mercy cannot be separated from those that answer His call. I take solace in the words of Christ when He encourages: ‘‘Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in Heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.’’ Like the Founders of our Nation and Framers of our great Constitution, I speak with many as a Representative in this august body ‘‘with a firm reliance on the protections of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.’’ So, Madam Speaker, I will stand with Joshua when he said: ‘‘And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve . . . But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.’’ I stand with the Apostle Paul when he said: ‘‘Putting away falsehood, let each one of you speak truth with his neighbor, for we are members of one another. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.’’ So I ask America: Who will stand with me? Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is inspiring to hear my friend, Mr. RUSSELL , speak such inspiring words. It is interesting that the book from which he kept quoting is the bestseller book of all time and also happens to be the most quoted book in U.S. history here in both the House and the Senate. There was a time when most legislators felt it was helpful in getting legislation passed if they had a verse of Scripture from the Bible that supported their position. Then we arrive at the point today where, if someone in Congress makes the statement in quoting Jesus Himself when He discussed marriage and divorce and was asked about it, that He, God, made male and female. Haven’t you read? Don’t you understand He created male and female? So you would have to believe, if you supported the agenda that was exhibited today, that Jesus didn’t know what He was talking about because God not only created male and female, He created a lot of question marks, like the cartoon that somebody did of a doctor holding a newborn and the mother asks, ‘‘What did I have?’’ and the doctor says, ‘‘The baby hasn’t decided yet.’’ We have come so far. We thought we had advanced so far. Yet, as Solomon said: ‘‘There is nothing new under the sun.’’ I know Justice Ginsburg was talking about samesex marriage when she said: Well, we just know so much more now than we used to know. In some ways—but in the nature of human nature, things haven’t changed. Things from 3,000 years ago, just as Abraham Lincoln said in quoting Scripture in his second inaugural, are just as true today as they were 3,000 years ago or 2,000 years ago. It is why Lincoln quoted them. But when we get to the place as a Nation that truth is not important, everything is relative, and there is no absolute, unqualified, blackandwhite justice or injustice, then our prisons fill up. You have more people committing suicide than ever. You have more people using drugs and trying to escape by using drugs. You have all kinds of problems in schools and in society. Things are turned upside down because a society loses its way, says there is no absolutes and everything is relative. But as C.S. Lewis pointed out, what led him from being an atheist to believing in God was in poking fun at Christians and saying: Why don’t you just admit it. Wouldn’t it just be easier to admit that there cannot be a just God when there is so much injustice in the world? After doing that for years, this brilliant man finally realized: If there were no just God, if there were no absolute intheuniverse standard of justice and injustice, right and wrong, if that 
standard did not exist, then I would have no way of knowing whatsoever that injustice even existed. As he illustrated, if a man is blind from birth, then he would not ever know what light was like. If there were no absolute standard of justice in the universe, we could never know when there was injustice. We just wouldn’t know the difference. b1230 But there is that standard. And as he points out, although some have a more heightened understanding of justice and injustice, of fairness and unfairness, and some of those standards differ, it doesn’t mean the standards don’t exist any more than the fact that some people can hit a musical note more closely than others. And just because somebody doesn’t hit it exactly the same does not mean the music does not exist. So we arrive at all these massive problems, and we are told the cure for the problems of society is if we start letting more people out of prison much sooner. And then people misrepresent and mischaracterize the reason why people are in prison in order to justify having a massive prison break that is authorized by the President of the United States. He is already authorizing prison breaks from Guantanamo Bay and is continuing to do that. There is an article from the National Review by Sean Kennedy this week. The subtitle is, ‘‘The Truth About the Sentencing Reform Act is Scary, and Not a Reason to Support It.’’ The title is, ‘‘Our Prisons Are Crowded Because We Have a Lot of Criminals.’’ The article points out, ‘‘mandatory minimums are for real bad guys.’’ In Texas, as in many States, we have what we call ranges of punishment. If you do something wrong—you commit a felony, for example—then, depending on how serious that has been judged to be—it could be a State jail felony, a thirddegree felony, a seconddegree felony, or a firstdegree felony, being the most serious. Well, actually, a capital felony would be the most serious, where the death penalty is authorized under certain, very strict conditions. But for noncapital, there is a range of punishment. For example, a thirddegree, minimum of 2 years, maximum of 10 years; seconddegree, minimum of 2 years, maximum of 20 years; firstdegree, minimum of 5 years, maximum of life or 99 years. Some say we should not have those minimums, and certainly not a mandatory minimum that says you can’t go below this point. For some of us, you are saying we have got to get rid of the bottom of the range. But as we saw, and with the circumstances that motivated the original sentencing guidelines in Federal court 30 years or so ago, we had Federal judges appointed for life, completely unaccountable, that would face some heinous, despicable act, and then give a very light slap on the wrist. So Congress came back and said, look, we are going to have to have some sentencing guidelines and keep judges within these guidelines. There was nothing wrong with that, as long as you give a judge at least some ability to discriminate between more serious and less serious, some ability to use judicial decisionmaking. Over time, we have seen the serious crime rates go down. Murders, assaults, rapes, a lot of those numbers have gone down for some time. They were a result not of society becoming more lawful and concerned, but actually just enforcing the law more strictly. Society has taken a turn for the worse as we have continued to say through the media, through entertainment, and through Congress everything is relative, there are no absolutes. Well, the Founders knew there were some absolutes. They knew the only way we could ever be considered to have rights that government could not take is to make clear that our rights do not come from the government. The government is the protector of the rights that came from our Creator. Once people decide your rights are given by the government, then obviously the government can take them away. But if those rights come from our Creator, as our Founders made very clear in the Declaration of Independence, then the government is supposed to protect them and not let anyone take them away. That is why it was a bit heartbreaking to hear the President say—I believe he was in Hawaii, but saying this week—oh, no. He was in a foreign country at the time. But he was explaining that, in the United States, we have these founding documents, and they indicate that we are endowed with certain unalienable rights. He went ahead and rewrote—actually, omitted— the most important words of that line in the Declaration, not where it just said we are endowed with certain unalienable rights, but we are endowed by our Creator. He just failed to mention ‘‘endowed by our Creator.’’ Maybe it bothers him to say that, I don’t know, but he left it out. And there is the problem: when people who are in leadership of the government of the United States think that they are the source of their rights. The oral argument in the Little Sisters of the Poor case should have gotten more notoriety than they got because some of the positions taken by President Obama’s attorneys were absolutely outrageous. The indications basically were that the government can tell, potentially even a church, which religious beliefs you can practice and which you are not allowed to practice. The government has that right, which would mean those rights didn’t come from our Creator; they came from the government. So the government giveth and the government will take away, which makes it very consistent with what the President just said in the last few days in eliminating that our rights were endowed by our Creator. There was no accident in the first part of the Bill of Rights, the First Amendment, having to do with religious liberty: ‘‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.’’ They knew if that freedom is abridged in any way, the rest of them will not matter. Once the government, for example, recognizes secular humanism as the official religion of the United States, then it can dictate to people of all faiths exactly what they can believe and disbelieve. That is exactly what has happened. There is a prior Supreme Court case that, in the footnotes, lists the different religions in the United States. Secular humanism was one of them. Secular humanism does not recognize a creator. There has been so much misinformation and miseducation of our young people. People were told that Ben Franklin didn’t believe in God. You have to be totally fraudulent in your representation of Benjamin Franklin to tell any student that, when he said in his own words—which were later illustrated in his own handwriting exactly what he said when he spoke in 1787, the end of June, to the Constitutional Convention imploring them that they needed to be praying—when he told them: 
We have been going nearly 5 weeks with more noes than ayes on virtually every vote. How has it happened, sir, that we have not once thought of humbly applying to the Father of Lights to illuminate our understandings? In the beginning of the contest with Great Britain, when we were sensible of danger, we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine Protection. Our prayers, sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered. 
He was 80 years old. He had gout. He had arthritis very bad. He was overweight. He had trouble getting up and down. He said: 
And the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth: that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings that ‘‘except the Lord build, they labor in vain that build it.’’ 
That is the basis on which this Nation was built. We were endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights. Ben Franklin knew what the Declaration of Independence said. It was Adams who told Jefferson, basically: You do the first draft. In essence: You are the best writer we have. It was Adams that Jefferson showed the first draft to, and then they both showed it to Franklin. Apparently, Franklin made some little interlineations. It 
was brought up for debate, and some things were knocked out. He knew exactly what was important in that Declaration that would stand as the building foundation for this Nation for our rights. When that foundation is cracked, when parts of it are eliminated, the building on which it stands would no longer stand. That is the kind of erosion that has occurred. When the Federal Government of the United States can tell the Little Sisters of the Poor—these incredibly ethical, loving, caring, giving women, who devoted their lives to helping others, far more than anybody in this city in government—and people in this city would tell them, no, you cannot practice your religious beliefs because we are secular humanists, and we will tell you you cannot believe and practice what the Bible tells you. Of course, Moses said it came from God. That is why he is right up there as the only fullface image in this whole room of lawgivers, considered the greatest lawgivers of all time. Moses is the only fullface, because he was considered for most of our history to be the greatest lawgiver of all time. This is the guy that says it is coming from God, but a man shall leave his mother and father, a woman shall leave her home, and the two will become one flesh. And when Jesus was asked about it, he said: Haven’t you read? Don’t you understand? God made them male and female. He didn’t mention question marks. These are people we need to love and encourage. The diagnostic statistical manuals for most of existence have pointed out that these are mental disorders. These are people that we are to love, encourage, and help every way we can. For among educated, compassionate people, for our civilized history, a man that didn’t know which he was was pitied, loved, and encouraged. But educated people said that is basically where the word ’perverse’ is most widely used. Now we have a government that says forget what the Bible says, forget what Moses said, forget what Jesus said when he quoted Moses verbatim and then added, ‘‘What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.’’ Even if you don’t believe Jesus was part of the Holy Trinity, as our Founders did, do you really want to leave this life and potentially, whether you believe in a judge, a maker, or not, say, ‘‘Oh, I didn’t think you were serious when you said those things about marriage’’? b1245 I didn’t think you were serious. You just weren’t smart enough to know that he didn’t just create male and female. I really wonder how many people in this body who had the ultimate power to decide whether humanity would go forward or not, whether there was an asteroid coming or something that would end humanity on Earth as dinosaurs were ended at one time— okay. We have a spaceship that can—as Matt Damon did in the movie—plant a colony somewhere. We can have humans survive this terrible disaster about to befall. If you could decide what 40 people you would put on the spacecraft who would save humanity, how many of those would be samesex couples? You are wanting to save humankind for posterity—basically, a modernday Noah. You have that ability to be a modernday Noah. You can preserve life. How many samesex couples would you take from the animal kingdom and from humans to put on the spacecraft to perpetuate humanity and the wildlife kingdom? That is why it has been called part of the natural law, natural law given by the Creator; but when we continue to abolish the first words of the Bill of Rights—the First Amendment—and we continue to prohibit the free exercise of religion, we don’t have much longer to go. Jonathan Cahn has a great book—interesting. The dialogue could be a little stronger, but ‘‘The Harbinger,’’ and the more recent one, ‘‘The Mystery of the Shemitah Unlocked,’’ really are thoughtprovoking even if you are a secular humanist. He makes the comparison that the United States, just as the Founders said, was founded by the grace of God and as an instrument to bless the world. Even for those who have not recognized the exceptional nature of the United States, it is still a fact that you can’t find nations throughout history that have done what this one has, where we have sent our best and brightest and our most valuable commodity—American blood, sweat, toil— and fought for the freedom of others. We have fought to protect others, not just ourselves. You don’t find nations through history that did that. This Nation had because they believed there was a higher power. They believe our rights come from our Creator, and we have an obligation to that same Creator. This Nation has spread goodness around the world despite those who would say otherwise. It has happened. We have been the most generous, charitable, helping, loving nation in the history of the world. We have more opportunities and more assets per individual than even Solomon’s Israel. We have been blessed beyond measure. Jonathan Cahn makes the comparison to the ninth chapter of Isaiah, where at that point, long after Saul and long after David and Solomon, we come to 732 B.C. By that time, Israel is divided into two parts—the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. The southern kingdom of Judah is where Jerusalem was. Jonathan Cahn draws the parallel, which is actually scary when you start looking at the things that actually are parallel to that time. God is telling Isaiah: Look, the people whom I have blessed—I have provided more than anyone else—have turned away from me; so I allowed the Assyrians to come in and attack and harm them. I pulled back the hand of protection. Back in those days, the Assyrians were known as the true fathers of terrorism. They came in and attacked and did the strange thing of going back to Assyria. God is telling Isaiah: I have given them a warning to turn back to me. I know that for 90 days, churches all over America were packed after 9/11. Basically, we saw people say: Never mind, God. We don’t have to worry anymore. We have got this. God said: They didn’t turn back to me. I am going to let them go. Ten years later, he allowed the Assyrians to come in and wipe them out. The southern kingdom, where Jerusalem was, continued to turn away from him. Then, over 100 years later, he allowed them to be attacked as a warning. They didn’t heed the warning. Now, they got about 19 years before God withdrew his hand of protection and allowed the children of Israel to be taken into exile, and the nation of Israel ceased to exist. The northern kingdom and the southern kingdom of Judah ceased to exist because they wouldn’t turn back. If Jonathan Cahn is accurate in that comparison—well, we are beyond 10 years since that warning. Maybe people believe there is a God and believe as our Founders did and as Ben Franklin said in his talking about the Bible, in quoting it, and as Jefferson did in the quote that is still engraved in his memorial: that he trembles for our country when he realizes God is just, but he is not going to remain silent forever— well, the southern kingdom got 19 years after their warning, and then God let them go. Tough times are upon us. We have a President who has now got an agenda to release more murderers, killers, haters of America to go forth and continue to kill and murder and hate Americans. I mean, I know some people are saying: But it has been 15 years; they have got to be released. No. The way it has always worked among civilized nations when it has come to prisoners of war is, when someone declared war on a nation or on a people, and when some of those warriors were captured, they were held in a civil manner; they were held until those at war said: We are no longer at war. Then the prisoners were released unless they had committed war crimes for which they could be tried. At any time in the last 15 years, all of them could have been released—unless war crimes had been committed—if their friends, their allies, had said: Okay. We are the Muslim Brotherhood, we are radical Islam, and we are no longer at war with the Great Satan, the United States. We want peace. We won’t be terrorizing and attacking you and trying to destroy your way of life anymore. We are done. 
That is when they cease the violence against the United States. We can release the prisoners unless war crimes have been committed. Then at that point, as in Nuremberg, you try them for their war crimes. This President is jumping the gun. They are still at war. Muslim leaders in the Middle East and Africa have asked me: Why is it you don’t understand that radical Islamists, the Muslim Brotherhood, have been at war with you since 1979, and you are helping them? Iran is the greatest supporter of terrorism. You are helping them more than you are willing to help us. What is wrong with you? The answer is: We have turned away from the Creator, the source of our rights and our blessings. I believe God exists. For those who think that maybe he does, maybe they are agnostic. If God exists, the question is: Does he love us more than he loved Jerusalem? Because, if he doesn’t, it is doubtful we have more than 4 or 5 years to go. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
