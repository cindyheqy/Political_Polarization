Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, in 1947, Senator Arthur Vandenberg famously stated that politics stop at the water’s edge. What that meant was that partisan fighting and attacks should cease when they compromise America’s role in missions abroad and, indeed, when they compromise the safety and security of Americans abroad as well. Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I sat in the Homeland Security Committee and heard over two dozen references from my esteemed colleagues across the aisle to a Muslim ban. When President Obama expanded its own screening for refugees for majority Muslim nations, he said it was because of ‘‘the growing threat from foreign terrorist fighters,’’ and nary a peep was heard. Our colleagues across the aisle said this Muslim ban will endanger Americans and serve as a recruiting tool to ISIS. Mr. Speaker, I agree, except there is no Muslim ban. Talk of a Muslim ban makes Americans less safe at home, true; it makes Americans less safe abroad, true; and if politics stop at the water’s edge and there is no Muslim ban, then why use partisan politics to perpetrate falsehoods that do just those very things. Let’s look at the facts: Of the 2.3 billion Muslims on the planet Earth, 11 percent live in the countries named in Mr. Trump’s executive order. Ninetenths of 1 percent live in Syria, a single nation pulled out for heightened scrutiny. The duration of the heightened scrutiny held to the Syrian refugee population is onehalf that of the same action taken by Mr. Trump’s predecessor, President Obama, as it related to Iraqis in 2011 when nary a peep was heard because politics are supposed to stop at the water’s edge. We hear questions: Does the President have a constitutional right to do this? I say, no, he has a constitutional duty to do this. We look at Article II and see the clear and present danger clause. We hear the language of the Obama administration speaking of growing terrorist threats from abroad. We see in Article II and in the oath that the President takes that it is his duty to protect Americans from all threats, all enemies, foreign and domestic. So what we know is that the executive order affects a scant 7 of well over 50 majorityMuslim nations. There is no religious test because it also affects millions of Christians living in these nations. It affects about 11 percent of the global Muslim population. There are exceptions granted. We know that ISIS is using the refugee system to infiltrate Western nations. We know that first or second generation radical Islamists have killed over 70 Americans since Boston and wounded over 300 on U.S. soil. 
b1015 We know that, just over a month ago, a dozen innocent individuals at a Christmas market in Berlin were murdered and 50 more were injured by a refugee. We know that the fallacious concept of a Muslim ban inflames and enrages our enemies and serves as a recruiting tool. So the question then becomes: Why do some Members of this esteemed body continue to perpetuate what is willful ignorance at best and a falsehood at worst? Why say there is a Muslim ban when there is not? Mr. Speaker, if politics stop at the water’s edge, then Members won’t play loose with the facts to score political points. Members won’t advance a false narrative that endangers Americans. Members will support this President, as they did the last President, as he seeks to discharge his duty to defend the United States, its citizens, and our Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. 
TRUMP IMMIGRATION EXECUTIVE ORDER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BROWNLEY ) for 5 minutes. Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, last Saturday, a U.S. Army interpreter, who risked his life serving our country for over a decade in Mosul and Baghdad, was stopped at the airport and detained for 18 hours. His name was Hameed Khalid Darweesh. Why was he detained? Because he came from a country that was singled out by President Trump because of the religion of its people. He did so not to increase safety, but to instill fear. When people are afraid, they tend to let their President and their elected leaders do anything they think will protect them, and they ignore just about everything else. When the American people are afraid, they might ignore a President’s promise that he would ‘‘drain the swamp.’’ When they are afraid, they might forget that a President has treated Vladimir Putin better than he has treated the heads of state of our allies and trading partners. They might ignore his attacks on women, on minorities, on our environment, on our health care, on our civil rights, on our public education system; and they might even ignore investigations into his vast conflicts of interest. They might be willing to overlook the very principles of our Constitution that, indeed, make us safe. One of these principles is freedom of religion, because our Founding Fathers knew that despots all over the world have used fear of another group’s religion to do terrible, terrible things throughout the history of man. So when the President singles out who can come into this country and who cannot based on one’s religion, he is insulting and turning his back on our Constitution—a Constitution that keeps us safe, a Constitution that, by its own example, helps to keep the world safe. Let’s be clear. When Mr. Trump bars a man like Hameed, an interpreter who helped protect our troops from coming into our country, because of his religion, he is not protecting us; he is endangering us and he is endangering the world. We cannot let it stand. We must resist. f 
UPHOLDING OUR NATION’S VALUES OF A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, it is only day 13 into the Donald Trump administration and we are already faced with yet another round of questions about President Trump’s potential conflicts of interest over his business holdings. The most recent issue to raise questions is President Trump’s Muslim ban executive order. At face value, this action looks like yet another harmful step in his divisive agenda. Trump’s hateful scapegoating of refugees will make us less safe, and it goes against our country’s moral fiber and small ‘‘d’’ democratic values. It is hard to believe that these seven countries were targeted based on a serious threat that was posed by their citizens who were traveling to the United States. The people responsible for some of the most egregious attacks on American soil in recent decades, including 9/ 11, the Times Square bombing, the Boston Marathon bombing, the Pulse nightclub shooting, and others did not come from these seven countries. In fact, refugees from these countries already face a lengthy and rigorous vetting process led by our security intelligence agencies. This 20step process involves multiple background checks, interviews, and screenings, and it frequently takes between 18 and 24 months for approval. However, these seven countries do have at least one thing in common. According to Bloomberg News, The Trump Organization does not have business or has not pursued business deals in any of them. President Trump does, on the other hand, have business ties to other countries in the region that were excluded from the ban. His FEC filings indicate The Trump Organization has development projects in Saudi Arabia and business projects possibly related to Egypt. These countries were excluded from the executive order despite their being home to many of the terrorists who carried out 9/11. In Turkey, President Trump has a licensing deal for two luxury towers to use his name—a deal he received up to $5 million for just last year. He also has licensing agreements with businesses in other countries in the region. I am not saying that we should ban people from these countries. I firmly oppose any ban that is based on nationality or religion, but it is unacceptable that business interests have played potentially a role in such a destructive policy that also makes our country less safe in the long run. This move will likely damage relationships with our Muslim allies who are fighting ISIS militants, and be used as a tool by the Islamic State to increase their recruitment and radicalization efforts. Of course, my friends in the majority and in the White House claim that the seven countries under this order were similarly targeted by our previous administration. In reality, President Trump’s discriminatory ban is drastically different than President Obama’s specific changes to the State Department Visa Waiver Program, in which the changes focused on expedited visa privileges for dual nationals and did not target all citizens from specific countries; but I will bet you didn’t hear Sean Spicer make that distinction. Instead, the administration is busy downplaying the number of people who were impacted by this decision and is claiming that only 109 people were affected—aka alternative facts. At least 700 people were denied boarding after the order was issued, and 90,000 people in these countries already have visas but will not be able to travel to the United States. It is time for the President to stop defending his divisive and unconstitutional executive order and start being transparent about his business interests. Every President who has been elected in the modern era has released his tax records to ensure the American people that his actions will not be impacted by financial holdings. After promising throughout the campaign to release his tax returns, President Trump’s advisers recently announced that he will indefinitely hide this information from the public. These holdings potentially put President Trump in direct violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution on day one. The safeguard is designed to prevent corruption and foreign influence over policy decisions by not allowing Federal officials to take money from a foreign entity without there being congressional approval; but we have seen report after report of foreign leaders and diplomats choosing to stay at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., in order to gain favor with the administration. They stand to profit from foreign governments, including a big paycheck from a Chinese bank, which is a large tenant at the Trump Tower. These are just tipof theiceberg examples of direct conflicts in both domestic and foreign policy under this President. Mr. President, it is time for you to fix this. One, divest your business holdings immediately to remove any suggestion of there being a conflict in your decisionmaking. Two, show us your tax returns so that your business and financial interests are transparent to the American people. Three, get rid 
of your unconstitutional executive order, which will make us less safe and only serve to embolden our enemies. Short of that, we will have to take other actions, including legislative directives, resolutions of disapproval, even exploring the power of impeachment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
ACTING ON AMERICA’S INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) for 5 minutes. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, last week, President Trump traveled to Philadelphia to address the Republican Conference. He talked about his pledge to spend $1 trillion on our crumbling infrastructure, and he expressed frustration that it is not part of the first 100 days’ agenda of the Republican leadership. I share that frustration. It is never on the agenda for the Republican leadership to invest in American infrastructure. We did manage to pass a bill through the last Congress—the FAST Act—that was a decent continuation of our investments, but it lacked funding dramatically, and at the end of 5 years, our infrastructure will be in worse condition. So I share the President’s frustration. He also said, ‘‘fix it first.’’ Last week, I talked about harbors. It is easy to take care of the harbor issue. All you have to do is spend the tax for the purpose for which it has been collected, but the Republicans don’t want to do that. Today I am going to talk a little bit about rail—in particular, the Northeast Corridor. We had a report by Amtrak that assessed the needs on this corridor, which is shared by freight and rail and carries a phenomenal number of people and goods every day. Over 2,200 Amtrak commuter and freight trains work some portion of this route every day. However, it is in a state of serious disrepair. One of the most critical areas is in Baltimore, the Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel. It was an investment made by the Government of the United States of America. It began during the Civil War and finished just after. It has held up. That is a pretty amazing amount of time, but it is at the point of failure now, and if that tunnel fails, it will choke off all of the movement of goods and people from Washington, D.C.— points south—to the northeast. It is a major economic engine—a hugely populated area of the United States of America. The tunnel fix has gone through an environmental impact statement; so they can’t drag out with, ‘‘Oh, it is those darned regulations and environmental restrictions. We can’t get it done.’’ No. We can get it done. We have got a plan. We have got an engineering design. All we need is the money—the investment—by the Government of the United States. Now, we have a Speaker who says, ‘‘Oh, if it is worth doing, the private sector will do it.’’ No. This is an asset which serves both private and public interests, and it needs a Federal investment. That is $4 billion. If you go all the way up to Boston, you are looking at over $30 billion: bridges—critical bridges—that are 100, 110, 120, 130 years old and that are falling apart. It is time for some action here. If we go a little further north, up to New York, we have the Hudson River tunnel, which is another engineering miracle. The Hudson River tunnel was completed in, oh, 1909. Then, of course, even though that has held up pretty well, it was flooded during Hurricane Sandy, and the salts that got in there are accelerating the erosion of that tunnel, and it is near the point of failure; so we would no longer be connected to New York City through the Hudson River tunnel. There are 200,000 passengers who use that every day. That would be a blow not only to the New York and regional economy, but to the national economy should that tunnel fail. Other countries are making these investments. I was in Japan last year. They have a rail system that they built 40 years ago. It has run on time for 40 years. It has had no accidents for 40 years, and it travels at about 200 miles an hour. We, the great United States of America, can sometimes get trains up to 20, 30 miles an hour—at critical sections of this rail infrastructure—but we do not have time for that. First, we have to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Then we have to cut taxes for the wealthiest among us, and maybe they will build the tunnels and bridges and name them after themselves. I don’t think so. They will be buying more super yachts and expensive places to go on vacation. It is past time for this Congress to act in making critical investments in America’s infrastructure. Yesterday, I unveiled a clock which tracks the cost of delays and congestion to the economy and to the people of the United States on a daily basis because of deteriorated infrastructure. The clock is ticking. It is time to stop that clock and rebuild our country. 
b1030 DANTE SAWYER GOODBYE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank a longtime staff member in my office, Dante Sawyer, who, after nearly 4 years of service to the families of the Second Congressional District, is moving on to new opportunities to work in the office of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx. It will be a tall task replacing Dante in my office, but I am comforted and take pride in the fact that Dante will make a huge difference in a new capacity. When I first came to Congress and was deciding who I wanted to represent me in the field; who I wanted to serve the families I care so much about; and who had the compassion, presence, and leadership abilities to make a difference back in Chicago, I knew that Dante was the difference maker that I needed. Dante has a million dollar mind and an irreplaceable heart. He is the pulse of the people with a gift for public service. It is no secret that the Chicagoland area has been rocked by gun violence and economically distressing circumstances. And there is much that needs to be done for the families of Chicago. It is sad that January of 2017 has started off with just as many shootings as January of 2016—and 2016 was the most violent year for Chicago with nearly 700 gun deaths last year. But Dante holds the belief that I do, that nothing stops a bullet like an opportunity. And each year, he has been a lead staffer on my team in coordinating a youth job and resource expo in the Second Congressional District. Through this work, Dante has helped me leave a mark in offering economic opportunity, mentorship, and job readiness training to thousands of Chicagoland youth, helping to ensure the success of the next generation. He will be gone from my office, but his service continues. Congratulations, Dante, and continued success to his wonderful wife and his brilliant daughters, Jordan and Payton. I am honored to have the privilege to have worked with you. And on behalf of the families of the Second Congressional District, thank you so much for a job well done. CHICAGO GUN VIOLENCE  
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, last month, as I mentioned, Chicago suffered just as many gun shootings as the year before, and 2016 was a record setting month itself. I have come to the floor countless times to draw attention to this epidemic. Last week, President Trump threatened to send in the Feds in response to the carnage. It was very disheartening to hear and see on the news that my colleagues made jokes at their Republican retreat last week about this. This morning, he spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast. In that vein, I remind him of the Gospel of Matthew: violence begets violence; hate begets hate. The proper response is not threat of more force, increased demonization, or further withering of policecommunity relations. More cops on the beat alone is not the solution. It is mentorship, job training, and increased economic development. 
Nothing stops a bullet like an opportunity. I keep an open invitation to President Trump to visit my district so he can learn this himself and speak to those in the trenches, and those victimized by gun violence, instead of just demonizing in 140 characters from the safety of the White House residence. 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Our international alliances are vital to U.S. security. Allies like Australia have never failed to answer the U.S.’s call for help. For decades, Australia and the U.S. have cooperated on everything from military and intelligence to diplomacy and trade. Yet, now, as we face increasing tensions in the Asia Pacific, President Trump seems determined to promote instability and uncertainty. To assist with the rebalance to Asia, the United States has 2,500 marines stationed in Darwin. This forward posture allows the U.S. greater operational flexibility and military integration with Australia. I encourage President Trump to coordinate more closely with the State Department so he can fully understand the delicate balance of international affairs. Historical tensions between countries like Taiwan and China, and India and Pakistan require particular attention to historical precedents and agreements. The U.S. will gain nothing by projecting uncertainty or hostility toward our allies. They have sent their sons and daughters off to war on our behalf and formed bonds on the battlefield that will never be forgotten. I urge my colleagues to reaffirm our international alliances and reject efforts by the administration to undermine decades of peace and security. 
HONORING DR. CAROL MITCHELL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to commemorate African American History Month by honoring one of the exceptional Americans who resides in our district in Omaha. Dr. Carol Mitchell’s career of public service and her dedication to education has made her a true hero and an inspiration to us all. Dr. Mitchell was born and raised in, what was at the time, a segregated Port Arthur, Texas. Her identical twin sister, Bishop Sarah Davis, graduated as covaledictorians from Lincoln High School in Port Arthur. After graduation, she attended North Texas State University in Denton. North Texas State University afforded Dr. Mitchell her first educational experience with an integrated school. During this time, Carol had the fortune of studying chemistry and geology at Morris Brown College and at Emory University through summer education programs. Dr. Mitchell and her sister, who also attended North Texas State University, were the first African Americans initiated into the North Texas Green Jackets, a student community service organization further cultivating Dr. Mitchell’s love for public service and education. In 1970, after graduating from North Texas State University with a bachelor of science in secondary education, Dr. Mitchell married her husband, Glenn Mitchell, and moved to Omaha, Nebraska. In Omaha, she continued her work in public service, teaching science and chemistry for 15 years at Omaha Burke High School, culminating as the supervisor of all science education for the entire Omaha public school system. In 1991, Dr. Mitchell took an instructor position at the University of Nebraska Omaha, and for the next 22 years, Dr. Mitchell educated future science teachers in the college of education. It was during this time that Dr. Mitchell earned her doctoral degree from the University of NebraskaLincoln. Dr. Mitchell’s public service went far beyond just the Omaha and Midwestern region, to include work and study abroad. Among her many postdoctoral accomplishments, she twice had the honor of working at Oxford University in England and through her service with the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and she conducted Summer Science Institute courses in chemistry and biology for students and teachers and countries across Southern Africa. Since 1991, she has received 21 awards, including the STEM Legacy Award from the Empowerment Network earlier this year, and the UNO Alumni Excellence in Teaching Award in 2009. Dr. Mitchell has led a vibrant and inspiring life of public service in education and has worked to enrich the lives of all of her students and coworkers through her love of science and education. Her many accolades and awards throughout her life as a student, educator, and public servant attest to the legacy she has left. Though starting life with the challenges of a segregated community, she has persevered to obtain the epitome of success and enhance our communities and Nation. Undoubtedly, Dr. Mitchell has had a lifetime of influence, and her legacy will endure for many generations to come. 
IMPORTANCE OF ANIMAL WELFARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today we are starting efforts to reformulate the Animal Protection Caucus here for this Congress. I have been pleased for several years to serve as the cochair. Last Congress, it was with our friend Congressman MIKE FITZPATRICK from Pennsylvania—a bipartisan effort involving over 130 men and women in Congress who are dedicated to efforts of animal protection. The welfare of animals says a lot about us. Animal abuse is often a precursor to domestic violence. We find that the health and welfare of animals in our communities speak to the environmental protections. We find that people who are able to deal meaningfully with animal welfare have a chance, in many cases, to have benefits that go far beyond what you would imagine. Animals have a capacity to have a calming influence on people. We see this as volunteers bring pet rabbits to nursing homes to be able to deal with people. Animals have a way of reducing people’s blood pressure. It is a great symbiotic relationship. Here in Congress, we have a wide variety of areas that we can work on together to advance animal protections. We have strengthened laws against animal fighting. We have raised awareness about the barbaric practice of horse soring injuring them to produce the distinctive gait. We promote humane treatment of animals in agricultural research, to be able to reduce the harmful effects on animals in production of cosmetics. We have bipartisan legislation that would allow people to have their animals at domestic violence shelters, or for emergency services. One of the things that was most jarring for me, illustrated by what happened with Katrina—2005 hurricane in New Orleans—that there were times where people would not abandon their home because they were afraid of what would happen to their puppy. We have seen women who are in a situation of domestic violence refuse to leave their abuser because they are afraid of what is going to happen to their kitten that would be left behind. I am pleased that, in this Congress, the Republican cochair is going to be my friend Congressman VERN BUCHANAN from Florida. V ERNbrings to this issue personal passion, energy, and new ideas. And I am quite confident we will continue the efforts with the caucus to be able to promote animal welfare, promote understanding on Capitol Hill. We have had, on a monthly basis, bipartisan briefings of legislation with Republican and Democratic cosponsors that garner broad support. And I am hopeful together that this can be, in a time when there is more than a little contention and controversy—that this is an area that we can come together to work on, on Capitol Hill. We are supported by organizations like the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Animal Welfare Institute, Born Free, The Humane Society; representative of the over 25,000 organizations across the country that are dedicated to animal protection. 
I am hopeful that each of my colleagues will join us in this bipartisan effort, focus on simple commonsense things that we can do that bring us together to promote animal welfare, to be able to make all of God’s creatures better off, and in so doing, reinforce our humanity. 
AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION— GO RED FOR WOMEN CAMPAIGN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to support American Heart Association’s Go Red for Women campaign. The Go Red for Women campaign is an incredible public awareness initiative, spearheaded by the American Heart Association to promote heart healthy lifestyles. We have great results. Since Go Red for Women started in 2004, more than 627,000 women’s lives have been saved, and I am so proud that I was an initiator and supporter of Go Red for Women in my great State of Ohio in the capital city of Columbus. Yes, we have made great progress, Mr. Speaker, but we still have a long way to go in helping to prevent cardiovascular disease, including stroke. Cardiovascular diseases claim more lives each year than all forms of cancer combined, and it is just not women, Mr. Speaker. That includes men, also. However, women do have a higher risk of stroke than their male counterparts. In fact, 90 percent of all women have one or more risk factors for developing heart disease. Collectively, cardiovascular disease and stroke cause one in three women’s death each year, killing approximately one woman every minute. b1045 Yet, even with these eyecatching statistics, according to the American Heart Association, almost half of all the women, Mr. Speaker, are not aware of heart disease, and that it is the leading cause of death for women. For African American women like me, the risk of heart disease is far greater. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for African American women, killing almost 50,000 annually. Of African American women ages 20 and older, 49 percent have heart disease, but only 1 in 5 African American women believe they are personally at risk. Mr. Speaker, I was one of them. I suffered a cerebral brain stem stroke in 1999. But after my personal experience, I decided to do something about it. I decided to get more engaged, and I am so proud to say that I was appointed to serve on the American Heart Association Board, and at that time, I was the only nonhealthcare professional or cardiovascular physician on the board. That is why, Mr. Speaker, when I came to Congress, I decided that I would be engaged, and I became the co chair of the Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition, where my colleagues and I work very hard to raise the awareness about the prevalence and the severity of cardiovascular disease. Last Congress, Mr. Speaker, I introduced the Return to Work Awareness Act, which would assist survivors of stroke and other debilitating health occurrences to be able to return to work. Mr. Speaker, I will always be an active participant in education and awareness. I will reintroduce that important piece of legislation this month, during American Heart Month, and I invite all my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, to join me in sponsoring this piece of legislation. This month, as we celebrate American Heart Month, let us recommit ourselves to becoming more educated about cardiovascular diseases, improving our heart health, and continuing to fight against this devastating disease. Today, Mr. Speaker, I want the Nation to know that women will stand on the Capitol steps, and we will have our photo taken, all dressed in red, because we want to stand united to help educate this Nation, that if we stand together, maybe, just maybe, we can send a strong signal to America that we can fight against this disease. I want to personally thank Nancy Brown for allowing me to serve with her on the Board, and welcome the new CEO, Steven Houser, and so many of the volunteers across this Nation and the leaders because we know, Mr. Speaker, that we need to recognize all Americans who are battling heart disease and express gratitude to all of them. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 48 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day. There have been many prayers this day rising to You from those engaged in the political discourse of this Nation. We give You thanks for those who were able to gather at the National Prayer Breakfast and those across this land who joined their prayer intentions with the many who attended. Bless the Members of this people’s House now as they gather to do the legislative work they are called to do. May their prayers this day be authentic and heard by You, the living God. May their work be fruitful and beneficial to those whom You favor, the poor. And may all they do be done in humility and charity, knowing that we are all earthen vessels through whom Your Spirit might shine forth. And, finally, may all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the DREAMers, Immigrants, Refugees—or DIRe—Legal Aid Act. This bill will fund legal services to protect them from the recent executive orders. In my district last week, I held an immigration town hall. The place was packed with people who were afraid for their neighbors and afraid for our communities, and this was before the executive order was released. When I was at LAX this past Saturday evening, I saw the fear escalate. President Trump’s executive orders directly challenge the due process rights that are guaranteed to all of us under the Constitution. My legislation will help DREAMers, immigrants, and refugees have access to legal representation. Refugees are already vetted by the State Department, and the State Department does a very good job. If we want to do extreme vetting, let’s do it right, and let’s do it legally. If we wish to remain a beacon of freedom to the world, we must stand up for immigrants and refugees who look to America as a place of hope. We can’t just claim we are the greatest Nation in the world—we have to be the greatest Nation in the world. 
MICHIGAN ON THE FOREFRONT OF AUTOMOTIVE AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight an exciting, new development that builds on Michigan’s leadership in the auto industry. Earlier this week, General Motors and Honda announced a joint venture to produce an advanced hydrogen fuel cell system. With an investment of $85 million, this operation will bring new, goodpaying jobs, and it will be based at a manufacturing facility in southeast Michigan. This is just the latest example of how Michigan continues to be on the forefront of automotive and technological innovation that has the potential to revolutionize the industry. Mr. Speaker, that is not all. A few weeks ago, GM also announced a plan to invest an additional $1 billion in United States manufacturing, which will create thousands of jobs for American workers. With our State’s worldclass workforce and commitment to cuttingedge research, Michigan will remain a global automotive leader for generations to come. SLEEP APNEA IN THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY (Mr. SIRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the grave consequences that undetected obstructive sleep apnea has on safety in the railroad industry. Obstructive sleep apnea is caused by the obstruction of the airway during sleep. Untreated sleep apnea can cause unintended sleep episodes that may result in attention deficits and in a loss of situational awareness. It is a serious safety concern in railroading and has been a factor in numerous crashes: The September New Jersey Transit crash in Hoboken, New Jersey, was operated by an engineer with undiagnosed sleep apnea; In April 2011, a BNSF coal train collided with a standing train in Iowa that resulted in the deaths of two crew members. Medical records showed that both crew members had multiple risk factors for sleep apnea; In December 2013, a MetroNorth Railroad passenger train derailed, killing four passengers and injuring 60. The engineer feel asleep due to undiagnosed sleep apnea. I am pleased that the Federal Railroad Administration finally released a safety advisory that calls for railroads to screen train operators for sleep apnea, and I hope it is instituted quickly. f 
REMEMBERING DESSEY L. KUHLKE (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Augusta community mourned the loss of a legend in the business community—Dessey Landrum Kuhlke. Dessey was the most caring and selfless leader I had ever known. As a longtime resident of the area, Dessey graduated from Georgia Southern University and served in the United States Army from 1959 to 1965. I was fortunate enough to work for him and with him during my 35year career in construction and the development industry. I had the opportunity to serve alongside him in the Augusta Exchange Club and sit in front of him on Sundays at Trinity on the Hill United Methodist Church. Dessey was a husband, a father, a grandfather, a friend, and a mentor to many in our community. He and his wife, Barbara, lost two of their children at a young age, and Dessey was the rock that held that family together. Mr. Speaker, I have recently lost two of my heroes: Arnold Palmer in September and Dessey Kuhlke last week. But through the loss, I can’t help but smile when I think about the possibility of those two getting together with family in Heaven and playing a round of golf. Augusta is a better place because of Dessey Kuhlke. We will remember him often. f 
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF BUFFALO’S HISTORIC COLORED MUSICIANS CLUB (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, as the Nation recognizes Black History Month, I rise to pay tribute to a special history in my western New York community. This Friday marks the 100th anniversary of the opening of Buffalo’s historic Colored Musicians Club. The club’s origin stretches back to 1917 when a group of African American musicians sought to create its own safe haven in a then segregated community. They banded together, organized, and started Local 533 of the American Federation of Musicians. Some of the world’s most prolific jazz musicians have performed at the club. The likes of Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, and Ella Fitzgerald all impressed crowds in the building near the corner of Broadway and Michigan. Through the years, the Colored Musicians Club has become an important community and cultural center, featuring a museum to educate new generations of the club’s key role in Buffalo and our country’s history. As this landmark celebrates a century of work, we support its continued success and celebrate the example it sets in advancing the coming together of community and culture. 
HONORING FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TOM BARLOW (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Thomas Jefferson Barlow, III—a former Member of this honorable body—who passed away on Tuesday, January 31, at the age of 76. Mr. Barlow, a Democrat, represented the citizens of Kentucky’s First Congressional District from January 3, 1993, until January 3, 1995. Mr. Barlow was a tremendous public servant who had a positive impact on thousands of people. He was dedicated to making lives better, but he never sought fame or glory. He got satisfaction in having his voice heard and in influencing public policy. He was born in Washington, D.C., but his family roots ran deep in Ballard County, Kentucky, where his ancestor and namesake, Thomas Jefferson Barlow, was an original settler in the town of Barlow. He grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland, and graduated from Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. In his political career and private life, he worked tirelessly to help the 
less fortunate, to create jobs, to improve the environment, and to improve education. His professional career included work in State government and as a business executive. Although he lost his reelection bid in 1994, he was not discouraged and continued to make his voice heard by running for additional races for the House and the U.S. Senate. In fact, he used the same vehicle in all of his campaigns, and its odometer topped 400,000 miles when it finally wore out after 13 years. He was always outspoken and stood up for what he felt was right even if it was in opposition to his own political party’s views. He lived with his wife of 28 years, Shirley Pippin Barlow, in Paducah, Kentucky, where he was a former director of the River City Mission, which helped homeless people get on their feet, and the Lone Oak Kiwanis Club. He was also an active member of the Grace United Methodist Church in La Center, Kentucky. I ask my colleagues to join me in sending condolences to the Barlow family. 
REFUGEE BAN (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, 2015: ‘‘Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.’’—Governor MIKEPENCE . 2016: ‘‘A religious test for entering our country is not reflective of our fundamental values. I reject it.’’—Speaker PAULRYAN. 2017: Acceptance from both PENCE  and RYAN. What has changed? This unconstitutional executive order and its hasty implementation has created chaos and confusion at our Nation’s airports. With the stroke of a pen, President Trump negligently and shamefully turned his back on thousands of desperate men, women, and children who were fleeing war zones. Green card holders and visa card holders who have been denied entry and detained for hours have dominated our news. This is not who we are. This ban will make America safer. That is an alternative fact. This ban emboldens our enemies, serves as a recruitment tool for terrorists, and puts our servicemembers in the Middle East in greater danger. That is fact. I urge my Republican colleagues to speak out just like they did in 2015 and 2016. We can’t afford your silence. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate National Catholic Schools Week. America’s Catholic schools educate over 2 million students from diverse backgrounds each year, effectively preparing them for a brighter future and instilling in them faithfilled values. Data show that Catholic schools are often the highestperforming educational institutions in our communities. In fact, 99 percent of students from Catholic schools graduate from high school. This week, I applaud Catholic schools for making a difference with students throughout our country; I applaud the educators who invest in their students’ academic and spiritual formation; and I applaud the 28 Catholic grade schools and high schools that faithfully work in the 18th Congressional District of Illinois. Today I am a cosponsor of a resolution that expresses congressional support of Catholic schools for their invaluable contributions to students and families across America. It is with deep gratitude that I recognize those Catholic educators who are shaping the next generation. f 
b1215 PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 36, PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A FINAL RULE OF THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 37, DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, AND THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 74 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 74 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 36) providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the final rule of the Bureau of Land Management relating to ‘‘Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation’’. All points of order against consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources; and (2) one motion to recommit. SEC. 2. Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 37) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation. All points of order against consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; and (2) one motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana). The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of two important measures, which would overturn two significant onerous regulations finalized in the waning days of the Obama administration. First, the resolution provides for the consideration of H.J. Res. 36, providing for congressional disapproval of the so called BLM methane rule. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee and provides for a motion to recommit. In addition, the resolution provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 37, providing for congressional disapproval of the socalled blacklisting rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and provides for a motion to recommit. Mr. Speaker, burdensome regulations are crippling our businesses. The Obama administration finalized 38 major rules between election day and inauguration day. It is estimated those rules will cost our economy $41.2 billion. Sadly, this was just par for the course with the previous administration. In 2016, the Obama administration finalized over 400 regulations at a cost of over $160 billion to the economy. Over the entire Obama Presidency, over 3,000 regulations, at a cost of $873.6 billion, were finalized. I am heartened by President Trump’s regulatory freeze, which has been estimated to save over $180 billion in regulatory costs, followed by his executive order which aims to revoke two regulations for every new regulation put forward. 
Specifically, H.J. Res. 36 overturns the BLM methane rule. The rule is a significant regulatory overreach by the Bureau of Land Management. Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to regulate methane emissions, which it currently does. Instead, the BLM has decided to also assert authority over methane in a way that is both duplicative and unnecessary, yet has significant negative impact on jobs, energy production, and Federal, State, and local revenues. Mr. Speaker, this is a regulation in search of a problem. According to a 2015 EPA study, methane emissions from both natural gas systems and crude oil production have fallen by significant margin, even while oil and natural gas production have exploded. The BLM flaring rule is both costly and unnecessary. The second rule considered by this resolution is similarly a solution in search of a problem. For decades, the Federal Government has had a suspension and debarment process in place to deny Federal contracts to bad actors who violate basic worker protections. However, President Obama signed an executive order directing various agencies to add another layer of bureaucracy onto the Federal procurement system. Prior to awarding a contract, each agency’s contracting officer and a newly created labor compliance adviser will be required to review both violations and alleged violations to determine whether an employer should be awarded a Federal contract. Even the courts have agreed this is overreach. In October of 2016, a Federal district judge blocked enforcement of these rules, citing concerns with the violation of due process rights and executive overreach. For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we prevent implementation of these rules which are unnecessary and add even more regulatory burdens to our struggling businesses and anemic economy. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and the underlying legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in opposition to this rule and the underlying resolutions. The resolutions that this rule provides consideration for threaten our air and don’t protect the American people. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that somehow repealing these rules will create jobs. It will actually destroy jobs, jobs that are associated with recapturing methane. This is what a methane flare looks like. I drive by them in Colorado, and the potential for capturing, rather than flaring that methane, is important for the quality of our air and to reduce our emissions. The House majority has made it their priority to instill fear and uncertainty in hardworking American families. People, who come here legally on visas who have lived here for many years, even small businesses, rather than focusing on jobs or having constructive conversations about immigration, are worried about their employees and, in some cases, even their owners being deported or not allowed back after conducting business overseas. Republicans apparently would rather help shield large corporations from transparency, eliminate regulations that protect families from water and air pollution, and require companies to follow wage rules. To add to this uncertainty and fear, President Trump has signed an executive order already that bans refugees and citizens from predominantly Muslim countries. Well, America is a nation of immigrants—those who fled political and religious persecution, violence in their home countries, and those seeking to build a family in a country that values freedom and upholds civil rights. Our new President has decided that the best use of taxpayer money is to build a wall on our southern border. Our President has used his first 2 weeks in office to generate fear and uncertainty among vulnerable households who may lose their health insurance rather than create jobs and improve our economy. The new President has even limited the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to communicate with the public about things like methane flaring. The two Congressional Review Act resolutions we are discussing today— like the previous ones that, I should point out, do not follow regular order— they didn’t receive any hearings in this Congress. They were a closed rule with no amendments allowed. I offered two amendments to the methane rule amendment. Neither were allowed to even be debated on this floor of this House, no less adopted. I would like to quote from Speaker RYANwhen he took the gavel in October of 2015. He said: ‘‘We need to let every member contribute—not once they have earned their stripes, but right now.’’ In a further quote, Speaker RYANsaid: ‘‘The committees should retake the lead in drafting all major legislation. If you know the issue, you should write the bill. Open up the process.’’ ‘‘In other words, we need to return to regular order.’’ Yet, here we are again with two CRAs that did not come through regular order, did not have a hearing with no opportunity for Members on either side of the aisle, Democrats or Republicans, with good ideas to make these pieces of legislation any better. Apparently, Speaker RYAN’s commitment doesn’t apply to CRAs or issues that keep our air and water clean or protect workers. I would like to ask that Speaker RYANexplain to his colleagues how he is sticking to his commitment of regular order and to clarify what that means. Not one amendment was allowed to be heard on the floor on either of these bills. This is a closed rule, including two of mine. First, let’s talk about the methane waste rule. It is very important to my constituents where fracking has worsened the quality of the air and upset neighborhoods across my district in Colorado. b1230 The first amendment offered in the Rules Committee was to the methane waste rule, and it would have added Bureau of Land Management scientific findings. It would offer transparency and truth to this Congressional Review Act, providing facts about methane, methane waste, and why it is necessary for this rule to be moved forward. Without this rule, we would be seeing a lot more of this in areas like my district and my State. In the last few weeks, a war on science has been begun by this administration. If we support facts, then we should let facts speak for themselves and be as objective as possible. We should have allowed that amendment which would have listed the scientific truths around methane and this rule. Scientific facts are clear. The current rule would supply energy for up to 740,000 more households per year. Rather than burn that methane into the atmosphere, we can actually provide energy for 740,000 more households; and that methane is 25 times more dangerous and potent as carbon dioxide for worsening the impact of global warming. Even if you want to ignore the energy impact of helping more Americans have power or the climate impacts of increasing climate change, if we look at this rule from a jobs perspective, this CRA would destroy American jobs. I would like to explain how this methane waste CRA rule will affect the jobs of thousands of employees of the more than 70 companies headquartered in the U.S. that provide services and equipment to identify and capture natural gas and methane leaking from pipelines, processing equipment, and wells, including many in my home State of Colorado. This rule directly threatens the livelihood of many businesses and employees in my home State. If, for some strange reason, the job creation argument isn’t enough for you, how about the hundreds of millions of dollars American taxpayers would collect over the next decade from additional royalties? Oil and gas companies are required to pay for the methane they collect and sell from public lands, and the more that is captured rather than burned off, the better not only for the companies and the employees, but also for taxpayers as we try to reduce our budget deficit. An estimated $140 million in royalties over the next decade would be lost if this CRA moves forward. That is $140 million more in deficit spending that this rule signifies if it were to pass, and 
that is why it is opposed by Taxpayers for Common Sense and most other fiscally conservative groups. Again, if job creation, science, and taxpayer savings aren’t enough, how about the cancercausing impacts, carcinogenic effects, of oil and gas drilling? Stacy Lambright lives in Thornton, Colorado, near my district with her husband, Eric, and her two kids, Jack and Molly. Stacy became a community activist and a member of Moms Clean Air Force after she found out her neighborhood park frequented by children and families was directly next to a leaking oil and gas fracking well. Stacy and her family have been living in the neighborhood for over 14 years, and they have started to experience health concerns after oil and gas drillers moved in. Since 2015, Stacy’s been documenting an unusual amount of nosebleeds in her family. Just as recently as Monday, her daughter had a nosebleed, while her son had six nosebleeds last month, something they never had before. And Stacy’s husband’s asthma has significantly increased. They have lived in the neighborhood for 14 years and only recently, since the drilling occurred, have they had these health impacts. There have been no changes in their home or surrounding neighborhood other than the increased amount of fracking and oil and gas wells and leaks, documented leaks, to existing wells. This methane rule further threatens the health of constituents as we gather additional data, and that is why Stacy is advocating for stronger legislation and better management practices, not worse management practices, with regard to existing oil and gas wells. The safety and health of Stacy’s family should be a top priority for Congress, but it appears, instead, the Republicans’ top priority in this resolution is bringing us back to a time when our water is polluted, our skies are smoggy, and health issues from dirty air are a burden for families. I know it has been argued—we probably will again—that oil and gas companies are fixing and capping leaks on their own, but that is false. There is a massive amount of gas leaked every day, and these companies have not reduced methane emissions from the field one bit. Again, absent this rule, we will see more of this kind of activity, not less. Another argument is that infrastructure, like pipelines, is important to prevent methane flaring. And of course that is true, but a GAO report says that only 9 percent of venting and flaring is due to the lack of infrastructure, so it is only a small part of the overall issue. And, by the way, this rule doesn’t block or in any way impede any new infrastructure projects, and more infrastructure alone clearly won’t solve the problem of leaking wells and flaring methane. The issue of leaking methane, in particular, is partially addressed by this rule, which, by the way, doesn’t go far enough. However, what they wrote has been proven to work in creating jobs and cleaning up our air. In Colorado, we have a methane rule that, frankly, this rule is largely based on, and I know it has worked in Colorado. And while we need to do a lot better in my home State, at least some level of baseline can work for the whole country. Oil production on Federal lands went up 28 percent between 2010 and 2015 under the Obama administration. There is no question that BLM has and still has authority to regulate methane. It is a waste of taxpayer money, a misuse of our public lands to do anything other than to reduce our methane emissions. Just as an aside, the benefits of this rule include increased job creation, cleaner air, healthier families, and the climate. BLM was extraordinarily conscientious when drafting this rule. They held eight public forums. They extended the comment period for 75 days. Over 300,000 public comments were collected and addressed. The BLM’s methane rule was done out in the open with public input as opposed to, by the way, this process, which was done behind closed doors, without a public hearing, and didn’t even have a committee hearing. It doesn’t make sense to use the CRA to repeal this BLM methane rule. This BLM methane rule creates jobs, protects our families, saves taxpayer money, and reduces our budget deficit. The second amendment I offered got to the heart of the problem with CRAs in general. Regardless of the rules that they are impacting, they are a reckless, blunt tool, and they are not the right instrument for honest, thoughtful legislating. If Congress has a problem with the authority under which the methane rule was issued, we should amend the statutory authority of the agency, not use a congressional resolution of disapproval. My other amendment simply said that the agency has the right and authority to write a rule impacting this issue which, otherwise, the CRA could effectively prevent; and due to that uncertainty, passing the CRA creates even more uncertainty for the industry. As the Denver Post, a newspaper that has endorsed dozens of Republicans over the last few years, said in regards to this methane waste rule: ‘‘Congress is getting ready to use an ax where it needs a scalpel.’’ The Congressional Review Act is one of the most ridiculous tools to be used by Congress, and, regardless of whether you disagree or agree with the policy, the better way to approach it would be to amend the statutory authority of the agency to make it clear whether they have the authority to issue this kind of rule and under what conditions. While we may disagree on that, and we may be able to offer and bring to the floor amendments regarding agency authority, that is the appropriate venue for this discussion. Let’s move on to the other bill under this rule, the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces bill. My Republican colleagues continue to refer to this order as a problematic order. Unfortunately, it is another attempt to mislead the American people. This is a tactic the Republican elite have called ‘‘providing alternative facts.’’ The rule under CRA today comes from the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order, and it is sorely needed legislation. What this rule says is, if you are a company that consistently breaks the law, without regard for your workplace, workers, taxpayers, or the community, you should not receive millions of dollars in taxpayer contracts. It makes common sense to me. If you are abusing workers, have engaged in tax fraud, why would we want to contract with you with our taxpayer dollars? Companies that cut corners in safety or fair pay, dozens of other areas, shouldn’t get to compete for our taxpayer money against good actors and companies that play by the rules. Everybody needs to start from a level playing field. Now, to be clear, there are only a few bad actors. The vast majority of companies have no issue at all with this rule. But unscrupulous actors who have ignored the law, violated the law, cut corners, should not be rewarded; and, to this day, there are a few bad actors that continue to receive billions of dollars of your taxpayer money in Federal contracts. In 2010, a GAO report proved that there was a problem. GAO investigated 15 Federal contractors cited for violating hundreds of Federal labor laws enforced by the Department of Labor, OSHA, and the National Labor Relations Board. The Federal Government awarded these 15 Federal contractors over $6 billion in government contract obligations, your money going to known violators in 2009 alone. How about that for waste, fraud, and abuse? Now, look, I don’t know about my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but fiscal responsibility is core to my beliefs as a Member of Congress. That is why I am a proud cosponsor of an amendment to require a balanced budget. I believe in the value of hard work and personal responsibility. If we know a company is cutting corners, taking the easy way out, and avoiding the responsibility of the law, why would we reward them with your money? Organizations throughout the country, representing a diverse group of stakeholders, agree. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Service Employees International Union 
all join me in opposition to this Congressional Review Act. They recognize the value of hard work. They don’t support companies who cheat. I don’t know why my Republicans colleagues do. This rule modernizes an antiquated system. Right now it is virtually impossible for procurement officials to know if company A has had any violations when they are up against company B for a contract. If company A has been cheating workers out of overtime and that allows them to underbid Company B, they shouldn’t get the contract and be rewarded for violating the law. This executive order will increase coordination, simplification, access to information, and streamline the system. This executive order does not set up any way for companies to be banned or disbarred. That process has always existed and will still exist alongside this as a separate, independent process. In fact, what this process does is it provides a remedial path for companies to right the ship, to get right with the law, to be eligible, once again, for Federal contracts. A simple or rare mistake should, of course, not bar a company from participating in the Federal recruitment process. Instead, companies with repeated and excessive transgressions should be helped to follow the law and create a better workplace and be rewarded to be better stewards of taxpayers dollars. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Not surprisingly, my friend and I have a number of disagreements on the wisdom of getting rid of these particular regulations. We do agree on the importance of actually capturing methane gases. Frankly, my friend is right. That is a profitable thing, and most companies try to do it on their own. We do, frankly, need more infrastructure in this area, no question about that. The BLM has been less than cooperative in allowing that infrastructure to be built on Federal land, and that has made this problem more difficult than it needs to be. But it is important to recognize, overall, the amount of methane gas that actually escapes has gone down steadily and, frankly, dramatically, even as production has moved up. So additional regulation is unlikely to change that process. It may actually complicate it. In terms of where the appropriate authority lies, again, I would just remind my friend, as he knows, the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to do this. So if it felt like it needed it, it could. The BLM has actually moved into a new area beyond its traditional jurisdiction because it does not have authority, under the Clean Air Act, to draft these kind of rules and regulations. The Clean Air Act, again, is already in place. The EPA has the authority. If we need to do something, let’s do it. In terms of the disbarment procedure for contractors, what we have is already awfully robust. Almost 2,000 firms, or on 2,000 occasions, companies were disbarred in 2015 from Federal contracting work. It was the same in 2014. So there is something in place. We don’t need additional regulatory expense, additional people working for the government. We can rely on the procedures we already have. My friend is concerned about the lack of hearings. I would remind him, while we haven’t had hearings on these items in this Congress, we certainly did on both of them in the last Congress, in some cases, multiple hearings. There is not any need to rehash and go over the same ground, in my view. Finally, in terms of just the process itself, the Congressional Review Act actually limits the form in which these sorts of things can be brought forward. If amendments are made in order, frankly, the item loses its privilege in the United States Senate, which, obviously, changes the speed at which you can move and perhaps even the number of votes that are required to actually move forward. So we think, again, these are items that have been explored, looked at, debated. The evidence is pretty clear. We think it is important to move quickly in these areas, and I would urge the body to do so. Adopt the rule. Support the underlying legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ). Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. What does this rule do? It enables the repeal of protections for American workers. These are regulations that ensure that Federal contractors must disclose labor violations across 14 basic labor laws. b1245 Our Federal contractors employ approximately 28 million workers, and while the vast majority of contractors are in compliance, unfortunately, every year American workers are denied their overtime wages, they are discriminated against for their gender, or their age, or had their health and their safety put at risk. Why is this Republican majority working so hard to ensure that billions of taxpayer dollars continue to go to contractors that cheat their workers? This executive order targets those bad actors and the most egregious cases. The intention of the executive order was to encourage compliance with the law and level the playing field for contractors who are playing by the rules. If there are no violations, bidders simply check a box. What should we be doing here in this body? We should be increasing worker protections, not demeaning them or decreasing them. The more than one in five Americans who would be affected should be protected by our labor laws. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to make a couple of good points. Remember, my friends, disbarment is already a very common procedure. It was invoked over 2,000 times. So having another regulatory hurdle and hoop to jump through, just simply isn’t necessary. Again, these regulations were, frankly, generated in the final waning months of the Obama administration. They haven’t been in action, and there is sort of a regulatory fit. It is not, by the way, unusual for just the last administration. All administrations have this tendency near the end, and that is one of the reasons why we have the Congressional Review Act in the first place, so that when administrations, in their waning days, decide they want to leave difficult situations or push through things that they didn’t see fit to do over an 8year period, Congress can expeditiously make sure that those regulations aren’t put in place and businesses are forced to begin to comply with them. As I pointed out in my opening remarks, the regulations released by the last administration—over 3,000 of them in an 8year period—cost the economy over $870 billion. The regulations that were issued between election day and Inauguration Day cost the economy over $40 billion. That is real money. That is real investment that could go elsewhere and could hire people. So I would think that these, along with the other Congressional Review Act bills that will be coming forward, and have already come forward, will actually give the economy a much needed shot in the arm, will help stimulate job creation and movement, and we have a timeframe in which we have to operate. So if we actually followed all of the procedures my friend suggested, many of these regulations, frankly, would never get reviewed before they went on the books. So it is better to act quickly. I think it is better for American business. Again, I urge the support of the rule and the underlying legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. I am prepared to close if the gentleman doesn’t have any remaining speakers. Mr. COLE. I am certainly prepared to close. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. First of all, the gentleman from Oklahoma referenced that these have been the subject of hearings. I would point out that there are over 50 new Members of this body who were not part of the last Congress who have not had a chance to look at it. And there has been time. They could have had hearings and markups last week or the week before 
prior to these bills coming to the floor. I just came from a hearing in one my committees today. So they certainly could have been done consistent with the timeline, had that been the desire. But, again, the better approach, the correct approach, would be to amend or change the authorities of the authorizing agency for these rules, rather than use the CRA process. Mr. Speaker, President Trump’s immoral and unconstitutional executive order banning Syrian refugees and suspending immigration from many countries is an attack on our core American values as a nation of law and a nation of immigrants. This callous indifference of human suffering not only has tarnished and hurt our image abroad but harmed our national security by alienating allies and providing terrorist groups with new recruiting tools. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative LOFGREN ’s bill to overturn and defund this dangerous executive order. Let me be perfectly clear for people watching what this vote means. A ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question gives us the opportunity to overturn this order and bring up Representative LOFGREN ’s bill. A ‘‘yes’’ vote means the House will continue to do nothing to stop President Trump’s executive action and, instead, choose with allowing more methane to be spewed into the atmosphere. This will be the third such vote the House takes this week, and, so far, every vote cast by a Republican Member in Congress has been in favor of turning a blind eye to President Trump’s unconstitutional and dangerous order. The American people should take notice and insist that their elected Representatives vote ‘‘no’’ and reject this administration’s disgraceful policy. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment into the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. POLIS. The fact that these CRA proposals that we have before us have not gone through any sort of special order, regular order; the fact that CRAs are cumbersome and reckless tools; and the fact that all they do is take away protections from our air and from our workers should make it easy for every Member of this body to join me in voting ‘‘no’’ on this rule and on the underlying bills. We should be keeping regulations and standards predictable that put Americans at the top of our priority list, not oil and gas companies, and not companies that are bad actors and violate our law by refusing to pay overtime to their workers. We should value clean air, and we should value companies that play by the rules. We should value regulations that protect our taxpayer dollars rather than increase our deficit by $140 million. We can do all of these things by simply defeating this rule and defeating the underlying bills. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question, ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and ‘‘no’’ on the underlying bills. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank my friend. As always, he is always thoughtful, always a good person to hold a debate and a conversation with. On this one, we simply disagree. My friend referenced some of the ‘‘conservative groups’’ that are supporting the maintenance of the flaring rule, the BLM. Just for the record, I want to add some that I am actually more familiar with: the Americans for Tax Reform, Citizens Against Government Waste, Americans for Prosperity, and Taxpayers Protection Alliance. All of those are in favor of the repeal of this regulation, and all of them think it will actually save businesses money and increase activity as opposed to the regulation which we think actually discourages economic activity. Again, these are regulations—in both cases, they were adopted in the final waning days of the administration. These are things that Congress had serious doubts against, but, obviously, couldn’t override an administration when they were in office. The Congressional Review Act itself is done, so we can do this sort of exercise after an administration leaves, and actually go back and undo some of the damage that I think is routinely done by both parties in their waning days, when they would actually be better off to just simply let the new people get into their jobs and actually go about their business. We have appropriate regulatory authority in both of these areas. Again, the Environmental Protection Agency has the power under the Clean Air Act to issue whatever regulations it cares to on methane. And here, frankly, we ought to pat business on the back because, as we have increased production of both oil and natural gas, methane has consistently gone down dramatically and steadily over the years. I suspect that process will continue with or without the regulation of the Federal Government because, quite frankly, it makes good business sense. And, quite frankly, most people in private business want to be good stewards to the environment. They are not out to try and damage our air or our water. The same thing is true in terms of bad actors—and there certainly are some bad actors—that engage in activities that are inappropriate for Federal contractors who violate the law. That is why, under current law, almost 2,000 companies were disbarred in 2015; a similar number in 2014. So, again, what we have in place appears to be working. Why we would create an additional hurdle, hire additional people, and force companies to do additional paperwork is beyond me. I don’t think it is the wise thing to do; I don’t think it is the necessary thing to do. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support the rule. H.J. Res. 36 and H.J. Res. 37 both undo regulations that should never have been made in the first place. By preventing the implementation of these onerous, duplicative regulations, we will relieve the burdens faced by American small business. The material previously referred to by Mr. POLIS is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 74 O FFERED BY  MR. POLIS At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 724) to provide that the Executive Order entitled ‘‘Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States’’ (January 27, 2017), shall have no force or effect, to prohibit the use of Federal funds to enforce the Executive Order, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 724. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s 
ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 71, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 40) providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Social Security Administration relating to Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, 
and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 71, the joint resolution is considered read. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: 
H.J. R ES. 40 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Social Security Administration relating to Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (published at 81 Fed. Reg. 91702 (December 19, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force or effect. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The joint resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their designees. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials to H.J. Res. 40. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 40, a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the rules submitted by the Social Security Administration relating to implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. On December 19, 2016, in the waning days of the previous administration, the Social Security Administration published a rule finalizing the criteria for sending the names of certain Social Security beneficiaries to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS. Under the rule, an individual’s name will be sent to the NICS if they receive disability insurance or supplemental security income benefits based on having a mental disorder, the person is between age 18 and the full retirement age, and the SSA determines that the person needs a representative payee to manage their benefits. Individuals who meet these criteria would be prohibited from exercising their Second Amendment right to possess firearms. This rule is a slap in the face of those in the disabled community because it paints all those who suffer from mental disorders with the same broad brush. It assumes that simply because an individual suffers from a mental condition, that individual is unfit to exercise his or her Second Amendment rights. No data exists to support such an egregious assertion. In fact, studies show that those who suffer from mental disorders are more likely to be victims of crime rather than perpetrators of crime. Furthermore, there is a total absence of any meaningful due process protections under the rule. Currently, citizens lose their right to possess a firearm when they have been convicted by a judge or jury of a felony or misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, when they have been dishonorably discharged after given a hearing, or when they have been deemed a fugitive after being given an option to appear and avail themselves of their due process rights, among other reasons. b1345 All of these have one thing in common: they all provide due process to the affected individual. Under the SSA rule, the affected party has no ability to defend himself or to even introduce evidence before the SSA denies his right to possess a firearm. Additionally, at no time during the process during which the SSA is seeking to deny someone his Second Amendment rights must the Social Security Administration make a determination that the individual poses a risk to himself or others. This is the standard that has long been used to determine if the right to possess a firearm should be prohibited. Some may point to the rule’s appeals process as providing a form of due process. However, the appeals process is severely flawed because it puts the burden on individuals to prove that restoring their Second Amendment rights would not pose a danger to public safety or be contrary to the public interest. In every other instance in which someone is facing a loss of his ability to possess a firearm, the burden is on the government to prove that the individual should have his right taken away. Under this flawed system, the individual bears the burden against the government. This is not what due process looks like. During debate on the rule for this joint resolution, I heard a number of reasons from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle as to why they opposed this joint resolution. Quite frankly, I am shocked at what little regard they have for the disabled community. The gentleman from Massachusetts claimed that this joint resolution was done at the bidding of the National Rifle Association. Yes, the National Rifle Association does support H.J. Res. 40. However, what my colleague from Massachusetts failed to mention during the debate yesterday was who else supports the joint resolution. Supporters include the American Association of People with Disabilities, the National Disability Rights Network, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the Arc of the United States, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, the Disability Law Center of Alaska, the National Council on Independent Living, and the National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery. Even the National Council on Disability—an independent Federal agency that makes recommendations to the President and Congress to enhance the quality of life for all Americans with disabilities and their families—has called on Congress to utilize the Congressional Review Act in order to repeal this rule. It was also mentioned—and will, undoubtedly, be mentioned here later today—that this rule received over 91,000 comments. What they didn’t tell you, and what I am guessing they won’t tell you today, is that the overwhelming majority of the comments opposed the rule. Opposition wasn’t based on small, technical issues. It was based on the fundamentally flawed concept of the rule. Many of the organizations I mentioned earlier provided comments to the agency. Rather than listen to the organizations advocating for the rights of the disabled, the previous administration decided to ignore them. I thank the gentleman from the State of Texas (Mr. SAMJOHNSON ) for his hard work on this important issue that affects lawabiding citizens in every congressional district in America. I ask my colleagues to support this resolution—to stand with the disabled community and to stand with the Constitution. Support H.J. Res. 40. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous consent to yield the control of the balance of my time to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SAMJOHNSON ), the sponsor of this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 40, a measure that would vacate an important rule issued by the Social Security Administration to help reduce gun violence. This resolution of disapproval is particularly problematic because, pursuant to the Congressional Review Act, it would not only invalidate this rule but prohibit the agency from adopting substantially the same rule in the future, even an improved version of the rule. How unusual. As we consider this resolution today, I ask my colleagues to consider, for just a moment, how we arrived at this point and, more precisely, what is at stake. In 1968, after a decade of assassinations and gun violence, Congress worked to pass the Gun Control Act. That law lists certain categories of individuals who are prohibited from purchasing and possessing firearms, including felons, fugitives, those who 
have renounced their citizenship, those who have been dishonorably discharged, and also those ‘‘adjudicated mentally defective.’’ Today, we don’t commonly use that outdated and unfortunate terminology. Instead, we refer to the ‘‘Federal mental health prohibitor,’’ which remains an important—although challenging—feature of our Federal gun laws. Because it was common sense that we needed a system to help prevent guns from getting into the hands of those who were legally prohibited from possessing them, Congress took bipartisan action to enact the Brady Act in 1993. That statute established a National Instant Criminal Background Check System—some call it NICS—and it requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct checks on prospective purchasers in order to verify that they are not prohibited on the basis of the statutory categories. Although unwisely limited only to sales conducted by licensed gun dealers, the NICS system is extremely beneficial as far as it goes. Critically, however, this background check system is only as good as the completeness of the records it includes. This fact was tragically underscored in 2007, when a student on the campus of Virginia Tech shot and killed 32 people. The shooter had a mental health record that was serious enough that it should have been reported to the system, but it was not. As a result, Congress enacted the bipartisan NICS Improvement Amendments Act that same year in order to provide incentives for States to do a better job of submitting disqualifying mental health records to the system. The law also requires Federal agencies to submit any such information that they have. While some States have done a great job of complying with the law, others have not, which remains a critical challenge. As we expect States to do more to comply, we must also ensure Federal agencies are doing their part. The rule under consideration, which was finalized last December after an extensive rulemaking process that considered more than 91,000 comments from the public, is intended to impact only a very narrow range of individuals whom the agency determines should be prohibited from possessing firearms under the statutory mental health prohibitor, which has been the law for decades. The rule applies only to those individuals who have a very severe, longterm mental disorder that makes them unable to do any kind of work in the American economy, including even part time or at very low wages. These individuals must have been determined through an evaluation of all of the evidence that they are not capable of managing their own benefits and must be assigned a representative payee. This designation is given only after an individual is notified orally and in writing at the outset of the process that the gun eligibility determination would be the result of the assignment of a representative payee. After the determination is made, the affected individuals may appeal the decision to the agency and then, ultimately, to a Federal court. Of course, we must avoid taking actions that would unfairly stigmatize individuals who suffer from mental illness or a disability. This is true in many respects, but, with regard to issues of public safety, we must recognize that people who suffer from mental illness should not be assumed to be dangerous. In fact, they are much more likely to be victims of crime than to be perpetrators. With those considerations in mind, my colleagues, it can be difficult to apply the mental health prohibitor, but, still, we must apply and enforce the law. If I were proposing such a rule, I cannot say whether this process would be exactly what I would recommend. We have not held hearings on this issue, and we have not had the chance to examine all appropriate considerations. I can say that the agency has undertaken a commendable effort in accordance with President Obama’s directive to ensure that the NICS background check system has the information that it believes, after a thorough rulemaking process, corresponds to a longstanding category of firearms prohibition. Accordingly, we should not completely disregard the agency’s efforts, and I urge my colleagues to strenuously oppose H.J. Res. 40. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Former President Obama was never a champion of the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. He fought to deny Americans their constitutional rights throughout his whole 8 years in office. In fact, on his way out the door, former President Obama finalized a rule that discriminates against individuals with disabilities and that deprives lawabiding Americans of their Second Amendment rights. Under this rule, certain Social Security disability beneficiaries, who also need help, would be stripped of their Second Amendment rights. More specifically, their names would be reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Mr. Speaker, just because someone has a disability does not mean he is a threat to society. Furthermore, needing help to manage your benefit does not make you dangerous; but you don’t have to take my word for it as the disability community has also raised serious concerns with regard to this rule. The National Council on Disability, which is the independent agency that is charged with advising Congress and the President on disability policy, said: ‘‘There is, simply put, no nexus between the inability to manage money and the ability to safely and responsibly own, possess or use a firearm.’’ In addition, Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD many letters of support I have received for my bill from one of the disability community’s Second Amendment groups and civil rights groups and others. 
NATIONAL COUNCIL ON DISABILITY , Washington, DC, January 24, 2017. Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL , Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL AND  SPEAKER RYAN: I write on behalf of the National Council on Disability (NCD) regarding the final rule the Social Security Administration (SSA) released on December 19th, 2016, implementing provisions of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, 81 FR 91702. In accordance with our mandate to advise the President, Congress, and other federal agencies regarding policies, programs, practices, and procedures that affect people with disabilities, NCD submitted comments to SSA on the proposed rule on June 30th, 2016. In our comments, we cautioned against implementation of the proposed rule because: ‘‘[t]here is, simply put, no nexus between the inability to manage money and the ability to safely and responsibly own, possess or use a firearm. This arbitrary linkage not only unnecessarily and unreasonably deprives individuals with disabilities of a constitutional right, it increases the stigma for those who, due to their disabilities, may need a representative payee[.]’’ Despite our objections and that of many other individuals and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed rule, the final rule released in late December was largely unchanged. Because of the importance of the constitutional right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule legitimizes, NCD recommends that Congress consider utilizing the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal this rule. NCD is a nonpartisan, independent federal agency with no stated position with respect to gunownership or guncontrol other than our longheld position that restrictions on gun possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon. Additionally, it is critically important that any restriction on gun possession or ownership on this basis is imposed only after the individual has been afforded due process and given an opportunity to respond to allegations that they are not able to safely possess or own a firearm due to his or her disability. NCD believes that SSA’s final rule falls far short of meeting these criteria. Additionally, as NCD also cautioned SSA in our comments on the proposed rule, we have concerns regarding the ability of SSA to fairly and effectively implement this rule—assuming it would be possible to do so—given the longstanding issues SSA already has regarding long delays in adjudication and difficulty in providing consistent, prompt service to beneficiaries with respect to its core mission. This rule creates an entirely new function for an agency that has long noted that it has not been given sufficient resources to do the important work it is already charged with doing. With all due respect to SSA, our federal partner, this rule is simply a bridge too far. In fact, it is conceivable that attempts to implement this rule may strain the already scarce administrative resources available to the agency, 
further impairing its ability to carry out its core mission. The CRA is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory overreach, and NCD urges its use advisedly and cautiously. In this particular case, the potential for real harm to the constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to undermine the essential mission of an agency that millions of people with and without disabilities rely upon to meet their basic needs. Therefore, in this instance, NCD feels that utilizing the CRA to repeal the final rule is not only warranted, but necessary. Regards, CLYDE E. T ERRY , Chair. 
OFAMERICA , Fairfax, VA. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , House Minority Leader, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN AND MINORITY LEADER  PELOSI : I am writing on behalf of the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action (NRA–ILA) to urge you to vote yes on H.J. Res. 40. This measure is a joint resolution to disapprove, under the Congressional Review Act, a Social Security Administration (SSA) rule that would result in hundreds of thousands of lawabiding Americans permanently losing their Second Amendment rights. SSA claims its rule was mandated by the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA), as interpreted by the Obama administration’s Department of Justice. The supposed intent of the rule is for SSA to identify disability or Supplementary Security Income beneficiaries who qualify as prohibited ‘‘mental defectives’’ under the Gun Control Act (GCA) and report them to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). NICS came online nearly 20 years ago, but at no point before this new regulation did SSA consider its own operations or decisions as somehow implicated by the prohibitions in the GCA. Clearly this was not provoked because of the NIAA or because of changes in the SSA’s own procedures, but because of the antigun politics of the Obama administration. President Obama made clear that if Congress would not support his desire for increased gun control, he would act on his own. That’s why he issued this proposal in the final days of his administration. The SSA received over 91,000 comments in response to its proposed rule, the overwhelming majority of them in opposition. Comments submitted by NRA–ILA explained in detail how the rule misread the underlying statutes; ignored binding case law; targeted harmless individuals who do not pose a risk of harm; violated due process; and hijacked the SSA’s legitimate functions for political purposes. Our opposition was joined by mental health professionals and advocates for the mentally ill, who argued that the proposal was not supported by evidence or science; added to the stigma of mental illness; and created disincentives for mentally ill persons to seek help and benefits to which they are entitled. Reporting lawabiding, nondangerous individuals to NICS and forcing them, as a condition of removal, to prove they are not a threat to society is inconsistent with the GCA, the Second Amendment and basic due process. For these reasons, the NRA strongly supports H.J. Res. 40. Because of the importance of this issue to NRA members and gun owners throughout the country, votes on H.J. Res. 40 will be considered in future candidate evaluations and we will notify our members accordingly. Sincerely, CHRIS W. C OX. 
NATIONAL COALITION FOR  MENTAL HEALTH RECOVERY , Washington, DC, January 29, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Office of the Democratic Leader, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : I write on behalf of the National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery (NCMHR) regarding the final rule the Social Security Administration (SSA) released on December 19th, 2016, implementing provisions of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, 81 FR 91702. NCMHR submitted comments to SSA on the proposed rule in June 2016. In our comments, we cautioned against implementation of the proposed rule because there is no causal connection between the inability to manage money and the ability to safely and responsibly own, possess or use a firearm. This arbitrary linkage not only unnecessarily and unreasonably deprives individuals with disabilities of a constitutional right, it increases the stigma for those who, due to their disabilities, may need a representative payee. Despite our objections and that of many other individuals and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed rule, the final rule released in late December was largely unchanged. Because of the importance of the constitutional right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule legitimizes, NCMHR recommends that Congress consider utilizing the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal this rule. NCMHR is a nonpartisan, is a nonpartisan, nonprofit with no stated position with respect to gunownership or guncontrol other than our longheld position that restrictions on gun possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon. Additionally, it is critically important that any restriction on gun possession or ownership on this basis is imposed only after the individual has been afforded due process and given an opportunity to respond to allegations that they are not able to safely possess or own a firearm due to his or her disability. NCMHR believes that SSA’s final rule falls far short of meeting these criteria. The CRA is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory overreach, and NCMHR urges its use advisedly and cautiously. In this particular case, the potential for real harm to the constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to undermine the essential mission of an agency that millions of people with and without disabilities rely upon to meet their basic needs. Therefore, in this instance, NCMHR feels that utilizing the CRA to repeal the final rule is not only warranted, but necessary. Sincerely, DANIEL B. F ISHER , M.D., Ph.D., Chair NCMHR. CONSORTIUM FOR  CITIZENS WITH DISABILITIES , Washington, DC, January 26, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Office of the Democratic Leader, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : The CoChairs of the Rights Task Force of the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) urge you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ‘‘Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.’’ This rule would require the Social Security Administration to forward the names of all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is the largest coalition of national organizations working together to advocate for Federal public policy that ensures the selfdetermination, independence, empowerment, integration and inclusion of children and adults with disabilities in all aspects of society. Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, the CCD Rights Task Force conveyed its opposition to the rule through a letter to the Obama Administration and through the public comment process. We—and many other members of CCD—opposed the rule for a number of reasons, including: The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive assistance from representative payees in managing their benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions. The absence of any data suggesting that there is any connection between the need for a representative payee to manage one’s Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward gun violence. The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior to the SSA’s transmittal of names to the NICS database. Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to transmit the names of individuals who have been ‘‘adjudicated’’ to lack the capacity to manage their own affairs, SSA’s process does not constitute an adjudication and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly unable to manage their own affairs. Based on similar concerns, the National Council on Disability, an independent federal agency charged with advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule. We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it inflicts on the disability community.

AMERICAN CIVILLIBERTIES UNION, Washington, DC, February 1, 2017. Vote YES on the Resolution of Disapproval, H.J. Res. 40 (Social Security Administration NICS Final Rule) Vote NO on the Resolution of Disapproval, H.J. Res. 37 (Federal Acquisition Regulation/Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces EO) DEAR REPRESENTATIVES : On behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), we urge members of the House of Representatives to support the resolution disapproving the final rule of the Social Security Administration which implements the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Improvement Amendment Acts of 2007. Additionally we urge members to oppose the resolution of disapproval of the rule submitted by the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and NASA relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation that implement the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order 13673. 
SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (SSA) ’SI MPLEMENTATION OF THE NICS IMPROVEMENT  
WITH DISABILITIES  In December 2016, the SSA promulgated a final rule that would require the names of all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients—who, because of a mental impairment, use a representative payee to help manage their benefits—be submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is used during gun purchases. We oppose this rule because it advances and reinforces the harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent. There is no data to support a connection between the need for a representative payee to manage one’s Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward gun violence. The rule further demonstrates the damaging phenomenon of ‘‘spread,’’ or the perception that a disabled individual with one area of impairment automatically has additional, negative and unrelated attributes. Here, the rule automatically conflates one disabilityrelated characteristic, that is, difficulty managing money, with the inability to safely possess a firearm. The rule includes no meaningful due process protections prior to the SSA’s transmittal of names to the NICS database. The determination by SSA line staff that a beneficiary needs a representative payee to manage their money benefit is simply not an ‘‘adjudication’’ in any ordinary meaning of the word. Nor is it a determination that the person ‘‘[l]acks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs’’ as required by the NICS. Indeed, the law and the SSA clearly state that representative payees are appointed for many individuals who are legally competent. We recognize that enacting new regulations relating to firearms can raise difficult questions. The ACLU believes that the right to own and use guns is not absolute or free from government regulation, since firearms are inherently dangerous instrumentalities and their use, unlike other activities protected by the Bill of Rights, can inflict serious bodily injury or death. Therefore, firearms are subject to reasonable regulation in the interests of public safety, crime prevention, maintaining the peace, environmental protection, and public health. We do not oppose regulation of firearms as long as it is reasonably related to these legitimate government interests. At the same time, regulation of firearms and individual gun ownership or use must be consistent with civil liberties principles, such as due process, equal protection, freedom from unlawful searches, and privacy. All individuals have the right to be judged on the basis of their individual capabilities, not the characteristics and capabilities that are sometimes attributed (often mistakenly) to any group or class to which they belong. A disability should not constitute grounds for the automatic per se denial of any right or privilege, including gun ownership. FAIR PAY AND SAFE WORKPLACES REGULATIONS  
ADVANCE WORKER SAFETY AND RIGHTS  The rules implementing the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order take an important step towards creating more equitable and safe work conditions by ensuring that federal contractors provide workplaces that comply with federal labor and civil rights laws. Employers that have the privilege of doing business with the federal government must meet their legal obligations. The Fair Pay and Safe Workplace regulations are crucial because they help ensure that federal contractors behave responsibly and ethically with respect to labor standards and civil rights laws and that they are complying with federal labor and employment laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (which includes the Equal Pay Act), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and their state law equivalents. The Executive Order also bans contractors from forcing employees to arbitrate claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act as well as claims of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Congress should stand with workers, increase the accountability of federal contractors and oppose any attempts to undo the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces regulations. These rules will help ensure that the federal government does not contract with employers that routinely violate workplace health and safety protections, engage in age, disability, race, and sex discrimination, withhold wages, or commit other labor violations.

THEJUDGE DAVID L. B AZELON CENTER FOR MENTAL HEALTH LAW, Washington, DC, January 30, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Office of the Democratic Leader, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law urges you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ‘‘Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.’’ The Center is a national legal advocacy organization that protects and advances the rights of adults and children with mental disabilities. This rule would require the Social Security Administration to forward the names of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The rule is inconsistent with the statute it implements, has no evidentiary justification, would wrongly perpetuate inaccurate stereotypes of individuals with mental disabilities as dangerous, and would divert already too scarce SSA resources away from efforts to address the agency’s longstanding backlog of unprocessed benefits applications toward a mission in which the agency has little expertise. First, there is no statutory basis for the rule. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) statute authorizes the reporting of an individual to the NICS database on the basis of a determination that the person ‘‘lacks the capacity to contract or manage his own affairs’’ as a result of ‘‘marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency condition or disease.’’ The appointment of a representative payee simply does not meet this standard. It indicates only that the individual needs help managing benefits received from SSA. Second, the rule puts in place an ineffective strategy to address gun violence, devoid of any evidentiary basis, targeting individuals with representative payees and mental impairments as potential perpetrators of gun violence. In doing so, it also creates a false sense that meaningful action has been taken to address gun violence and detracts from potential prevention efforts targeting actual risks for gun violence. Third, the rule perpetuates the prevalent false association of mental disabilities with violence and undermines important efforts to promote community integration and employment of people with disabilities. The rule may also dissuade people with mental impairments from seeking appropriate treatment or services, or from applying for financial and medical assistance programs. Finally, the rule creates enormous new burdens on SSA without providing any additional resources. Implementation of the rule will divert scarce resources away from the core work of the SSA at a time when the agency is struggling to overcome record backlogs and prospective beneficiaries are waiting for months and years for determinations of their benefits eligibility. Moreover, SSA lacks the expertise to make the determinations about safety that it would be called upon to make as part of the relief process established by the rule. Based on similar concerns, the National Council on Disability, an independent federal agency charged with advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule. We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it inflicts on the disability community. Sincerely, JENNIFER MATHIS , Director of Policy and Legal Advocacy. 
b1400 Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we need to put a stop to this rule now. That is why I introduced H.J. Res. 40, along with Congressman ABRAHAM, to overturn this rule and make sure the constitutional rights of individuals with disabilities are protected. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ and pass this resolution. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. THOMPSON ). Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 40. This resolution undermines our NICS background check system. I am a gun owner and a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, but this isn’t about denying people the right to own a gun. It is about upholding the law, and the law is very clear on who should be reported to the NICS system. The law was passed more than a decade ago to keep guns out of the hands of people who can’t responsibly own them. These are not people just having a bad day. These are not people simply suffering from depression or anxiety or agoraphobics. These are people with a severe mental illness who can’t hold any kind of job or make any decisions about their affairs. So the law says very clearly that they shouldn’t have a firearm. The Supreme Court in the Heller decision recognized that the Second Amendment grants Americans the right to own firearms, but they also stated that reasonable restrictions to that right can apply, such as when a person is diagnosed with a severe mental illness. The Social Security Administration is simply obeying the law. So what exactly is the objection here? Passage of this resolution puts Americans at risk. It would prevent the Social Security Administration from reporting the names of those who should not have a gun and prohibit that indefinitely. If there are concerns about the rules, let’s revise it. But the CRA process is not a revision. It would ban Social Security from even amending their rule. This is a dangerous overstep, and I urge Members to consider the safety of our districts. No one wants another Virginia Tech. No one wants another Newtown. Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM ). Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to introduce this resolution with my good friend, Representative SAMJOHNSON of Texas, one of the greatest patriots I have had the honor to come in contact with and a lifelong defender of our freedoms in America. This resolution can be boiled down to one point: no bureaucrat should be able to deny an American his or her constitutional rights just because someone else handles their finances. In the midnight hour of President Obama’s last days in office, the Social Security Administration finalized a rule that would allow it to send the name of any beneficiary to the FBI’s criminal background check system if they are assigned a representative payee due to mental impairment. Allowing bureaucrats at the Social Security Administration to determine whether or not a beneficiary is fit to exercise their Second Amendment rights is a clear violation of due process that every American is afforded. When this awful rule was proposed in 2015, both Representative SAMJOHNSON  of Texas and I introduced legislation to prevent the Social Security Administration from carrying it out. With the introduction of this joint resolution, I am pleased that Congress and the President will now have the opportunity to review and to reverse this terrible rule. That is why I strongly urge my colleagues, in both the House and the Senate, to pass this resolution and keep the government bureaucracies from putting themselves before the Constitution. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, at a time here in America when mass shootings have become all too frequent, at a time when bullets literally rip apart human bodies and human families and cause so much pain, at a time when effective groups like Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense and Texas Gun Sense and the P.E.A.C.E. Initiative are asking this Congress to act to reduce gun violence, this Congress has committed itself to doing absolutely nothing about that violence. If you are on the terrorist watch list and you cannot fly, not to worry about buying a gun. It’s ‘‘No fly,’’ but you can still buy. Today we are told the problem isn’t that there are too many guns out there causing too much harm to American families. There are not enough. A group is being left out, omitted from access to guns. There are a group of Americans, who either from birth or by contracting some mental disability later in life, have a mental impairment that is so significant that we ask taxpayers across America to provide them support through the Social Security disability system. They are declared to be disabled. And within that group that is taxpayer funded, there is a much smaller group whose disability is so severe that they can’t handle their own affairs. They can’t receive a check. But these folks say don’t worry that you can’t place a check in their hand and you have to give it to someone else, it is okay to put a gun in their hands. That is what this proposal does. Now, we have, as they have failed to point out, a system in place at the Veterans’ Administration so that if someone is a veteran and they are disabled, there is a process by which they are included within this system. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. SIMPSON ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, but these folks, instead of reaching out to do something about gun violence in America, propose to make them more accessible to individuals that are so impaired they cannot take care of themselves in many ways and cannot even accept a check and are saying: Give them a gun. There are already safeguards in this Rule. Someone can appeal being listed and say: You know, I can’t accept a check, but I do have the ability to own a gun. And they can do that through the Social Security Administration, as soon as they see their name on the list. Or if they are denied a purchase at a later time and they are someone who doesn’t belong on this list, there is a way for them to get off the list. In short, there is due process to ensure they are not unfairly denied gun access. But the American people and the families that are being hurt day after day by gun violence, they deserve some due process, too. Let’s uphold this Rule and reject this giant step backward that will only produce more gun violence and more families torn asunder. Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH). Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution to repeal a rule which would arbitrarily revoke the Second Amendment rights of certain Social Security beneficiaries. The inability to manage one’s Social Security benefits does not correlate with the capacity to judiciously use firearms. By adding Social Security beneficiaries to the NICS list with no judicial review and forcing them to go through an appeals process to be removed, this rule would also violate the due process rights of these Americans. I would also like to focus on the component of this rule which would inhibit the ability of Social Security disability beneficiaries to be approved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to work with or around certain materials. Mr. Speaker, there is bipartisan agreement we should be investing in and rebuilding our infrastructure. There is also bipartisan agreement we should be empowering people receiving benefits, like disability insurance, to return to work if they are able to do so. However, this rule will create a new barrier for beneficiaries seeking to return to work in industries like construction by forcing them to navigate a complex appeals process before they can be reemployed. Let me say again, if we do nothing about this rule, it will prevent law 
abiding Americans who are able to do so from getting off the disability rolls and returning to work. We can work together on constructive ways to prevent those who would do us harm from having access to firearms and explosives. This rule is not the way to do so. I urge support for the resolution. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. HIGGINS ). Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 40 with a message, and that is: Do not repeal this rule. The Social Security Administration rule is intended to promote and to preserve the integrity of gun ownership in America. I have heard it said by gun owner advocates that a steady hand is the best gun control. I believe that, but a steady hand requires a rationale mind. The Social Security Administration rule that my colleagues on the other side want to eliminate is written carefully and narrowly, affecting a very small group of people with a very severe, longterm mental disorder that makes them unable to do any kind of work in the U.S. economy, even part time or with very low wages and, also, people not mentally capable of managing their own benefits. The Social Security Administration rule ensures that individuals, who are already prohibited from having guns under existing Federal law, have their names included on the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Mr. Speaker, 93 percent of Americans support background checks and believe that systems should be in place to ensure that guns are not in the hands of individuals who have been determined already by Federal law to be unable to use them safely. I urge my colleagues to reject H.J. Res. 40. Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RENACCI ). Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SAMJOHNSON of Texas for his work on this important resolution and his many years of service to our country. Mr. Speaker, in the final weeks of President Obama’s final term, the Social Security Administration finalized a rule that flat out discriminates against millions of individuals with disabilities by denying them their Second Amendment rights. But it gets worse. Not only does the rule place these innocent individuals’ names in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, it does so in a way that strips them of their due process. Specifically, it would subject these people to a very timely appeals process requiring them to prove their own innocence before their name could be removed. In other words, this rule turns due process on its head by shifting the burden of proof from the government to the individual to ensure their constitutional right is not stripped away. Moreover, as a member of the Social Security subcommittee, I am very concerned that this rule falls way outside the bounds of the Social Security Administration’s mission. Instead of using the Social Security administrator’s field office staff to help Ohioans manage and understand their benefits, this rule diverts resources away from that core mission toward one that is constitutionally suspect. That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Chairman SAM JOHNSON of Texas’ resolution that protects Americans’ Second Amendment rights and protects Americans with disabilities, their constitutional right, to due process under the law. I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution of disapproval. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Members of the House, we have some organizational support for opposing this resolution. The first is the AFL– CIO, one of our largest unions in the country. The second is the Consumer Federation of America, and then there is this great organization, Everytown for Gun Safety across the country. In addition, the Americans for Responsible Solutions organization is opposed to H.J. Res. 40. Finally, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence is also opposed to this measure, as is the Consumer Federation of America. b1415 If Members believe this rule needs further refinement or that it does not afford adequate due process, then we should have the conversation with an eye toward improving the rule, but that is not what has been done. Unfortunately, this is what we are not discussing today. Instead, H.J. Res. 40 would invalidate all aspects of this rule and prohibit the agency from adopting substantially the same rule. We should not summarily dismiss this rule, which would undermine the effort to make the NICS more effective. If H.J. Res. 40 passes Congress and is signed into law, some individuals will be able to pass firearm background checks solely because Congress prevented relevant records from being submitted to the system. The Social Security Administration’s rule is about making Americans safer from the scourge of gun violence and, unfortunately, believe me, H.J. Res. 40 would do the opposite. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI ). Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 40. As part of our bold agenda for the American people, we are reining in the outofcontrol bureaucracy in Washington. We are taking action to roll back 8 years of Obama administration overreach. Today we are stopping an egregious violation that flies in the face of the Constitution. This regulation, finalized in the final days of the Obama Presidency, would deny certain Social Security recipients their Second Amendment rights without due process. If you receive Social Security disability payments and someone helps you manage those payments, this regulation stops you from being able to purchase a firearm, your name gets added to a Federal database, and the burden is on you to prove it doesn’t belong there. This is absolutely outrageous. This regulation discriminates against individuals with disabilities by denying them their Second Amendment rights and violating their rights of due process. And it gives far too much power to bureaucrats at the Social Security Administration, who should be focused on making sure people get the benefits they deserve, not deciding who can own a gun. This is why we are standing up for the Second Amendment rights of all disabled citizens. Being disabled doesn’t make you a danger to society, and getting help managing your benefits doesn’t mean you forfeit your constitutional rights. Mr. Speaker, I want to absolutely thank Congressman SAMJOHNSON and Congressman RALPH ABRAHAM for their leadership on this issue. I strongly support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  additional letters of support. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY  BEHAVIORAL HEALTH & D EVELOP MENT DISABILITY DIRECTORS , Washington, DC, February 1, 2017. Re NACBHDD and NARMH Letter of Support for the CRA on the SSA NICS Rule. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Office of the Democratic Leader, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : NACBHDD and NARMH urge you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ‘‘Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. This rule would require the Social Security Administration to forward the names of all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). NACBHDD is a national organization that represents county mental health, substance use, and developmental; disability directors in Washington, DC. NARMH represents rural mental health in the Capital. Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, NACBHDD and NARMH conveyed our opposition to the rule through a letter to the Obama Administration and through the public comment process. We join many of our 
mental health coalition members and advocates who—opposed the rule for a number of reasons, including: The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive assistance from representative payees in managing their benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions. The absence of any data suggesting that there is any connection between the need for a representative payee to manage one’s Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward gun violence. The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior to the SSA’s transmittal of names to the NICS database. Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to transmit the names of individuals who have been ‘‘adjudicated’’ to lack the capacity to manage their own affairs, SSA’s process does not constitute an adjudication and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly unable to manage their own affairs. Based on similar concerns, the National Council on Disability, an independent federal agency charged with advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule.

ONMENTAL ILLNESS , Arlington, VA, January 31, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Office of the Democratic Leader, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) writes to urge you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ‘‘Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.’’ This rule would require the Social Security Administration to forward the names of all Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability beneficiaries who use a representative payee to help manage their benefits, and who have been found eligible by meeting or equaling an SSA mental impairment listing, to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). NAMI is the nation’s largest grassroots mental health organization dedicated to building better lives for the millions of Americans affected by mental illness, with more than 1,100 state and local affiliates nationwide. NAMI recognizes and supports the need to prioritize reducing gun violence in the U.S. However, we are gravely concerned that the rule, as adopted, perpetuates unfounded stereotypes about people with mental illness and other mental disabilities that have no basis in fact. Moreover, we believe that the rule may have unintended negative consequences, including deterring individuals from seeking or receiving help when they need it. Our specific concerns about the rule are the following: There is no evidence supporting the proposition that people who are assigned Representative Payees on the basis of mental illness or other mental disabilities pose increased risks for gun violence or threats to public safety; Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to transmit the names of individuals who have been ‘‘adjudicated’’ to lack the capacity to manage their own affairs, the assignment of a Representative Payee to a recipient of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is not equivalent to an adjudication. Rather, it is a unilateral determination by the SSA that a person may need help in managing his or her benefits. There is no hearing, the beneficiary is afforded no oppornmity to testify or provide evidence why he or she should not be assigned a Representative Payee, and there are no other due process protections typically associated with formal adjudications. The new rule reinforces unfounded perceptions associating mental illness and other mental disabilities with violence. Scientific studies that have assessed risk factors for violence contain no evidence linking difficulties with managing benefits with increased risks for violence. SSI and SSDI provide vital links to medical benefits for people with mental illness. The rule may deter individuals from applying for these benefits for fear that their names will be added to a public database maintained by the FBI. Without such benefits, access to mental health treatment and services will be impeded. Mr. Speaker and Madam Leader, NAMI asserts that the adoption of this misguided rule in the aftermath of Congressional adoption of a comprehensive bill to improve mental health care in America is exactly the wrong step to take. We therefore urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage it inflicts on people with mental illness and other disabilities. Thank you for your prompt attention to these concerns. Sincerely, MARYGILIBERTI , J.D., Chief Executive Officer. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR RIGHTS  PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY , Huntsville, LA, January 31, 2017. Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL , Senate Majority Leader, Washington, DC. Hon. CHUCK SCHUMER , Senate Minority Leader, Washington, DC. DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL AND  MINORITY LEADER SCHUMER : The National Association of Rights Protection and Advocacy (NARPA) urges you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ‘‘Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.’’ NARPA was formed in 1981 to provide education and advocacy in the mental health arena. Members are attorneys, people with psychiatric histories, mental health professionals and administrators, academics, and nonlegal advocates. Central to NARPA’s mission is the promotion of those policies and strategies that represent the preferred options of people who have been diagnosed with psychiatric disabilities. This rule requires the Social Security Administration to forward the names of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The rule is inconsistent with the statute it implements, has no evidentiary justification, would wrongly perpetuate inaccurate stereotypes of individuals with mental disabilities as dangerous, and would divert already too scarce SSA resources away from efforts to address the agency’s longstanding backlog of unprocessed benefits applications toward a mission in which the agency has little expertise. First, there is no statutory basis for the rule.

It indicates only that the individual needs help managing benefits received from SSA. Second, the rule puts in place an ineffective strategy to address gun violence, devoid of any evidentiary basis, targeting individuals with representative payees and mental impairments as potential perpetrators of gun violence. In doing so, it also creates a false sense that meaningful action has been taken to address gun violence and detracts from potential prevention efforts targeting actual risks for gun violence. Third, the rule perpetuates the prevalent false association of mental disabilities with violence and undermines important efforts to promote community integration and employment of people with disabilities. The rule may also dissuade people with mental impairments from seeking appropriate treatment or services, or from applying for financial and medical assistance programs. Finally, the rule creates enormous new burdens on SSA without providing any additional resources. Implementation of the rule will divert scarce resources away from the core work of the SSA at a time when the agency is struggling to overcome record backlogs and prospective beneficiaries are waiting for months and years for determinations of their benefits eligibility. Moreover, SSA lacks the expertise to make the determinations about safety that it would be called upon to make as part of the relief process established by the rule. Based on similar concerns, the National Council on Disability, an independent federal agency charged with advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule. We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it inflicts on the disability community. Sincerely, ANNRIDER, President. 
ONINDEPENDENT LIVING , Rochester, New York, January 27, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Office of the Democratic Leader, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : The National Council on Independent Living (NCIL) urges you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by 
the Social Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ‘‘Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.’’ This rule would require the Social Security Administration to forward the names of all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). NCIL represents people with disabilities, Centers for Independent Living (CILs), Statewide Independent Living Councils (SILCs), and other organizations that advocate for the human and civil rights of people with disabilities throughout the country. Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, NCIL joined the CCD Rights Task Force to convey its opposition to the rule through a letter to the Obama Administration and through the public comment process. We— and many other members of CCD—opposed the rule for a number of reasons, including: The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive assistance from representative payees in managing their benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions. The absence of any data suggesting that there is any connection between the need for a representative payee to manage one’s Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward gun violence. The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior to the SSA’s transmittal of names to the NICS database. Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to transmit the names of individuals who have been ‘‘adjudicated’’ to lack the capacity to manage their own affairs, SSA’s process does not constitute an adjudication and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly unable to manage their own affairs. Based on similar concerns, the National Council on Disability, an independent federal agency charged with advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule. We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it inflicts on the disability community. We look forward to an opportunity to speak with you and your staff about our concerns. Respectfully, KELLY BUCKLAND , Executive Director. 
JANUARY 31, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Office of the Democratic Leader, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : The National Disability Leadership Alliance (NDLA) urges you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ‘‘Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.’’ This rule would require the Social Security Administration to forward the names of all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). NDLA is a national crossdisability coalition that represents the authentic voice of people with disabilities. NDLA is led by 14 national organizations run by people with disabilities with identifiable grassroots constituencies around the country. The NDLA steering committee includes: ADAPT, the American Association of People with Disabilities, the American Council of the Blind, the Association of Programs for Rural Independent Living, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, the Hearing Loss Association of America, Little People of America, the National Association of the Deaf, the National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery, the National Council on Independent Living, the National Federation of the Blind, the National Organization of Nurses with Disabilities, Not Dead Yet, Self Advocates Becoming Empowered, and the United Spinal Association. Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, NDLA conveyed its opposition to the rule through letters to Vice President Biden, to President Obama, and to Congress.

NEWYORK ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC REHABILITATION SERVICES, INC., Albany, NY, January 31, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Office of the Democratic Leader, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : On behalf of thousands of New Yorkers with psychiatric disabilities, the New York Association of Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services (NYAPRS) urges you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ‘‘Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.’’ By way of reference, NYAPRS is a 36 year old statewide coalition that has brought together New Yorkers with psychiatric disabilities and community recovery providers to advance policies, programs and social conditions that advance recovery, rehabilitation, rights and community inclusion. This rule would require the Social Security Administration to forward the names of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The rule is inconsistent with the statute it implements, has no evidentiary justification, would wrongly perpetuate inaccurate stereotypes of individuals with mental disabilities as dangerous, and would divert already too scarce SSA resources away from efforts to address the agency’s longstanding backlog of unprocessed benefits applications toward a mission in which the agency has little expertise. First, there is no statutory basis for the rule. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) statute authorizes the reporting of an individual to the NICS database on the basis of a determination that the person ‘‘lacks the capacity to contract or manage his own affairs’’ as a result of ‘‘marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency condition or disease.’’ The appointment of a representative payee simply does not meet this standard. It indicates only that the individual needs help managing benefits received from SSA. Second, the rule puts in place an ineffective strategy to address gun violence, devoid of any evidentiary basis, targeting individuals with representative payees and mental impairments as potential perpetrators of gun violence. In doing so, it also creates a false sense that meaningful action has been taken to address gun violence and detracts from potential prevention efforts targeting actual risks for gun violence. Third, the rule perpetuates the prevalent false association of mental disabilities with violence and undermines important efforts to promote community integration and employment of people with disabilities. The rule may also dissuade people with mental impairments from seeking appropriate treatment or services, or from applying for financial and medical assistance programs. Finally, the rule creates enormous new burdens on SSA without providing any additional resources. Implementation of the rule will divert scarce resources away from the core work of the SSA at a time when the agency is struggling to overcome record backlogs and prospective beneficiaries are waiting for months and years for determinations of their benefits eligibility. Moreover, SSA lacks the expertise to make the determinations about safety that it would be called upon to make as part of the relief process established by the rule. Based on similar concerns, the National Council on Disability, an independent federal agency charged with advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule. We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it inflicts on the disability community. Please feel free to contact me at any time.

SAFARI CLUBINTERNATIONAL , Washington, DC, January 31, 2017. Re Safari Club International Support for House Joint Resolution 40. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , House Minority Leader, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN AND MINORITY LEADER  PELOSI : Safari Club International (Safari Club) supports House Joint Resolution 40, which provides for Congressional disapproval under the Congressional Review Act of the final rule submitted by the Social Security Administration (SSA) relating to ‘‘Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007,’’ adopted on December 19, 2016, 81 Fed. Reg. 91702. Safari Club seeks Congressional disapproval of the rule for several reasons. It deprives an individual of the ability to receive or possess a firearm, including for recreational hunting, due to that individual’s inability to manage his or her financial affairs (Firearms Rule). Under the Firearms Rule, the prohibition would apply when the SSA designates a representative payee because of the individual’s mental impairment. A mental impairment that makes an individual incapable of handling his/her financial affairs does not necessarily equate to an inability to properly abide by the law in the use of firearms. The Firearms Rule unfairly attributes illegal conduct to law abiding citizens. In addition, the Firearms Rule fails in its attempt to rectify its unfair treatment of individuals with mental impairments through its program for individuals to request relief from Federal Firearms prohibitions. This program places on the individual with a mental impairment the costly and burdensome task of collecting and presenting data to overcome the presumption that he or she is incapable of abiding by the law. This program forces upon lawabiding citizens the task of confronting a federal bureaucracy just to prove that they should not be unfairly treated as a criminal due to a mental impairment. For these reasons, Safari Club supports a joint resolution stating ‘‘that Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Social Security Administration relating to Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, and such rule shall have no force or effect.’’ Sincerely, LARRY HIGGINS , President, Safari Club International. 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ). Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, the regulatory state in America is alive and well. I wish I could say as much for our economy and our personal freedoms, but I believe that that is about to change thanks in large part to the recent Presidential election. Over the last 8 years, we have replaced a free enterprise system with a regulatory bureaucracy that has crushed our economy, stifled our innovation, and quashed the great American spirit. America has never seen such an onslaught of abusive and burdensome actions from the fourth branch of government. The cumulative cost of regulations on our American economy is almost $2 trillion. It costs almost $60 billion just to enforce all the regulations on the books. Let me give you, though, an example of a regulation that is far worse in its effects than just simply economic burden or burden on our people. Today, I stand with my friend and great American hero, SAMJOHNSON , in strong support of H.J. Res. 40 to strike down the Obama administration’s last ditch effort to infringe upon our Second Amendment rights. In the 11th hour, the Obama administration quietly sneaked in a rule that threatens to deny certain Social Security beneficiaries their right to purchase a firearm. Federal law makes it a crime already to possess a firearm if an individual has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to a mental institution. This midnight rule designates Social Security beneficiaries as having a mental impairment simply because they ask someone to manage their finances. Just because an elderly or disabled individual chooses to delegate their financial responsibilities to another does not make them mentally incompetent, nor does it waive their right to due process. Many people, even in this Chamber, are designated to manage the finances of their parents on Social Security, and they do so because their parents may prefer not to deal with the complexities of our current financial environment. Not only would this proposed rule be a continuation of the Obama administration’s regulatory fiat, it would be irresponsible and dangerous and a breach of one of our fundamental rights. We cannot allow the Federal Government to haphazardly restrict our freedoms and the freedoms of over 4 million law abiding Americans who would otherwise be responsible gun owners. In fact, they are some of the most vulnerable Americans who need to be able to protect themselves. As noted by the Founders and in the plain language of our Constitution, the Federal Government shall not infringe upon our right to keep and bear arms. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, 
and I would like to emphasize several points additionally. The degree of impairment required for reporting to the NICS is extremely high, to the extent that someone is not capable of working at any job in the economy, no matter how basic. Someone receiving Social Security benefits as a retiree, even if they have mental impairment and have been assigned a representative payee, would not meet the criteria for reporting to the NICS because they are not receiving benefits because of disability. Further, the rule went into effect in January, but compliance is not required until December of this year. This would only impact claims going forward and will not involve retroactively assessing individuals already receiving Social Security disability payments based on mental impairment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO). Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman JOHNSON for standing up and defending our Nation’s Constitution again, not just in his service to our country during the Vietnam era, but here in Congress and his many years here. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. As a tireless advocate for the protection of our Second Amendment rights, I am disappointed, but not surprised, in the Obama administration’s attempt to impair Americans’ right to own firearms, by fiat, in its last days of existence. It is unconscionable and unthinkable that a President would do that to the citizens of this country. This rule claims to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check but, in reality, acted as a gun grab on individuals who receive disability insurance benefits or Supplemental Security Income payments. Participants in those programs should not be forced to worry that, in order to receive government assistance, they must sacrifice their constitutional liberty at the random whim of a government bureaucrat. The Second Amendment to our Constitution states very clearly that the right to keep and bear arms ‘‘shall not be infringed,’’ and Congress cannot stand by and allow unaccountable rulemaking from a previous administration to infringe on that right. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDYCHU), my colleague, a member of the Judiciary Committee. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this use of the Congressional Review Act to repeal the Social Security Administration’s rule strengthening the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The rule in question implements alreadyexisting law to establish a commonsense streamlining of information which will help improve our background check system for gun purchases. It is important to note that individuals with disabilities are actually more likely to be victims than perpetrators of gun violence, which is why I support more farreaching gun safety measures like universal background checks and a ban on the most dangerous weapons. However, when there have been instances of mass shootings committed by those with a history of mental health issues, top Republicans, including Speaker RYAN, have stood on this very floor to say that they believe we should focus on mental health issues. Well, this is their chance to prove that those were not just empty words; but, instead, they are showing their true loyalties and again resisting any attempt to strengthen basic safeguards to ensure responsible gun ownership. This is a commonsense regulation that sets a high bar for referring names to the background check system. No one’s rights are unduly restricted. An appeals process has been built in to afford due process. So it is clear that my Republican colleagues concerns’ are not about safety, but about maximizing profits for gun manufacturers, even if it costs the lives of fellow Americans. And worse, they are using the restrictive Congressional Review Act to do so. This will not only make it easier for even those with severe mental health issues to buy a gun, but it will also take the option for writing similar rules off the table forever, tying the hands of all future administrations. This is reckless. Gun deaths are a daily scourge in our country, and it is up to us to do whatever we can to mitigate the risk of the dangerous weapons in the wrong hands. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolution. Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, having no other speakers, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Members of the House, this is a very serious matter. This rule, and I have to emphasize this, does not run afoul of the Second Amendment. You can oppose this—well, let’s put it like this: The Heller Court, in the Supreme Court case, said that ‘‘nothing in the Court’s opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill.’’ I emphasize ‘‘and the mentally ill.’’ And it is in that sense that I join with the AFL–CIO, Consumer Federation of America, Everytown for Gun Safety, Americans for Responsible Solutions, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, and many thoughtful citizens who support the Second Amendment in opposing the measure that is on the floor now. I urge Members to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1430 Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. This is about constitutional rights of individuals with disabilities. Just because someone has a disability does not mean they are a threat to society. Furthermore, needing help to manage your benefits does not make you dangerous. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  additional letters of support. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF  PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES , Washington, DC, January 26, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Office of the Democratic Leader, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : The American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) urges you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ‘‘Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.’’ This rule would require the Social Security Administration to forward the names of all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). AAPD is a national disability rights organization that works to improve the lives of people with disabilities by acting as a convener, connector, and catalyst for change, increasing the economic and political power of people with disabilities. Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, AAPD conveyed its opposition to the rule to the Obama Administration. We, and many other disability rights organizations, opposed the rule for a number of reasons, including: 1) The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive assistance from representative payees in managing their benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions. 2) The absence of any data suggesting that there is any connection between the need for a representative payee to manage one’s Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward gun violence. 3) The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior to the SSA’s transmittal of names to the NICS database. Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to transmit the names of individuals who have been ‘‘adjudicated’’ to lack the capacity to manage their own affairs, SSA’s process does not constitute an adjudication and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly unable to manage their own affairs. AAPD urges Congress to act, through the CRA process, to disapprove this new rule to prevent the damage that it inflicts on the disability community and the extraordinarily damaging message it sends to society that people with mental impairments could should be feared and shunned. 
Thank you for taking our position into consideration. Yours truly, HELENA R. B ERGER , President & CEO. 
ADAPT, Rochester, NY, January 31, 2017. ADAPT urges you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ‘‘Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.’’ This rule would require the Social Security Administration to forward the names of all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). ADAPT is a national grassroots community that organizes disability rights activists to engage in nonviolent direct action, including civil disobedience, to assure the civil and human rights of people with disabilities to live in freedom. We oppose the rule for a number of reasons, including: 1) The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive assistance from representative payees in managing their benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions. 2) The absence of any data suggesting that there is any connection between the need for a representative payee to manage one’s Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward gun violence. 3) The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior to the SSA’s transmittal of names to the NICS database.

We look forward to an opportunity to speak with you and your staff about our concerns. Sincerely, BRUCE DARLING , National Organizer. ASSOCIATION OF MATURE  AMERICAN CITIZENS , February 1, 2017. Hon. CHUCK GRASSLEY , U.S. Senator, Iowa, Washington, DC. Hon. RALPH ABRAHAM , 5th District, Louisiana, Washington, DC. Hon. SAMJOHNSON , Chairman, Social Security Subcommittee, House Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC. DEARSENATOR GRASSLEY , CHAIRMAN JOHNSON, AND CONGRESSMAN ABRAHAM : On behalf of the 1.3 million members of AMAC, the Association of Mature American Citizens, I am writing in support of the Joint Resolution to protect certain Americans’ Second Amendment rights, H.J. Res. 40. Using the Congressional Review Act, this Joint Resolution is meant to undo a Social Security Administration (SSA) regulation that would deprive thousands of Americans who are disabled and who utilize a ‘‘representative payee’’ in order to acquire their benefits of their ability to purchase a firearm. This regulation is both unnecessary and unfair to thousands of law abiding seniors and citizens who wish to exercise their basic Second Amendment rights. In December 2016, SSA finalized a rule providing that any American receiving disability benefits due to a ‘‘mental disability’’ and who are also receiving assistance in managing their benefits should be labeled ‘‘mentally defective.’’ As a result, those who are inappropriately labeled as ‘‘mentally defective’’ are mandatorily reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System—a federal list of people who are barred from purchasing firearms—as required by the Gun Control Act. This finalized rule unjustly equates persons with disabilities and those who require assistance to manage their benefits to those who are actually ‘‘mentally defective.’’ Aside from the fact that this regulation inappropriately equates disabled persons relying on representative payees with those who are ‘‘mentally defective,’’ AMAC objects to the way in which this regulation has been implemented. Over the past several years, Americans, particularly seniors, have been at the mercy of executive overreach and mandate. As millions of American seniors rely on SSA for their retirement income, the burden of this regulation has been largely concentrated in our communities. This Joint Resolution is a welcome reprieve to seniors who have had their Second Amendment rights subverted by an administration and agency with significant influence over their retirement income. As an organization committed to representing the interests of mature Americans and seniors, AMAC is dedicated to ensuring senior citizens’ interests are protected. This midnight regulation has placed an undue burden on those requiring assistance to manage their benefits and who suffer from disability. As an organization, we thank Senator Grassley, Chairman Johnson, Congressman Abraham, and their respective staffs for their quick response and steady resolve to protect seniors and those who have been affected by this regulation. We ask Congress to quickly pass this Joint Resolution and restore the basic Second Amendment rights this rule has abridged. Sincerely, DANWEBER , President and Founder of AMAC. THEARC, Washington, DC, January 30, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Office of the Democratic Leader, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : The Arc of the United States (The Arc) writes to urge you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ‘‘Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.’’ This rule would require the Social Security Administration to forward the names of all Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability beneficiaries who use a representative payee to help manage their benefits, and who have been found eligible by meeting or equaling an SSA mental impairment listing, to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The Arc is the largest national communitybased organization advocating for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) and their families, with over 660 state and local chapters nationwide. The Arc is devoted to promoting and protecting the human and civil rights of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and has over 60years of history of advocating for the rights of children and adults with disabilities. The Arc is concerned about the safety of all Americans, including through gun violence. However, The Arc—and many other members of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD)—opposes the rule for a number of reasons, including: The damaging message that may be sent by an SSA policy change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive assistance from representative payees in managing their benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions. The absence of any data suggesting that there is any connection between the need for a representative payee to manage ones Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward gun violence. The absence of any meaningful due process protections when interfering with an individual’s constitutional right, prior to the SSA’s transmittal of names to the NICS database. Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to transmit the names of individuals who have been ‘‘adjudicated’’ to lack the capacity to manage their own affairs, SSA’s process does not constitute an adjudication and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly unable to manage their own affairs. The potential for the rule to deter some people with mental impairments from seeking access to the Social Security and SSI disability benefits that they are eligible for, out fear of being added to the NICS or having their privacy violated. We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it inflicts on the disability community. Respectfully Submitted, MARTY FORD, Senior Executive Officer, Public Policy. 
AUTISTIC SELFADVOCACY NETWORK , Washington, DC, January 30, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Office of the Democratic Leader, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : The Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) urges you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ‘‘Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.’’ This rule would require the Social Security Administration to forward the names of all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The Autistic Self Advocacy Network is a nationwide 501(c)(3) advocacy organization run by and for autistic people ourselves. ASAN promotes public education and public policies that are aimed at eliminating stigmatizing attitudes and increasing autistic Americans’ access to all aspects of the community. Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network conveyed its opposition to the rule through a letter to the Obama Administration and through the public comment process, in addition to joining in public comments as a member of the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities Rights Task Force. We—and many other disability rights organizations—opposed the rule for a number of reasons, including: 1) The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive assistance from representative payees in managing their benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions. 2) The absence of any data suggesting that there is any connection between the need for a representative payee to manage one’s Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward gun violence. 3) The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior to the SSA’s transmittal of names to the NICS database. Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to transmit the names of individuals who have been ‘‘adjudicated’’ to lack the capacity to manage their own affairs, SSA’s process does not constitute an adjudication and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly unable to Manage their own affairs. Based on similar concerns, the National Council on Disability, an independent federal agency charged with advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule. We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it inflicts on the disability community. Sincerely, SAMANTHA CRANE , Director of Public Policy, Autistic SelfAdvocacy Network. COUNCIL FOR CITIZENS  AGAINST GOVERNMENT WASTE , Washington, DC, February 1, 2017. House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE , You will soon consider a number of resolutions that will disapprove rules offered within the last six months of the Obama Administration, pursuant to the Congressional Review Act. On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I urge you to support the following resolutions: Rep. Bill Johnson’s (ROhio) resolution to disapprove the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Stream Protection rule. The rule rewrites more than 400 regulations, while threatening onethird of the nation’s coal mining workforce. The rule would also override preferable existing regulations at both the state and federal level. Rep. Bill Huizenga’s (RMich.) resolution to disapprove the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rule, ‘‘Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers.’’ The SEC, whose mission is to maintain efficient markets, estimates compliance of the rule could reach $591 million annually. The rule also fails to protect investors and prevents capital formation. Rep. Sam Johnson’s (RTexas) resolution to disapprove a rule promulgated by the Social Security Administration relating to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). This rule misinterprets the NICS Improvements Amendment Act, and it allows disability or Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries to be deemed ‘‘mental defectives’’ in NICS without any due process as required by law. Rep Virginia Foxx’s (RN.C.) resolution to disapprove the socalled ‘‘blacklisting’’ rule promulgated by the Department of Defense, General Services Administration, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. This rule requires employers bidding on federal contracts to disclose both violations and alleged violations of state and federal labor laws for every contract bid, and to update that information every six months during the contract. This rule unnecessarily drives up the cost of projects, violates due process, and puts small business at a disadvantage. Rep. Rob Bishop’s (RUtah) resolution to disapprove the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) Venting and Flaring rule. This rule is an example of agency overreach, as BLM lacks the statutory authority to regulate air quality. Further, the rule fails to address BLM’s real problem: a backlog of permits for the pipelines, in turn forcing the methane companies to vent and flare gases wastefully. It is critical that Congress removes as many of the ‘‘midnight regulations’’ as possible forced on taxpayers by the previous administration. All votes on these resolutions will be among those considered for CCAGW’s 2017 Congressional Ratings. Sincerely, TOMSCHATZ . President. 
DISABILITY LAWCENTER , Anchorage, AK, January 25, 2017. Re: Social Security ‘‘Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007’’. Sen. LISAMURKOWSKI , Anchorage, Alaska. Sen. DANSULLIVAN , Anchorage, Alaska. Congressman DONYOUNG , Anchorage, Alaska. DEARSENATORS MURKOWSKI AND SULLIVAN , 
ANDCONGRESSMAN YOUNG : This past summer, our office commented on Social Security’s propsal to report certain beneficiaries to the federal firearms database. A copy of these comments is attached. Despite those comments, and many others, the agency went ahead with its proposal. 81 Fed. Reg. 91702 (December 19, 2016). According to press reports today, you will soon have before you a joint resolution disapproving these new regulations. This is to urge you carefully to consider, and, if appropriate, pass this joint resolution. This is not a situation where Congress would be asserting its political will over an agency that carefully analyzed the comments on its proposed regulations and responded to those comments in a thoughtful way. Instead, in its responses to comments, Social Security: 1) Simply failed to take into account that its disability determination process does not purport to decide whether someone is a ‘‘mental defective,’’ that Social Security is not the kind of ‘‘court, board, commission, or other lawful authority’’ that makes such findings, and that written decisions saying that someone qualifies for benefits typically do not mention whether the person meets or equals the mental Listings, thus omitting information necessary for people to decide whether to appeal. 81 Fed. Reg. at 91703. 2) Relied, repeatedly, for its legal analysis on a DOJ Guidance that has not been published anywhere, let alone published in the Federal Register. 81 Fed. Reg. at 91703, 91704, 91706. 3) Responded to the suggestion that people might not apply for disability benefits they deserved because they would be reported to the database by saying that the reason they were on the database would be kept private, so they would not be ‘‘stigmatized’’ or ‘‘embarrassed.’’ 81 Fed. Reg. at 91707. It isn’t a matter of stigmas or embarrassments. It’s a matter of wanting to own a firearm and being discouraged from applying for benefits because you know that if you get benefits you may lose your property. 4) Agreed that the process can assign someone a representative payee even though the person is competent, 81 Fed. Reg. at 91709–10, but did not see that this fact ought to keep that person from going onto the federal firearms database; and 5) Completely failed to analyze whether putting someone on the database restricts Alaskan subsistence activities as protected by ANILCA. This is agency decisionmaking that is, for want of a better word, wrong. It deserves to be analyzed and rejected under the Congressional Review Act. Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as the ACLU said: ‘‘We oppose this rule because it advances and reinforces the harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent. There is no data to support a connection between the need for a representative payee to manage one’s Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward gun violence.’’ Mr. Speaker, we must act today to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of H.J. Res. 40, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have always been a strong ally of the disability community and have paid close attention to the concerns many have had with this rule. I’m proud to have been the lead sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, 
which opened doors of independence, access, opportunity, and equity for millions of Americans with differing abilities. In Congress, Democrats have put forward commonsense gun safety laws that would prevent violent and dangerous individuals with mental disabilities from purchasing firearms. However, the Republicanled Congress would not allow even a vote on such legislation. President Obama took a series of limited steps within his authority, one of which was this rule, whose aim has been to prevent those who shouldn’t have guns from obtaining them. I believe that, absent action from Congress to enhance our background check system, this rule represents an imperfect but necessary step. It is imperfect because it stigmatizes the disability community unfairly and needs a stronger appeals process to protect the rights of those who fall under its purview. I disagree with the premise that having a mental disability that precludes independent management of one’s finances correlates with a heightened risk of violence. I have read the rule and recognize that it was written in a narrow way so that it applies only to those with severe mental illnesses. I’ve had many discussions over the past several days with leaders in the disability community. I’ve grappled with the very difficult questions this resolution poses and ultimately decided that, given these circumstances, the best step right now is to oppose this resolution. I look forward to working closely with the disability community and gun safety advocates to push for Congress to take up legislation that keeps all Americans safe from gun violence while protecting the rights of those with differing abilities. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this misguided resolution that will only imperil the lives of more Americans. In 2007, this body passed the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Improvement bill with a unanimous voice vote. We all agreed that the background check system needed better information, especially after dangerous individuals slipped through the cracks and were able to purchase guns they never should have been allowed to buy in the first place. Like Jared Loughner, who killed six people in Arizona who were at a grocery store to meet our colleague Gabby Giffords. He passed background checks even though he had a history of drug use and disturbing behavior that should have been in the system. So the Obama Administration, at Congress’s direction wrote this rule to make sure that federal mental health records make their way into the background check system, so that it can effectively deny purchases to individuals who are already prohibited from buying guns. And let’s be clear about what we’re talking about. This rule only affects those with very severe, longterm mental disorders, and who have been identified by doctors and psychologists as severely mentally disabled. It does not paint disability recipients with a broad brush. 8.8 million Americans receive Social Security disability benefits, yet SSA estimates only 75,000 would meet the criteria under this rule. That is less than one percent. Let’s also be clear: this resolution is an attempt to hamstring our federal agencies and to keep them from improving the background check system. Rather than work with a new administrator to improve the rule, the Majority would rather have no rule at all because this bill not only repeals this background check improvement rule, it also prohibits the federal government from issuing a similar rule in the future. We’ve got it backwards. We shouldn’t be repealing gun safety rules, we should be strengthening them. Gun violence is an epidemic in this country and we have done literally nothing in Congress about it since Republicans took the majority in the House in 2011. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this bill that uses dangerous procedure to advance dangerous policy to erode our important firearms background check system and undermine public safety. In response to the tragic mass shooting at Virginia Tech, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Improvement Amendment Act was passed by Congress unanimously and signed into law by President Bush because everyone agreed that we need federal and State agencies to submit relevant information to maintain an accurate, effective system. This bill directly undermines public safety by permanently blocking a federal agency from submitting records to this critical safeguard system. I know the high cost of gun violence on families and communities. I know that policy makers have an obligation to address public safety carefully and responsibly. Reasonable people can disagree about whether the rule by the Social Security Administration struck the right balance between the threshold and process reporting to the background system. While opponents have raised some concerns about whether there is sufficient due process in this rule, the solution is not to block the rule entirely. Rather, the solution is to fix it. Therefore, I oppose this CRA because it would permanently prohibit the Social Security Administration from ever reporting individuals to this critical safety system, which is an extreme, dangerous, irresponsible, and irreversible action that threatens the safety of our communities. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 71, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint resolution. The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, AND THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 74, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 37) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 74, the joint resolution is considered read. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: 
H.J. R ES. 37 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (published at 81 Fed. Reg. 58562 (August 25, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force or effect. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Utah (Mr. CHAFFETZ ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. 
Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 37. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the resolution. During the past 8 years, the number of newly issued regulations and the costs of those regulations have surged. By the prior administration’s own estimates, Federal regulations promulgated over the last 10 years alone have imposed a cost of more than $100 billion annually on American taxpayers. H.J. Res. 37, which we are considering today under the Congressional Review Act procedures, represents an important step toward rolling back this tsunami of rules. Once a CRA resolution of disapproval for a rule is enacted, agencies cannot reissue the rule or any substantially similar rules in the future. H.J. Res. 37 revokes the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule, otherwise known as the blacklisting rule. I want to thank Chairwoman FOXX for her leadership on this resolution of 
disapproval. I also want to recognize my fellow original cosponsors, Mr. CHABOT and Mr. M ITCHELL , for their leadership on this issue as well. I want to highlight the impact of this rule on the Federal acquisition system as well as contractors. This rule requires Federal contractors to report violations and alleged violations of 14 Federal labor laws and undefined equivalent State labor laws for the previous 3 years. Contractors must collect and report this information every time they submit a proposal for a contract and then every 6 months during the contract performance. Then Federal contract officers consult with their agency’s newly created agency labor compliance adviser before determining if a contractor is eligible for a contract award. There are a number of reasons this rule should be revoked. The Federal acquisition system is already a very complex, inefficient system. This contractor blacklisting rule is exactly the type of requirement an already complex Federal acquisition system does not need. The rule adds another contractor clause to an increasingly long list of clauses in every Federal contract. It slows down a process that already has trouble delivering goods and services in a timely manner. It increases the burden on Federal contract officers who have to review and assess the significant volume of information and take on the role of labor law experts. The rule imposes significant costs on contractors, which means the government, which ultimately means the taxpayers. The rule itself is estimated to cost contractors and subcontractors more than $458 million in the first year and $413 million in the second year of its implementation. Some experts believe the government underestimated these costs. The cost to establish a new information collection, reporting, and assessment system to comply with the rule would be prohibitively expensive for most contractors, especially the small contractors. Mr. Speaker, this is where the rubber meets the road. It is these small contractors. In fiscal year 2016, the Federal Government spent more than $470 billion contracting for goods and services. We need to be looking for ways to reduce, not increase, spending in this area. The rule discourages competition and reduces access to innovation. The last thing we need to do for the Federal acquisition system is to discourage competition and innovation, particularly for first time participants who want to join the Federal marketplace. There are already so many barriers to entry, particularly for these small businesses. So think about the small business at home. They want to compete for these Federal contractors. They may be a very small organization. Even after we pass the resolution of disapproval, there are still rules, there are still laws, and there are still a lot of burdens that they have to deal with. But I want to cite some Bloomberg data about the number of first time Federal vendors. We have fallen to a 10 year low—down 24 percent in 2007 to only 13 percent in 2016. What that means is the big are probably getting bigger, but the small guy, the mom, the pop, and the woman who is starting a new business and wants to compete for these Federal contracts don’t have a fighting chance. For the Federal Government to put more burdens on there, especially things that haven’t been substantiated, is just not fair, and it is just not right. b1445 The rule duplicates existing labor enforcement mechanisms to hold contractors accountable and, therefore, I believe, is not necessary. Revoking this rule will not leave Federal contractors free to violate labor laws. To the contrary, the Department of Labor has significant oversight and investigation resources to enforce the Federal labor law. Further, if there is a badapple contractor not complying with the law, contract officers already have the authority to refer contractors for suspension and disbarment. This rule raises due process and First Amendment concerns. One of the most disturbing parts of the rule is that contractors would be required to report alleged violations—not confirmed—just the alleged violations of the 14 Federal labor laws, and the undefined equivalent of State labor laws. It deprives contractors of their legal rights to challenge such allegations. The reporting requirement covers non final administrative merits determinations without regard to the severity of the alleged violation. Contractors would have to disclose National Labor Relations Board complaints, OSHA citations, EEOC non final letters of determination, even though these cases have not been adjudicated and the record is incomplete. Contractors challenged this rule in Federal Court, and the judge, in granting a preliminary injunction for the rule, found this reporting requirement could also impact contractors’ First Amendment rights. The judge said that the rule could result in compelled speech by requiring contractors to report allegations that would cause a reputational harm, particularly if after adjudication the allegation is found to be without merit. This rule increases costs, complexity, and reduces competition in the Federal acquisition system. We are having trouble getting new entrants in to compete as contractors, and, therefore, I urge the support of the passage of H.J. Res. 37. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution which would disapprove of the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule that was finalized in August of 2016. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires Federal contractors to be ‘‘responsible,’’ to have a satisfactory record of integrity, and business ethics. The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule would require Federal contractors to selfreport on violations of 14 fundamental Federal labor and nondiscrimination laws. This includes laws like the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA; the Fair Labor Standards Act; the Family and Medical Leave Act; and the Civil Rights Act. These Federal laws apply to all businesses in the United States, and a vast majority of Federal contractors comply with them as well. Unfortunately, studies by the GAO, the Center for American Progress, and others show that there are a few bad apples that consistently violate these fundamental Federal labor laws, yet continue to be awarded Federal contracts. That is just plain wrong. Americans’ tax dollars should not go to contractors who persistently and willfully violate such laws. It also puts contractors who do obey the law at an unfair disadvantage because they willingly bear the cost of compliance to provide safe and fair workplaces. The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule would also improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Federal acquisition process by promoting healthy and productive workplaces. As the final rule notes, ‘‘Contractors that consistently adhere to labor laws are more likely to have workplace practices that enhance productivity and increase the likelihood of timely, predictable, and satisfactory delivery of goods and services.’’ This rule should be a winwin. It helps the Federal Government ensure compliance with fundamental labor and nondiscrimination laws and, at the same time, improve the efficiency of the Federal contracting process. I urge our Members to vote ‘‘no’’ on this illconceived disapproval resolution. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BOBBY SCOTT), the ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, be allowed to control the time on this side. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Maryland? There was no objection. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), the lead sponsor of the joint resolution and the chair of the committee. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for yielding time. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to stand up for workers, taxpayers, and small businesses. We all agree employers who do business with the Federal Government should be held to high standards, and their employees deserve strong protections. That is why for decades the Federal Government has had a system in place to deny contracts to employers who violate Federal labor laws. Time and again, Republicans in Congress urged the Obama administration to enforce the current system to ensure workers receive fair pay and safe workplaces. Instead, the previous administration did the exact opposite. It went in search of a problem that doesn’t exist. It took its eye off the ball, and we are here today to demand better. The Obama blacklisting rule empowers government agencies to deny employers Federal contracts for alleged violations of various Federal labor laws and similar State laws. That is right. Under this rule, bureaucrats can determine employers are guilty until proven innocent, and then deny them the ability to do business with the Federal Government. This is one important reason why a Federal district judge recently blocked implementation of the rule because it would have a chilling effect on the due process rights of American citizens. But that is not the only reason why we are here today. Rather than streamline the procurement process to better protect taxpayers and workers, the Obama administration added new layers of red tape on to a system plagued by delays and inefficiencies. Simply put, this rule is a bureaucratic nightmare. It turns our already complex Federal procurement process into a convoluted regulatory maze. Despite what our Democrat colleagues will claim, this rule will actually hurt workers by making a system designed for their protection less efficient. Lawabiding smallbusiness owners, the backbone of our Nation’s economy, will be less inclined to bid on Federal contracts. As a result, we will see less competition in the Federal contracting process. With less competition, hardworking taxpayers will be forced to pay more for goods and services provided to the U.S. Government. Perhaps most concerning is the threat this rule poses to our national security. Higher costs and a delayed contracting process will jeopardize the resources our Armed Services depend on to keep our Nation safe. With men and women currently stationed in harm’s way, this is simply unacceptable. If workers, taxpayers, and small businesses stand to lose, then who stands to gain? The answer is Big Labor. Union leaders often file frivolous legal complaints to gain leverage against employers. This is just one more partisan rule that stacks the deck in favor of union leaders. The facts are clear: this rule is fatally flawed. It is not in the best interest of workers, smallbusiness owners, our military or hardworking taxpayers. It is also unnecessary, but you don’t have to take my word for it. Last October, our colleagues in the Congressional Progressive Caucus— Representatives KEITH ELLISON and RAU´LGRIJALVA said: ‘‘The Department of Labor has full authority under current law to hold Federal contractors accountable.’’ I could not agree more. In fact, that is what Republicans have been saying all along. I urge my colleagues to stand up for workers, smallbusiness owners, taxpayers, and our national security by supporting this commonsense resolution. Then let’s work together to ensure existing policies are enforced and workers have the protections they deserve. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) be permitted to control the remainder of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Ms. FOXX. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Before I address the disapproval resolution, I just want to acknowledge the important role Federal contractors have in meeting the needs of the Federal Government. Employment and critical services in many districts, including my own, are heavily reliant on Federal contractors, including those who serve a critical role for our Nation, supporting the needs of the military, the Coast Guard, Homeland Security, and many others. That said, it is imperative that contractors are bidding on a level playing field when they compete for contracts. Unfortunately, this resolution would effectively reward contractors who cut corners, endanger the rights of their workers, and, studies show, compromise quality. Although most Federal contractors obey labor laws, studies by the GAO, the Senate HELP Committee, and others document that Federal contractors with histories of serious, willful, and repeated violations of labor employment and nondiscrimination laws continue to be rewarded with Federal contracts. For context, it is important to know that contracting rules already require agencies to determine whether or not a prospective contractor is responsible before awarding a contract. Amongst the criteria considered is whether or not the contractor has ‘‘a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics,’’ and ‘‘a satisfactory performance record.’’ As previous speakers have noted, violations can already be considered. However, contracting officers don’t have access to a list of those violations until this rule is issued, nor are contracting officers required to review a bidder’s labor violations history. The rule implementing the executive order on Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces does not add any extra layers of review. Rather, it would fill that data gap by requiring contractors to disclose whether they have violations of 14 longstanding labor laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, OSHA, Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act, and nondiscrimination laws. It only applies to contracts over $500,000, so we are not talking about momandpop operations. But if listing those violations of fair pay and safe workplace laws constitutes an administrative burden, more the reason to make them be listed. They are to be disclosed. And although we have heard about allegations, and although some violations may not be final, the only thing that has to be disclosed are those violations for which there has been an agency determination. That is, an allegation is made, it is investigated, and the company has been found to be in violation. It may be on appeal or whatnot, but there has at least been an agency determination of guilt. The rule requires contracting officers to focus on whether such violations are serious, repeated, willful or pervasive. The rule helps bring those contractors with a history of violations into compliance by way of labor compliance agreements so they can continue to be considered for contracting opportunities while they improve their records. Some have mislabeled this rule as the ‘‘blacklisting rule,’’ but this suggestion and characterization ignores the rules’ meaningful compliance provision. The reality is that this rule would, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, encourage agency contract officials to push bidders with serious labor law violations ‘‘to enter into labor compliance agreements’’ rather than to disbar or suspend them. I want to point out that a coalition of 20,000 construction contractors submitted testimony to the Small Business Committee where they wrote: ‘‘Employers—primes and subs have more rights, remedies and redress for nonresponsibility determinations based on lack of integrity or business ethics under the executive order than the current Federal Acquisition Regulation procedures specifically provide.’’ Now, this testimony suggests that the rules are far more contractor friendly than the detractors have characterized. It would be premature to dismantle this rule because it hasn’t even been put into effect because it has been under a court injunction. Further, repealing the rule under the CRA would bar future consideration of substantially similar rules unless Congress enacts subsequent enabling legislation. 
So the bottom line is that there are winners and there are losers if this legislation passes. The winners, if this legislation passes, would be companies who willfully, and repeatedly, and pervasively violate labor laws. The winners would be the contractors who cut corners and gain an unfair competitive advantage over lawabiding contractors. b1500 The losers will be workers who are employed by Federal contractors. They will be more susceptible to wage theft, unfair working conditions, and unsafe workplaces run by unscrupulous contractors. Losers will be the lawabiding contractors who lose contracts because they abide by the laws protecting their workers. This is why the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule enjoys support from a widespread number of businesses, veterans, civil rights, and labor organizations from the Easterseals to Paralyzed Veterans of America, to the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. That is why I oppose this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ), the chair of the Committee on Small Business. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 37. I want to commend my colleague from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for her leadership in sponsoring this measure. I am proud to be a cosponsor. The blacklisting rule is a textbook example of executive overreach that became standard operating procedure during the previous administration. Instead of using the existing suspension and debarment system to deal with bad actors, the Obama administration imposed an unnecessary regulation that placed significant burdens on all Federal contractors, even though they admitted that ‘‘the vast majority of Federal contractors play by the rules.’’ This kind of action—failing to enforce existing rules and then imposing a burdensome, redundant regulatory scheme—is exactly what frustrates the American people about Washington. We all want bad actors to be held accountable, but this rule is unnecessary red tape that punishes everyone for the actions of a few. As chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I am concerned that we already have 100,000 fewer small businesses doing business with the Federal Government than we did back in 2012. So in the second term of the Obama administration, we lost 100,000 small businesses doing business with the Federal Government across the country. That means we have less competition, and that is bad for job creators and it is bad for taxpayers alike because, when there is less competition, we pay more, so the tax dollars that we send here to Washington are not used as efficiently as they ought to be. The Committee on Small Business held several hearings and roundtables on this rule over the last 2 years, heard directly from small businesses, and examined the Obama administration’s rule very closely. What we found was quite alarming. The blacklisting rule would force innocent small businesses to settle unproven claims, disclose commercially sensitive information to their competitors, and report information the Federal Government already has. So we are going through this whole process, and the Federal Government has already got it; but they are not competent enough to use what they have already got, so they want to put it on the contractor to do even more. It makes no sense. Ultimately, this rule will result in small businesses being blacklisted from participating in Federal contracting based on accusations—just accusations—where they may ultimately be found innocent. They didn’t do anything wrong, yet they are barred from doing business with the government. Again, it makes no sense. I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 37. Passage of this joint resolution will undo a duplicative and unnecessary regulation that harms small business, hurts competition, and prevents taxpayers from getting the best bang for their buck. I again want to thank the chairwoman for her leadership in pushing this forward. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ). Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to congressional Republicans’ attempt to repeal Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces protections for Federal contract workers. We all know President Trump is no fan of transparency. He has steadfastly refused to disclose his own tax returns, so it is no surprise that he and the Republicans would oppose disclosure of labor, employment, civil rights, and nondiscrimination law violations by bidders for Federal contracts. What I really don’t understand is why Members of Congress would ask American taxpayers to subsidize companies that routinely violate our labor laws. Voting for this resolution actually rewards companies that discriminate, stiff their employees on pay, or cut corners on safety, and it puts responsible businesses that play by the rules at a disadvantage. This resolution harms women. Women make up the majority of low wage workers. Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces protections ensure that our tax dollars do not support sexual harassment and sex discrimination on the job, regular occurrences especially for lowwage working women. This resolution harms veterans, including disabled veterans. Repeal means that we won’t know whether a contract bidder routinely violates section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, which Paralyzed Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans, and Vets First say is ‘‘necessary to prevent discrimination in the workplace and during the hiring process.’’ This resolution also harms older workers. To quote AARP: ‘‘ . . . age discrimination in the workplace persists as a serious and pervasive problem. The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order is the first executive order since 1964 addressing the obligation of those who receive federal contracts not to discriminate on the basis of age.’’ If you don’t want your taxpayer dollars to be used to undermine Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces protections, then all Members should oppose this resolution. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to our distinguished colleague from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ). Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 37. I am proud to join Chairwoman FOXX and Chairmen CHAFFETZ and C HABOT as an original cosponsor. H.J. Res. 37 would void the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule, commonly known as the blacklisting rule. The blacklisting rule is an additional layer of Federal bureaucracy that crushes the ability of small and midsize companies to compete for Federal contracts and adversely impacts timing and efficient procurement while massively increasing costs. The blacklisting rule requires Federal contractors to report violations, including alleged violations of 14 Federal labor laws and equivalent State laws, over the previous 3 years. Contractors have to collect that information from all of their subcontractors, and they are liable for that information, placing a huge administrative burden on those contractors. Also, not only when they bid for the contract, but every 6 months, they must renew that information. Federal contract officers—by the way, there are over 37,000 of them, an amazing number—would then be required to consult with newly created labor compliance advisers. Yes, it creates more bureaucrats. The final rule, itself, estimates costs for contractors and subcontractors of more than $458 million in the first year—a half a billion dollars—and more than $413 million in the second year. Amazing costs. This compliance cost is catastrophic for small and midsize businesses. Those who deny workers basic protections are already protected by the suspension and debarment process. The blacklisting rule is simply another bureaucratic hoop. In 2015, nearly 1,000 suspensions and 2,000 debarments were undertaken. Put simply, the suspension and debarment system has worked to protect workers and government. 
Moreover, the rule requires contractors and subcontractors to report on alleged labor law violations and violations that have not been fully adjudicated. A business could be deemed ineligible for a Federal contract, or blacklisted, because the contractor reported alleged labor law violations while still exercising their legal right to pursue adjudication. That is antithetical to our Constitution. H.J. Res. 37 will remove a regulation that raises serious due process concerns, duplicates existing enforcement mechanisms, increases the cost of Federal contracting, and expands the Federal bureaucracy. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ), the vice ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.J. Res. 37. President Obama’s Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule reinforces employment protections and laws that help veterans, individuals with disabilities, older Americans, minorities, and LGBTQ workers. It protects workers in our country so they receive a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work. This rule was passed in response to discovering that billions of taxpayer dollars went to companies that violated Federal workplace laws. A contractor who cheats workers out of their pay, endangers their safety at work, or engages in discriminatory practices should be required at least to disclose this information when bidding for Federal contracts. Taxpayer dollars should not support the exploitation of workers. That is just common sense. The resolution before us would also remove critical protections for workers that allow them to access our judicial system. The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule bans forced arbitration in workplace discrimination and sexual assault cases for contracts of $1 million or greater, a policy already in place at the Department of Defense that was enacted with broad bipartisan support in 2010. Workers deserve the opportunity to have their day in court to seek justice for their sexual assault and discrimination claims. I oppose this resolution to disapprove of these protections because it gives serial law violators a free pass at the cost of workers’ safety, and it disadvantages the lawabiding contractors in Oregon and across the country who follow our Nation’s laws. H.J. Res. 37 before us today would reward unlawful and discriminatory conduct. I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for introducing this legislation and sponsoring it. I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 37. We all agree that bad actors who deny workers basic protections and violate the Fair Labor Standards Act should not be rewarded with government contracts funded by taxpayer dollars. However, the Department of Labor’s rule effectively blacklists Federal contractors for alleged violations and would require contractors to defend themselves against these allegations without being entitled to a formal hearing. The Federal District Court has already ruled that the Department of Labor rule violates contractors’ due process rights. Additionally, this rule is unnecessary because the Department of Labor already has significant oversight and investigation capabilities to assess contractor compliance with Federal labor laws. This rule supersedes agencies’ existing authority to hold contractors accountable under the current suspension and disbarment system. My question is why don’t they use it? Misguided regulatory policies, like the blacklisting rule, don’t stop bad actors, but they do end up adding new layers of redundant bureaucratic red tape, harming employers and older workers, disabled workers, female workers, minority workers, and workers, in general, alike. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution of disapproval and roll back this duplicative and unnecessary rule. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, can you advise both sides how much time is remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 171⁄2minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from North Carolina has 12
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS ), a member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD two letters from organizations that have long led the fight for workers’ rights: the AFL–CIO and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. 
AFL–CIO, February 1, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : The AFL–CIO urges you to oppose the Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval of the regulations implementing the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order. The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces regulations implement the commonsense proposition that companies wanting to receive lucrative taxpayerfunded government contracts should comply with the law and respect workers’ rights. The Executive Order and implementing regulations establish a process for reviewing the records of companies bidding for federal business and ensuring that companies that receive this business comply with the law and respect workers’ rights. The regulations improve the contracting process and establish more fairness, so that companies that respect workers’ rights do not have a competitive disadvantage when competing against companies that cheat by misclassifying their workers as independent contractors, ignoring health and safety hazards, or engaging in wage theft. Repealing these regulations will remove an important incentive for companies to pay their workers what they are due, protect their health and safety, and comply with the law. The regulations are needed because the current procurement system does an inadequate job screening prospective contractors and their compliance (or noncompliance) with the law. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, federal contracts have been awarded to companies with significant records of violating wage and hour, health and safety, and other worker protection laws. A report by the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions similarly found that the government regularly awards federal contracts to companies with significant violations of worker protection laws. Wiping out these regulations using the Congressional Review Act is a draconian and unnecessary act. If Congress adopts this resolution, agencies will be forever barred from adopting similar regulations in the future. This is overkill. If Congress has concerns about aspects of the regulations, it can work with the Trump Administration to modify those provisions through the regular rulemaking process. Congress should not use the blunt instrument of the CRA to wipe out the rules and prevent their adoption in the future. Sincerely, WILLIAM SAMUEL , Director. Government Affairs Department. 
[From the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Feb. 2, 2017] ROLLBACK OF ‘FAIR AND SAFEWORKPLACES ’ WILLHURTWORKERS , REWARD BADACTORS  
RESCINDING EXECUTIVE ORDER  WASHINGTON .—The following is a statement from Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa on the House of Representative’s consideration of legislation later today that would roll back the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order issued by President Obama in 2014 and instituted last year. ‘‘Federal government contractors receive taxpayer dollars to provide a service or product. And as part of that agreement, they should be expected to follow the law when it comes to the workplace and their employees. When they don’t, they hurt working families, they gain unfair advantage over companies that play by the rules, and they should be held accountable for their actions. ‘‘That’s what the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order that took effect last August ensures. There is nothing controversial about it. Lawmakers should want workers to receive the paychecks they earn, be safe on the job and not be discriminated against. ‘‘Taxpayer money should not be handed to companies that blatantly violate labor and workplace laws. If elected representatives are as truly interested in standing up for workers as they claim, they will stop efforts to overturn rules that protect employee pay and ensure workers can provide for their families.’’ Founded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.4 million hardworking men and women throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, before entering public office, I was an electrician. I used to work on top of bridges doing very dangerous work. Imagine climbing 150 feet up over 
water. But over the course of that career, three times, there were gentlemen I worked with who never went home, never clocked out, never went home to see their wife or their children. Every day, 13 Americans are killed on the job; they didn’t go home to see their wife, their children, their husband. Sometimes accidents are unavoidable, but many, many times they aren’t, and that is what we are talking about here. b1515 The rule doesn’t talk about hurting companies. We are talking about basic information, the same information that everybody in this room would ask if they were building an addition on their house. You would want to know, if you were spending $10,000, whether or not that contractor had any violations, did he finish the job, were people killed on the job. But when we are spending $81 billion of the American taxpayer, somehow we don’t want to know that. If you go for a loan, they want to know what your background is, even if you had given it ten times before. If you are going to college, they certainly want to know your background. So what we are talking about here is simple transparency. It is not just about workplace safety. It is about giving a free pass for something that they did wrong. Let me repeat that. Something that contractors did wrong. If they did nothing wrong, they have nothing to fear. That is why I stand in opposition to this rule. When I vote against this legislation, I want everybody in this room to think about 13 men and women who aren’t going home tonight, who wouldn’t have to tell anybody that they were killed on their jobs. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ), my distinguished colleague. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairwoman for yielding, and for her leadership on our committee. I rise today to offer my strong support for H.J. Res. 37. This legislation is about protecting our Nation’s workers, small businesses, and taxpayers. As a former labor and employment attorney, I have seen the maze that businesses must jump through in order to become a Federal contractor. Well, this rule would only make things that much harder for them. This regulation, due to the price of compliance, could force small and mediumsized businesses, who can’t afford to hire a massive legal team, out of being able to get contracts with the Federal Government. This rule will add subjectivity to the Federal procurement process and deprive contractors of due process rights. As an attorney, I take that threat very seriously. We should be in the business of supporting policies to make it easier for these kinds of businesses to get new work, not harder. Now, Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues on the other side say this is just about punishing bad actors. But this rule would require Federal contractors to disclose even alleged violations of wrongdoing, regardless of whether or not there is any credibility to the claims. Right now, there are effective policies in place to prevent bad actors and contractors that break the law from receiving government contracts. This could be especially damaging for employers who are the target of union organizing campaigns, or in a situation where a competitor files a claim in an effort to gain a competitive advantage. It elevates the risk of frivolous complaints and the loss of business. Instead of muddying the water and making it harder for our Nation’s small and mediumsized businesses, let’s use the current framework, not a new burdensome regulation, to enforce the law and hold any bad actors accountable. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution to block an overreaching and counterproductive rule. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to overturning the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule under the Congressional Review Act. Undoing this rule would once again allow unethical Federal contractors to collect billions of dollars from taxpayers while stealing from, endangering, and discriminating against their employees. Right outside this building, on January 20, President Trump promised to give power back to the people and empower everyday Americans. I do not understand how allowing Federal contractors to hide records of wage theft, safety violations, and discrimination keeps that promise. I am particularly concerned with what repealing this rule will mean for our Nation’s veterans. Because Federal contractors are encouraged to employ the men and women who have served, they will be greatly affected if we let companies off the hook for repeatedly violating workplace laws. In addition, President Obama’s executive order helps to guarantee that Federal contractors comply with longstanding law that protects veterans and people with disabilities from discrimination in the workplace. It also encourages contractors to recruit, hire, promote, and retain these individuals. This is why the Paralyzed Veterans of America wrote a letter to the Speaker and minority leader asking that they oppose this resolution to ensure fair and safe working conditions for our veterans. PVA was also joined in a separate letter by Vietnam Veterans of America and disability advocates, including Easterseals, the American Association of People with Disabilities, and dozens more opposing the resolution we are debating today. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  both letters. 
PARALYZED VETERANS OF AMERICA , Washington, DC, January 30, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House of Representatives, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : Paralyzed Veterans of America urges you to reject a Congressional Review Act (CRA) disapproval resolution of the 2016 Federal Acquisition Regulation rule designed to reduce employment discrimination against people with disabilities and veterans, including those with serviceconnected disabilities. PVA is the nation’s only Congressionallychartered veterans’ service organization solely dedicated to representing veterans with spinal cord injuries and/or diseases. Disapproving this rule will weaken important nondiscrimination and affirmative hiring provisions intended for people with disabilities and veterans. For more than four decades, individuals with disabilities and veterans have been protected by federal laws against discrimination in employment with employers that do business with the federal government. In addition, these landmark laws (Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974) have required large federal contractors to take affirmative action to recruit, hire, promote, and retain these individuals, who traditionally face higher unemployment rates than their peers. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (81 Fed. Reg. 58562)—that is being targeted by this CRA resolution of disapproval—simply ensures that companies that want to do business with the federal government disclose whether they have been in violation of these longstanding requirements. Please ensure that veterans and other individuals with disabilities are not denied fair and equal employment opportunities by voting against the CRA resolution of disapproval of the Federal Acquisition Regulation published at 81 Fed. Reg. 58562. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, CARLBLAKE , Associate Executive Director.

DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADER PELOSI : The undersigned members of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) and our allies urge you to reject a Congressional Review Act (CRA) disapproval resolution of the 2016 Federal Acquisition Regulation rule designed to reduce employment discrimination against people with disabilities and veterans, including those with serviceconnected disabilities. CCD is the largest coalition of national organizations working together to advocate for Federal public policy that ensures the self determination, independence, empowerment, integration and inclusion of children and adults with disabilities in all aspects of society.

Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government, which spends billions of dollars contracting with private companies every year, has an obligation to demonstrate and promote responsible behavior. We should not be in the business of working with contractors who repeatedly violate our Nation’s labor laws, particularly when they harm the veterans who have served our Nation so bravely. Repealing this rule sends the wrong message to employers, the wrong message to veterans, and the wrong message to hardworking Americans who deserve to be treated with respect in the workplace. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a list of organizations supporting this disapproval resolution. 
LETTERS IN SUPPORT OF H.J. R ES. 37 Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM). Other Stakeholders (19 signatories): Aerospace Industries Association, American Council of Engineering Companies, American Foundry Society, American Hotel & Lodging Association, American Trucking Association, Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc., Associated General Contractors, College and University Professional Association for Human Resources (CUPA–HR), HR Policy Association, Independent Electrical Contractors, Information Technology Alliance for the Public Sector, International Foodservice Distributors Association, National Association of Manufacturers, National Defense Industrial Association, Professional Services Council, Society for Human Resource Management, The Coalition for Government Procurement, U.S Chamber of Commerce, WorldatWork. Ms. FOXX. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT ), a member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague and ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, Mr. SCOTT, for yielding. I stand here in opposition to this resolution, which looks to undo rules that provide safety and fairness in the workplace. The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule speaks for itself. It ensures that contractors entrusted with taxpayer dollars cannot exploit their workers and that repeated lawbreakers do not get a competitive advantage. This standard does not impose extra regulations on contractors. It simply requires that they follow the law. These laws make sure women are paid the same wages for the same work. They make sure that employers are paying a fair rate for overtime work. They protect employees with disabilities. And they protect workers who are victims of sexual assault or sexual harassment by ensuring those individuals have an opportunity to be heard. A 2013 Senate report found that government contractors are often among the worst violators of the workplace safety, wage, and hour laws. Nearly one in three companies with the worst safety and wage violations are Federal contractors. Americans working for Federal contractors lose up to $2.5 billion each year to violations of minimum wage laws alone. This is unacceptable and exactly why this order was executed—to protect workers. We have a duty to our constituents, and this rule rightfully asks the Federal Government to take another look at contractors who have violated labor laws before awarding a contract. By upholding this order, we can continue to ensure that taxpayers get a fair deal for their money, something my Republican colleagues certainly should be in favor of. Some Republicans will claim that this order creates a socalled blacklist by preventing companies from receiving Federal contracts. However, the opposite is true. The order, in fact, provides new tools for contractors to come into compliance with the law. This order is in the interest of the people and our constituents who we were sent here to represent. Rolling back these protections would demonstrate that we would rather side with employers who cut legal corners by not paying a fair wage than with our constituents who work day in and day out to provide for their families. Not only will rescinding this rule hurt our constituents, but it would also hurt lawabiding companies by forcing them into unfair competition with companies that cut corners and knowingly violate the law. As we look to invest in our country’s infrastructure, I cannot think of a more important time to ensure that employees working for Federal contractors are treated fairly. This rule is an important safeguard that protects employees, and its rollback will be a disgrace. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution and the complete dismantlement of the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order. Among other worker protection benefits, President Obama’s Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order prohibits Federal contractors from using forced arbitration clauses in employment contracts involving civil, sexual assault, and harassment disputes. It directs companies with Federal contracts of $1 million or more not to require their employees to enter into predispute arbitration proceedings for disputes arising out of title VII of the Civil Rights Act or from sexual assault or harassment cases, except when valid contracts already exist. This existing order built upon existing policy that was successfully implemented at the Department of Defense, the largest Federal contracting agency, and it will help improve contractors’ compliance with labor laws. Simply put, Mr. Speaker, the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order required Federal contractors to give employees their day in court. By doing away with this order, the new administration is subjecting workers to forced arbitration, which is a private and fundamentally unfair process. Unlike the court system, which was developed through centuries of jurisprudence, forced arbitration does not provide important procedural guarantees of fairness and due process that are the hallmark of our courts. There are no requirements that witnesses testify under oath or affirmation, rules of evidence and procedure are not relied upon, the caselaw that has been developed over centuries is not used as precedent, and arbitration proceedings are often secretive, sealed, and there is no meaningful right to appeal. Behind closed doors and shrouded in secrecy, forced arbitration enables employers to conceal wrongdoing from the public and to undermine employee rights. Since 2007, I have championed the Arbitration Fairness Act, which would eliminate forced arbitration clauses in employment, consumer, and civil 
rights cases. The executive order took us one step closer. Americans deserve better than private, unaccountable tribunals that adjudicate disputes, mostly in favor of the employer. Equal access to justice for all should not be an aspiration but a guarantee for all Americans. I ask my colleagues to oppose H.J. Res. 37. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. Mr. Speaker, I just want to restate a couple of provisions. One is this underlying regulation only applies to contracts in excess of $500,000. As previously stated, this information that is to be disclosed can already be considered in contracting. This regulation makes it available so it can be considered. It is not just allegations. We are talking about agency determinations after an investigation. Now, the regulation requires consideration of the fact of whether or not a determination is final or whether it is on appeal. That is to be considered. But not all violations in the fullest of time are to be considered at all. Only those that are serious, repeated, willful, or pervasive violations of fair pay and safe workplace violations are to be considered. And so for the people who are not blacklisted, the guilty are encouraged to participate in labor compliance agreements so they can continue to receive contracts while they improve their records. b1530 In closing, Mr. Speaker, let us recall who the winners and losers are if this resolution of disapproval passes. The winners will be the unscrupulous contractors who cut corners and compromise the safety of their workers. The losers will be the workers, who are the most susceptible to wage theft and unfair working conditions, and the law abiding contractors who face unfair competition. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  three letters: one from The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, another from the American Industrial Hygiene Association, and, finally, one from a coalition of 134 business, labor, and civil society groups which stand in opposition to this resolution of disapproval. 
THELEADERSHIP CONFERENCE ON  CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS , Washington, DC, January 31, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN AND MINORITY LEADER  PELOSI : On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse membership of more than 200 national organizations to promote and protect the civil and human rights of all persons in the United States, we write in strong opposition to the use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal the regulations implementing the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order. The Fair Pay regulations represent a muchneeded step forward in ensuring that the federal contractor community is providing safe and fair workplaces for employees by encouraging compliance with federal labor and civil rights laws, and prohibiting the use of mandatory arbitration of certain disputes. Employers that have the privilege of doing business with the federal government also have a responsibility to abide by the law. The Fair Pay regulations are crucial because they help ensure that federal contractors behave responsibly and ethically with respect to labor standards and civil rights laws. They also encourage companies applying for federal contracts to comply with federal civil rights laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (which includes the Equal Pay Act), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and their state law equivalents. The Executive Order also bans contractors from forcing employees to arbitrate claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act as well as claims of sexual harassment and sexual assault. We urge you to oppose any attempts to roll back the protections that stem from the Executive Order on Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces. The Order and implementing regulations provide strong protections against the federal government contracting with employers that routinely engage in discrimination based on race, sex, age, or disability, violate workplace health and safety protections, withhold wages, or commit other labor violations. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact June Zeitlin, Director of Human Rights Policy. Sincerely, WADEHENDERSON , President & CEO. NANCY ZIRKIN , Executive Vice President. 
AIHA P ROTECTING WORKER HEALTH  January 31, 2017. EXPRESSING CONCERN FOR WORKER HEALTH & SAFETY RELATED TO H.J.R ES. 37 ‘‘D ISAPPROVING THE FINAL RULESUBMITTED BY  
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE , THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION , AND THE  NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMIN ISTRATION RELATING TO THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION ’’ DEAR US R EPRESENTATIVES : On behalf of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), I am writing to express our concern with H.J.Res. 37, which would overturn a final rule that amended the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement Executive Order 13673 ‘‘Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces’’, and is currently scheduled for consideration this week on the House floor under Suspension of the Rules. While the final rule and Executive Order address many topics, our concerns are limited to those areas dealing with worker health and safety, as these are the subjects in which AIHA and its members possess unique expertise and knowledge. Instead of a blanket repeal of this rule, AIHA encourages you to engage with occupational and environmental health and safety professionals, and others in a constructive dialogue that examines how best to improve worker health, safety, and socioeconomic prosperity—all of which are closely linked. As currently drafted, H.J.Res. 37 threatens to slow progress towards healthier and safer workplaces; as such, we encourage you to oppose its passage. Founded in 1939, AIHA is the premier association of occupational and environmental health and safety professionals. AIHA’s 8,500 members play a crucial role on the front line of worker health and safety every day. Our members represent a crosssection of industry, private business, labor, government and academia. Thank you for your consideration of AIHA’s concerns and recommendations. AIHA looks forward to working with you to help protect worker health and safety. Please feel free to contact Mark Ames, AIHA’s Director of Government Relations. Respectfully, LAWRENCE SLOAN , CAE, Chief Executive Officer, AIHA.

The Executive Order also bans contractors from forcing employees to arbitrate claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act as well as claims of sexual harassment and sexual assault. We ask you to stand with American workers and oppose any attempts to roll back the protections that stem from the Executive Order on Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces. They provide strong protections against the federal government contracting with employers that routinely violate workplace health and safety protections, engage in age, disability, race, and sex discrimination, withhold wages, or commit other labor violations.

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolution of disapproval. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, I thank my colleagues— Chairman CHAFFETZ , Chairman CHABOT , and Representative M ITCHELL—for joining us in this important effort as well as to thank my colleagues who came and spoke on this resolution. Workers deserve strong protections. The best way to ensure fair pay and safe workplaces is to enforce the existing suspension and debarment system. It is also important to remind my colleagues of what the Congressional Progressive Caucus said: 
The Department of Labor has full authority under current law to hold Federal contractors accountable. 
It is clear we don’t need more layers of red tape to prevent bad actors from receiving taxpayerfunded contracts. Creating a bureaucratic maze would only make a system less efficient that is designed to protect workers. Furthermore, the blacklisting rule would undermine the ability of small businesses to compete for Federal contracts, would increase costs for taxpayers, and would jeopardize the resources of our Armed Forces—the ones they need to keep this country safe. I urge my colleagues to block this harmful rule and vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.J. Res. 37. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Joint Resolution 37, which annuls a poorlywritten regulation put in place by the Obama administration. We need to clean up the regulations that the previous administration imposed upon American business. We need to reform them, and ensure that they serve a useful purpose. This is especially important for the Department of Defense and NASA. The regulation in question does not allow contractors to exercise their right of due process. Rather than letting our legal system provide justice, American companies could be blacklisted by contracting agencies if ‘‘preliminary determinations’’ had been made against them. This is not how our justice system works. Perhaps that is why this regulation was halted by a nationwide injunction. We should protect American workers. The regulation we strike today was poorly crafted, and it would ultimately do America’s workforce more harm than good. As Chairman of the Science Committee, I know that such a regulation would impede NASA from carrying out its mission of exploration and place an unnecessary cost on taxpayers by diminishing competition. NASA should not be hampered by such unnecessary regulations and needs to focus its resources on the challenges of outer space exploration. The Federal procurement process cannot afford to be bogged down with defective regulations. Congress must clean up how our government does business to ensure that it is just and efficient. I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, we often tell young people that if they work hard and play by the rules, their efforts will be rewarded. Yet this unjust resolution fails to put our federal government’s money where its mouth is. It will ensure that our tax dollars continue to go to companies that fail to live up to their end of this bargain. Time and again, reports have cited the glaring frequency with which serial labor law violators receive federal contracts. In the mid1990s, GAO identified dozens of companies of violating core workplace protections, like the National Labor Relations Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. And these abuses have continued. Reports in 2010 and 2013 again found that companies with significant labor citations continued to receive federal contracts. The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule makes certain that our agencies have the information about these violations they need to protect American workers and safeguard our tax dollars. It makes clear that companies who violate our landmark labor protections, who deny overtime pay or family leave, and who deny workers’ rights to organize are not rewarded for repeatedly flouting the law. It also ensures that workers who have been discriminated against or sexually harassed can have their day in court. They cannot be forced into arbitration. Our procurement laws already ask that tax dollars only go to responsible contractors, with ‘‘a satisfactory record of integrity’’. Serial labor law violators do not meet this test. What’s more, numerous studies have found that contractors with better compliance records also perform better. So let’s not brush around the edges; this is not about safeguarding tax dollars. This vote is about allowing labor abuses to go rewarded. I cannot stand for that. I urge my colleagues to vote no. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 74, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint resolution. The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

ELECTING MEMBERS TO THE JOINT COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS ON THE LIBRARY AND THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON PRINTING Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on House Administration be discharged from further consideration of House Resolution 82, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BACON ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi? There was no objection. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
SECTION 1. ELECTION OF MEMBERS TO JOINT COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS ON THE LIBRARY AND JOINT COMMITTEE ON PRINTING. 
(a) J OINT COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS ON THE  LIBRARY .—The following Members are hereby elected to the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library, to serve with the chair of the Committee on House Administration and the chair of the Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch of the Committee on Appropriations: (1) Mr. Loudermilk. (2) Mr. Brady of Pennsylvania. (3) Ms. Zoe Lofgren of California. (b) JOINT COMMITTEE ON PRINTING .—The following Members are hereby elected to the Joint Committee on Printing, to serve with the chair of the Committee on House Administration: (1) Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois. (2) Mr. Walker. (3) Mr. Brady of Pennsylvania. (4) Mr. Raskin. 
The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
GROUNDHOG DAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today is a big day in the Fifth Congressional District of Pennsylvania, specifically, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, as our most famous resident had his day in the sun, literally. Early this morning, Punxsutawney Phil, our weatherexpert groundhog saw his shadow. For those of you who know the old German legend, this means that we are in for six more weeks of winter. Punxsy Phil has been forecasting the weather since the 1800s. He drinks a magical punch annually on February 2, which is an elixir of life that extends his life by 7 years. Crowds gathered on Gobbler’s Knob before sunrise today for the 131st celebration. While there are many wannabes, accept no substitution for the original prognosticator. The crowd chanted Phil’s name repeatedly to awaken him, and then Phil, known in his hometown as the Seer of Seers, came to deliver the news. Records going back to 1887 show that Phil has forecasted a longer winter 103 times and an early spring just 18 times. Today in Punxsutawney it was a balmy 30 degrees, so don’t pack up your winter gear just yet. Phil says we have six more weeks. Happy Groundhog Day. f 
IMPACTS OF THE IMMIGRANT BAN (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to tell the story of how last week’s reckless and poorly implemented executive order indiscriminately banning immigrants from seven countries directly impacted two University of California, Santa Barbara graduate students in my district. My office was contacted by Hassan Arbabi, a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering at UCSB. Hassan reached out to me on behalf of his girlfriend, Maryam Rasekh, who has also been accepted into UCSB’s Ph.D. program for electrical engineering. Maryam, an Iranian citizen, left the United States to undergo the vetting process for her F–1 student visa in order to attend graduate school in Santa Barbara. For months, Maryam interviewed and underwent an exhaustive administrative immigration process. Maryam’s F–1 student visa was approved on Friday, January 26, the same day the President signed his executive order banning all immigrants from Iran. The order prevented Maryam from returning to the United States to begin her studies. We have in place the strictest vetting process in the world. Banning immigrants like Maryam from pursuing higher education degrees does not make us safer. It prevents people like Maryam from making important scientific advances and contributing to our Nation. 
REMEMBERING THOMAS J. MAHONEY, JR. (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Mr. Thomas J. Mahoney, Jr. of Savannah, Georgia, a highlyrespected local attorney and community leader. He passed away on January 20 at 80 years of age. 
Mr. Mahoney graduated from Savannah’s Benedictine Military School in 1954 and earned his law degree from the University of South Carolina. In his first career after college, he worked as an FBI Special Agent in Chicago, Baltimore, and Washington. During this time, Mr. Mahoney met the love of his life, Judy, with whom he had four children. After 2 years in the FBI, Mr. Mahoney returned to Savannah and joined the law firm Mahoney & Cole, P.C. Through his hard work and determination, he worked up the ranks to become its president and CEO. He used his legal knowledge to make coastal Georgia a better place to live, serving as the Chatham County attorney, city attorney for Tybee Island, judge for Tybee Island, and assistant city attorney for Savannah. He also served as the special assistant attorney general for the Georgia Ports Authority since 1987, helping it to grow to its current, impressive size. Thank you, Mr. Mahoney, for everything you have done for the Savannah community. You will be missed. 
b1615 VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, we all know that human trafficking is a major problem right here in the United States. It is happening in every one of our communities. This week, as millions of Americans gather to watch the Super Bowl, I would like to shine a light on another troubling fact, and that is that there is an increase in the human trafficking and sex trafficking in the days surrounding the Super Bowl. Last year, in a few weeks leading up to the Super Bowl event, the Santa Clara Sheriff’s Office identified 42 potential victims of sex trafficking during a series of stings and cited 30 additional men for soliciting prostitution. The good news is, Mr. Speaker, we are drawing attention to this fact and working hard to end this heinous practice. Next year, my home State of Minnesota will be hosting the Super Bowl, and our host committee is already working hard in collaboration with Federal and local law enforcement, with government agencies, with advocacy groups and victims’ service organizations to develop a comprehensive and coordinated plan to address the issue. That is because, Mr. Speaker, over the next year, we will continue to end the practice of human trafficking, working tirelessly, and this is a wonderful opportunity to showcase how we can have freedom from the ugliness of trafficking. 
THIDWICK BOOKS (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Thidwick Books is a small, 865square foot bookshop that has been in the same building since 1999, but now it is being forced to either close its doors forever or move away. Serial plaintiff Craig Yates has sued multiple other merchants, including Thidwick Books. He generally makes vague claims about the designs of retail stores and claims that they violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. These small businesses do not have the resources to contest unfounded lawsuits or, in many cases, even know what the alleged violations are. The businesses are told to either pay a settlement or get sued with further litigation. Oftentimes, small businesses choose to pay the extortion rather than to defend the expensive, unfounded driveby lawsuit. The bipartisan bill, the ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017, improves access to public accommodations for the disability community while preventing wellmeaning businessowners from falling victim to driveby lawsuits. Mr. Speaker, the ADA was designed to improve access for the disabled, not to enrich unscrupulous lawyers and the plaintiffs. And that is just the way it is. f 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PROTECTS SENIORS’ SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I am thankful we have in the process here as elected officials the ability to hold accountable Federal agencies and new rules that will be made at midnight. I am speaking of legislation passed today to allow, in many cases, seniors who might see their Second Amendment rights limited or taken away by a lastminute rule that would require them to be turned in to the national background check system in this country, thereby, because they might be on SSI or disability, losing their ability perhaps to own a firearm under their Second Amendment rights. The House of Representatives took steps today to ensure their ability to not be singled out because they might be in a particular system and assumed to be a risk—unlike anybody else. So we can do good work sometimes, and we do when we strike out for protecting people’s rights. 
SUPPORTING JUDGE NEIL GORSUCH’S NOMINATION TO U.S. SUPREME COURT (Mr. GARRETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support of the President’s selection of Neil Gorsuch as nominee to the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Speaker, it is my sincerest hope that the Members of this body and our body down at the other end of the building will recognize just what a wonderful selection Mr. Trump has made. In fact, candidly, Mr. Speaker, were it my selection, I probably would not pick someone who had clerked for liberal jurist Byron ‘‘Whizzer’’ White or the split vote on the Court, Anthony Kennedy. In fact, I wonder if the habits of the individuals in the Senate—who might have the opportunity to confirm—to resist every single thing that comes across their desks these days might not, in fact, lead to a more conservative nominee should Judge Gorsuch not be nominated. I would again commend Mr. Trump for this middleoftheroad selection. I think he will maintain the balance on the Court that Mr. Kennedy has here today. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are wise enough to understand just what a benevolent and middleoftheroad selection Mr. Gorsuch is. f 
LET US SHOW MERCY (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is going to be a devastating day for so many. For decades, America has been engaged in resettling refugees. I remember the Vietnamese, the Iraqis, and the people from Afghanistan. More importantly, I remember the excitement I had in visiting the Statue of Liberty and being reminded of what a great country this is. Tomorrow, with the 120day suspension, we will literally devastate refugee families, some of whom waited 10, 12, 15 years, who have sold all their goods and who are good people who want to come to this country, and, as well, their documents will expire. I am asking the administration to have mercy and to be as the Chaplain ordered us to do: to find our grounding in being able to be servants. I would ask that we not devastate these families causing them to completely be derailed from moving toward being refugees in this country. No terrorist has been found in refugees. I believe it is crucial that we show mercy in the spirit of prayer, as in the prayer breakfast this morning. Let us show mercy. 
SUPPORT FOR BLM METHANE RULE (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, late last 
year, the Bureau of Land Management finalized its methane rule, which will reduce harmful emissions by curbing the wasteful venting, flaring, and leaking of natural gas. Not only is methane a potent greenhouse gas, but every cubic foot of gas that is wasted cheats New Mexican taxpayers out of precious royalty and tax payments which go toward public education, infrastructure, and community development programs. Considering that the Governor of New Mexico has proposed cutting money from school districts to close an estimated $70 million deficit, we simply cannot afford to let money disappear into thin air. Unfortunately, the House of Representatives is considering legislation that will not only rescind BLM’s methane rule, but also prohibit the consideration of any similar rule to curb methane emissions and protect taxpayer interests ever again. I strongly support efforts to work with all stakeholders, especially small, independent producers who may, in fact, have difficulties implementing BLM’s new standards, but taking a sledgehammer to our Nation’s energy policy is irresponsible and counterproductive. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation and instead work to make this rule work for both producers and taxpayers alike. 
NEW MEMBERS WORKING TOWARD A COMMON GOAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is good to be back on the floor. We have had a productive week so far. Things are moving along. We are doing exactly what we promised the American people, and that is removing regulatory burden, that is beginning to move toward an economy that looks after the needs of our communities— our moms, dads, aunts, uncles, and grandkids. They come together to know we are working toward a common goal, and that is looking ahead and making sure that what we do is in the best interests of our neighbors and our communities. Today, I want to continue in what we started, Mr. Speaker, just a week or so ago. We are introducing the folks that the country has sent from our side to be Members here, to join myself and others, to take this fight from the majority not only from their streets in the campaigns, but now onto the floor of the House. So this afternoon, we are going to start off with one of our new Members from New York’s 19th Congressional District, JOHN FASO. I found out as I was looking through his background that JOHNcomes from the same hometown as President Martin Van Buren and also our former colleague Chris Gibson, who was here for a while. I think if there is anything that sums up what I have heard from JOHN’s heart, it is the economic condition that we are in and the fact that our debts cannot continue to be sustained, and we have to put in good practices that not only take into account his district—which is a wonderful part of New York State—and the growing application there, but how we can take that all over the country. So with great pride, it is my privilege to introduce the newest Congressman from New York’s 19th Congressional District, JOHNFASO, to tell us a little bit about why he is here and his vision for what we have. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. FASO). Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that, and I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia’s hospitality in yielding the floor to me at this time. Mr. Speaker, indeed, I am privileged to represent the 19th Congressional District of New York State. This encompasses a wide area of the midHudson Valley and the Catskill region. The district touches Vermont in the northeast corner and Pennsylvania in the southeast corner. We go out to Cooperstown, and we have great local locations like Woodstock. Many people are familiar with Woodstock, where the concert was supposed to be back in the late 1960s, but also where the concert occurred in Bethel, New York, in Sullivan County. The district encompasses all or part of 11 counties. The gentleman from Georgia referenced the fact that I have resided for the last 30, almost 34, years in Kinderhook, New York, the hometown of Martin Van Buren, our eighth President. Our district also has within it the town of Hyde Park in Dutchess County, which is the home of a President who was extraordinarily wellknown and recognized for his great contributions to our country, Franklin D. Roosevelt. I encourage people to come visit Hyde Park and the Roosevelt home and mansion, and also Kinderhook. I would be remiss if I did not also mention that the 19th District has the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, where I know a number of Members will be coming up later this year to play a game of baseball in a charitable fundraising event. Mr. Speaker, Mr. COLLINS had made reference to the economic condition. The economic condition in upstate New York is extremely difficult. Of the 11 counties in my district, for instance, all 11 have lost population in the last 5 years. What has happened is that people are leaving because of high local taxes and burdensome rules. These come not just from Albany, but also from Washington. This is one of the things that I think the people sent me here to Congress to work on. I ran on a platform of economic growth. We must get our economy moving, and we must get it moving fast and growing at rates that are not in the anemic 1.5 to 1.8 percent level, but up to 3, 3.5, and 4 percent if we are going to produce enough wealth and opportunity for our children and grandchildren. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow this generation to leave to the next generation a country that is immeasurably poorer and less well off than the country that we were given by our parents and grandparents. I am privileged to serve on three committees here in Congress: the Budget Committee; the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where I am honored to serve as the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials; and also the Committee on Agriculture. All three of these committees are going to be vitally significant in terms of my tenure here in these 2 years of Congress, but also for the people of our district. Agriculture, we have a robust and growing agricultural economy. It is dairy, where a lot of dairy farmers are struggling with the low price of milk, but also fruits and vegetables. We have got a remarkable number of new producers—yogurt producers, cheese producers, and beef and pork producers— because we live only 125 to 150 miles away from the city of New York and the tremendous metropolitan area and the tremendous market that that entails. On the Agriculture Committee, I will be fighting hard to protect the interests of our dairy community and small farmers and to make sure that we encourage our young people to go into agriculture. I am pleased to soon support a measure which will encourage young people to go into agriculture. On the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I mentioned the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee. Our district is blessed to have the beautiful Hudson Valley. The Hudson Valley—the Empire State corridor of Amtrak—is one of the busiest in the Nation. It is also one of the profit centers for Amtrak. Many, many people ride the train between Albany and New York City on a daily basis, in fact. It is vitally important to our commerce and to our business interests in our district. We also have a number of freight rail facilities. I will be working closely with folks out in Otsego County and Oneonta for the project that they are looking at for their rail facility in that community. Lastly, as I mentioned, I serve on the Budget Committee. Just today, we heard a report from the Congressional Budget Office. The chief of the CBO came before us. He indicated that today we have almost $20 trillion of national debt. b1630 That is just the onthebooks government national debt. He also said to us that within 10 years we are going to be facing another $10 trillion on top of 
that. And $30 trillion, my colleagues, is not sustainable. It is, in essence, generational theft. It is saying we would spend today our children’s and grandchildren’s inheritance and that we are forcing, by borrowing way beyond our means, our children and grandchildren in the future to pay for our spending today. So this, indeed, is a crisis point. It is a crisis point for our country. It is a crisis point for every man, woman, and child in our Nation. In fact, if you look at the data, right now our national debt is the equivalent of about $60,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. We have to get this under control. The way to get it under control is we have to deal with growth. We have got to get economic growth. Smart tax and regulatory changes can help us spur the private sector economy to grow this economy, to create more opportunity, to create more wealth and jobs for our families all across the Nation, but particularly, from my vantage point, in upstate New York. But we also need to take a hard look at reforming entitlement programs. There is precedent for doing this. President Ronald Reagan, Tip O’Neill, the great former Senator from New York State Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and others came together in the early eighties and fixed the Social Security financing problem for over 40 years. Well, the timeline for fixing that problem is running out. I encourage people at home and citizens all across this country, pull out your Social Security earnings statement. Pull out that statement that the Social Security Administration sends to you each year. If you look at it closely, it will say that, in 2034, just a mere 17 or 18 years from now, Social Security can only pay approximately 75 or 76 percent of the promised benefits. We have it in our capacity to fix this problem to assure that all the seniors are taken care of and that those close and near retirement will not be affected. But we also have to reform the system so that our children and grandchildren have the prospect of something there for them in the future. We cannot, again, be the generation to leave our kids and our grandchildren holding the bag with a country less wealthy, with less opportunity than the country that our parents and grandparents gave to us. So I am really pleased to have this opportunity to come before the House today. I am very happy that Mr. COLLINS has, with his wisdom and experience here in the House, afforded us this opportunity to come here and describe what is going on in our district, why we came here, what we want to do, and what we hope to accomplish over the next 2 years. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons we do this—and I think Congressman FASOactually mentioned this—is what we forget so many times is we come in here, and we are grouped together as 435, but, the reality is, we all come from our individual districts. Listening to the gentleman’s story, listening to why he came, that is what keeps us grounded. This is the wonderful hallowed halls for us to remember all the history that has been here, but, when we come here, you bring that personal story. And that is what the voters elected you to do. Again, it is a pretty amazing district. I am learning about a lot of districts. When you have the area of Woodstock and Cooperstown in the same district, that is pretty cool. I appreciate the gentleman being here, and I am looking forward to his service. Mr. FASO. Well, I look forward to working with the gentleman from Georgia, and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to try to fix what is wrong with our country today, to improve on what we already have, and to create a sustainable future for all Americans. This is why I ran, and that is why I am here. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for the opportunity to come before the House to speak with him today. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. We are very glad to have the gentleman here. Mr. Speaker, as we go along, you have seen one great new Member from New York’s 19th District, but then there is also a new Member who comes from the Big First out in Kansas. He is a doctor. He has been married for 32 years and has four children. I think the coolest thing about this is we talk about a culture of life. For me, it is not just a life issue of getting up every day. I believe that you take every day as a gift that has been given to you, and you grasp and you take that joy. But life has to start. For a doctor who delivers 5,000 babies, it is pretty cool to see that life, as a husband who has been there. He has talked about his greatest role as a husband and father. That is mine and, I think, Mr. Speaker, as most, as we look at this. Seeing my kids come in was a special time. To know what that means in the life of a family, Dr. Marshall brings that personal touch to the House. He brings that personal touch from the Midwest. Mr. Speaker, you do know I am in the Air Force Reserve. Mr. Speaker understands that very well. Also, I will say that he served as well in our once parent operation, the Army Reserve. It is good to have him here. That military background also gives us a new perspective because our world is not a safe place, and we need to understand what we are going through. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Big First, the First District of Kansas, Dr. ROGER MARSHALL . Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for Georgia for yielding. I am so proud to be here today. Before I talk about my district, I just want to say thanks to my fellow freshman class. I am so grateful to be part of the freshman class of the 115th Congress—a freshman class that includes 10 Members with military experience, a sheriff’s officer, an FBI agent, two physicians, a dentist, and the rest of the class being mostly businessmen and businesswomen full of reallife experiences, which helps us solve problems with some little common sense. As my family and I traveled our district of Kansas this last 2 years, traveling 30,000 miles, they constantly identified the three common problems. They were concerned about the economy, national security, and health care. The first 2 years of those travels, I listened a lot. The last 6 months, I focused on solutions. I thought I would share today some of the common solutions that my classmates and I have talked about, as well as my constituents back home. First of all, as far as the economy goes, the number one problem with the economy is government overregulation. Overregulation creates uncertainty and consolidation. When there is uncertainty, businesses don’t grow; they don’t invest. The overregulation creates consolidations. So instead of having three or four community banks in town, consolidation forces there to be only one bank. Oftentimes, those single banks no longer even make bank loans to people from their own community. Consolidation has occurred in hospitals and with physician practices as well, all too often. I am so proud to stand up here today and hear that the Senate also approved one of the laws we have passed repealing regulations. We think, as we go down this path, repealing regulation will be a continued path for small businesses to grow. That is where 80 percent of our future job growth is going to come from: small businesses. It is hard to believe, when I talk about national security, that men and women who live 1,300 miles inland from the nearest ocean, separated by mountains and rivers, are concerned about their own safety. It is hard to imagine that before there was the Paris massacre or San Bernardino or Orlando that my constituents in Kansas were concerned about national security. I stand beside our President in making our border secure and working through immigration and refugee issues to make our Nation more secure. We think that is vitally important, and that is one of the reasons we elected this President and many, many people from my class as well. Lastly, I want to talk about health care, something very near and dear to my heart. For the past 6 years, I have lived the nightmare of ObamaCare. It has caused many, many physicians I know to quit, to give it up. ObamaCare has reduced us to data entry positions rather than 
physicians who can listen and develop their clinical skills as we try to work with patients to solve their healthcare problems. ObamaCare has led to consolidation of physician practices. It has led to high prices as well for insurance products. It has led to $12,000 deductibles for most families. It is no longer affordable. It is like having no insurance at all. Eighty percent of Americans are not happy with the Affordable Care Act, but I want to assure the American public and my constituents that, for every 5 seconds I have spent thinking about repeal, I have spent 5 days thinking about replace. Though quite often the press wants to talk about this as two separate books, this is one book in my life—a book of repealing and replacing as quickly and efficiently as possible. I want to assure all my constituents back home that, if you are on an ObamaCare product right now, we are not pushing you off any cliff. We are going to give you a period of transition where you can have a truly affordable healthcare product that works for you without a $6,000 or $12,000 deductible. We are a party of solutions. If you will look at Dr. PRICE’s bills he submitted the last 6 years, you will see great alternatives and solutions that the party has presented. We do think there are good solutions out there. Speaking of Dr. PRICE, I can’t help but just stop and say we need to approve him, confirm him as quickly as possible. Dr. PRICE is a physician, an orthopedic surgeon from Georgia, who has served Congress in multiple ways, including leading the Budget Committee. I have not met a man I would rather have serve as the Secretary of HHS than Dr. TOMPRICE, a mentor to me— a mentor to many of us—a kind man, a Godly man, a person who cares about patients, who understands health care, but he also understands government. Before we can take many more steps with health care, we need someone in that position. I believe with all my heart that Dr. PRICE will do a great job. I look forward to continuing my next several weeks here working with the freshmen, working with the rest of Congress. We are so optimistic. We think that great days are ahead of us. I am going to close with a memory today that I will have forever of going to the National Prayer Breakfast. I have had the privilege of going to many, many events, but this may have been the greatest event I ever attended in my life to see men and women, leaders across the world, praying for our President, praying for our Vice President. I am just thrilled to be a part of this. I am proud to turn this country back in a positive direction. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. It is good to have Dr. MARSHALL here and be a part of bringing that vitality of someone in the health field, knowing and understanding that relationship between the patient and the doctor and finding the best way so that all can have that access. I think that is what we see. He ended with something, and I will sort of end with that: the prayer breakfast. From my background as not only an Air Force chaplain but also a pastor for over 11 years, we can have disagreements. And we are going to have disagreements. But what I have found is, when you pray for each other, you can have disagreements, but you can’t be mad. I think that is what we have got to do as a country is we have our disagreements and we move forward and we look for what is best for the individuals and not best for what is this government. I think that is what you brought to the table today and talked about, that passion to get it back to the individual who looks to Washington, knows it is there, and doing what the Constitution said, but not overreaching into the areas of their life that take them away from the things they want to do. So I appreciate the gentleman’s service. I appreciate him being here. It is going to be great as we go forward. Mr. Speaker, we have gotten a fast start. There are some things going on where we are doing what we promised. I had an interview just the other day, and the reporter asked me the question: Well, what do you think about X? They named off like two or three things. I said: What is surprising right now to many folks who have reported on this place for so long is the fact that things are getting done and being promised to get done, and they are happening. Mr. Speaker, that is what we are sent here for. And as we see that through the regulatory issues we have been dealing with this week, we are going to deal with again next week, and as we look ahead to the battles of repealing and putting together access to affordable health care for all Americans and not doing the scare tactics and not doing the straw man and not trying to push anybody off a cliff but saying: let’s talk about this together; let’s listen and work together, as opposed to the way it was done. Then, we look into tax reform. We look into energy development. It is a time in America to be smiling. It is a time when we can look around and the rest of the world is saying: that is the country that we know. That is the shining light that we know. That is the place that the world looks to. Because we are the freest country in the world, and we gave our spirit to others. b1645 So it is exciting for me, as part of my work for the Republican Conference, to bring the freshman Members up here to let them tell about their areas. And as we do so, it just shows you, I believe, that America, in many of these districts, saw promise. And we are looking forward to continuing with our new Members and continuing to introduce them over the next weeks. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has agreed to without amendment a joint resolution of the House of the following title: 
H.J. Res. 38. Joint resolution disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Interior known as the Stream Protection Rule. 
The message also announced that pursuant to sections 42 and 43 of title 20, United States Code, the Chair, on behalf of the Vice President, reappoints the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) as a member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution. 
RUSSIAN AGGRESSION AGAINST UKRAINE (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the day after our new President spoke to the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, we saw a surge in Russian aggression and attacks in eastern Ukraine. Every American must realize, Russia is testing our new administration’s resolve to stand up for liberty. Since Russia invaded Crimea in February 2014, 10,000 innocent Ukrainians have been killed by Russian aggression, and this has increased over the past week. Dozens more have been displaced—17,000, in fact. These actions violated the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances that stated: the Russian Federation would respect the independent sovereignty and existing borders of Ukraine. Russia’s new aggression is another step in its campaign to undermine the democratic order that has existed in our Transatlantic Alliance since the end of World War II and cold war. America must stand up for the people of Ukraine and our European alliances and denounce the actions of President Putin. We have to stand up or we face— Russia will face condemnation by the world community. Russia should withdraw her heavy weapons from that region. They should stop financing separatists. They should allow repairs for critical infrastructure and fulfill all of their agreements under the Minsk accords. What is happening is a global shame. 
THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here with my colleague PRAMILA JAYAPAL from Seattle, Washington. We wanted to talk about what has been happening over the last week with the executive orders on immigration and asylum that have taken place, and we want to try to take a broad perspective on this; to put it in some historical, legal and constitutional context; and then also to talk very specifically about the executive orders and what has been taking place with them in different parts of the country; and about the multiple Federal judicial rulings imposing injunctions on enforcement of those orders. But I wanted to begin, actually, by stepping back from the heat of the current crisis and looking, instead, at the idea of America. Well, what is the idea of America? America was created, as the great Tom Paine said, as a haven of refuge for people fleeing political and religious repression from all around the world. Remember the radicalism of the American Revolution and our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. We were the first Nation on Earth conceived in revolutionary insurgency against monarchy, dictatorship, autocracy, theocracy, and the merger of church and State. The American colonists were rebelling against, not just the king and all of the whimsical depredations and abuses of the crown, but also against centuries of religious warfare in Europe between the Protestants and the Catholics, holy inquisition, holy crusades, witchcraft trials, endless wars between the Catholics and the Protestants. Our forefathers and foremothers wanted to break from that history and put into our Constitution the separation of church and State—as Jefferson called it, the wall of separation between church and State, the establishment clause, the idea of free exercise of religion, freedom of speech, the right to petition for redress of grievances, the right of people to assemble, freedom of thought, freedom of conscience in the United States. But it would be a land that would be open to people who were fleeing authoritarianism, who were trying to get away from repressive regimes, and kings, and monarchs, and princes, and tyrants, and dictators, and despots everywhere. That was the idea behind America. Well, then in this Presidential campaign, then candidate Donald Trump said that he wanted to impose a Muslim ban, a ban on Muslims coming to America, which would cause our forefathers and foremothers to turn over in their graves to hear that somebody running for President of the United States wanted to impose a ban on the immigration of people based on their religious faith, in a country that was designed on the principle of free exercise of religion, designed on the principle of no establishment of religion, designed on the principle of no religious tests for public office or political participation that suddenly we would say we are not going to accept people— in the 21st century—based on their religious heritage. And of course, anybody can make up their religion anyway. Anybody can say what they are. So it is as futile and as silly as it is anathema and apathetical to our basic constitutional ideals. Well, that Muslim ban has, in its bizarre way, become law now in the United States of America. The President issued an executive order as one of his first actions on people coming to our country from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, those seven countries. And we have got to interrogate what exactly the logic of this is. The President and his chief strategists of the altright, named Steve Bannon, have defended this order on the grounds of national security. The idea is that somehow we are defending the national security and the defense by banning people from those countries. All right, we all support national security. If that would advance our national security, it is something we should look at. Well, what is the evidence that that is going to benefit our national security? Our country now is no stranger to terror and to terrorism. All of us remember that shocking, fateful day, 9/ 11, back in 2001, when America changed forever. Those 19 hijackers came from three countries. And which three countries on this list of seven did they come from? None of them. Those hijackers came from Saudi Arabia. The overwhelming majority of them came from Saudi Arabia, then Egypt then United Arab Emirates. None of those three countries is on this list of seven. Why not? Well, a couple of different theories are out there. One is that President Trump has business interests in those countries. He is doing business with corporations in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt, and in the United Arab Emirates. So that is one leading theory that is out there. The other is that these are rich and powerful countries. So despite the fact that they were the lead exporters from this prism of terrorist hijackers to the United States, they get a pass. And instead, we pick on Yemen, and Somalia, and Iraq—our presumed ally— that another Republican President sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into waging a war based on the mythology that there were weapons of mass destruction in that country, but now they are on our side. Yet, we have imposed a ban of people coming in as refugees from Iraq. But Saudi Arabia gets a pass; Egypt gets a pass; United Arab Emirates gets a pass because they are on the rich side. So what exactly do these seven countries have in common if it doesn’t have anything to do with our national security? Because if you look at the other terrorist events that have taken place in our country, for example, the Boston Marathon bombers, those young men who were implicated in that crime against the people of the city of Boston and the people of the United States came from Russia originally. Is there a ban on Russia being imposed here? Quite the contrary. Earlier today, President Trump relaxed sanctions on Russia, made it easier for American businesses to export information technology to Russian companies, according to news reports. I haven’t seen the exact order yet, but there is an executive order that is lessening sanctions on Russia, despite the fact that two of the most infamous terrorists against the United States originally came from there. So what do those seven countries have in common? Well, they are all Muslim countries. They are poor Muslim countries. They are poor Muslim countries that Donald Trump doesn’t do business with. And so maybe that is it. Maybe the idea is, we are going to wage a worldwide war on the poorest, most vulnerable Muslim countries, even if they don’t pose any special threat to us, because that will conform to Steve Bannon’s ideological world view of a major contest between the Christian west and radical Islamic terror. I think that would be it. But President Trump, of course, puts his business interests even above the racism and White nationalism of Steve Bannon, because the business interests have to come first in all cases. So that is the best that we can make of what has been imposed on the country, an Orwellian policy imposed with Kafkaesque incompetence all over the United States of America. So the airports are in an uproar, families have been dislocated, children agonized over the situation, panic spreading across America. And part of me wants to think, well, this is just the misfortunes of a beginning President. Maybe this is part of a design by Steve Bannon who has proclaimed himself a Leninist who wants to tear the system down, tear the government down; to start over again. Maybe that is what is going on. Who knows? But all of this brings us back to the emoluments clause. Now the emoluments clause, Article I, section 9, clause 8 of the Constitution was inserted by our great Founders because they feared foreign monetary dominance of the United States Government. They knew that kings and princes, dictators and despots, traitors and saboteurs all over the place would try to use their money to compromise the integrity of Republican government, Republican democracy. Remember, we were trying something new here, what our great Republican President Abraham Lincoln would later come to call the ‘‘government of the people, by the people, and for the people.’’ 
That was the experiment that we launched then, and they knew that there was a basic problem, which is, the room will not hold all. We can’t have a New England town meeting every time we need to make a decision, so we have got to elect people to go be our Governors. But when you elect them, now you have got an agent. And the problem all of you lawyers know out there—in principal agent law—is how do you make sure the agent actually serves the client rather than the interests of the agent himself or herself? And the Founders understood that, and they were afraid that the people who we elected might go to Washington and be corrupted by foreign money, by all of the diplomats and spies running around offering gifts, and gold, and snuffboxes, and diamonds, and so on. And so what they said was that no official in our government, no official could accept any gifts, or emolument, any payment of any kind at all from a foreign government, a king, a prince, or a foreign government. No foreign payments. And that is something that has been observed scrupulously for more than two centuries by our Presidents. Nobody has even come close to the line of violating that. When Benjamin Franklin was Ambassador to France, he received a snuffbox from the people of France. He came back, and he brought it to Congress and asked Congress to approve, because it is up to this body to decide whether or not a foreign payment is acceptable or not. And Congress said: Mr. Franklin, because of your extraordinary reputation for integrity, for decency, and for honesty, we understand you have not been compromised by that snuffbox, and it is just a snuffbox, and you can keep it. But today, what we have got now is a President who has hundreds of millions of dollars of interest all over the world—in Russia, in the Philippines— millions of dollars of loans from the Government of China, the Trump Hotel, which is renting out banquet rooms, dining halls, floors, hotel rooms, to foreign governments and embassies from all over the world who come here to try to influence our government. And what do we hear about the emoluments clause? Has the President come to ask us whether or not we approve of these arrangements? Nothing. Nothing has happened. Is it affecting policy? Every single day. And I come back—before I turn it over to my colleague—to what we are talking about, which is these executive orders which have this very bizarre quality, my fellow Americans. b1700 They apply to poor Muslim countries where Donald Trump has no business interests. These executive orders don’t apply to Saudi Arabia, they don’t apply to Egypt, they don’t apply to the United Arab Emirates, they don’t apply to any of the countries where Trump Industries has business. That is precisely why the Founders put in the emoluments clause. I know it is a bit of a mouthful, but every American has got to learn to say it. All it means is payments. This is the foreign bribery clause in our Constitution. These terrible immigration orders, which have created chaos and pandemonium across the land, are a perfect demonstration of why we need to enforce the emoluments clause and why this President needs to divest himself immediately of all these foreign concerns, or this Congress must hear the appeals that are coming from our side of the aisle and must listen to the fact that these payments that are being received on a daily basis by the President are a threat to the American constitutional order. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ), my good friend and colleague from Seattle, Washington. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ), my friend and colleague, and I thank my other colleagues also who are here today to shine a light on the abuses that happened last week and last weekend with the executive order that was passed and signed into law by this President. Mr. Speaker, this order is in direct contrast with the values that this country was built on: foremost, to be a refuge. That is how so many people in the history of this country have come here. Instead, our President has chosen to close the doors on people who are fleeing violence in their home countries, and it is based on their religion. This ban is discrimination in its purest form. It does not make us safer. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I believe that doing what we did has actually put fodder into the hands of those who really do wish to do us harm by being able to say that America hates Muslims, that America hates Islam, and that America hates immigrants and refugees, none of which is true to the history and the founding of this country. The reality, Mr. Speaker, is that the International Rescue Committee has said that it is more challenging for refugees to get into the United States than anyone else. They are the most heavily vetted group there is. As you can see here, there are 20 steps involved in the process, and those who do get approved have been through the most rigorous background checks, fingerprinting, and questioning. Instead of making us safer, this ban is simply throwing people into chaos. Many of us over this last weekend went to our airports across the country— Dulles; New York; Seattle, Washington, my hometown. We were called to the airport because there was chaos that erupted across the country, chaos that erupted at the airports, because people who had legal documents to come to the United States were coming in and being told that the executive order meant that they no longer could actually stay here in this country. Mr. President, what happened then for me, when I went to the SeaTac Airport at 1 in the afternoon on Saturday, I found a Somali family who had been waiting, a U.S. citizen woman who had been waiting to be reunited with her husband. She believed that finally she was going to get to hold him in her arms. Instead, Mr. Speaker, what happened is that he was put on a plane and sent back to Heathrow, but perhaps somewhere else. We were not given any information about what was going to happen to that gentleman. We found out that there were two additional individuals who were already put on a plane ready to be deported. We, along with the ACLU, the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, and our governor, were able to file for a temporary restraining order. We were able to take that restraining order on our phone to the plane and say: Stop this plane. That literally, Mr. Speaker, is how we were able to get those two people off of the plane. We were able to then get them legal counsel after much intervention. Mr. Speaker, it should not be this way. This is a country that was built by immigrants. It is a country that has welcomed people from across the world to come here as a refuge, as a sanctuary. My State of Washington is one of the top States in the country for refugee resettlement. The reality is we are destroying the very principles of compassion, of humanity, of being a refuge, of building this country with immigrants and refugees. Literally thousands of people came to the airport to say: We welcome refugees; we welcome immigrants. This is not the America that we know and love. We are better than this. This is not the first time I have had to fight against these illegal deportations. After 9/11, we had similar situations, not as bad as this, but we had the National Security EntryExit Registration System, NSEERS. It required that men from 25 Muslim and Arab countries were going to be fingerprinted and registered. This was under the Bush administration. At the time, Attorney General John Ashcroft said: You are either with the terrorists or you are with us. That is a false choice, Mr. Speaker. The reality is that security and liberty do not oppose each other. They go hand in hand, and we cannot sacrifice one for the sake of the other. Mr. Speaker, we were able to fight that, and we finally did end that special registration program, but now here we are again. We know the shame of history when we have not been on the right side of it. We know that in 1942, 125,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry were put into internment camps, and it took us a very long time to come back and apologize. Mr. Speaker, when we did, we said we will never do that 
again. Yet, here we are for the first time again instituting a religious test as to who can get into this country. Let us be clear that it is a Muslim ban. It does not mean that every single Muslim country necessarily has been targeted yet. But what it does mean is that Muslims are being scrutinized in a different way simply for being Muslim. A constituent of mine called my office this week to tell me another very disturbing story, and she told me that I could tell it here on the floor. She was passing through immigration into Houston on her way back home from Seattle. Dr. Angelina Godoy was traveling back from Central America where she was doing research. She is a U.S. citizen. She said she was so alarmed by what happened to her that she wanted to call and get it on the record. Angelina is a human rights professor and she has traveled through immigration many times. This was the first time she said she had experienced anything like this. Her immigration officer asked her about her political views. When she said that she was deeply concerned about the President’s actions, he asked her why she wasn’t concerned with all the refugees that were flooding into our borders. And he used that word ‘‘flooding.’’ When she said she didn’t think that they were flooding in, he told her that she can’t tell him that based on the fake news she is seeing on television. Mr. Speaker, this is incredibly disturbing. Are we going to now check the views of every U.S. citizen who is coming into the our borders to see whether they agree with these executive orders or not? Well, I am here to tell you that it may be the thought that fear and patriotism together is the way to suppress dissent. We will not be suppressed with fighting for the very values that make us great. In cities around the country, what gives me hope is that people stood up to stand up against this hatred. The Muslim ban is unconstitutional, and we are standing here today to demand that it be repealed. You can see here the chart that I referred to earlier. There are 20 steps that you must go through in order to be screened. Syrian refugees are probably the most screened individuals in our country today. And there are 5 million Syrian refugees who are pouring out of the country. Mr. Speaker, this is not a time to turn our backs on them. This is a time to make sure that we are taking care of the women, the children, the families, the majority of refugees to this country who are women and children and families. The majority who have family members here that they are waiting to be reunited with, that is who we are talking about, Mr. Speaker. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE). Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) and the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ) for their tremendous leadership. They have hit the ground running here in Congress in defense of our Nation’s immigrants and refugees and for all who just seek to live the American Dream. So thank you very much for your leadership and for calling us together tonight. Mr. Speaker, in his first week as President, Donald Trump issued an executive order essentially banning immigrants and refugees from the United States on the basis of religion. This action effectively shuts our gates to some of the most vulnerable people in the world fleeing danger and death. This ban flies in the face of our fundamental values as Americans. It is, yes, morally reprehensible and will only serve to make the United States less safe. This executive order is also a direct threat to our national security. Banning Muslim immigrants and refugees only fuels ISIS propaganda by promoting the false idea that the United States is at war with Islam. This halfway ban is felt in our communities across the Nation. In my district, one Iranian student at the University of California, Berkeley was not allowed to board the plane to return to the United States. She is now forced to withdraw from the semester. This is a disgrace. Mr. Speaker, this Nation is and has been and will always be a Nation of immigrants. This ban and this President and his executive orders do not reflect our values. This is not who we are. As the President’s divisive ban was implemented, we witnessed thousands of Americans bring what I call ‘‘street heat.’’ Men, women, and children across the country stood up to the President and declared with one voice: Not on our watch. These protests, the voice of the American people, give me hope. If we stand together and resist, we will prevail. While the President continues his attack on immigrants, refugees, and Muslims, I vow to stand up for our communities with my colleagues with a clear message saying once again: This is not who we are. This Muslim ban is hateful, it is unconstitutional, and it is downright wrong. Finally, let me just say that February is Black History Month. As an African American woman, I am reminded of the bans and exclusions of African Americans and my ancestors and the legacy of slavery where my ancestors were brought here in chains, built this country, and continued to fight for freedom and justice. As an African American, there is no way I can tolerate any ban on anyone seeking refuge in this great country. Finally, and in conclusion, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I just want to say that I am going to fight tooth and nail to prevent funding for these misguided antiimmigrant and antirefugee policies. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. BARRAGA ´N). Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, last Saturday night, I was at Los Angeles International Airport. I went out to show unity and stand with those that stand against this ban. I think it is wrong. I think it is unconstitutional and unAmerican. But what I saw there was startling. I want to tell you the story of Fatema. Fatema is a legal permanent resident. She got a notice in the mail that she was about to be sworn in to become a U.S. citizen on February 13. She was traveling with her 1yearold son who is an American citizen. She was the victim and was being detained. Reports from lawyers on the ground were that she was being pressured to sign away her right to be a legal permanent resident right after they had sent somebody back, a student, who had a visa to be here. b1715 I was there, along with one of my colleagues, JUDY CHU, fighting, trying to get to the detainee to make sure that she had access to an attorney. I asked to go to CBC, the Customs and Border Protection. Conveniently, they were shut down. They had closed the office. So I asked somebody: Can you walk me down to the arrivals so I could talk to somebody? They wouldn’t do it. I got a telephone number. I called. None of my questions were answered. They wouldn’t answer a single question: Were any of my constituents being detained? Could I get a lawyer to somebody? They wouldn’t even say yes or no. All I was told was I had to call this Washington, D.C., number—a 202 number. Now, it was Saturday night. It was 7 p.m. on the Pacific Coast. I called. I left a message, asking for a return call. I didn’t get one. I demanded, with my colleague, that we get a briefing privately, behind closed doors, outside the press. We didn’t get one. As a matter of fact, when I called back, I asked: Who is your manager? Who are you answering to? She said: The President. Oh. You have talked to Donald Trump? It was really disturbing. And then she hung up on me—and I am a Member of the United States Congress. I couldn’t get any answers to try to protect the very constituents that we fight for, the constituents whom we represent. It was very disturbing. These immigration orders are unsettling, but they are also a disservice to the Customs and Border Protection when you don’t give a headsup, when you don’t have a warning on how things are going to be carried out. This led to mass confusion not just at LAX, but at airports across the country. I hear often that this affected just a small number of travelers, but it affected a lot more than that. We saw the 
masses of people coming out. We saw lawyers who had to go down there and give their time. A shoutout to the ACLU and to the attorneys at public counsel and to so many other attorneys who went down there and gave their evenings, their time, and who have been standing up and fighting for people in court to get people to come back. Just today, at Los Angeles International Airport, there was a press conference held to welcome back the one person who was allowed to come back—an Iranian citizen who was deported and sent back, who was forcibly removed on Friday night even though he had a legal right to be here. Hopefully we are going to hear more of these stories, but it shouldn’t be that way. People should not show up at the airport and get on a flight in a country in which they have a right to be just to have to turn around and be sent back after being detained for hours on end. This isn’t right. As a Member of Congress, I will work to ensure that the Federal Government obeys the Constitution, respects our history as a nation of immigrants, and does not unlawfully target anyone because of one’s national origin or faith. Mr. RASKIN. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished Congresswoman from New York, YVETTE CLARKE . Ms. CLARKE of New York. I thank the gentleman from Maryland and the gentlewoman from Washington State for hosting this very important Special Order hour. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my outrage over Donald Trump’s unconscionable, illconceived, horribly executed and implemented executive order that limits Muslim immigration and travel into the United States. This order is an appalling affront to American interests. It is contrary to our ideals and values as a nation, and it flies in the face of our history and the core conviction of freedom from religious persecution that this Nation was built upon. It provides the fuel to our enemies and makes a mockery of our democracy and Constitution. Most importantly, it tears families apart by prohibiting people with valid travel documents from entering the country. I saw this firsthand on Saturday when I visited JFK International Airport to witness the needless chaos and confusion that this order has created. One person who lives in my district who has been affected by this order is Dr. Kamal Fadlalla. Dr. Fadlalla is a Sudanese hospital resident in Brooklyn, New York. He is trained to save lives, not to take them. Yet, due to Donald Trump’s egregious executive order, Dr. Fadlalla has been prevented from returning back to the United States to help heal our sick and save lives. There is no justification for this shameful order, and it is no wonder that the Acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, risked her job and reputation rather than act as Donald Trump’s enforcer. I commend Ms. Yates for her personal integrity and fidelity to our Constitution. Ironically enough, during her confirmation hearing, it was Donald Trump’s own nominee for Attorney General who suggested that Ms. Yates maintain the integrity of the Department of Justice at all times and that she must refuse to enforce orders that were unconstitutional. This week, Ms. Yates made good on her answer to Senator SESSIONS and upheld her oath to faithfully uphold our Constitution. For these reasons, I will proudly introduce a resolution that commends Ms. Yates for her act of moral courage and for her adherence to the dictates of the United States Constitution. I call on all of my colleagues to sign on to this resolution and for House leadership to schedule a vote to commend Ms. Yates. Most importantly, though, I call on Donald Trump to rescind this egregious order that harms our economy, that contravenes our values, and that endangers our national security. I thank the gentleman and gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. RASKIN. I thank the Congresswoman for her comments. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished Congressman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ). Mr. ELLISON. I thank Congressman RASKIN , and I thank Congresswoman JAYAPAL . Mr. Speaker, the truth is that the House of Representatives has tremendously benefited by these two awesome freshmen who have come in here like gangbusters. I am sure that my classmate and friend of many years from New York, Ms. YVETTE CLARKE , will agree with me that we are always trying to welcome these folks who have come straight off the campaign trail, because you really know how people are feeling when they come straight off the campaign trail—fresh. I am sure the Congressman from Rhode Island, DAVID CICILLINE , agrees. The people of this country are fundamentally fair folks. Our countrymen and women believe that everybody ought to be treated with dignity and respect. Yes, we believe that we have to have an economy that works for everybody. Absolutely true. We also believe that people should be treated based on their behavior, based on who they are, based on what they bring, not based on their race, their sex, their gender, their religion. In fact, this idea is enshrined in the Constitution. The first clause of the First Amendment reads: ‘‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.’’ Later on in the Constitution, it reads that Congress shall not impose any religious test for participating— serving—in public office. In America, you don’t have to have one religious belief or another. In America, you can be a Christian, a Muslim, a Jew, a Hindu, or of no faith whatsoever. You can be Baptist; you can be Methodist; you can be whatever you want to be. That is up to you, and it is a private matter. Americans basically understand that this is right because the Framers of the Constitution, people like Thomas Jefferson and others, looked over at some of the Colonies and even looked at some of the conflicts in Europe and said that we don’t need to be mixed up—fighting— with each other over religion. Now, the Framers got a lot of things wrong. They got women’s rights wrong; they got race wrong; they got Native American rights wrong. There were many things that they needed to correct in this Nation. As the great Thurgood Marshall said, we were defective from the start, and we needed to have civil wars and civil rights movements and other movements to make this country the country that it is today. Yet one thing we did decently in the beginning is with regard to religious freedom—until now. Donald Trump is introducing a religious test for whether or not people can be a part of this American story. Donald Trump claims: Oh, I don’t have a Muslim ban. Wait a minute, President Trump. Wasn’t it you who, on December 7, 2015, said that you were calling for a ban on all Muslims who enter into the United States? Wasn’t it you who said it multiple times throughout your campaign? Didn’t you say you wanted to have a Muslim database for all of the Muslims who were in the country? Didn’t you say you wanted to shutter mosques? You said these things, and now, all of a sudden, you are shy about saying that you are running a Muslim ban. These people who say, oh, it is not a Muslim ban surprise me because I am, like, I thought you all were proud of it. I thought you were bragging about it. I thought it was how you rode your way into office—by appealing to people’s fears and trying to whip up hostility among different Americans of different faiths and traditions. Yet now, all of a sudden, you are shy about saying what you are doing, which is a Muslim ban. Yes, it is a Muslim ban. Just because it doesn’t ban every Muslim everywhere does not mean that the people who are banned are not banned because they are Muslim. That is exactly why they are banned. That is why they are banned. He was asked on a TV program: Would you give preferential treatment to people of another faith? He said: Yes, I would give preferential treatment to another faith. He said it. It is on the record. So don’t come telling me how there is no Muslim ban. There is one, and these people who bragged so much about it— I mean Trump and Bannon and all of the rest of them—should not act like there is not a Muslim ban now. There is a Muslim ban. It is a religious test for entry into this country. It is unconstitutional; it is immoral; and it is wrong. 
I just want to say to all of my fellow Americans right now, if they can ban Muslims, they can ban Jews; if they can ban Jews, they can ban Seventh day Adventists; if they can ban Seventhday Adventists, they can ban Mormons; and if they can ban Mormons, they can ban Catholics. It is wrong, and we should stand up and say that it is wrong and immediately demand that it be repealed right away. I think this is absolutely critical that we do so. I want to share a story for a moment longer, if the gentleman doesn’t mind, because I know we have some really excellent speakers coming right behind me, and I want to yield to them as quickly as I can. I want to share a story about one of the families that has been affected in my own home State of Minnesota. One person who was prevented from flying to United States this week is a little girl from Somalia whose mother came to Minneapolis as a refugee in 2013. This child was stuck in Uganda without her family because she hadn’t been born by the time her mother was granted refugee status. When her mother, Samira, was given permission to come to the United States 4 years ago, she was told to leave her daughter behind with friends of the family in Uganda and apply for reunification in the United States. This little girl was supposed to fly to Minnesota and rejoin her family on Monday. Instead, her flight was canceled because of the Muslim ban. President Trump is not making our country safer. President Trump is reinforcing the narrative of people who don’t like our country. What does ISIS ultimately say? That America is at war with Islam. I am here to tell everybody on the planet that America is absolutely not at war with Islam or with any other religion. The American people are of a peaceful nation. The people who live in the United States want to live in harmony with all of the other people of the world; but this particular person who happens to occupy the Presidency doesn’t reflect the values that we represent. He doesn’t reflect who we are. The thing that he is doing is actually reinforcing the narrative of the people who would mean to do all of us harm no matter what religion we may be. I just want to sit down now and say: For the sake of this young woman and for the sake of Samira’s daughter, who is languishing in Uganda right now and who wants to be reunited with her family, may we please get rid of this ban and get rid of this unlawful executive order? b1730 Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ). Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) and the gentlewoman from Washington State (Ms. JAYAPAL ) for organizing tonight’s Special Order hour on this very important topic. I join my colleagues in expressing my strong opposition to the President’s Muslim ban, a religious test. It is the first time we have seen this in modern times. We have been at war since 9/11 against terrorism, and our most urgent responsibility is to keep America safe, but President Trump’s Muslim ban makes it harder to do this. The Muslim ban makes it harder to work with our allies. The Muslim ban makes it harder to recruit intelligence assets. The Muslim ban makes it harder to enlist allies in our fight against ISIS. We should help people who are fleeing ISIS rather than slam the door in their faces. Instead, President Trump’s Muslim ban likens these individuals to terrorists. This isn’t a plan, and it won’t keep America safe. We need a real plan, a plan that honors our values and a plan that does not discriminate based upon a person’s religion. We need a plan that keeps our country safe and respects freedom of religion, whether people are White, Black, Brown, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, young, or old. Immigrants and refugees have made incredible contributions to our great country, and it is time for our President to say this. In my home State of Rhode Island, like so many places around the country, when we watched on television news reports of an executive order being issued and people who are lawfully authorized to return home to the United States being held in detention and being prevented from coming back into America, we were sick to our stomach. People in Rhode Island rallied, like people did all across this country, to express their outrage, to say this is not America and these are not our values. This is inconsistent with our Constitution. While we saw this administration working to undo basic constitutional rights and civil liberties—including, most importantly, freedom of religion—people all across America spoke out. In addition to recognizing that this didn’t comport with our deeply held beliefs and faith and confidence in our Constitution, we also knew that these were families fleeing unspeakable violence as part of the refugee program who are also being denied access into the United States. People were fleeing ISIS and then coming to America only to have the door slammed in their faces. As has been said, the refugee program that we have in place is the single most difficult way for someone to be allowed to enter the United States. It is a 10 or 12step process. If you go to the website, you can see what you have to go through to be authorized to come into the United States as a refugee, and included in that is a determination that you do not pose a danger to the national security or to the American people. So it is embedded in the process already. It is a process that takes anywhere from 18 to 24 months. It is a process which has been in place and has worked successfully. There hasn’t been a single Syrian refugee who has been charged with having been engaged in any terrorist activity. By the way, the world is facing the largest refugee crisis since World War II. The U.N. estimates that 4.9 million refugees have registered, and there are about 6 million total if you include those that aren’t registered. Turkey has taken 2.7 million refugees. Lebanon has taken 1 million refugees. Jordan has taken 655,000 refugees. Iraq has taken 228,000 refugees. Do you know how many the United States accepted last year? About 16,000. So, Mr. Speaker, we have a lot more to do to meet our responsibilities with respect to accepting refugees who go through this very rigorous process. I am here tonight to speak out as loudly as I can against the executive order that ends the Syrian refugee program that has worked so successfully and that puts in place a Muslim ban that is making us less safe. This isn’t a Democratic or a Republican issue. There have been a number of Republicans who have knowledge that this is making us less safe. Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM and Senator JOHN MCCAINsaid this may well do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security. There are a number of other national security experts who have said this will not make us safer. There are a number of veterans organizations that have said the same. Business leaders have said the same. This will not make us safer, and it has really brought the scorn of the world, as people have seen an America that has always stood for values of welcoming people and of diversity and being a place that people come to—like my greatgrandfather did—to build a better life to suddenly be slamming its doors and instituting a test based on religion. It does violence to our history and to our Constitution. I want to just ask the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ), who is not just an ordinary lawyer, but a scholar, a professor of law, whether or not he has done an analysis as to the constitutionality of the President’s Muslim ban. There have been, I think, four courts now who have, in fact, entered orders invalidating key parts of these orders based on their assessment that they don’t comport with our Constitution. I ask the gentleman to share his assessment as to whether or not my view of this—and, I think, the view of these courts—is the correct one. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief here because a number of our colleagues from around the country are waiting to weigh in. Let me just say that this executive order is like a bad issue spotter on a constitutional law final exam. It 
is riddled with so many constitutional errors and violations, starting with the ban on religious free exercise, equal protection of the laws. The way it has been implemented has been draconian and Kafkaesque around the country, violating due process and the right to counsel, which has been the source of a lot of the successful constitutional litigation that has already taken place. It hasn’t even been out on the street for a week, and I think five or six Federal district courts have struck down different aspects of it. So it is a Pandora’s box, and it is going to be the gift that keeps giving to constitutional lawyers across the country. Again, we are urging the President just to withdraw it at this point. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in urging President Trump to rescind both of these unconstitutional executive orders. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ). Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) as well as the gentlewoman from Washington State (Ms. JAYAPAL ) for hosting this important Special Order hour. Congressman RASKIN and Congresswoman JAYAPAL are two of the newest members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and I want to express my gratitude for their leadership. Mr. Speaker, last week, President Trump issued an executive order that violated America’s basic commitment to projecting hope and tolerance around the world. With a stroke of his pen, he turned his back on a humanitarian crisis and shut the door on desperate families fleeing unspeakable violence. It has taken just 2 weeks for this administration to undermine our moral authority and weaken our role in promoting peace and stability in a volatile world. In airports across the country, in streets of coastal cities and midwestern towns, in States that voted for Secretary Clinton and in States that voted for President Trump, the American people are expressing their outrage at the Muslim ban. Patriotic men and women are standing up for the compassionate, exceptional country we strive to be. Religious leaders are standing up to say: This is not who we are. Veterans are standing up to say: This is not what we fought for. There was a time when Republican leadership stood with them. These two tweets to my right are a memorial to a time when Vice President PENCE and Speaker RYAN were prepared to publicly oppose policies they called un American. Now, when faced with the reality of this policy, Speaker RYANis choosing to support the ban. Our Vice President deleted his tweet. We had to search around to find the original tweet, and it is right over there. The American people deserve better. Let’s be clear. The President’s executive order makes America less safe. The only threat to America posed by Syrian refugees is to our conscience. Instead of protecting the homeland from terror, the President has gift wrapped powerful propaganda for our enemies. This is not just my opinion or the opinion of Democrats in Congress. This is what we have heard from dozens of national security experts from both parties. They are warning us that this executive order is a stain on our reputation and a setback for counterterrorism efforts around the world. Yet congressional Republicans remain silent. Mr. Speaker, our democracy has endured and prospered for more than two centuries because of our system of checks and balances. Congress has a responsibility to act when the executive branch advances reckless and illconceived policies. We are failing to fulfill that duty by refusing to repeal the Muslim ban, by refusing to investigate the President’s many conflicts of interest. And by refusing to stand up for America’s most basic principles, my friends across the aisle are putting our global leadership and the integrity of our government at risk. If ever there was a time to choose your country over your party, this is it. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, we have four more speakers. We have had an overwhelming response to the Progressive Caucus’ Special Order on the executive orders here. I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN ). Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) and the gentlewoman from Washington State (Ms. JAYAPAL ) for the Progressive Caucus’ Special Order hour. I was on the floor earlier today talking about my concerns very specifically around this, as it relates to the countries that were selected and the fact that these were not countries that were selected for any reason other than the fact that they are Muslim countries and that Mr. Trump has decided that they should be included. What I want to talk about tonight is my district and how this affects it. We saw the crowds in New York, California, Chicago, Boston, and other big cities that have international airports and the activities this weekend; but in Madison, Wisconsin, we have had a very direct impact. We have 115 faculty, students, and staff, right now, impacted by this decision. In fact, there is one joint national CanadianIranian student who is in Brazil who has been advised not to come back. What I want to do is read into the RECORD this statement. We are working on a case of someone who is an Iraqi national, and this is a letter written by someone who served with him in the military. I want to read this very quickly: I am contacting you regarding John, an Iraqi national who earned a special immigration visa for his work with the U.S. Army over two different 3year periods in Baghdad and another region of Iraq. My personal acquaintance with him, where he is a translator in a small 12man military training team I led. The recent executive order curtailing immigration from Iraq, along with six other countries, has halted his plan to emigrate with his family. He and his fellow translators provided an invaluable service to the team. They braved the same dangers we all faced. They rode in the same vehicles, walked the same streets, met with the same people. The only difference is is they were unarmed and, after missions when we returned to secure FOBs, they had to return to live in their communities unprotected. John was wounded while working with the U.S. Army, and he provided honorable service to the country for years. 
This is who is the target of President Trump’s executive order banning Muslims. This is wrong, and we need it to stop. President Trump, rescind your order. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Washington State (Ms. JAYAPAL ) and I thank all of the Members who have come pouring out in response for this Progressive Caucus Special Order. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ). b1745 Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, refugees that are fleeing for their lives are not the enemy. Look at this 3year old Syrian boy, Aylan Kurdi, who washed up on a beach in Turkey. He and his older brother and his mother drowned. They were among, literally, thousands of people who drowned escaping the violence that was certain in their home country of Syria. Now the President is trying to keep them out of our country. He is condemning more children like Aylan to their death with this executive order. And in face of this immoral action by the administration, I have witnessed the decency and generosity of people in my district. I was proud to join people of all faiths in rallies to support our refugees and our Muslim neighbors. I was with lawyers who rushed to O’Hare Airport to offer assistance to those who suddenly are detained under the executive order. I have received hundreds of letters. One was from a couple who had joined with 13 friends to welcome and provide assistance to a family that wanted to resettle from Syria. They had collected money. They had collected furniture. They had worked for over a year in order to make this happen, and they finally got word that they were actually going to get a family to come. Then, on January 30, they got official word that the family would not be allowed to enter. And now they don’t know what happened to that family. Let me just read the end of that letter. He said: 
Now we don’t know what happened to the family. Because they are Syrian, they are indefinitely banned from the United States. 
Meanwhile, we have a warm apartment and $12,000 waiting for them. We have rooms full of furniture stockpiled, and no way to get to them. As a group of Chicagoans, as a secondgeneration American myself, we came together to aid a family in dire need and to affirm the quintessential American values of openness and inclusiveness. I can’t stop thinking about that couple, what they are telling their children right now, and where they will sleep tonight. Turning our back on families and children who are fleeing a war is not our best strategic interest as a nation, nor is it in our best interest as decent human beings. 
Thank you from Maria Demopolis, Chicago, Illinois. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ). Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise here to protest the deaths that are occurring, protest the horrible situation that our President has put upon us. I include in the RECORD a letter that I have received from the University of California at Davis, and the Mayor of the City of Davis, California, who have so clearly laid out the impact that the immigration ban and the ban on refugees has put upon the university and the community. 
[From Ralph J. Hexter, Interim Chancellor, University of California Davis, and Robb Davis, Mayor, city of Davis] We have over 5000 international students and scholars at UC Davis, many of whom are actively questioning what future actions by this administration might mean for them. This is an incredibly disorienting time for all our international guests. Here are some specific cases that illustrate challenges that students and scholars all over the country are facing at this time. These are specific to our community. (Note: as you know, F–1 status is for students at any degree level authorized to study in the US at accredited universities. J–1 can refer either to students or scholars in the US Visitor Exchange Program) 1. A former J–1 scholar from Iran is in the US arranging the move of his wife and son, while awaiting green card processing. He was to have left the US for final interviews and processing but is now uncertain. He has an appointment in UC Davis’ Plant Sciences Department. 2. An Iranian PhD student who was to have started at UC Davis this spring (he was accepted), recently obtained his visa, was to arrive in March, 2017, to start classes April 4. His ability to start then is now in doubt. In addition, his proposed roommate, who is already here from Iran, was counting on him to share expenses. This person now finds himself in a difficult situation. 3. An Iranian F–2 (spouse of F–1) is concerned about her ability to change to F–1 status to become a student. She has been accepted at UC Davis. 4. An Iranian student applying for a Master’s program in Engineering at UC Davis is asking about whether she should continue her application process. 5. The spouse of an F–1 student (F–2 status) is currently stuck outside the US and unable to be reunited with her family. 6. An Iranian F–1 PhD student, who started in Fall 2016 quarter had invited his father to visit. This student has a sister with two children in the US and she and they are American citizens. The father/grandfather had a visa interview scheduled in Yerevan, Armenia for February 8th so he could come on a tourist visa to visit the student son and daughter and grandchildren. His visa interview has now been canceled. Attached are the pictures of the two grandchildren he will not be able to see. He has not been able to see his daughter for five years. 7. Scholar advisors at UC Davis are being asked by scholars of these countries if it is safe to travel within the USA. The fact that scholars must ask this shows the fear that exists. 8. Departmental staff is questioning whether to admit students or invite scholars from these countries for summer and fall arrivals. There is much confusion. 9. A high profile scholar from one of the countries (his profile might put him at risk) was set to come to UC Davis to do research on responses to humanitarian abuses in his country. Because of the order, UC Davis was not permitted to provide him with documentation necessary to obtain a visa. These stories were gathered in the past 5 hours WITHIN the City of Davis and the University. We are a small city of 65,000. The fact that Iranians are the main nationality represented comes as no surprise. UC Davis and the City of Davis are home to many Iranians and have been for a generation at least. The fact that the Trump Administration can point to NO attacks by Iranians on US soil or against US interests makes their exclusion seem particularly arbitrary and cruel to us. MAYOR DAVIS’ LETTER TO GARAMENDI ON  MUSLIM BAN (By Vanguard Administrator) REPRESENTATIVE GARAMENDI : Thanks for your interest in the challenges the City of Davis and UC Davis are facing in light of President Trump’s executive order restricting entry for citizens from 7, predominantly Muslim nations. UC Davis has 87 students or scholars from Iran, Iraq and Libya, with unknown numbers of Iranian faculty, family members and workers with permanent residency living in our City. In addition, the following shows the large numbers of students and scholars from other predominantly Muslim countries currently at UC Davis. While these countries are not covered by the current Executive Order, students and scholars from them are very concerned about their future status and ability to travel home or receive visitors from home. 1. Bangladesh: 14 students, 9 scholars 2. Egypt: 14 students, 7 scholars 3. Indonesia: 147 students, 1 scholar 4. Malaysia: 49 students, 6 scholars 5. Morocco: 4 students, 1 scholar 6. Nigeria: 4 students, 2 scholars 7. Pakistan: 18 students, 14 scholars 8. Turkey: 31 students, 9 scholars Beyond these numbers we have over 5000 students and scholars at UC Davis, many of whom are actively questioning what future actions by this administration might mean for them. This is an incredibly disorienting time for all our international guests. Here are some specific cases that illustrate challenges that students and scholars all over the country are facing at this time. These are specific to our community. (Note: as you know, F–1 status is for students at any degree level authorized to study in the US at accredited universities. J–1 can refer either to students or scholars in the US Visitor Exchange Program) 1. A former J–1 scholar from Iran is in the US arranging the move of his wife and son, while awaiting green card processing. He was to have left the US for final interviews and processing but is now uncertain. He has an appointment in UC Davis’ Plant Sciences Department. 2. An Iranian PhD student who was to have started at UC Davis this spring (he was accepted), recently obtained his visa, was to arrive in March, 2017, to start classes April 4. His ability to start then is now in doubt. In addition, his proposed roommate, who is already here from Iran, was counting on him to share expenses. This person, now finds himself in a difficult situation. 3. An Iranian F–2 (spouse of F–1) is concerned about her ability to change to F–1 status to become a student. She has been accepted at UC Davis. 4. An Iranian student applying for a Master’s program in Engineering at UC Davis is asking about whether she should continue her application process. 5. The spouse of an F–1 student (F–2 status) is currently stuck outside the US and unable to be reunited with her family. 6. An Iranian F–1 PhD student, who started in Fall 2016 quarter had invited his father to visit. This student has a sister with two children in the US and she and they are American citizens. The father/grandfather had a visa interview scheduled in Yerevan, Armenia for February 8th so he could come on a tourist visa to visit the student son and daughter and grandchildren. His visa interview has now been canceled. Attached are the pictures of the two grandchildren he will not be able to see. He has not been able to see his daughter for five years. 7. Scholar advisors at UC Davis are being asked by scholars of these countries if it is safe to travel within the USA. The fact that scholars must ask this shows the fear that exists. 8. Departmental staff is questioning whether to admit students or invite scholars from these countries for summer and fall arrivals. There is much confusion. 9. A high profile scholar from one of the countries (his profile might put him at risk) was set to come to UC Davis to do research on responses to humanitarian abuses in his country. Because of the order, UC Davis was not permitted to provide him with documentation necessary to obtain a visa. These stories were gathered in the past 5 hours WITHIN the City of Davis and the University. We are a small city of 65,000. The fact that Iranians are the main nationality represented comes as no surprise. UC Davis and the City of Davis are home to many Iranians and have been for a generation at least. The fact that the Trump Administration can point to NO attacks by Iranians on US soil or against US interests makes their exclusion seem particularly arbitrary and cruel to us. Finally, I wanted to share with you a joint statement from Interim Chancellor Ralph Hexter and me to our campus and community. Thanks for helping us get the word out on the challenges that we are facing in light of the Executive Order. 
IMMIGRATION EXECUTIVE ORDER : Our city and university host over 5,000 international students, faculty members and scholars, as well as their families. Many of them come from nations with majority Muslim populations. These are our neighbors, friends and colleagues. They have faces and stories we know well. They contribute in myriad ways to our community and our university. They are part of us. We are deeply concerned by the impact of the recent executive order that restricts the ability of students, faculty, staff and other members of our community from certain countries to return to the United States if they are currently traveling or plan to travel abroad. The threat of the order and the order itself are already having impacts on people in our town and university, on their academic, professional and personal lives. 
We understand it is the federal government’s role to maintain the security of the nation’s borders. However, this executive order’s impact on our friends and colleagues is inconsistent with the values of our community. It has created uncertainty and fear that hurts the University of California, Davis, and the city of Davis. We have long been deeply enriched by students, faculty, scholars and health care professionals from around the world—including the affected countries—coming to study, teach, research and make our lives richer and better. Any effort to make these valuable members of our community feel unwelcome is antithetical to our mission of expanding learning and generating new knowledge. Nothing, however, will cause us to retreat from the shared principles of community we have developed together, and to all of our friends from here and abroad, you have our commitment to welcome you. Sincerely, RALPH J. H EXTER , Interim Chancellor. ROBBDAVIS, Mayor, city of Davis. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. It is a terrible situation, but I do want to—— The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BANKS of Indiana). The time of the gentleman from Maryland has expired. Mr. RASKIN. Could we allow the gentleman to complete his statement just with 1 minute? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman may ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute. Mr. RASKIN. I ask unanimous consent for just 1 minute to complete—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from California ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute? Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, reserving my right to object, I would just like to note that we knew where the clock was going on this, but I made a speech today in the Judiciary Committee, and I want to stand by my word and acknowledge the gentleman and not object so the gentleman can complete his statement. Mr. RASKIN. I thank the gentleman. That is very gracious of the Congressman. 
HORRORS OF THE IMMIGRATION BAN (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GARAMENDI. I will just finish this up very quickly. I think we need to look to where this problem emanates. It emanates from the President’s adviser, Mr. Bannon. He has been at this for some time talking about the nature of America being a White nationalist nation. So if we look beyond the horror that this ban places, we need to look to where it emanates, Mr. Bannon, clearly this comes from him, and we need to focus our attention on what he has done to this Nation’s values. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. RASKIN. If the gentleman has a few seconds left, I would just say I know the distinguished Congressman KINGis going to go, and then we have a couple more people who were left over from the Progressive Caucus Special Order who will stay for 1minutes after. 
REQUEST TO ADDRESS THE HOUSE FOR 1 MINUTE Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for 1 minute. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Michigan? Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I do now object because I have been waiting for a half hour. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is heard. 
THE PRESIDENT’S EXECUTIVE ORDER IS NOT A MUSLIM BAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) for 30 minutes. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I regret I wasn’t able to work with all of the speakers here tonight they wanted to pack within that hour. I understand that they have prepared themselves to give this speech tonight, and there will be opportunities in each succeeding day. I just wanted to recognize their right to speak on this floor under the rules and be as lenient as I can, and also, of course, defending my own rights at the same time. But I would acknowledge that we did have a discussion before the Judiciary Committee today, and I want this Congress to have the level of comity so that we can exchange ideas and bounce them off of each other. And I have long believed that if I can’t sustain myself in debate, I have got two choices. One of them is go back and do more research and build enough information that I can to sustain myself; and the other is adopt the other fellow’s position. I am not very inclined to do that, but I am inclined to listen to their positions. So, as I have listened to these positions here for more than an hour here on the floor, things come to me and I hear these words recurring over and over again. I didn’t get a full count on it, but I know I heard 7, 8, 10, or maybe even more, times saying that the President’s executive order is a Muslim ban. Now, looking through that executive order—and I haven’t read it thoroughly word by word, but those who were vetting that executive order, to use that term, tell me the word ‘‘Muslim’’ is not used in that executive order. I am going to assert that is the case, that President Trump did not use the word ‘‘Muslim’’ in his executive order, and that the executive order is not a Muslim ban, but is a ban on travel from seven countries that are Muslim majority. If it was his intention to try to block Muslims from coming into America, he would have started with Indonesia rather than Iraq and Syria and the wartorn countries. So I will assert it is not a Muslim ban, except that the words ‘‘Muslim ban’’ are in the talking points of the Democrats, and they will repeat it over and over and over again, as if somehow they could amend the executive order to have the words ‘‘Muslim ban’’ in there so they can have their grievance to the executive order. I saw this unfold on Friday, when the President issued his executive order. It was a big day, I admit. He has had a lot of executive orders, and they have been raining down pretty fast on this country, and I am glad of that. We should objectively deal with the directive that is there. It is a temporary travel ban that focuses on the seven countries that President Barack Obama identified as the most dangerous countries, I call them terrorist spawning countries. It is a prudent thing on the part of the President to temporarily suspend travel from those countries. I would have added a few more countries in the suspension of the travel to the United States. It is his intention, and I think it is clearly stated within his executive order to evaluate the security circumstances coming from each of these countries and determine how we can have a better policy, especially to do extreme vetting on the travel people that are coming from not only these seven countries, but other countries that do send terrorists to us. And I won’t start down that list, but we know it is extensive. I will say some of the countries that are not on this list are Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other countries that would be listed as Arab countries, but including Indonesia, which is the largest population of Muslims, but the lowest concentration of terrorist production per Islamic society that I know of in the world. So I think this reflects the danger and the risk to Americans and a prudent approach to this. It is not only the ban on travel that is not a Muslim ban, not a Muslim ban—if I had to say that enough times to negate the times that that has been asserted here on the floor, I suppose I could; but we are going to hear it in the news every day because that seems to be what pays off politically. The argument that it was a religious test; this executive order is not a religious test. It doesn’t reference religion. In fact, when I have asked questions of the officials of the Obama administration, I have said to them: Why is it that Christians don’t seem to be allowed into the United States as refugees under the Obama administration? We saw one group that was 1,500 somestrong that had one Christian in there. So I traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, and sat down with the lead on UNHCR, the United Nations Council on 
Refugees. And there, I believe her name is Kelly Clements, I asked: Do you determine when you are vetting refugees, what their religious is? She says: Yes, we do. And she said they had 115,000 refugees that they had run through their process that they had vetted. And of those 115,000, I said, how many of them are Christians? And she said: 15,000. So the rest of them, roughly the 100,000, she said almost all of them would be Muslim. But they fill out a form. They attest to their religion. They are in the database. We can identify Christians. They are the ones that are persecuted. They are the ones that are being targeted because of their religion. The Assyrian Christians, the Chaldean Christians, and then not Christians, but the Yazidis, they are the three groups that are targeted the most. We should establish an international safe zone for them in their neighborhood. When the word comes out that these countries have accepted a list of refugees, such as Lebanon or Jordan, there are also countries that haven’t accepted any significant number, like Saudi Arabia. Why shouldn’t the neighbors accept refugees, Mr. Speaker? They are the ones that have the most security at stake. They are the ones that are most invested in trying to establish stability in that part of the world. Don’t we want people who have lived, say, in the Nineveh Plains region since antiquity to be close to home so that when security circumstances and economic circumstances settle down, they can come back to their homes where they have lived since antiquity? Of course we do. We see data from last year that says $64,000 is about the typical cost of resettling one refugee in the United States; $64,000. But that same amount of money will take care of a dozen people over in their neighborhood rather than one person here in America. Why shouldn’t we get a 12to1 return on the taxpayers’ investment and help people in the region where they live so that they can go back to their homeland again and grow their families and grow their population and their industry and reestablish their roots rather than let ISIS push the Christians out of the Middle East and push the versions of Islam out that they hate the most? If we take people out of there and resettle them in large numbers, we are giving them the region that they would like to have ethnically cleansed of the people they disagree with. So we are helping out their war effort by pulling people out of the way and bringing them here. They need to stay close to home. Especially the young men need to take up arms and defend their own country. I went over to the Middle East and I walked in that river of epic migration, that river of humanity that is flowing into Europe and has been flowing into Europe for 2 years, nearly solid. As I walked in that river of humanity, I asked them a lot of questions and I was able to communicate with them; sometimes an interpreter, sometimes hand signals, sometimes a word here or there of English or something else. Here is what I asked them: Where are you going? This was in Serbia. In my mind, as I watched them board the trains in Serbia—1,000 at a time and day and night, I might add—I would say: Where are you going? Germany. Do you have family there? No. Do you have friends there? No. Do you have a job there? No. What will you do? I don’t know. How will you live? Germany will take care of me. That is the answer that I got over and over again. Eightyone percent of that human river were, let’s say, militaryage males. They left their family? They leave their family in Syria and Iraq to go into Europe? What responsible father does that when he should be home defending his country and defending his family? They are not going because they are war refugees, for the most part. That wave is over. They are going primarily because they are economic refugees. They are economic refugees because we hang the carrot out in front of them and we say: Come to the United States. We will bring you over here and we will make sure that we take care of all of your needs. You don’t have to worry about anything. b1800 We are competing with countries like Germany, Austria, Sweden, and the Netherlands because they offer a standard of living. The law in Germany is that there is a baseline standard of living that every human being receives, work or not. Angela Merkel says: Come to Germany, and we will take care of you. I recall a 10minuteand49second videotape of her in a townhall meeting speaking to a blonde German lady who stood up and said: Why are you doing this? They are killing us. They are raping us. They are taking German jobs. Why do you do this? Chancellor Merkel’s answer was: We cannot be ruled by fear, and your voice is a voice of fear. So she just devalued or denigrated the voice of the griefstricken German woman. She said: We cannot stop them. We must take care of them. The violence that they are perpetrating against Germans is not going to be as great as that which we have perpetrated against others in our most recent history. That is the statement, Mr. Speaker. The constitution in Germany says they have to accept refugees. We put that in there postWorld War II. Because they had created so many, we required that they take them. In their law that they have written there is a baseline standard of living. The other part was Nazi guilt. So Chancellor Merkel opened that all up because of those roughly four reasons that I have given you, and 1.6 or so million poured into Germany. The last two New Year’s Eves have seen rape after rape after rape—many of them not even investigated—right there next to the dome of the Cologne Cathedral. It is an annual event now: New Year’s Eve in Cologne, migrant men come and rape German women there. That is the last 2 years, and you hardly find that in the news unless you know where to look. I do look, and I talk to people over there. This is not a Muslim ban. This is not a religious test. You can read the executive order and determine that. The difference is my constituents will check to see if I am telling them the truth. Others’ constituents apparently don’t hold them accountable. It has no reference to whatever color people are, whatever race they are, whatever ethnicity, or whatever the national origin—I guess in a way because it says if you are coming from these nations. I will agree, we have Iraqis who have helped us and saved American lives, and we have Afghans who have helped us and saved American lives. But, on balance, this has been blown completely out of proportion. Here is another statement that was made about the refugees. This is a quote from the gentleman who spoke here, ‘‘an executive order banning Muslims.’’ Again, it is an executive order, and it bans travel from seven Muslim countries—primarily Muslim countries—but it bans Christians as well as Muslims coming from those countries. As for the Christians, I think we should have been allowed in because they are the ones who were targeted. By the way, Egypt is not on this list, but the Christians were targeted there. They blew up the church where the Coptic Pope presides. I visited him there. They killed 50 or so Christians, and they have blown up churches all over the place. That is, by the way, Muslims attacking Christians, just for the record. When the gentlewoman spoke here of the 3yearold who washed up on the beach, that is the one that troubles me a lot. I saw that image. I watched that picture, and it went right into my heart like it did most everybody else in this country. That has been several weeks ago that America was mobilized by that little boy lying face down on the shores of the Mediterranean after the boat had capsized and many of them had drowned, including his father. But it came out a couple of days ago that that family had been living in Turkey for 3 years, and that the father 
of that little boy’s sister had been sending money to them so that they could slip into Europe because the father needed a new set of teeth. They were motivated so the father could get dental work perhaps most likely in Germany. It wasn’t because they were running from the war. They had stabilized themselves in Turkey for 3 years. They were going to Germany for the dental work of the father. That is a matter now of public record that has been exposed by Kerry Picket who did the research back on this and corroborated by a number of other news outlets as well. So it isn’t always what we see. It isn’t always what it seems. The people who speak into the megaphone in the airports aren’t always telling us the truth. We find out sometimes it is anything but the truth. What is the truth is that there has been a tragic war in the Middle East, and it continues. The civilian population has been decimated in Syria, and there are refugees going in all directions. A lot of it is because we have created and we have allowed for a power vacuum—a power vacuum in Syria. That brought Putin into that power vacuum, and he was able to assert himself and, so far, at least, protect alAssad. In doing so, we see the operations of the invasion that has come out of Baghdad and gone up towards Mosul and taken the east side of the river in Mosul. The west side is still held by ISIS. I think that is a shortsighted strategy to have Shia militia, Iraniansupported Shia militia going in to take Mosul when Mosul is populated by Kurds in the suburbs and Sunni Muslims in the inner city. How are the Shias going to govern a city that doesn’t, in any substantial way, include their population? So I am troubled by shortsighted decisions that don’t seem to take into account the tribal connections that we know have been so much a part of the sectarian strife that has been a part of Iraq, Syria, and also Iran in the Middle East. I want people to be selfdetermining. I want people to be able to determine their own government and rule their own countries. This is going to take a prudent knowledge of those tribes, and it is going to take input from them. We need to build alliances in the Middle East with the moderate Muslim countries that will join with us in bringing out stable governments that respect the autonomy of the populations that live within the various regions. That is the best solution that can come about, and it doesn’t put a lot of American boots on the ground. So I hope we can step back, Mr. Speaker, and take a deep breath and recognize it is not a Muslim ban, and it is not a religious test. But I want this statement to go into the RECORD with clarity, and that is that the President of the United States not only has the constitutional authority to bring about this suspension of travel from these seven countries because of security reasons, he is specifically authorized to do so by the United States Code, by Federal Law. So he is operating within the law; he is operating within the Constitution; and he is operating within the realms of prudence, at least on a temporary basis. I am hopeful that the input that we have is an input that will help bring about the dialogue in this country. The debate we have here on the floor hopefully causes people to think about this, go back and read the executive order, look for the word Muslim or Muslim ban, look for any kind of religious test. There is none. But I think we ought to know. I mentioned and didn’t go deeply enough into this that when the executive branch of government, the USCIS in particular, and ICE included, when I asked them: When you have these applicants for refugees that you say you are vetting, then do you know what religion they are? They say: No. Do we ask them? No. We don’t ask, but the information is there in the database at UNHCR, at the United Nations. They had vetted 15,000 Christians, and one got through in a list of 1,500. I think that was probably a mistake. I think there was a religious test for refugees under Obama, and I think it was a preference for Muslims, and it was discriminating against Christians. I hope that we can have a stable policy that brings people relief, but I think the prudent one is give them a place to live in the Middle East, protect them, and create an international safe zone so that they can live in peace where they have lived since antiquity. Mr. Speaker, I have addressed the topic of what I heard as I sat on the floor tonight. I really came to the floor here to speak in favor of Judge Neil Gorsuch. Mr. RASKIN. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. KING of Iowa. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland and welcome him to the United States Congress. Mr. RASKIN. I thank you for your thoughtful comments tonight, and I think you made some good points. I think you effectively made the point that this is not, strictly speaking, a Muslim ban. It is not a ban on all Muslims entering the country. In the popular vernacular, the public has taken up basically what was the current President’s language that he used during the campaign. So people are using it for kind of a shorthand. But I want to ask you about the ban. It is not the case that there is no religious reference in the executive order because it does say that the religious minorities from those countries are given preference, and that would be the Christians in those countries. One thing I think that does need to be corrected is thousands of Christians were admitted from the Muslim world under the Obama administration, and there was no discrimination. In fact, I think there were almost as many Christians admitted as Muslims. But here is my real question for you. The 9/11 hijackers—which was the worst terrorist atrocity ever committed on our shores, thousands of Americans were killed, the country plunged into chaos—came from three countries: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates. All three of those countries where Trump Industries does business were exempted from the ban on the seven countries. Why? What is the policy justification for not including that? None of the countries that are included in the ban produced any of the terrorist attacks that we saw in Orlando, in San Bernardino County, or any of the other ones. So how were those chosen and the source countries for the 9/11 attack exempted? Mr. KING of Iowa. Reclaiming my time, in addressing both of those topics, the gentleman’s data that says that more Christians than Muslims have been brought in as refugees, I have heard that as an Obama administration information that has come out. That doesn’t match up with the data that I have seen when I traveled to places like Geneva and looked at that or looked at the data that came out before that release. The data up to that release indicated entirely the opposite which I have identified. And the data that came out in the last weeks of the Obama administration asserted that they had a significant number of Christians who were part of that. I appreciate the gentleman’s point that the executive order references religious minorities, and I appreciate that it does, because I think they are the ones that are targeted. But the gentleman’s point about the origin of the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 is an accurate point, and the largest number of them came from Saudi Arabia. I would just assert that because Donald Trump has done business in three of those countries, I would be surprised if he didn’t do business in a place like Dubai where they have developed a wonderland out of the desert, and his business in each of those countries. How many other countries has he done business in? I don’t think we can correlate that. But what we can correlate is that these seven countries are the countries identified by the Obama administration. So, maintaining my time, we can have conjecture on this back and forth. But the facts are that it is the Obama administration that identified these seven countries, and it is the Trump administration that brought them forward with the travel ban on them. I believe it is a coincidence that these other countries are places among many countries that Donald Trump has done business in. I know that I only have about 7 minutes remaining to take up Judge Gorsuch, but I would yield to the gentleman briefly, simply out of the comity that we discussed earlier today. 
Mr. RASKIN. Again, that is very gracious of you, and I appreciate the spirit with which you engage in this dialogue. I think it is something we really do need to get to the bottom of. To my knowledge, Trump Industries is not doing business in the poor Muslim countries that were targeted like Somalia, Libya, and so on, but perhaps I can be corrected. In any event, the fact that he has done business in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt, and United Arab Emirates—in the wealthier Muslim countries—it may be logical as a matter of business practice, but I don’t think that can become the basis for American foreign policy. I think that is the reason why this policy has created such outrage in America and around the world because it doesn’t seem to have any national security logic to it. It is not about terrorism unless you can convince me that those seven countries actually generated terrorism. Mr. KING of Iowa. Reclaiming my time, it is conjecture that any of the Trump businesses had anything to do with this decision. It is pure conjecture. If the argument is that Donald Trump didn’t do business in Somalia, I wouldn’t blame him one bit. If anybody watched ‘‘Black Hawk Down’’ then they would know a good reason. It is essentially a terrorist state in Somalia. So I will thank the gentleman for his comments, and I am going to turn then to Judge Neil Gorsuch and see if I can make that point yet this evening, and it is this: We had this vacancy in the Supreme Court. It is a vacancy that is brought about by the tragic death of Justice Antonin Scalia, a man whom many of us have admired for a long time and enjoyed his friendship, his company, his sense of humor, his gregariousness, and also especially his dissenting opinions that were written for the law school students whom he always understood would have to read the dissent when they studied the cases. He wanted to write them in such a way that they would read them, hopefully enjoy them, and remember them. He has been a speaker before the Conservative Opportunity Society which I have chaired for some time, and he has done it a number of times. We really enjoyed his company. We had very engaging debates and discussions. There is a huge hole in the United States Supreme Court created by the loss of Justice Scalia. I am grateful that we have taken serious time in filling that hole and seeing a nominee come forward that has the chance to grow into the shoes of Justice Scalia. b1815 As I went to the White House a couple of nights ago to be there to witness the ceremony of the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch, we were all briefed on a lot of things that had to do with his bio. I am just quickly going to touch on some of the high points in Judge Gorsuch’s bio. His undergraduate school was Columbia University, with honors, Phi Beta Kappa; Harvard Law School, cum laude; a Truman Scholar, where he received his juris doctorate; then went to Oxford as a Marshall Scholar and received another doctoral degree, a Ph.D. in philosophy. Then he became a clerk for Justice White, and then, later on, for Justice Kennedy. If he is confirmed, it will be, we think, the first time that there has been a clerk that became a Justice on the Supreme Court serving with the Justice whom he clerked for. So that is a unique component of Judge Gorsuch. He is a man of the West. He has a strong work ethic and common sense. He is an outdoorsman. He loves to fly fish, and he raises animals in his barn at home. His background, he was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but worked bluecollar jobs and worked his way up. We know that he accelerated his education very well. For his 10 years on the bench, he clerked for the judge on the D.C. Circuit, and then from there, clerking for the Supreme Court Justices, whom I mentioned, White and Kennedy. He was then appointed by George W. Bush on May 10, 2006, after a decade in private practice where he became a partner in a large law firm. They must have liked him there. They took him in as an associate, and he became a partner for a decade. Then in his heart was that he wanted to be a judge, and he wanted to protect the Constitution and the rule of law. After a year at the Department of Justice, George W. Bush appointed him to the D.C. Circuit. There, he was confirmed by the United States Senate, without dissent, by a voice vote on July 20, 2006. He served for more than a decade as a district court judge. His record is stellar. When I asked questions about Judge Gorsuch, I learned a number of things. One of them was that, of the 21 candidates that were listed by, first, Presidentelect Trump and, now, President Trump—he would draw from that list and nominate, and then seek confirmation and appoint from that list—each candidate was asked the question as they were interviewed: Who would you name for this position if it isn’t going to be you? A tough question. So, it is like saying, I would interpret that as: Who do I think is second best? That is the only reason I would be there is if I thought I was the best choice. I would think that is what all of them must have thought as they were interviewed. There were 21 candidates. You take one out of that number, because that is Judge Gorsuch himself. We don’t know how he answered this question. When the other 20 were asked, if it is not to be you, who shall it be, everyone said Judge Neil Gorsuch. There can’t be a stronger endorsement than that. It shows a respect from all of his competing peers. I believe that they believe he will do the best and the clearest job of preserving, protecting, and defending our Constitution and read the letter of the Constitution and interpret it, as Judge Scalia did, to mean what it says and to be understood to mean what it says and was understood at the time of ratification of the body of the Constitution or the various amendments, whichever the case may be. That is the strongest and most profound. When I asked the question what is his level of respect for stare decisis, the people who know him and studied him say he has more respect for the text of the Constitution than the decisions that have been made along the way. I think that he will recognize those decisions. I asked that question, would he look into them to determine if that rationale has helped his rationale but always anchor it back to the Constitution and the original understanding. This is secondhand of the people that know him, but the best answer I can get from that is yes. The next one is the Chevron doctrine. He has written about the Chevron doctrine. It is pretty clear that he thinks that the Chevron doctrine is unjustly created by the courts and that you shouldn’t give administrators of undue legislative authority the benefit of the doubt. So those things sound really good to me. I am looking forward to the confirmation hearings. Hopefully, an expeditious confirmation of Judge Gorsuch. I am very, very happy with the selection that President Trump has made, and I really appreciate what I saw there that night as I watched Judge Gorsuch. In the middle of his speech, he turned and looked at his wife, Marie Louise, and there was that significant eye contact that told me that they are a bonded couple that are a team together. The friends of the family tell me she is more conservative than he is. So I look forward to his confirmation. I think the President of the United States has made a terrific choice. Let’s get the judicial branch of government up and running again, along with the executive branch, and let’s keep up pace here in the House. We have got some work to do, too. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
OPPOSITION TO MUSLIM BAN (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I want to just conclude our earlier Special Order where many of my colleagues spoke out in strong opposition to the Muslim ban that was just signed by President Trump. I would like to read a short paragraph from the letter that we have now 
submitted to Secretary Kelly. It has been signed by over 110 of my colleagues in the House. It requests that we have an immediate emergency meeting and briefing. I include in the RECORD the entire letter, and I will just read a short portion. ‘‘The Executive Order is both controversial and confusing. For example, the International Rescue Committee called the Order ‘harmful and hasty’ noting ‘America has the strongest, most successful resettlement program in the world.’ Over 4,000 academics, including 25 Nobel Laureates, have signed a petition denouncing the Order, writing ‘this measure is fatally disruptive to the lives of these immigrants, their families, and the communities of which they form an integral part. It is inhumane, ineffective, and unAmerican.’’’ 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, February 1, 2017. Hon. JOHNF. K ELLY , Secretary of Homeland Security, Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC. SECRETARY KELLY : We write to strongly condemn the President’s executive order issued January 27, 2017, titled ‘‘Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,’’ and the ensuing actions taken by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its agencies, in particular Customs and Border Protection (CBP), to implement the order, and to request an urgent briefing regarding the same. We hope you will urge the President to immediately rescind the Executive Order, which has created profound chaos and fear among refugees and immigrants who have been admitted to the United States, as well as their families. As a nation of immigrants that has been a refuge for people fleeing persecution from around the world, these actions are contrary to who we are as a nation. We understand that you met yesterday at 4:30 PM with Chairs and Ranking Members of relevant Committees to discuss ‘‘recent executive actions.’’ You should understand that such a time limited meeting with a subset of Members and Senators in no way obviates the need for the briefing we are requesting for all Members. Such full Member briefings are a frequent occurrence on Capitol Hill after important events such as the issuance of the January 27 Executive Order. They allow all Members to benefit from the knowledge and experiences of the executive branch so that we may be well informed in our legislative and oversight affairs and serve our constituents best. The full Member briefing regarding the Executive Order is particularly needed given the unsettling events of last evening—the abrupt firing of Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and the termination without explanation of Daniel Ragsdale as acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The need to brief the full Democratic.Caucus is also necessary as we now understand that guidance concerning the January 27 Executive Order has been provided to Members of the Republican Conference, but not the Democratic Caucus. According to yesterday’s Washington Post, ‘‘substantive guidance [concerning the Executive Order was given] to congressional Republicans . . . late Saturday. . . . In a twopage memo that offered some details on the policy . . .’’. The Executive Order harms our families, economy, and national security. Over the weekend, individuals—some of whom have been lawful permanent residents for decades—were found stranded outside the United States, leaving families in turmoil. Technology companies, including industry leaders like Microsoft, Google, and Apple, report that the Executive Order could directly impact their employees and hinder their ability to attract the best talent from around the world. In addition, the policy reflected in the Executive Order is counterproductive to our national security. We understand that scores of American diplomats stationed across the globe are drafting a formal ‘‘dissent memo’’ to register their objections, stating that the order will ‘‘not achieve its aim of making our country safer’’ and will instead result in a ‘‘drop in international good will towards Americans and a threat to our economy.’’ We need to develop relationships with Muslim countries and others seeking to combat terrorism. Unfortunately, the Order alienates many of the groups we need to have working alongside us. The Executive Order is both controversial and confusing. For example, the International Rescue Committee called the Order ‘‘harmful and hasty’’ noting ‘‘America has the strongest, most successful resettlement program in the world.’’ Over 4,000 academics, including 25 Nobel Laureates, have signed a petition denouncing the Order, writing ‘‘[t]his measure is fatally disruptive to the lives of these immigrants, their families, and the communities of which they form an integral part. It is inhumane, ineffective, and un American.’’ The Order has resulted in widespread confusion, as hundreds of individuals have been improperly detained at our airports, at least four federal courts have issued stays concerning the Order, and protests have broken out at airports and other venues nationwide. At the time this letter was sent, 16 State Attorneys General have condemned the Executive Order. In the interest of exercising proper Congressional oversight of DHS and CBP and of holding agencies accountable, we write to urgently request an emergency briefing this week with you and others at DHS and the Administration concerning the Executive Order. Among other things, we would like to receive the following, either at or in advance of the briefing: Any DHS guidance, directive, or policy regarding interpretation and implementation of the Executive Order, specifically is it pertains to current visa holders seeking entry into the United States, visa applicants, lawful permanent residents, dual citizens, and U.S. citizens, as well as clarification on the status of the individuals from the seven designated countries in the Order who are applying for or renewing immigration benefits. Details on individuals who have been prevented from entering the country, including the airport at which they arrived, location of detention, number provided with interpretation services, number who have been released broken down by airport, number of individuals who were sent back broken down by nationality, and a breakdown of the immigration status of those being detained and those who were sent back. The manner in which DHS is complying with the various courtissued stays of removal, including the number of individuals who have been provided access to counsel. What, if, any accommodations are being considered for interpreters and translators from the seven designated nations who have worked with our military and intelligence, as well as notable academics coming to do research in the U.S. The manner in which the exceptions to the Executive Order’s application with respect to ‘‘religious minorities’’ will be applied, particularly given Mr. Trump’s series of statements concerning his preference for Christian refugees. In addition, and among other things, we would like to be briefed by you on the accuracy of President Trump’s assertion that the Executive Order can be justified because thenpresident Obama had ‘‘banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months’’ in 2011. It is our understanding that in 2011 the Iraqi resettlement program was subject to a simple reduction for a short time while new security measures were added, In stark contrast, Mr. Trump’s Executive Order calls for a suspension of all refugees, not just one category, in addition to suspending the Syrian program indefinitely. For decades both Democratic and Republican Presidents have supported granting safe haven to families fleeing persecution, violence, terror, sexual slavery, and torture. At a time of unprecedented forced migration across the world, the need for American leadership in these areas has not subsided. Given the urgency, widespread confusion and dangerous impact of the Executive Order, we would appreciate hearing from you as quickly as possible so that we may ensure the briefing occurs by no later than Friday, February 3. The lives and wellbeing of many individuals, as well as our ability to partner with foreign governments to fight terrorism, depends on it. Sincerely, JOHNCONYERS , Jr. Member of Congress. ZOELOFGREN , Member of Congress. PRAMILA JAYAPAL , Member of Congress. (And an additional 111 Members of Congress.) f 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Mr. JONES (at the request of Mr. MCCARTHY ) for today on account of personal reasons. Mr. HASTINGS (at the request of Ms. PELOSI ) for today and February 3.

Members of the Committee or Subcommittee shall receive copies of transcripts for their prompt review and correction and prompt return to the Committee. The Committee or Subcommittee may order the printing of a hearing record without the corrections of any Member or witness if it determines that such Member or witness has been afforded a reasonable time in which to make such corrections and further delay would seriously impede the consideration of the legislative action that is subject of the hearing. The record of a hearing shall be closed 10 calendar days after the last oral testimony, unless the Committee or Subcommittee determines otherwise. Any person requesting to file a statement for the record of a hearing must so request before the hearing concludes and must file the statement before the record is closed, unless the Committee or Subcommittee determines otherwise.

The Chairman of a Subcommittee shall schedule a hearing only after consultation with the Chairman of the Committee and the Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee. After such consultation, the Chairman of the Subcommittee shall consult the Chairmen of the other subcommittees and shall request the Majority Staff Director to make a public announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of such hearing at least 1 week before the hearing. If the Chairman of the Committee or the Subcommittee, with concurrence of the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee, determines there is good cause to begin the hearing sooner, or if the Committee or Subcommittee so determines by majority vote, a quorum being present for the transaction of business, the Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee, as appropriate, shall request the Majority Staff Director to make such public announcement at the earliest possible date. The clerk of the Committee shall promptly notify the Daily Digest Clerk of the Congressional Record and shall promptly enter the appropriate information into the Committee scheduling service of the House Information Systems as soon as possible after such public announcement is made. (c) Scheduling of Witnesses.—Except as otherwise provided in this rule, the scheduling of witnesses and determination of the time allowed for the presentation of testimony at hearings shall be at the discretion of the Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee, unless a majority of the Committee or Subcommittee determines otherwise. (d) Written Statement; Oral Testimony.— (1) Each witness who is to appear before the Committee or a Subcommittee, shall insofar as practicable file with the Majority Staff Director of the Committee, at least 2 working days before the day of his or her appearance, a written statement of proposed testimony. Witnesses shall provide sufficient copies of their statement for distribution to Committee or Subcommittee Members, staff, and the news media. Insofar as practicable, the Committee or Subcommittee staff shall distribute such written statements to all Members of the Committee or Subcommittee as soon as they are received, as well as any official reports from departments and agencies on such subject matter. All witnesses may be limited in their oral presentations to 
brief summaries of their statements within the time allotted to them at the discretion of the Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee, in light of the nature of the testimony and the length of time available. (2) As noted in paragraph (b) of Committee Rule VII, the Chairman of the Committee, or any Member designated by the Chairman, may administer an oath to any witness. (3) To the greatest extent practicable, each witness appearing in a nongovernmental capacity shall include with the written statement of proposed testimony: (i) a curriculum vitae; (ii) disclosure of the amount and source (by agency and program) of any Federal grant (or subgrant thereof) or contract (or subcontract thereof) received during the current calendar year or either of the 2 preceding calendar years by the witness or by an entity represented by the witness; and (iii) disclosure of the amount and country of origin of any payment or contract related to the subject matter of the hearing originating with a foreign government received during the current calendar year or either of the 2 preceding calendar years by the witness or by an entity represented by the witness. Such statements, with appropriate redactions to protect the privacy of witnesses, shall be made publicly available in electronic form not later than 1 day after the witness appears. (e) Questioning of Witnesses.—Committee or Subcommittee Members may question witnesses only when they have been recognized by the Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee for that purpose. Each Member so recognized shall be limited to questioning a witness for 5 minutes until such time as each Member of the Committee or Subcommittee who so desires has had an opportunity to question the witness for 5 minutes; and thereafter the Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee may limit the time of a further round of questioning after giving due consideration to the importance of the subject matter and the length of time available. All questions put to witnesses shall be germane to the measure or matter under consideration. Unless a majority of the Committee or Subcommittee determines otherwise, no Committee or Subcommittee staff shall interrogate witnesses. (f) Extended Questioning for Designated Members.—Notwithstanding paragraph (e), the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member may designate an equal number of Members from each party to question a witness for a period not longer than 60 minutes. (g) Witnesses for the Minority.—When any hearing is conducted by the Committee or any Subcommittee upon any measure or matter, the minority party Members on the Committee or Subcommittee shall be entitled, upon request to the Chairman by a majority of those minority Members before the completion of such hearing, to call witnesses selected by the minority to testify with respect to that measure or matter during at least 1 day of hearing thereon as provided in clause 2(j)(1) of House Rule XI. (h) Summary of Subject Matter.—Upon announcement of a hearing, to the extent practicable, the Committee shall make available immediately to all Members of the Committee a concise summary of the subject matter (including legislative reports and other material) under consideration. In addition, upon announcement of a hearing and subsequently as they are received, the Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee shall, to the extent practicable, make available to the Members of the Committee any official reports from departments and agencies on such matter. (See paragraph(f) of Committee Rule XI.) (i) Open Hearings.—Each hearing conducted by the Committee or Subcommittee shall be open to the public, including radio, television, and still photography coverage, except as provided in clause 4 of House Rule XI (See also paragraph (b) of Committee Rule III.). In any event, no Member of the House may be excluded from nonparticipatory attendance at any hearing unless the House by majority vote shall authorize the Committee or Subcommittee, for purposes of a particular series of hearings on a particular bill or resolution or on a particular subject of investigation, to close its hearings to Members by means of the above procedure. (j) Hearings and Reports.—(1)(i) The Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee at a hearing shall announce in an opening statement the subject of the investigation. A copy of the Committee Rules (and the applicable provisions of clause 2 of House Rule XI, regarding hearing procedures, an excerpt of which appears in Appendix A thereto) shall be made available to each witness upon request. Witnesses at hearings may be accompanied by their own counsel for the purpose of advising them concerning their constitutional rights. The Chairman of the Committee or Subcommittee may punish breaches of order and decorum, and of professional ethics on the part of counsel, by censure and exclusion from the hearings; but only the full Committee may cite the offender to the House for contempt. (ii) Whenever it is asserted by a Member of the Committee that the evidence or testimony at a hearing may tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person, or it is asserted by a witness that the evidence or testimony that the witness would give at a hearing may tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate the witness, such testimony or evidence shall be presented in executive session, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) of this rule, if by a majority of those present, there being in attendance the requisite number required under the Rules of the Committee to be present for the purpose of taking testimony, the Committee or Subcommittee determines that such evidence or testimony may tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person. The Committee or Subcommittee shall afford a person an opportunity voluntarily to appear as a witness; and the Committee or Subcommittee shall receive and shall dispose of requests from such person to subpoena additional witnesses. (iii) No evidence or testimony taken in executive session may be released or used in public sessions without the consent of the Committee or Subcommittee. In the discretion of the Committee or Subcommittee, witnesses may submit brief and pertinent statements in writing for inclusion in the record. The Committee or Subcommittee is the sole judge of the pertinence of testimony and evidence adduced at its hearings.
