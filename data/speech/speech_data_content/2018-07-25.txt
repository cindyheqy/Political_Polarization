Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Thanet Natisri of Marion, Illinois, for his role in rescuing 12 young soccer players and their coach from a flooded cave in Thailand earlier this month. Thanet, a groundwater expert educated at SIU Carbondale, began doing charity work in his native country of Thailand 3 years ago. He was in Thailand assisting rural residents in fixing their water problems when he got the call from the Thai military. Within 3 hours, he was on a plane to go help divert rising water levels in the cave. The rescue operation used his expertise to divert water and allow divers to reach the soccer team. After 18 grueling days, which captivated the world, the boys and their soccer coach were safely rescued. Thanet, you played a vitally important role in saving 13 lives. Southern Illinois is proud. RECOGNIZING OFFICER JAMES HOLDER  
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Officer James Holder of Pinckneyville Police Department for receiving the Illinois State Bar Association’s Law Enforcement Award. The Law Enforcement Award recognizes officer conduct that promotes justice and brings honor and respect to the entire criminal justice system. Officer Holder was acknowledged for his involvement in a search and rescue operation during a major fire in an apartment building next to the Perry County Jail. He forcibly entered the building, notifying residents to immediately evacuate and clearing housing units to ensure no one was present. He proceeded to identify the source of the fire and work with other first responders as traffic and crowd control. Thank you, Officer Holder, for your brave service, and thank you to all of our first responders who are out there risking their lives every day to keep our communities safe. 
TIME TO CORRECT OUR FISCAL COURSE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, every day there is a headspinning moment with someone who is willing to push the Presidential powers to the point of abuse. Trump is undermining freedom of the press with unprecedented attacks. He cast doubt on the integrity and competence of United States intelligence services. He has an administration that is manipulating the data of a dishonest agency evaluation of the impact of monuments status that protects hundreds of thousands of acres and endangered species like the magnificent sagegrouse. Today’s outrage is a plan to use the Commodity Credit Corporation to funnel another $12 billion for a bailout of American farmers. You know, most farmers and ranchers don’t want a government bailout. They would like to be able to farm. They would like to be able to market. They would like to be able to sell their products without the threat of Trump’s trade war. Soon after Obama took office, inheriting the worst economy since the Great Depression, we have seen steady private sector employment growth for 9 consecutive years. Now, after inheriting a strong and growing economy, Trump and his enablers in the Republican Party are threatening this progress with a trade war that increases prices for American consumers, for American businesses, and is raising their costs. It is hard to keep track of everything. Trump is involved with an all out war on the Affordable Care Act. After utterly failing in his promise—remember, he was going to provide better healthcare for more people at lower cost. Who knew healthcare was complicated. Instead, his administration is raising insurance costs for millions in the individual market while destabilizing insurance for the rest of us. There were promises of tax reform, making it simpler and fairer. Instead, we have hopelessly complicated the Tax Code. We have given massive tax cuts for many people who didn’t need them. We are going to be watching for 
taxes being raised on homeowners across the country over the next 10 years. And, as a result of these actions for the budget and the taxes, we have doubled the budget deficit this year, with the prospect of deficits every year of a trillion dollars or more as far as the eye can see. After Republicans have cut over $2 trillion in taxes since 2001 for just the top 1 percent, what is the solution our Republican friends are offering to deal with the consequences? Look at the budget they just passed. Mr. Speaker, $2 trillion of cuts in programs for everybody else: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act. At some point, the public is going to catch on to what is happening to them. In fact, maybe they already are. Maybe that is the reason that the Republican tax cuts are less popular than Bill Clinton’s tax increase. It is time that we take a step back, while we still can, and get back on the appropriate fiscal course. It does not mean trade wars and providing money for people who don’t need it. Let’s allow the economy to function without gimmicks and bailouts. 
CTE BILL A WIN FOR ALL AMERICANS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which has seen unanimous support in both Chambers of Congress, something I hope continues today. I proudly championed this bill because I truly believe that passing it will be a win for students, for workers, and for every person in America. Mr. Speaker, America is ready for a win. In June 2017, the House unanimously passed this bill to strengthen career and technical education. On Monday, the Senate also approved it unanimously, and we are now just steps away from getting this critical legislation to the President’s desk to be signed into law. This bill has been supported by House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairwoman VIRGINIA FOXXand Ranking Member BOBBY SCOTT. I thank them both. I want to thank the Democratic lead, Representative RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI , and my CTE Caucus cochairman, Representative JIMLANGEVIN . House and Senate leaders have brought this legislation to their respective floors because they know it is an important bill. Mr. Speaker, this legislation aims to restore rungs on the ladder of opportunity, because all Americans deserve a goodpaying, familysustaining job. Too often, we see students pushed down the collegeforall pathway that just doesn’t work for some people. But CTE has established itself as a path that many highachieving students choose in pursuit of industry certifications and handson skills that they can use right out of high school in a skillsbased education program or in college. By modernizing the Federal investment in CTE programs, we will be able to connect more educators with industry stakeholders and close the skills gap in this country. Mr. Speaker, 6.7 million jobs, good jobs, are currently available because people need to be qualified to get them. In fact, today, right here in Washington, CTE will be highlighted. The House Education and the Workforce Committee has invited 24 innovators from across the country for the bipartisan Innovation Forum and Showcase. Dedicated professionals will share with Congress and the public how they are addressing the Nation’s education and workforce development changes. I am proud to count among these professionals Mr. Joe Luther from my district. Mr. Luther is the horticulture and landscaping instructor at the Central Pennsylvania Institute of Science and Technology, located in Pleasant Gap, Centre County, Pennsylvania. Mr. Luther uses handson instruction to inspire students to reach great heights and achieve success in life. He brings reallife scenarios into his classroom at every opportunity to show students what their future can be like in the workforce. I know every Member of this House wants to give every American, regardless of where they come from, the best opportunity to succeed. That is why I urge my colleagues to support the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act when it comes back to the floor today with the Senate amendment. This bill and the amendment will modernize the Federal role in our Nation’s CTE program, which is long overdue; but, most importantly, it will restore rungs on the ladder of opportunity. It will inspire a new generation of builders and thinkers and makers and creators, and it will give every American a shot at the American Dream, which is opportunity and success in life. f 
RECOGNIZING UPCOMING CENTENARIANS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to recognize three of my constituents who are all celebrating birthday 100 very, very soon. Mrs. Cora Jones ‘‘Boot’’ McLeod, Mrs. Christine Johnson Umstead, and Mrs. Annie Belle Gilmore Rogers are all members of historic Mount Vernon Baptist Church located in Durham, North Carolina, pastored by my friend Dr. Jerome J. Washington. These centenarians, Mr. Speaker, will soon celebrate their birthdays, surrounded by family and friends. These women have committed much of their lives to the development of their family and community. They are devout Christians of the missionary baptist faith who love their church. Mrs. Cora Jones Boot McLeod was born on August 8, 1918, in Raleigh, North Carolina, and attended Rosenwald Schools. She started her own business in Durham as a professional beautician. Mrs. McLeod has spent all of her life encouraging her family and community to be independent and faithful in their pursuits. Her leadership is reflected in the business community and at her beloved Mount Vernon Baptist Church, where she served as church usher. Mrs. Christine Johnson Umstead was born on August 16, 1918, in Roxboro, North Carolina, located in Person County, just north of Durham. She came to Durham as a food service professional. In retirement, she has encouraged others to become active senior citizens by setting an example and providing motivation to all. Mrs. Umstead joined Mount Vernon in 1948 and has remained an active church member. Over the years, she has provided faithful leadership and fellowship as a Christian missionary, a member of the senior citizens organization, and the J.E. Best Bible Class. Finally, yet importantly, is Mrs. Annie Belle Gilmore Rogers. Mrs. Rogers was born on October 20, 1918, in Durham, and her ancestors were founding members of Mount Vernon Baptist Church. Over the past 100 years, she has exemplified the value of faith, education, and resourcefulness. She attended what was then Hillside Park School, which we now know as Hillside High School, in Durham. She went on to become a teacher’s assistant at C.C. Spaulding Elementary School, where she helped educate young minds who would go on to become future leaders. Mrs. Rogers recognized the value of managing her resources and teaching her family to do the same. She was among the first members and leaders of the Mount Vernon Baptist Church Credit Union, at a time when African Americans had few opportunities for investing their limited resources or borrowing money to develop individual wealth. The credit union stands today as the last functioning church credit union in the State, with members of Mrs. Rogers’ family serving on its board. b1015 Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride this morning that I speak these words today from the floor of the House of Representatives. These three strong and powerful African American women 
have worked and labored to empower their families and Mount Vernon Baptist Church into a spiritual force serving the Durham community. I am grateful to these remarkable women for their love of humanity and contributions to their community. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing these three great Americans our very best wishes as they each celebrate 100 years of life. 
SUSTAINABLE CONTROL OF THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to one very remarkable young woman. Earlier this year, I had the honor of meeting Masedi while visiting Botswana as part of a delegation trip. Sadly, Botswana is still struggling with HIV/AIDS. Every year, there are 14,000 new infections, and 1 in 5 adults in the country has HIV/AIDS. Masedi is one of these adults. Born with HIV/AIDS 23 years ago, she lost both of her parents and many other family members to this disease. But when my husband, Dexter, and I visited with her in Botswana, she was full of optimism and determination. Masedi’s story is remarkable, and what she has had to overcome is truly inspiring. She has made it her mission to educate the people of Botswana on HIV/AIDS to dispel any rumors or stigmas related to this disease and to one day see a Botswana free of this terrible ordeal. We were so inspired with this visit, and she is truly a shining role model for the entire country. That is why our PEPFAR program is so vitally important, Mr. Speaker. In just over 15 years, PEPFAR has saved and improved millions of lives while preventing millions more in HIV infections. Thanks to American leadership, PEPFAR, and remarkable individuals like Masedi, we can achieve the goal of sustainable control and eradication of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and thank my dear friend Bob Rosasco for his efforts with MINTS International Seminary and its seminaryinprison degree program. Since 2010, this organization has been teaching theology in Florida’s prisons in order to educate, to train, and to equip members of the prison population, so they can teach others about religion and the word of God. This program provides inmates with the necessary tools and training that prepare them to reenter society and become productive members of the community after their release. Studies have shown that those who participate in education programs, including religious programs, while incarcerated are much less likely to reoffend. Because of Bob Rosasco and the efforts of so many like him, this program now has more than 200 students participating, with plans to keep expanding beyond Florida and across the United States. We are blessed to have Bob Rosasco as a member of our south Florida community, and I commend him for continuously giving back to others by sharing his time, his knowledge, and his passion. RECOGNIZING RYAN DOOLEY  
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ryan Dooley, a dedicated Federal employee, a public servant, and my friend who lives in my congressional district in beautiful south Florida. I first met Ryan 14 years ago, shortly after he arrived in Miami as Assistant Director of the State Department’s Miami Passport Agency. Ryan’s commitment to service is unparalleled, and because of his efforts, he was soon promoted to Director of the Miami Passport Agency. When the San Juan Passport Agency opened its doors to the public in 2014, Ryan was chosen to lead that office as well. For the first time, our fellow Americans living in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands gained direct access to much neededpassport services, and that was truly a historic milestone. Today, Ryan is responsible for helping countless citizens across a huge geographic area. Ryan and his staff are consummate professionals dedicated to serving their communities efficiently and accurately. Under Ryan’s leadership, they have met and overcome numerous passport workload challenges. I have had the opportunity to work with Ryan on multiple occasions, both in Miami and here in D.C., and I can say that he is respected and admired by his colleagues at local, State, and Federal levels. I also know numerous State Department employees who got their start in Miami and were mentored by Ryan and encouraged to excel in their public service paths. In his career that has taken him around the world, Ryan has always promoted the ideals of freedom, of democracy, and of being responsible to the citizens of our great Nation. I would like to say, on behalf of my constituents: Ryan Dooley, thank you so much for all of your tireless work. I commend you for a job well done. I hope that you continue to serve the people of south Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands faithfully. I wish you and your partner, Gerald Darby, the best in the years to come. Gracias, amigo. 
MINORITY MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark Minority Mental Health Awareness Month. Mental health challenges do not discriminate. They affect Americans of all ages, races, backgrounds, and genders. It doesn’t matter if you are from a blue State, a red State, or a swing State. Mental illness is in your community. It affects your family and exists in your friend group and with your coworkers. Tragically, while mental health challenges impact so many people across the board, too many never see or get treatment because of the stigma associated with mental healthcare. It shames them into silence. So it is fitting that this year’s theme is ‘‘CureStigma.’’ While stigma keeps far too many from seeking and receiving the care that they need, the silence of stigma plagues African American populations and other ethnic groups. It is a sad and staggering statistic that African Americans are 20 percent more likely to report serious psychological distress than their White counterparts but just 25 percent will seek care. There is a tragic inequity in that figure, given that 40 percent of their White counterparts will seek care. Is this a matter of stigma? Of access to care, culturally competent care, and associated resources? Or perhaps a combination of them all. Mr. Speaker, it is past time that we tackle the stigma associated with mental health that keeps too many trapped without hope, recourse, or recovery. As for access to care, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, all health insurance plans are required to cover mental health services, just as they would cover cancer screenings and tetanus shots. Still, this administration, either through cruelty or willful ignorance, has actively attacked the mental health requirement and sought to push bad or, as I call them, junk insurance plans that neglect mental health services. We must do better. Congress must be better. Too many, especially in vulnerable populations, are still in desperate need of this care. That is why I am proud to be cosponsoring the Mental Health in Schools Act offered by my good friend, Congresswoman GRACE NAPOLITANO . This bill will provide comprehensive mental health programs to students in schools, with a special focus on dealing with trauma and violence. Congress can make a world of difference today, if we pass this bill. I am also proud to be cosponsoring the Veterans Mental Health Accessibility Act introduced by my colleague from Pennsylvania, Congressman MATT CARTWRIGHT . His bill would make veterans who serve in combat zones eligible for more mental health services through the VA. This is really commonsense legislation. With more than 20 of our brave veterans committing suicide daily, it is of critical importance that we pass this bill. 
In closing, I want to remind everyone, my colleagues, and those watching at home on C–SPAN that mental health is something that we can all work on. Simple, small, everyday things can make a huge difference. Here is my personal top five. First, take care of your body. It is all connected. Even a little bit of exercise or even a little more sleep can improve mood, reduce stress, and improve your health all around. Second, find a stress management strategy that works for you. For some, it is reading or running, while for others, it is coffee with friends or takeout and a movie. Do whatever works for you. Third, surround yourself with good people, be it family, friends, or someone you can trust in your community. Fourth, volunteerism is a great way to get out of your own head and give back to your community. It is good for you and great for your community. Finally, if you or someone you love needs help, please get it. Don’t let stigma hold you back. Mr. Speaker, as Minority Mental Health Awareness Month comes to a close, let’s cure stigma. 
HONORING THE BURLE FAMILY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ryan and Abby Burle of Gainesville for creating a book drive for families with newborns who are receiving lifesaving medical treatment. The couple was inspired to establish the Mighty Three neonatal intensive care unit book drive after their triplets, Maggie, Max, and Miller, underwent medical treatment in Northeast Georgia Medical Center following their births. For months, Ryan and Abby could not hold their babies while they received crucial medical attention. As teachers, the young couple decided that they could leverage reading to communicate with the triplets using the sound of their voice to develop a bond with the three tiny patients. The Burles designed the Mighty Three NICU book drive to give families two books for each baby receiving treatment at Northeast Georgia Medical Center’s Gainesville hospital. Initially, the couple set out to collect 850 books but quickly surpassed that goal. Through their tireless work, the Mighty Three NICU book drive has provided more than 2,000 books to the hospital on Spring Street. Mr. Speaker, I commend Ryan and Abby for their dedication to encouraging families during times of need, and I wish the two of them much joy as they raise their three healthy children. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join northeast Georgia in celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Ty Cobb Museum. The museum opened its doors on July 17, 1998, to highlight the legacy of Ty Cobb, a Banks County native and Baseball Hall of Fame member. Cobb was a Major League Baseball outfielder who set 90 MLB records during his career, some of which stand today. He played for the Detroit Tigers for 22 years, and, later, for the Philadelphia Athletics for two seasons. Cobb’s remarkable achievements include 4,065 runs scored and batted in, 897 total stolen bases, and a batting average of 366 at the close of his career. Additionally, Cobb was the first player ever inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. In the community of Royston, The Georgia Peach is remembered for his philanthropic kindness. He was responsible for the Cobb Memorial Hospital and the Cobb Educational Fund, which have left a lasting legacy of love for his hometown. Mr. Speaker, the Ty Cobb Museum captures significant moments throughout Cobb’s life, from his roots in Royston to this success as part of American’s pastime. I congratulate the staff of the museum for two decades of service to their Georgia community and wish them well in their endeavors. CONGRATULATING CAROLINE LEWALLEN  
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Caroline Lewallen of Jaemor Farms in Alto. As a member of the Hall County Farm Bureau and Georgia Farm Bureau’s Young Farmers and Ranchers program, Caroline’s commitment to our State’s agricultural industry earned her the program’s Excellence in Agriculture award. Caroline holds degrees in agricultural education and leadership from the University of Georgia and Texas A&M University, respectively. She began her career as a student teacher and later became an agricultural fellow in the office of one of my former colleagues, Congressman Jack Kingston. Today, Caroline serves as the agritourism and marketing coordinator for Jaemor Farms. At Jaemor Farms, Caroline manages all events, like the festival honoring my favorite peach, the annual Georgia Belle Peach Festival. She also runs Jaemor Farms’ marketing and social media presence, regularly attracting attention from across the State and the country. Mr. Speaker, Caroline has played an important role in promoting the work of the northeast Georgia farmers by communicating the importance of locally grown produce for communities, and I want to congratulate her on this award and wish her well throughout her career. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Kit Dunlap, president and CEO of the Greater Hall Chamber of Commerce, who recently received the Georgia Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives’ Legacy Award. The Georgia Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives’ Legacy Award is the association’s highest honor, recognizing executives who have dedicated many years to successfully improving their local chambers of commerce. Kit has served as the Greater Hall Chamber’s top official for more than 20 years. Her ambition and compassion for others has allowed her to excel as a leader. Throughout her involvement in the local chamber of commerce, she has transformed the Greater Hall Chamber by bringing together a well connected economic development team. This team has helped increase capital investment, job availability, and job retention in the Hall County area. Additionally, Kit has managed multimillion dollar initiatives, including the HALLmark campaign and Vision 2030, which helped fund communitybased education and economic development programs. I congratulate my friend Kit Dunlap on this award and thank her for her service to the Hall County business community. Mr. Speaker, as Kit’s representative, I must end this speech by answering the question she asks at the end of each chamber meeting: What is the water level of Lake Lanier? Well, today, it is 1,071.89. f 
TRIBUTE TO A LOCAL HERO, ROBERT VON DRASEK The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. D AVIS) for 5 minutes. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Von Drasek, as he is better known. Bob was the most dedicated, committed, and loyal Saul Alinskytrained organizer who I have ever known. Bob came to the south Austin community during a time of great turbulence. b1030 The community was in the throes of a great transition from being 80 percent White to becoming 80 percent Black within a 10year period of time. Blockbusting, panic peddling, redlining, disinvestment, and all manner of malfeasance were taking place. Police brutality and other forms of law enforcement misconduct were rampant. I met Bob during this period. It was also during this time that the Organization for a Better Austin, under the leadership of Gail Cincotta, was organized; the South Austin Coalition Community Council, SACCC, was formed with Bob as a lead organizer; and I decided to run for the city council. Over the years, I have followed Bob’s work without exception. South Austin is practically an all African American community, except for a few merchants who never left the area, a few White citizens, school teachers, and policemen. Of course, Bob is White or Caucasian, and yet he won the hearts of the 
community and the trust of the people. He has developed intimate relationships with many of the residents and, to many, he is like a member of their family. Through Bob’s leadership, SACCC became known as the top grassroots community organization in the Chicagoland area. Bob was always a great strategist, but the members, like Mr. Ed Bailey, Mrs. Irene Norwood, Mrs. Lillian Drummond, and Mr. George Lawson, were the voices. Many people don’t know it, but it was SACCC who led community reinvestment. It was SACCC who organized senior citizens. It was SACCC who led the fight for LIHEAP. It was SACCC who kept the Austin Bank on its toes. It was SACCC who united block clubs. It was SACCC who got people to join local school councils. And it was SACCC who got churches to open their doors for community meetings. I have been in buildings with Bob where there was no heat. I have been in homes where there was no food. I have been on streets where there were no lights. I have been with Bob in allies where there was no hope. I have been with Bob and families after their relatives were shot. Bob has worked to bring help to the helpless and hope to the hopeless. Bob VonDrasek, you are a good man, and I thank you and your family, your wife and children, for what you have meant to our community and to our world. True soldiers are always reluctant to come off the battlefield, but there comes a time when we must put away our swords and shields to practice war no more. When that time comes, Bob, just know that you have made a difference. When you came to south Austin, newspapers were writing that it would be the next big slum. They did not know you and they did not know the people of south Austin. South Austin is not a slum. It is a vibrant, forwardthinking, and forwardmoving community. Bob, you have done the Master’s work. You have fed the hungry, clothed the naked, brought hope to the hopeless, and help to the helpless. You have lifted spirits and you have taught people how to love, how to live, and how to work together. I close, Bob, by leaving these words with, and for, you. 
If when you give the best of your service, telling the world that the Savior is come, be not dismayed when men don’t believe you, He understands, and will say, ‘‘Well done.’’ Oh, when I come to the end of my journey, weary of life and the battle is won, carrying the staff and the cross of redemption, He’ll understand, and say, ‘‘Well done.’’ If when this life of labor is ended, and the reward of the race you have run, oh, the sweet rest prepared for faithful, will be His blest and final, ‘‘Well done.’’ But if you try and fail in your trying, hands sore and scarred from the work you’ve begun, take up your cross, run quickly to meet Him, He’ll understand, He’ll say, ‘‘Well done.’’ SERBIA AND AMERICA—100 YEARS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 100 years ago, in 1918, President Woodrow Wilson declared July 28 as a National Day of Prayer for the Serbian people. This was during World War I, the war to end all wars. American doughboys and leathernecks had arrived on the western front, holding the line against Germany’s last offensive before it collapsed. Meanwhile, the Serbian people were suffering under occupation by the central powers, who had launched a brutal invasion of Serbia. Mr. Speaker, during World War I, one in four Serbian people were killed during that war. But the Serbian army had survived the invasion and was fighting alongside our allies to liberate their home. They were reinforced by many SerbianAmericans, who had returned to Europe to help their brothers. President Wilson wanted America to honor the sacrifices of the Serbian people. In a speech marking the invasion of Serbia by the central powers, he said of the Serbians: 
Nobly did they respond. So valiantly and courageous did they oppose the forces of a country ten times greater in population and resources. . . . While their territory has been devastated and their homes despoiled, the spirit of the Serbian people has not been broken. 
As a Texan, I admire such defiance against overwhelming odds. On that special day, President Wilson ordered a rare recognition to a foreign ally, by having the Serbian flag raised over the White House. That recognition had only occurred one other time in American history. The spirit of brotherhood between the Americans and the Serbians, fighting shoulder to shoulder against tyranny, did not end there. One of the most meaningful stories for Americans is the Halyard Mission during the dark days of the Second World War. Despite being under Nazi occupation, the Serbian people demonstrated their remarkable bravery once again, saving the lives of hundreds of Americans in the largest rescue operation of American airmen in history. In 1944, American bombers were flying frequent missions to strike Germany’s vital oil supplies in Romania as a part of the allied advance into Europe. The 15th Air Force led this effort by launching 20,000 sorties into Eastern Europe, with many of the missions flying over Nazioccupied Yugoslavia. As many as 1,500 pilots and airmen were shot down during these air raids. Serbians, who had been resisting Nazi forces since 1941, risked their own lives to rescue American aircrews in Yugoslavia and hide them from patrolling Nazis. These brave and noble Serbians cared for and protected Americans and allied pilots. In August of 1944, the allied forces, including the 15th Air Force and the Office of Strategic Services, devised a daring operation to evacuate hundreds of allied pilots being sheltered by the Serbian resistance in Nazioccupied Yugoslavia. American aircraft flew into enemy territory and evacuated 500 airmen from the airfield built and protected by local Serbians near the village of Pranjani. For over 60 years, this operation was kept secret from the American people. But now we can remember the courage of our Serbian friends and their stand against the Nazis. Here, Mr. Speaker, is a photograph taken by the Serbian resistance, taking Americans who had been shot down in Serbia and taking them to the airfield, where they would be returned back to the American lines. George Dudich, the father of my chief of staff, Elaine Dudich Stolze, when I was a judge in Texas, rescued many Americans who had been shot down in occupied Yugoslavia. All these years later, we remain committed to the cause of freedom for both nations. We should work together to preserve each other’s security. The United States is now working with Serbia to improve its democracy, an independent judiciary, and fight corruption. A democratic Serbia with a strong rule of law is in America’s interests and Serbia’s. We are united in keeping the hungry Russian bear from interfering in domestic affairs in Serbia. Russian disinformation efforts are designed to keep Serbia in its sphere of influence and poison our relationship. Nevertheless, Serbia’s integration to the west has continued to move forward. In 2006, Serbia joined NATO’s Partnership for Peace program and, in 2015, signed an Individual Partnership Action Plan with the alliance to strengthen cooperation. And recently, the European Union has announced that Serbia would join the EU as early as 2025. The prime minister and foreign minister of Serbia and numerous Serbs are in the Capitol today to promote U.S. Serbian relations. So on this 100th anniversary of President Wilson’s speech about the courageous Serbs of World War I, we reaffirm our joint partnership and friendship and a quest for liberty. And that is just the way it is. 
HONORING THE VICTIMS OF THE OCTOBER 1 SHOOTING IN LAS VEGAS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, it has been 297 days since the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. On October 1, 2017, 58 people were senselessly murdered at the Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas, in my hometown, and more than 500 people were injured. I still remember that day like it was yesterday. I remember going to Sunrise 
Hospital and seeing 194 victims who had been shot or injured. Since October 1, I have come to the House floor 58 times to honor each of the victims and to share their stories. For the last 9 months, my colleagues have listened to 58 separate speeches, and have looked at the pictures of the 58 victims. These stories have been met with silence by the majority. Since October 1, members of the Nevada delegation have asked to, at least, hold a hearing on bump stocks, the device that contributed to the massive carnage in Las Vegas. Our letters have been met with silence by the majority. Since October 1, Democrats, and a few Republicans, have introduced no less than 30 bills to combat gun violence in our country, yet these bills have been met with silence by the majority. Since October 1, there have been more mass shootings in the U.S., including at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas; at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida; and at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. These mass shootings have been met with silence by the majority. At what point are my colleagues in Congress going to stop being silent? At what point are they going to say: We have to do something; we have to take action? The United States is in the middle of a gun epidemic. Every day, 96 Americans, Mr. Speaker, are killed by gun violence. Americans are 25 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than people in other developed countries. Americans can no longer feel safe at churches, concerts, movie theaters, work, military bases, nightclubs, restaurants, shopping malls, grocery stores, baseball fields, congressional baseball fields, and, even worse, our children are no longer safe at school. Since 2009, there have been 288 school shootings in the U.S. Today, little kids are afraid to wear lightup shoes to school because a gunman could see them when they have to hide for their life. From the time of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook to the mass shooting at Parkland, the House of Representatives has held more than 40 moments of silence related to gun violence. However, in that same time, the majority refuses to consider any real piece of legislation, hold any hearings, or take any action that could reduce this gun violence epidemic. b1045 And despite bipartisan support in this body to ban bump stocks, implement universal background checks, limit highcapacity magazines, or ban assault weapons, my colleagues say that nothing can be done to prevent gun violence in America. If that is true, why is the United States the only developed country that has this problem? The truth is we can do something. We can take action. My Republican colleagues can put the American gun lobby first and the NRA and gun manufacturers, but the American people come first. We have to listen to the American people. We can pass bipartisan and commonsense solutions to prevent more shootings and to save more lives. To my fellow Nevadans and Americans, I want you to know that, despite these roadblocks, we will keep fighting. Every day there are people here in Congress working tirelessly to make our country safer. Every day we are moved by your rallying cries and your stories; and every day, we will fight to end the gun violence epidemic in the United States. 
MEMORIALIZING THE HISTORY OF THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH, BLACKSBURG, SOUTH CAROLINA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, July 25, 2018, in our Nation’s Capitol to formally memorialize the history of the First Baptist Church located in Blacksburg, South Carolina. First Baptist Church of Blacksburg was originally called the Berea Baptist Church, organized over 146 years ago, on December 4, 1876. The original structure was located near the corner of Highway 29 and Mountain Street, near the old Berea cemetery. This building was used as a church, schoolhouse, and community meeting hall. The first people to be baptized in the original building were Mrs. Sally Little and Mattie Bridges. The first mention of building a new church facility was the years 1906 through 1909, under the pastorate of the Reverend B.L. Hoke. A committee was formed to search for land to build the new church. During the pastorate of Reverend C.W. Payseur, property located on the corner of Cherokee and Rutherford Streets was purchased from Mr. D.D. Gaston for $500; and in the spring of 1912, construction began on the new building. The records indicate that W.A. Blalock and A.M. Bridges broke the first dirt, and D.A. Gold placed the first brick, with Miss Emma Cornwell placing the first mortar for the bricks. The first service in the new church facility was held over 105 years ago in June 1913, and the name of the church was officially changed from the Berea Baptist Church to the First Baptist Church of Blacksburg. The first person to be baptized in the new building was Mr. Ben Ramseur. In 1922, over 96 years ago, a house and 6 acres of land owned by Mr. Tracy Hardin was donated for the purposes of building a church parsonage, and in June of 1929, the church began construction on the first Sunday school rooms at a cost of $2,300. The property behind the existing educational building as it sits today was purchased during the years between 1941 and 1950, and a new building fund was started. The church broke ground on the new building at a cost of $87,500; and on Sunday, June 24, 1956, which was over 62 years ago, the church celebrated homecoming, with ‘‘Dinner on the Grounds’’ in the new social hall downstairs. On June 11, 1961, all debt was paid off and a note burning service was held to celebrate this accomplishment. On July 5, 1962, the church voted to begin construction on the present sanctuary to replace the old one which, at the time, had been destroyed. The committee overseeing the construction was comprised of 10 members representing each of the resident families. The new sanctuary was completed in 1963 at a total cost of $74,735, and the debt was paid off on May 2, 1979. The building of the new parsonage located at 108 Lenzer Circle began in the 1970s and was completed in February of 1972. The debt was paid off, and the official burning service was held on February 23, 1975, to celebrate this accomplishment of paying off the debt. In October of 1976, the church voted to sell the old parsonage and purchase the entire land located inside Lenzer Circle for a future recreational facility. On December 1, 1993, the church purchased the property and buildings immediately next to the existing church sanctuary at a cost of $35,000, with the debt paid in full on January 16, 1998. The next major renovation and building came in 1995, where the church reaffirmed the idea of seeking to build a recreational facility beside the existing church sanctuary; and in June of 1996, the old grocery store known as the Sara Wilkins property was demolished to make way for the new construction. In 1997, renovations and repairs were made to the existing educational building and exterior of the sanctuary, along with a new Allen organ for the sanctuary. The construction of the new Family Life Center began in August of 1999, for a total cost of $520,000, with the church only borrowing $60,000. The building was completed and the dedication held in May of 2000, and the remaining debt was paid off in 2001. In July of 2001, the church purchased the old library building located behind the existing sanctuary and education building where the church offices exist today. The last renovations to the present sanctuary were renovated in 2014. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to memorialize the 142year history of the First Baptist Church of Blacksburg, which was organized on December 4, 1876, as we worship today in 2018, with the core mission being, then and now, service to Jesus Christ and the faithful teachings of the Christian Gospel. 
WITHOUT THE RUSSIANS, TRUMP WOULDN’T HAVE WON The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New Hampshire (Ms. S HEAPORTER ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SHEAPORTER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to read a column by Max Boot, conservative, and very well known. I am quoting completely. ‘‘President Trump is willing, under duress, to briefly and begrudgingly admit that Russian meddling took place in 2016 before reverting to calling it a ‘big hoax.’ But he always maintains that the plot against America had no impact; he describes it as a ‘Democrat excuse for losing the ’16 election.’ Faithfully echoing the President, other Republicans, such as House Speaker PAUL RYAN, say it’s ‘clear’ that Russian interference ‘didn’t have a material effect on our elections.’ White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders even claims that the U.S. intelligence community reached that conclusion. ‘‘Not quite. Here is the intelligence community’s assessment, partially declassified in 2017: ‘We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The U.S. intelligence community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion.’’’ To continue the story that Max wrote: ‘‘When thenCIA Director Mike Pompeo claimed last fall that the ‘intelligence community’s assessment is that the Russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome of the election,’ his own agency rebuked him. ‘‘While the intelligence agencies are silent on the impact of Russia’s attack, outside experts who have examined the Kremlin campaign, which included stealing and sharing Democratic Party emails, spreading propaganda online, and hacking State voter rolls, have concluded that it did affect an extremely close election decided by fewer than 80,000 votes in three States. Clint Watts, a former FBI agent, writes in his recent book ‘Messing with the Enemy,’ that ‘Russia absolutely influenced the U.S. Presidential election,’ especially in Michigan and Wisconsin, where Trump’s winning margin was less than 1 percent in each State. ‘‘We still don’t know the full extent of the Russian interference, but we know its propaganda reached 126 million people via Facebook alone. A BuzzFeed analysis found that fake news stories on Facebook generated more social engagement in the last 3 months of the campaign than did legitimate articles: The ‘20 topperforming false election stories from hoax sites and hyperpartisan blogs generated 8,711,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook.’ Almost all of this ‘fake news’ was either started or spread by Russian bots, including claims that the Pope had endorsed Trump and that Hillary Clinton had sold weapons to the Islamic State. ‘‘Elsewhere on social media, tens of thousands of Russian bots spread pro Trump messages on Twitter, which has already notified 1.4 million users that they interacted with Russian accounts. The Russian disinformation, propagating hashtags such as #Hillary4Prison and #MAGA, reflected what the Trump campaign was saying. The Russian bots even claimed after every Presidential debate that Trump had won; whereas, objective viewers gave each one to Clinton. ‘‘Russia also hacked voting systems in at least 39 States; and while there is no evidence that vote tallies were changed, Russians may have used that stolen data to target their social media or shared the results with the Trump campaign. The Senate Intelligence Committee found that ‘in a small number of States,’ the Russians may have been able to ‘alter or delete voter registration data,’ potentially disenfranchising Clinton voters. ‘‘And then there was the crucial impact of the Russian hacks of Democratic documents disseminated primarily by WikiLeaks. The first tranche of stolen documents, more than 19,000 emails and 8,000 attachments, was strategically released on July 22, 2016, 3 days before the Democratic Convention. The resulting news coverage disrupted the Clinton campaign’s plans by creating the impression that the Democratic National Committee was biased against BERNIE SANDERS and forcing DNC Chairwoman DEBBIE WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ to resign. ‘‘The second tranche of stolen documents was released on October 7, just 29 minutes after The Post reported on the ‘Access Hollywood’ videotape in which Trump is heard boasting about grabbing women by the genitals. These emails, stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, distracted voter attention by revealing the transcripts of lucrative speeches Clinton had given to Goldman Sachs, a populist boogeyman. ‘‘A third release of stolen emails, on October 11, revealed that Democratic operative Donna Brazile, while working at CNN, had provided debate questions to Clinton during the primaries and that senior Democratic operatives, who were themselves Catholics, had exchanged emails disparaging Republicans who cherrypicked their faith for political gain. This fueled Trump’s narrative that the election was ‘rigged’ and that the ‘Clinton team’ was, as he said, ‘viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals.’ The latter charge, unfair as it was, proved especially important in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, swing States with lots of Catholic voters. ‘‘Little wonder that Trump said ‘I love WikiLeaks’ and mentioned its revelations 164 times in the last month of the campaign. ‘This WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable,’ Trump said on October 12. Eight days later, he marveled, ‘Boy, that WikiLeaks has done a job on her, hasn’t it?’ ‘‘Now, by contrast, Trump and his apologists pretend Russian intervention, including WikiLeaks, was no big deal. That beggars belief.’’ The end of this is—and I am sorry I have to skip over some of it—is: ‘‘That is the inconvenient truth that Putin Republicans won’t admit.’’ f 
THE IMPACT OF FOSTA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, in April, my bill, the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, or FOSTA, became law. FOSTA allows Federal, State, and local prosecutors to go after the online businesses that are trafficking our children. Signing FOSTA into law has decimated the online sex trade that fuels human trafficking in America. Scores of major websites that promoted sex trafficking and prostitution have shut down, and countless lives have been saved. Our communities are better off now because of FOSTA: fewer victims are being trafficked; buyers are no longer able to easily purchase women and children; and fewer pimps are getting their payday. The online slave trade has never been more fragile than today. After passage of FOSTA, global ad volume declined 87 percent from the daily average. Websites that dominated the illegal sex trade shut down for fear of being prosecuted. Websites like Massage Tolls, The Erotic Review, and Escorts in College are gone. Household names like Reddit, Google, PayPal, and Microsoft updated their terms of service to ensure that platforms aren’t being abused by traffickers. Additionally, the Department of Justice shut down backpage.com, and its owners were arrested. Right now, we have this criminal enterprise on its heels. Buyers and pimps don’t know where to turn, and traffickers are getting 90 percent fewer responses than they got on Backpage and the other leading trafficking sites that shut down. The bottom line is websites are doing everything they can to avoid criminal liability, while trying to keep their criminal enterprise alive. But the loopholes that they were utilizing no longer exist. Financial institutions are also cracking down on accounts used by trafficking. CC Bill, the payment processor of these porn and trafficking hubs stopped processing credit cards for websites that facilitate prostitution. b1100 CC Bill was the domestic credit card processor of last resort, and websites are now struggling to find a viable alternative. Together, we are putting the online slave trade out of business. As trafficking becomes less profitable, fewer victims will ever be sold and raped. 
FOSTA is striking fear in the hearts of America’s pimps and online predators. Law enforcement is seeing real results, and that is why FOSTA is being called the most significant antitrafficking law in nearly 20 years. Experts have repeatedly said that sex trafficking will flourish until market force of risk is increased and we create a real criminal deterrent. FOSTA establishes that deterrent, and as a result, fewer businesses will ever, ever enter the sex trade. Sex advertising is at a new low for this decade. And this Congress has demonstrated that we can and will hold accountable the businesses that profit from the sale of our most vulnerable. It is because of the massive bipartisan majorities of both the House and the Senate that FOSTA is law today. The results we are seeing in our communities are proof that Congress can, and does, work together to achieve real results for the American people. Lives have been saved, fewer children and women are being sold into slavery, and trafficking and prostitution websites are being shut down. We are delivering real results for real people and our country is better off now because of it. 
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO’S SENATE TESTIMONY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, a few hundred feet north of here in the Senate, Secretary of State Pompeo will soon testify about President Trump’s disastrous performance at the recent NATO summit and, worse, at his meeting in Helsinki with Russia’s dictator, Vladimir Putin. Now, if you are a Member of this body and you are interested in what Mr. Pompeo has to say on these topics, you had better turn on your television, because he isn’t coming over here. Secretary Pompeo is ignoring the House, despite our request that he come testify or brief our Members. He is blowing off half of the legislative branch. This is outrageous, and I bet if Secretary Pompeo were still a Member of this House, he would think so too. We have too many unanswered questions, Mr. Speaker. What happened in President Trump’s secret meeting with Putin? They sat together for 2 hours with no one else aside from interpreters. What deals were made? What agreements were reached? The Russians are claiming that a great deal was discussed, but so far, we have heard nothing from this administration. President Trump’s actions in Helsinki were a betrayal of his duties. He had already insulted our closest friends and allies, and with the world watching, he sided with Putin over our own intelligence and law enforcement communities about Russia’s attack on our democracy. So we need to see Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Mattis and Director Coats. I recently joined with my fellow ranking members, Mr. SMITH on the Armed Services Committee and Mr. SCHIFF on the Intelligence Committee, demanding that these senior officials come to the Hill and shed light on what took place. We don’t know, and the Secretary of State is not coming to the House to tell us. We have gotten no response to our requests. With Secretary Pompeo set to appear in the Senate, that is really a slap in the face to this body. Every Member of this body should object to the fact that this administration won’t give us the time of day. I object, and I will keep pushing until we get the answers we need. 
MUELLER RESOLUTION The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. REED). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. ROKITA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today ultimately seeking justice for the American people and to end what our President has rightfully described as a witch hunt. For too long, our resources have been wasted on Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian collusion in our 2016 elections. Not only has this probe dragged on for over a year, but it has undermined our entire system of justice at this point while giving Washington elites and their biased counsel a pass to work above the law, exempt from any boundaries. Through my Mueller Resolution, I am calling for us to call for the termination of the probe if no evidence of Russian collusion can be provided. And, again, after over a year, no evidence has been provided. It is time for the restoration of the rule of law back into our Justice Department, and that is why I am imploring my colleagues to fight alongside me by signing on to this resolution. Let’s work together to end the clear manipulation of power against our President. The President has the American people’s prosperity and security at the top of his priorities. Let’s look at the results so far. Let’s look at his track record. The economy is booming, regulations have been cut, and we are leading the world again. This witch hunt against our President is unprecedented and it is uncalled for. The Democrats have become the party of obstruct and resist, obstruct and resist, obstruct and resist. The Dems call Trump’s tax cuts crumbs, even though it benefits millions of Americans. Those $1,000 bonuses that are the result of the tax cuts and the economy booming are putting more food on the table, more security in the home, help with childcare, and everything else. They are anything, but crumbs. The Democrats are calling for the abolishment of ICE, even though they protect millions of Americans, even though they protect us. Since when has this body, since when has a party become so resistant, become so obstructionist against law and order, against law enforcement, against our fellow citizens who are protecting us. The Democrats are out of touch with the American people. It is time to throw our full support behind the President. Just look at this week in the Senate. Senator COREY BOOKER said that anyone who supports Judge Cavanaugh, President Trump’s next nominee for the Supreme Court, is ‘‘complicit in evil.’’ Mr. Speaker, how far have we gone? How out of touch is one political party in this Nation? Let’s support the President when he wants to put America First, and all that means. We saw that with NATO, he is calling on the other nations to finally pay their fair share, to do what is right, to do what they agreed to. If we have to be the world’s police force, at least we should have some help paying for it. And the same with what is going on at the U.N. We pay, we pay, we pay, the taxpayers pay and pay and pay, yet we don’t get the services we deserve or the leadership that we also deserve. It is time to put America First. Other countries have to help support. Let’s support the President in leading again. Let’s support the President in making America First again. 
IMPEACHMENT IS NOT DEAD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. I am proud, once again, Mr. Speaker, to stand in the well of the House. I am proud to do so today, Mr. Speaker, in defense of liberty and justice for all. Mr. Speaker, if we know the truth, it can set us free. A truth: A Quinnipiac Poll, Mr. Speaker, as of July 3, this month, this year, a poll indicates that 49 percent of Americans believe that the President of the United States is a racist, 49 percent, nearly 50 percent of the country. Wonder why? Could it be because of Charlottesville? Could it be because of a Muslim ban? Could it be because of the way this President has instituted policies, such as the one that has impacted Latinos at the border, taking babies from their mothers, segregating them such that babies don’t have contact with their parents? Fortynine percent of the people believe that the President is a racist. Mr. Speaker, in the same poll, 55 percent believe that he has emboldened people who hold racist beliefs to express those beliefs publicly. The President of the United States is having an adverse impact on society. He is causing people to do ugly things. Mr. Speaker, the polls also show, this is a Harris Poll, that 42 percent believe 
that the President of the United States of America should be impeached. That number would be higher, by the way, if, not but for, the effort to suppress impeachment. And I must compliment the people who are engaged in that effort. They have done exceedingly well. Some people dare not say the word ‘‘impeachment.’’ I am so glad, however, so thankful, so grateful that Dr. King was not guided by polls, because there are some polls that would cause persons to do what they should not. If you are waiting on the polls to tell you that the President ought to be impeached, you may be waiting a long time. If you are waiting on the polls to get to 60, 70, 80 percent, you may be waiting a long time. I am so glad that Dr. King did not wait for the polls to tell him to protest segregation and discrimination. The bus boycott probably wouldn’t have taken place in Montgomery if there had been a wait for the polls. They probably wouldn’t have crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge if there had been a wait for the polls. I am so glad that people of goodwill will stand up to bigotry, will take a stand. They don’t let political expediency trump the moral imperative to speak out and speak up. I am so glad that there are people who put the moral imperative above political expediency. And finally, this: For those of you who worship at the altar of polls, when President Clinton was impeached, 29 percent of the people thought that he should be impeached, 29 percent. There are some people who are not guided by polls. I am one of them. Bigotry emanating from the Presidency is impeachable because of the harm that it is doing to society. Impeachment is not dead. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, obviously we live in alternative universes. Mr. Speaker, America is winning again, and before we embark on the August recess, let’s take into account what just 18 months of unified Republican government has meant for the American people. According to the IMD World Competitive Center’s 2018 rankings, the United States of America has overtaken Hong Kong as the world’s number one most competitive economy thanks to faster economic growth and a supportive atmosphere for scientific and technological innovation. Our entire stock market is hovering around alltime highs. Our national unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in 18 years. Female unemployment has reached its lowest levels since 1953. That is over 65 years ago. Black and Hispanic unemployment have reached their lowest levels ever. More than 3.7 million new jobs have been created since President Trump took office, including 358,000 new jobs in manufacturing. In contrast, more than 16,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide were lost in 2016, the year before President Trump took office. b1115 In 2017, an average of 16,333 manufacturing jobs were created per month; and last month, 26,000 new manufacturing jobs were created, bringing it to a total of 358,000 new jobs in manufacturing since President Trump’s inauguration in January of 2017. And it continues to grow today. The U.S. currently has 6.6 million job openings. It is at an alltime high. There are now more job openings than there are job seekers in the United States for the third straight month. In May, new hires rose to 5.75 million. That is the highest level in 17 years and the second highest level on record. An alltime high of 155.6 million Americans now have jobs. Now, back home in Pennsylvania’s Third Congressional District, which is soon to be its 16th Congressional District, the unemployment rate has dropped significantly in all seven counties. In Erie County, unemployment is now at an 18year low, and in Crawford County, it is at a 42year low. Wages for workers in Pennsylvania and across America have grown steadily by almost 3 percent over the past year and are continuing to climb. Jobless claims, which are also known as unemployment benefit filings, have reached a 48year low. That is half a century. Customer confidence has reached its highest level since 2001. Job market confidence and small business confidence are at their highest levels ever. Since President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December of last year, businesses have created more than 1.3 million new jobs for American workers. And thanks to the tax cuts, more than 650 companies and counting are reinvesting billions of dollars into their businesses and have given more than 4.5 million American workers and counting major bonuses or pay raises or benefit increases. In my home district, this has included employees for NexTier Bank, Erie Insurance, PNC Bank, Walmart, Starbucks, McDonald’s, Chipotle, Home Depot, the National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation, and many more. Nationally, more than 100 United States utility companies have lowered bills for customers in 48 States. Since February of this year, 90 percent of American wage earners have been opening bigger, less taxed paychecks with more takehome pay. In my home district, the average tax cuts for individuals is $1,230. For families of four, it is $2,427. Those are hardly crumbs. In over 10 years, households will enjoy an average of more than $18,000 in takehome pay, and these are dollars that they have earned and now they get to spend it the way they want to as opposed to sending it to the government for the government to spend it the way the government would like to. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has also established the brandnew opportunity zones, a program to incentivize private investors to make longterm investments in communities that have faced economic hardships, which means even more jobs are on the way. The New York Times has called this provision the first substantial Federal attempt to aid those communities in more than a decade. Mr. Speaker, in every measurable way, all Americans are better off now than we were just 2 short years ago. In every measurable way, America is winning again. f 
SCHOOL SAFETY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP ) for 5 minutes. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about school safety. I present as a doctor, a healthcare professional, as a father, and as a Representative that is open to new ideas from people who are really attempting to do something to try to make our schools safer and better for our children. As a doctor, I see violence as a public health crisis which is multifaceted, with different contributing factors to consider and with preventive strategies to implement. That is why I want to share with you what a couple of organizations in my district are doing in an attempt to tackle some of the lesser explored potential factors contributing to violence within our schools, among our students, and growing in our society. It begins with an organization called Screen Education. Screen Education is a Cincinnatibased organization that seeks to understand, scientifically, how technology and social media impacts kids. Screen Education and EMI Research Solutions, which is an online market research supplier, also from Cincinnati, partnered with Stark Statistical Consulting of Albuquerque, New Mexico, to conduct a survey of students. While their full analysis contains much insight, I would like to share three statistics that I found particularly shocking: Sixtyeight percent of students said they witnessed someone being bullied online at least several times a year; Thirtyone percent of students said they had seen online bullying result in physical violence; and 
When asked if they felt that using social media will contribute to conditions that can result in school shootings, 73 percent of the students said ‘‘yes.’’ Now, to be clear, I am not saying that social media is the sole cause of shootings or suicides, but these statistics are statistics that should shock everyone. Recent findings say revenge is a strong motivation for school shootings and that among students, homicide perpetrators were more than twice as likely as their victims to have been bullied by peers. These are more than just statistics. They are the reported experiences of our Nation’s children on a daily basis, both in and outside of school. So this is an example of a problem that clearly could and should be addressed and that our society surely has the means to deal with. Some organizations are stepping up to do just that. Bully Bully is a Cincinnatibased firm that was created out of a disconnect that the founder noticed between widespread bullying in our schools and the often reactive, largely ineffective ways of addressing that harassment. Bully Bully is developing an anonymous reporting app that not only allows students to provide information regarding antagonistic situations, but also assists school administrators in analyzing and addressing these incidents and supporting victims of harassment. Bully Bully’s stated goal is to never allow another incident of intimidation or harassment lead to a school fatality or suicide. What they are saying is: Here is a problem. It might be a factor in violence, and I think we have the means to stop it. So here is a solution. Let’s try it. In my experience, Mr. Speaker, there is rarely a simple solution to a public health crisis. You need to try multiple solutions across multiple fronts. Physical or verbal intimidation may be a facet of this public health crisis that we haven’t paid enough attention to but ought to. I am glad we have Americans like those in my Ohio district who are willing to try and solve part of a large problem. Evidence has suggested that students who get harassed by their peers tend to grow up more socially anxious with less selfesteem and require more mental health services. Hundreds of thousands of students skip school each day out of fear and anxiety. It may be a more pervasive problem than we think, actually. Recent research by Screen Education on 12 to 16yearolds at Camp Livingston in Bennington, Indiana, found that students were largely happier by being deprived of their smartphones. They were more engaged and connected to one another as people when removed from the cyber world of drama, gossip, and aggression. Instead of being forced to react to student violence when tragically necessary, perhaps we should focus on equipping the adult who spends all day with these students with the means to support and guide them. Let’s keep looking for ways to make schools safer for our children and maybe, just maybe, we can make the school experience better and safer for our children as a result. 
WORKFORCE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on a topic that should continue to be in the forefront of our agenda here in Congress: workforce training and development. Before coming to Congress, I owned and operated a small construction company in Lancaster County, and when we worked to expand our footprint in central Pennsylvania and sought out new markets to expand the business, we faced a serious problem: Many times, there just simply were not workers available to fill the jobs that we needed to fill in order to expand. Qualified or trained workers were just simply unavailable. Just recently, I met with half a dozen of the Nation’s largest staffing agencies. They told me today that this has reached crisis proportions. They are seeing companies all across the country being faced with the same problem that I was faced with as a business owner, and companies now are making decisions on where to locate new facilities, where to expand based on the available workforce in that area. Sometimes, that is offshore rather than right here in America. I have seen the skills gap firsthand. I have managed through it, understood the impacts of it, and so now, in Congress, I am working to try to fix it. One of the best ways that we can lift people up, improve their standard of living, and create more opportunity is to connect them with a goodpaying, family sustaining job. Let’s be honest: the best antipoverty program is a job. Right now, our economy is booming, consumer optimism is rising, and American manufacturing has risen in each of the last three quarters. We have sustained economic growth, and jobs are being created all across the country. In fact, there are roughly 6 million jobs available right now. Ways and Means Chairman KEVIN BRADY said it best when he said, recently: ‘‘We have gone from a nation that asks, ‘Where are the jobs?’ to one that asks, ‘Where are the workers?’’’ One of my priorities in Congress has been to work to expand opportunities for workbased learning, where individuals get real experience from real professionals as they are learning. I was very happy to see the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act just came back from the Senate. We will be, hopefully, passing that onto the President’s desk this afternoon. There is additional work that we can do; therefore, I have introduced additional legislation that will continue this effort. H.R. 5153, the USA Workforce Tax Credit Act, would address the urgent need to ensure that current and future American workers are prepared for the jobs available in today’s 21st century economy. By establishing a new Federal tax credit, this legislation would encourage donations for communitybased apprenticeship programs, career and technical education, workforce development, and educational preparedness, and it would encourage partnerships with companies looking to sponsor these programs. Encouraging investments in organizations and programs that are preparing our workforce for the jobs of today means that more people will be connected with a job. It means more families will be improving their standard of living. It means that people will thrive off the dignity that jobs provide. But it is really more than just an investment in workforce training programs. It is an investment in the American people. There are so many different paths to obtaining a goodpaying job. I have my own experience of running my construction company during the day while I was taking college courses at night. I never did quite obtain that bachelor’s degree, but I gained the skills necessary for my industry. My experience isn’t that different from so many people in this country. I know firsthand that there is no one sizefitsall solution to finding a good job or helping others get connected with one. We have to ensure that our educational system is preparing workers to succeed in the 21st century. We have to invest in our people. I believe that this legislation makes a down payment and puts us on the right path. It is my hope that Congress advances this legislation to change lives, support families, lift people up, and support our growing economy. f 
ENERGY DIVERSIFICATION FOR EUROPE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 5 minutes. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, America is better off. America is better off because U.S. crude exports have more than doubled since January 2017, and production is up 12 percent so far this year alone. Since Congress lifted the 40year ban on oil exports in 2015, U.S. producers now export between 1.5 and 2 million barrels of crude every day. Lifting the ban has filled pipelines and sparked a surge of investment in new technology and shipping infrastructure around the United States. 
b1130 Today, U.S. crude imports have dropped 7.5 million barrels per day, as we rely on that increased domestic production and our friends in Canada. Lifting the ban has allowed us to be in competition with the two highest producing crude oil countries in the world, Saudi Arabia and Russia. According to the International Energy Agency, this year, the United States is expected to surpass Saudi Arabia and rival Russia as the world’s leading producer of crude oil. This comes as Germany is working with Russia on a pipeline that will deliver more than 50 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia to Germany. During the recent NATO summit in Brussels, President Trump was right to strategically question Germany’s further reliance on Russia’s natural gas. Our liquefied natural gas and oil delivered to the Adriatic, North Sea, and Baltic seaports offer our allies in Europe strategic diversification both from OPEC and from Russian dominance for our friends in Western and Central Europe, their consumers, and their industries. Mr. Speaker, America is better off. I commend President Trump for raising this important issue on his recent trip to Europe, and I am proud of our work in Congress to enhance America’s global energy leadership. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a good friend and a key figure in education and communication sciences in Arkansas, Dr. Dan Tullos. Dr. Tullos recently retired from Harding University, where he served since 1979 as a professor, program director, and chair of the Communication Sciences and Disorders Department. Under his guidance, the communication sciences and disorders program has grown from a major offered under the oversight of the Department of Communication to a separate department with two undergraduate majors and a graduate program. Throughout his career, Dan has been honored by his colleagues, students, and industry leaders with welldeserved recognition and awards. Most notably, he was the 2015 recipient of the Frank R. Kleffner award, which recognizes an individual’s outstanding contributions to communications. For his devotion to youth development, education, scouting, and a better world that has improved the lives of countless individuals across Arkansas and the globe, I congratulate Dr. Tullos on his great career and his retirement. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an outstanding leader who has transformed the realm of nonprofits in Arkansas, Pat Downs of the United Way of White County. Pat retired earlier this year as the executive director of the organization after 29 years of service. Her selflessness, passion, and work ethic inspire all who collaborate with her in White County, around the community, and in the workplace. Helping raise more than $11 million for associated agencies, Pat’s decades of leadership had an indelible impact on central Arkansas. I thank Pat for her outstanding service to the United Way and send best wishes for her future endeavors. f 
SOCIALIST POLICIES SABOTAGE VENEZUELA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS ) for 3 minutes. Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, the United States was founded on the fundamental principles of individual liberty and that all are created equal. As the late President Reagan once said: ‘‘Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.’’ We see this sad truth in nations around the world. So many live under the dark shadow of oppression. They are called captive nations. I was recently introduced to a young man with big dreams named Tito. He is from Venezuela, and he is currently pursuing his master’s at Washington State University. Life is tough in Venezuela, and it became very difficult for him when he was going through a routine checkup and found that his white cell blood count was too high. Unfortunately, he wasn’t properly diagnosed because the healthcare system is woefully inadequate. Even help had been denied. It wasn’t until he was able to fly to Houston to have a bone marrow test and was diagnosed with leukemia that he got the help that he needed. Once, Venezuela was not only the richest country in South America, it was one of the top 20 richest countries in the world. Today, it is one of the most economically oppressed. The IMF is reporting that inflation could top 1 million percent by year’s end. Chavez and Maduro have managed to sabotage this once vibrant and prosperous democracy with socialist policies, corruption, and authoritarian rule. Chavez once said that he was ‘‘convinced that the path to a new, better, and possible world is not capitalism. The path is socialism.’’ Today, in that new world, the government is telling its citizens to eat their own pets, lest they starve to death. What was once a vibrant cultural center and top tourist destination is the crime capital of the world. The average citizen has lost 20 pounds. Instead of a better world, there is a refugee crisis, and millions are fleeing to neighboring countries. The promises never materialized, and the people are suffering, people like Tito. Maduro’s stubborn pursuit of socialism is hurting millions. Of course, Maduro would not be able to cling to power were it not for Cuban support. And then you have other countries like Nicaragua ruled by the tyrant Daniel Ortega, where we have seen the elimination of the freedom of press and suppression of habeas corpus rights. We, as Americans, must stand in solidarity with people who long to be free. We must support legislation like the Venezuelan Humanitarian Assistance and Defense of Democratic Governance Act that passed the House overwhelmingly last year. We must have a strategy to help the people of Venezuela. We must do more to ensure that authoritarian regimes do not have the financial capacity to keep oppressing their people. This story has been repeated throughout history where socialist leaders rise to power, offering promises that are never kept. The people suffer. It is a reminder of why America is so unique. The fruits of our labor belong to us, we the people, not the government. That is why freedom is so important. 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Lasky, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed bills of the following titles in which the concurrence of the House is requested: 
S. 2278. An act to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide grants to improve health care in rural areas. S. 2779. An act to amend the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001. f 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. CURTIS ) at noon. 
PRAYER Right Reverend Bishop Irinej Dobrijevic, Serbian Orthodox Diocese of Eastern America, New Rochelle, New York, offered the following prayer: Lord God Almighty, God of justice, we offer You our sincere thanksgiving and heartfelt prayer for and with those whom You have graciously vested in governance of these United States of America. Enable the Members of the House of Representatives, elected by the people and for the people, to present equitably the diverse interests of our citizens and those from the expanse of the world who reside, labor, and study here. 
Guide those who deliberate and legislate on our collective behalf in the spirit of unity, openness, and understanding. Allow their hearts ever to be open to the resounding cry of those who earnestly pledge indivisible liberty and justice for all. May they be enlightened by Your precepts and motivated in their altruistic service to our Nation and its people. Bless and preserve them and us, Lord. This we pray in Christ Jesus, through the holy spirit. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BISHOP ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING BISHOP IRINEJ DOBRIJEVIC The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to Bishop Irinej of the Serbian Orthodox Church for coming to lead the opening prayer on this special day. Mr. Speaker, 100 years ago, July 28, President Wilson declared a national day of prayer for the Serbian people and their fight during World War I. Bishop Irinej has a long career of service, both to God and the church, as well as the Serbian American community. His work has taken him around the world. Formerly, he was a bishop of Australia and New Zealand, and before that, he spent years serving the church in Serbia. For most of his career, he has been a dedicated educator, teaching at Loyola University in Chicago and as a member of the orthodox church’s theological faculty in Belgrade. Perhaps most notably today is his work to improve the ties between the Serbian diaspora and the Serbian state. Bishop Irinej plays an important role in bringing us all together with God’s love. It was my honor to invite him to share his faith with us today. Thank you, Bishop Irinej, for that prayer, and may God bless Serbia and the United States of America. And that is just the way it is. ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, since 1987, the number of pilots in the United States has decreased by 30 percent. Demand for pilots is up and the supply of trained pilots is down. Throughout the aviation industry, there is a desperate need for trained aviation employees. One way we can help end the shortage is to create paths for minority training. African Americans are significantly underrepresented in the aviation industry. They represent only 9 percent of airline mechanics and service technicians, 2 percent of aircraft pilots and flight engineers, and 12 percent of air traffic controllers. Creating opportunities to diversify the aviation field will help the critical shortage of pilots and aviation employees. Soon, I will be introducing a bill to establish an African American advisory board within the FAA. The advisory board will engage African American students through aviation training, mentorship, education, and outreach programs. I urge my colleagues to join me in my effort to decrease our Nation’s pilot shortage by tapping into an underutilized population and creating a more inclusive aviation industry. f 
HONORING ROSARIA MARTINICO (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable constituent from Rochester Hills, Michigan, Rosaria ‘‘Sara’’ Martinico. She joined so many other brave women to help the war efforts during World War II as one of the original Rosie the Riveters. She served the country by working on B–17 bombers for a good portion of the war. Last Sunday, Mrs. Martinico reached a milestone. Born in 1910, during the William Howard Taft Presidency, she celebrated her 108th birthday in Rochester Hills alongside her 2 daughters, 8 grandkids, 18 greatgrandkids, and 12 greatgreatgrandchildren. That is five generations of family. Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to represent such an outstanding and honorable person, and I would like to wish Mrs. Martinico a very happy 108th birthday and thank her for her outstanding service as the original Rosie the Riveter. 
AFRICAN AMERICAN VETERANS MONUMENT (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of a committee in western New York dedicated to constructing the only monument in the Nation honoring African Americans who served in the United States military during times of war. This longoverdue tribute acknowledges the selfless sacrifice of our veterans, many of whom served our Nation while being denied equal rights at home. The African American Veterans Monument, to be located in the Buffalo and Erie County Military Park, will feature 12 illuminated black pillars, representing U.S. military conflicts, and is designed to give visitors an experience that is reflective, educational, and inspirational. The monument is being designed by a local, young, talented artist, Jonathan Casey. I have asked the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to collaborate with local project leaders on this first intheNation African American Veterans Memorial. Mr. Speaker, I commend the veterans, the artist, and New York State 
Assemblywoman Crystal Peoples Stokes, who have dedicated themselves to making this monument a reality. It is a longoverdue recognition of those who served proudly and courageously. 
AMERICANS ARE BETTER OFF (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, as I travel Michigan’s Seventh District, from neighborhood stores to the factory floor, there is a renewed sense of optimism. Folks I hear from feel safer and more secure about the future. The economy is thriving thanks to progrowth policies like tax cuts and regulatory reform. Businesses are hiring, and there are more job openings than job seekers, and workers and families are seeing bigger paychecks and more takehome pay. It is not just our economy that is getting stronger; our military is as well. We are taking care of our troops, raising their pay, and reforming the VA to help our veterans. We have also taken significant steps to combat the opioid epidemic, crack down on human trafficking, and make our communities safer. Is there more work to do? Absolutely. Our focus will remain on helping to improve people’s lives and making it easier for them to get ahead. The results so far are clear: Americans are better off now. 
HONORING JOHN A. PALUMBO (Mr. BARR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a special man, Mr. John A. Palumbo, from Lexington, Kentucky, who passed away earlier this month at the age of 97. Mr. Palumbo was born in 1921 in Schenectady, New York. As a youth, he was a boxer, winning a Golden Glove, and then moved to Lexington to attend the University of Kentucky. During his time as a student, World War II was raging, and Mr. Palumbo volunteered for the United States Army Infantry 1st Division. Following basic training, he was sent to England to train for the Dday invasion. He landed on Omaha Beach at H hour plus 58 minutes, actually swimming ashore when his landing boat received a direct hit and sank. He fought across Europe and received many citations for his brave service, including the World War II Victory Medal and the Bronze Star. After the war, Mr. Palumbo returned to Lexington, finished his education, married Nancyetta, and earned a law degree from the University of Kentucky. He worked for years in the lumber business and, as a Lexington developer, contributed greatly to the city of Lexington. He was well respected in the business community and was active in several civic organizations. Mr. Palumbo and his fellow veterans are true heroes. As members of the Greatest Generation, they willingly served to protect the freedoms we enjoy today. I am humbled to honor the life of an American hero, Mr. John A. Palumbo, before the United States Congress, and I extend my deepest condolences to his family during this time. f 
SERBIAU.S. RELATIONS (Mr. STIVERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Bishop Irinej, from the Serbian Orthodox Church, for offering today’s prayer. We are at the 100year anniversary of when President Woodrow Wilson raised the Serbian flag in a show of support for the Serbian people. That symbolic act of solidarity is remembered today, and I think it is really important. Since 2006, my home State of Ohio has worked closely with the Serbian Armed Forces through the Ohio National Guard State Partnership Program. Soldiers from the Ohio National Guard and the Serbian Defense Forces have worked together on deployments and training. We have also worked together to construct schools, carry out humanitarian missions, and provide healthcare. On this anniversary of the U.S.Serbia cooperation, I look forward to another 100 years of friendship with Serbia, and Ohio stands ready to lead the way. 
SUPPORTING THE BLADENSBURG WORLD WAR I MEMORIAL (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of an amicus brief filed by our majority whip, STEVE SCALISE, in defense of the Bladensburg World War I Memorial in Prince George’s County. The 93yearold memorial honoring fallen soldiers has recently come under attack simply for being shaped like a cross. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the memorial unconstitutional because of the inherent meaning of the cross as a religious symbol. What kind of world do we live in where a monument to honor fallen soldiers of World War I—93 years old—is being threatened because of its shape or religious meaning? What is more, this is a clear violation of the Establishment Clause, which has been litigated. It could only be described as hostility towards religion, not neutrality. What is next, Arlington National Cemetery? the U.S. Capitol? or countless other national monuments, historic sites, or traditions? The Supreme Court has a chance to reverse this decision. I urge them to set precedent that will protect America’s historic monuments in perpetuity. f 
b1215 NEW MEXICO UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DOWN (Mr. PEARCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, in June, New Mexico’s unemployment rate ticked down to 4.9 percent. This is the first time the State’s unemployment rate has gone below 5 percent since September of 2008. And just for perspective, one year ago, in 2017, the unemployment was at 6.1 percent. When we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs bill, New Mexico didn’t immediately feel the results, but now people are being filled with confidence, businesses are hiring, they are expanding, and people are going back to work. But an even more remarkable development was the right to export our oil. Two counties in New Mexico are driving a surplus that is causing America to extend above and beyond where Saudi Arabia is currently producing. We are on track to become number one. That is after decades of saying that we had reached peak oil in the country. When we release the ingenuity of the American worker, America can compete with anyone. These things are happening. America is better off today because of what we have done here in Congress as the Republicans. 
CONDEMNING VIOLENCE BY THE GOVERNMENT OF NICARAGUA (Mr. BUDD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the resolution we are voting on this afternoon, condemning the violence committed by the government of Nicaragua against it own citizens. I met with Brenda Lancaster and her husband last week in my office. She is a constituent of mine who started an organization called ZMI Family Ministries International, and they have planted ministries in five different countries, one of those countries being Nicaragua. Mr. Speaker, Brenda has received hundreds of calls and messages from people affiliated with her ministry down there confirming the severity of the situation. She has seen pictures and videos that she wishes no one would ever have to see. Luke 9:57 in the Scriptures recounts a man speaking to Jesus saying: ‘‘I will follow you wherever you go.’’ Brenda 
didn’t think that she would start a ministry in Nicaragua, but that is where God led her. And now people who work and volunteer fear for their lives down there. America has always been at the forefront of fighting human rights abuses around the world. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to do everything in my power to bring awareness to this pressing issue. 
CONGRATULATING TEACH FOR AMERICA FELLOWS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the participants of the 2017 Teach for America Capitol Hill Fellows Program. Soon, many fellows will conclude their yearlong placement with committees and Member offices throughout the House and the Senate. The fellowship offers insights into the legislative process with a focus on professional development, mentorship, and networking opportunities. I have had the pleasure of hosting Paul Camacho, an educator from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a part of my staff. Prior to his fellowship, Paul taught for 6 years in Philadelphia and 2 years in Chula Vista, California. Before becoming a teacher, Paul spent 8 years in the Marine Corps where he traveled extensively and learned important leadership skills. Paul has been a valuable member of my team, and I am grateful for his service. I wish Paul and his family the best as they start their next chapter. Mr. Speaker, I commend all of the 2017 Teach for America Capitol Hill Fellows for taking a year to immerse themselves in public policy and the workings of the legislative branch. I encourage my colleagues to explore what this tremendous program has to offer to their offices. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, to begin, I thank Representative HIGGINS for his hard work on this legislation, and I support H.R. 5693, as amended. This bipartisan legislation is a forwardthinking first step toward better aligning VA’s longterm care options with veteran preferences. Medical foster homes are a solution for veterans that may not be comfortable in a traditional institutional setting, such as a nursing home, yet still need some form of daily assistance and care. These homes provide caregiving services in a group setting for veterans that lack access to caregiving services at home. By allowing VA to cover the cost of medical foster homes, VA will be able to ensure veterans are achieving the most appropriate level of care in the most appropriate setting. The care delivered at medical foster homes is less intensive; therefore, less expensive. Additionally, the sense of community and the familiar homelike setting can promote a veteran’s physical and mental health. Again, I appreciate my colleague’s hard work on this legislation and look forward to voting in favor of the bill. I congratulate the gentleman from Louisiana’s hard work. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS ), an active member of the VA committee and one of the primary sponsors of this, an Army veteran, and reserve police officer. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5693, the LongTerm Care Veterans Choice Act. My bill would authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs for 3 years to cover the cost of longterm care at medical foster homes for up to 900 veterans at a time who are otherwise eligible for nursing home care through the VA. Medical foster homes are private homes in which a caregiver provides services to a smaller group of individuals who are unable to live without daytoday assistance. Medical foster homes are an alternative to nursing homes for those who require care but prefer a noninstitutional setting with fewer residents. For many younger veterans in need of roundtheclock care, medical foster homes can provide a more ageappropriate independent setting than traditional nursing homes. The VA has operated its medical foster home initiative for nearly 20 years, and currently oversees more than 700 licensed caregivers assisting nearly 1,000 veterans across 42 States. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, while the VA will cover the cost of home based primary care for eligible veterans living in medical foster homes, the VA does not cover the cost of medical foster home living arrangements for veterans eligible for nursing home care through the VA. The reforms in my bill increase access to medical foster homes and represent a significant cost savings for the Department of Veterans Affairs. There should be no onesizefitsall standard of care for veterans. Veterans should be afforded flexibility to use the benefits they righteously earned in a manner that best suits their individual needs, which is why the VA, American Legion, and many other veteran service organizations have offered their support for this language. Further, the bill refocuses the administrative bodies of the VA to better prioritize programs like the GI bill, vocational rehabilitation, home loan benefits, and transition assistance programs that create economic opportunities for veterans. This allows existing veterans’ health benefits and National Cemetery Administration to better focus on providing healthcare and cemetery services. This critical refocus will improve oversight and veterans access to important services like the medical foster home program that give much needed choice and personal dignity back to the brave men and women who have sacrificed so much for our Nation. Mr. Speaker, this bill reflects the compassion of the American citizenry in our dedication to serve the veterans who have served us. Please join me in supporting our servicemen and women by voting in support of H.R. 5693, the LongTerm Care Veterans Choice Act. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ), a member of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, and let it also be known that prior to his coming to Congress, he chaired a veterans committee in the California State Legislature. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5693, the Long Term Care Veterans Choice Act. This bipartisan legislation will expand veterans’ access to medical foster homes, an alternative to nursing home care, by allowing the Department of Veterans Affairs to cover such care for up to 900 veterans every year. b1230 The Medical Foster Homes program allows eligible veterans who require daytoday assistance to live in private homes with trained caregivers who provide aroundtheclock care and the services needed to help these veterans with their daily tasks, such as getting dressed. The program requires that caregivers be licensed and involved in frequent inspections by the VA. Most importantly, the Medical Foster Homes program provides aging veterans the option to live in a private setting that may feel more like a home than a nursing institution. Additionally, the amended bill creates a fourth administration within the VA, headed by a new Under Secretary, to administer the educational and employment benefits currently managed by the Veterans Benefits Administration. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 5693. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP ), my good friend, who has been an active member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee and chairs the Subcommittee on Health. I appreciate his leadership on this bill. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the LongTerm Care Veterans Choice Act, legislation that contains the text of my bill, the VET OPP Act. The VET OPP Act continues our effort to invest in our troops from the day they take their oath of service to when they begin their civilian careers. Part of our commitment to our men and women in uniform is helping them reintegrate back into civilian life. We can ease this transition by prioritizing programs that help them find meaningful employment or educational opportunities when they return home. For too long, the outdated structure of the VA has allowed economic opportunity and transition programs for our veterans to fall by the wayside. H.R. 5693 will change that. With the inclusion of the VET OPP Act, it prioritizes veteran employment and education programs at the VA by utilizing existing resources to place educational, employment, and transition programs together in a fourth administration within the VA. This will promote transparency and oversight, while placing greater priority on opportunitybased programs within the VA. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5693. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 5693, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, this is commonsense legislation that will allow veterans in certain circumstances to stay in a less intense nursing home facility. We hear this all the time: ‘‘I don’t want to go to a nursing home.’’ This will allow veterans who have earned these benefits to reside outside there. It is much less expensive for the VA, and it is also much 
better for the veteran if they can do this. A second part of this bill, which is to create the fourth administration, is not more bureaucracy, but to focus on the education benefits and transition as ActiveDuty military leave and enter civilian life again. I think it is one of the most critical things we do. A seamless transition from Active Duty to an active job, I think, will help reduce veteran depression, suicide, dependence, and other things. That is why we wanted to do this. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5693, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. EMMER ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5693, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
STRENGTHENING CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 2353) to reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the Senate amendment is as follows: Senate amendment: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following: 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act’’. 
Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or other provision of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.). 
This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall take effect beginning on July 1, 2019. 
a given career field, that are aligned to curriculum and instruction.’’. 
Section 9 (20 U.S.C. 2307) is amended to read as follows: 
Section 111 (20 U.S.C. 2321) is amended to read as follows: 
Section 118 (20 U.S.C. 2328) is repealed. PART B—STATE PROVISIONS 
Section 133 (20 U.S.C. 2353) is amended by inserting ‘‘or programs of study’’ after ‘‘career and technical education programs’’ each place the term appears. 
Section 135 (20 U.S.C. 2355) is amended to read as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the Senate amendment to H.R. 2353. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), the chairwoman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. THOMPSON for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, today has been a long time coming, so I will be brief. The legislation we are here to send to the President’s desk is a true difference maker. Every one of us knows someone God has blessed with skills, talents, and ideas that do not fit the mold of traditional postsecondary education. Because of that, they may not believe they have much to offer or much to gain by joining the workforce without the ‘‘right’’ degree or diploma. But there really isn’t a right degree or diploma. By updating and strengthening the career and technical education law, which H.R. 2353 does, we are making significant progress in changing those misguided perceptions and giving workforce development the recognition and credit it deserves. We have more than 6 million unfilled jobs in this country, due in large part to the skills gap. The skills gap is partly the result of an outdated approach to workforce development. H.R. 2353 supports innovative learning opportunities and strong community partnerships, addressing the problem of vacant jobs and workforce development needs where they exist: at the local level. I want to recognize the bipartisan effort that has gotten us here today. Congressman GLENN THOMPSON and Congressman RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI , along with a great staff, delivered a great bill for us to work on at the Education and the Workforce Committee. Since we marked it up, reported it, and the House passed the bill last year, I have been pleased and I have been proud to work with Ranking Member BOBBY SCOTT in urging Senate consideration of this legislation. I thank House leaders for bringing this bill back to the floor as soon as we could after the Senate passed it on Monday night. On behalf of every member and staff person of the Education and the Workforce Committee, I am grateful this bill is before the House today, and I am proud of all of their hard work. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman THOMPSON for his partnership on this legislation, and Chairwoman FOXXand Ranking Member SCOTT for their leadership. Lastly, I thank our colleagues in the Senate for working hard to pass H.R. 2353 earlier this week. It has now been 12 years since Congress acted to update this critical program. The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently reported a skills gap of 6.5 million unfilled jobs. Compared to this time last year, there are now an additional 1 million job openings where employers can’t find applicants with the adequate skills or training to fill them. For the health of our economy, the prosperity of our workers, and the strength of our businesses, we must reverse this trend, and we must reverse it now. Our bipartisan legislation, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, implements critical reforms to ensure American technical education and training programs prepare students for highwage, indemand jobs in their communities. This legislation aligns CTE programs to meet the needs of local labor markets, gives business and workforce experts a seat at the table when CTE curricula are crafted, and preserves robust accountability standards to protect American students. This legislation also increases funding to Perkins CTE programs to record levels, ensuring that each State across the country receives sufficient Federal resources to build a dynamic, growing workforce and a thriving economy. Congress hasn’t made substantive reforms to career and technical education since 2006, before the invention of the iPhone and long before the current technological revolution. American students, workers, and businesses are depending on us today to reform and reauthorize Perkins CTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2353, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as cochair of the Career and Technical Education Caucus, I am happy to say that this legislation, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, will help move us in the right direction. This bill has been the result of a long, bipartisan effort that I have been proud to lead with my CTE Caucus co chair, Mr. LANGEVIN from Rhode Island, and now with my cosponsor from the Education and Workforce Committee, Representative RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI . It has been more than a decade since our Federal role in our Nation’s CTE programs has been modernized, and so much of our society has changed since then. Right now, there are more than 6.5 million unfilled jobs in this country, and we are finally recognizing the impact of the skills gap. A study concluded by the Brookings Institute found that, in the next decade, 3 million workers will be needed in the infrastructure industry alone. This includes careers in transportation, housing, and telecommunications. As a father, I know there is nothing parents want more for their kids than a life that is better than their own, but only half of all Americans today expect their children to have a brighter future than they did. The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act aims to help more Americans, particularly younger Americans, obtain the knowledge and skills they need to break the cycle of poverty and achieve a lifetime of success. A big part of that goal is ensuring Federal policies take meaningful steps to address the challenges and realities facing today’s students, workers, and employers. We want State and local leaders to be able to focus their time and resources on preparing students for successful careers. H.R. 2353 helps with this goal by simplifying the application process for receiving Federal funds and providing States and local leaders with the flexibility needed to design CTE programs that best meet the needs of their local communities. Perhaps most importantly, this bill makes improvements on alignment with indemand jobs by supporting innovative learning opportunities and encouraging stronger engagement with employers. The bill promotes work based learning, a technique that allows potential employers to give students handson experience. 
The best thing about this bill is that it is going to be a gamechanger for American students. The second best thing about this bill is that it has enjoyed not just bipartisan support, but unanimous support in both the House and the Senate so far. We are here today to take the last step before sending this vitally important legislation to the President for his signature. I would be remiss not to personally take a moment to thank the many staffers who have made this bill possible: Matthew Brennan, Paul Camacho, and Michelle Rakebrand from my office; former staffer Katie Brown; Education and the Workforce Committee staffers James Redstone, Brad Thomas, Alex Ricci, Mandy Schaumburg, and Amy Jones; and the Senate HELP Committee staff, who have worked behind the scenes to get us to where we are today. b1245 This legislation is supported by a unified coalition of education, business, and industry organizations. And a specific thank you to Boeing, IBM, and the Chamber of Commerce for their leadership. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be joined by other members of the Education and the Workforce Committee to talk about what this bill means to our constituents. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise as ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce in support of H.R. 2353, the Strengthening CTE for the 21st Century Act, which will reauthorize the Perkins Career and Technical Education Program, the CTE program. Mr. Speaker, the House passed the CTE reauthorization in the last Congress and again last year. The Senate made minor changes to the bill, and now we are on the verge of final passage today. In passing the bill, we will be updating the Federal investment in CTE to provide increased State flexibility, while ensuring greater accountability for program quality. H.R. 2353 will also require a more inclusive collaboration between educational institutions, industry, employers, and community partners. Today’s CTE will not be the vocational education of the past. Workers rarely hold the same job for 40 years. Workers often have several jobs throughout their careers, which is why modern CTE programs must help ensure that students receive a foundational education that will help students switch in their career or academic tracks at any time. I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI ) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMP SON) for their bipartisan leadership, and, of course, the chair of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, Dr. FOXX. Because of their work, the House was able to produce a comprehensive reauthorization of Perkins CTE, which will improve program quality and services for students, and support educational programming that engages all students by linking core academic content with realworld, work based skills development. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to say thank you to the ranking member for his help and leadership with marshalling this through the process that we have. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE), a colleague and classmate of mine. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2353. The number one thing I hear from employers back home is that they have goodpaying jobs available, but they can’t find workers who have the necessary training or soft skills. I have also heard that employers are not engaged early enough in the process, and the reforms in today’s bill should help address these concerns. This bill helps encourage community partnerships and engages employers to help ensure employment opportunities for future generations. Most importantly, by Congress acting today, we show our commitment to help those for whom college may not be the right fit by offering them better, skillsbased learning opportunities that will ultimately result in jobs to support themselves and their families. I am also pleased to see the inclusion of provisions from the American Dream Accounts Act, which I introduced last week with Representative MOULTON . This will allow community partnerships to help engage kids to plan and save for technical education programs. A program in Elizabethton, Tennessee, is doing just this, with promising results. With these important reforms, we can help ensure that the labor force of tomorrow has the skills it needs today. I urge support. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ). Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, as co chair of the bipartisan Career and Technical Education Caucus, I am proud to rise in strong support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This important bill is long overdue. The Carl D. Perkins CTE Act hasn’t been reauthorized in more than a decade, and updating it is a vital step toward supporting students and businesses across the country. In particular, I would like to thank my CTE Caucus cochair, Representative GLENN ‘‘GT’’ T HOMPSON , for his leadership on this bill and partnership in Congress on this issue over the last many years. I also want to recognize my House and Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including Chairwoman FOXX, Ranking Member SCOTT, and Congressman KRISHNAMOORTHI , who have demonstrated great bipartisanship in crafting this legislation. I also thank the many partners from across the country from education and the business community for their work on this important bill, and also the many staffers who worked so hard on this, particularly Kerry McKittrick from my staff, and former staffers Sam Morgante and Kirtley Fisher over the years as well. For the past 10 years, I have heard the same concern from employers in Rhode Island, that they are unable to find skilled workers to fill open jobs in manufacturing, IT, and other skilled trades, and it is hurting their businesses. I know that other Members have heard this from their businesses across the country as well. Mr. Speaker, we need to ensure our workforce is equipped with the tools that they need to meet these demands in order to close the skills gap, especially skills for our young people entering the workforce. By aligning CTE programs with industry needs, we will ensure students are learning the academic, technical, and employability skills to succeed in growing economic sectors. I am proud that the Strengthening CTE for the 21st Century Act does just this, while making other important reforms that I have long championed, including expanding access to apprenticeships to give students valuable, handson learning experiences and supporting career counselors to guide students down appropriate academic and career paths. With these components, I am proud to support the Senate amendment to H.R. 2353, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, first of all, my thanks to Mr. LANGEVIN for his longtime friendship and leadership on career and technical education. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. LEWIS). Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. THOMPSON for his leadership on this legislation, as well as Chairman FOXX, Ranking Member SCOTT, and my colleagues on the Education and the Workforce Committee. This great bipartisan effort could not come at a more critical time. As our economy continues to boom, employers across the Nation are struggling to find the skilled workers needed to fill well paying jobs and grow their businesses. The legislation here strengthens the Perkins Act to ensure students gain the necessary skills to compete in the modern economy. I am particularly pleased that the final legislation includes my provisions to encourage and expand dual enrollment opportunities, putting more students on the fast track to a great career. 
Minnesota’s Second District is home to some great technical colleges, and dual enrollment allows high school students to access these programs and to begin working toward an indemand credential or degree. I am proud to support this bill to close the skills gap and help our students succeed. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. NOLAN ). Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this critically important bipartisan reauthorization of the Career and Technical Education Act. I want to especially commend Chairwoman FOXX; Ranking Member S COTT; and, of course, the real hard workers on this deal, Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI and Mr. THOMPSON ; and all the original cosponsors, staff, and people who support this legislation. Time and again, when I visit with owners and managers of manufacturing facilities in my northern Minnesota district, I am told two things. The first is that the employees they have hired who participated in the Career and Technical Education Act are among the very best that they have in their employment. The second point that they make is that they need more CTE trained employees. All up and down the line, from healthcare, to construction, information technology, aviation, transportation, you name it, the list goes on, and the jobs are waiting. This bill adds important new provisions to expand and update CTE, so that they can be filled. It gives States more flexibility to focus on the jobs and careers in high demand in their regions. Employers and communities get the tools that they need to develop stronger partnerships and to engage students and grow our local economies. And students get the tools that they need to compete and succeed in 21st century jobs and the economy. That is what this is all about, Mr. Speaker. It is about more goodpaying jobs. It is about great opportunities for students to learn and develop valuable skills, to develop more dynamic growth for an economy in need of the best, mostskilled workers that America can provide. I urge all of my colleagues to support this critical and important legislation. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN ). Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, it is very refreshing here and a historic day in Congress when we are working together to do something big, and I am just proud to be a part of it. During my time in Congress, I have traveled the 12th District, visiting many schools, and I have spoken to numerous groups of young students. One question I always ask is why they are getting an education. Typically, students will respond with a wide variety of reasons, but the answer is to prepare for a job, to build a successful career, to live the American Dream. Oftentimes, a 4year degree isn’t the right fit. Work is a Godgiven right, and I believe that young people today have the greatest opportunity to live the American Dream than at any time in my lifetime. I am proud to say that I helped create legislation that prioritizes these indemand job skills and education. H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, does a lot of great things. But as a smallbusiness owner, I made sure, during the drafting process, that this legislation would bridge the gap between the business and education community by finally bringing business leaders to the table to create CTE programs for indemand jobs in our hometowns. Thanks to tax reform and deregulation, our economy is booming: 6.7 million jobs are open and available, and the American Dream is right there for the taking. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. DAVIS). Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that our colleagues in the Senate have joined the House in passing career and technical education legislation. I want to thank Chairwoman FOXX and Ranking Member SCOTT, along with our authors of the bill, for your leadership in moving the House version of this bill through committee. Also, today, we gathered experts from across the country to participate in the committee’s first Workforce Innovation Forum. We just had an opportunity to hear from these innovators from cities around the country about the importance of investments and workforce development programs, and they shared how Federal investments can spur private investments in students, raise public awareness—very, very critical—of these programs, and connect workers to jobs in their communities. CTE provides a crucial link between the K–12 system and the workforce, and allows promising students to prepare for fields where highpaying jobs are available. Mr. Speaker, every day, families across America gather around the kitchen table to discuss college and career options, and we need to make sure that highneed job development programs are a bigger part of that conversation. Students and parents need good, current information to make these critical decisions. The flexibility in many of these programs offers our students less time in the classroom and more time in the workplace. And the handson education model keeps people engaged while teaching necessary soft skills before graduation. Every person deserves a quality education, and every community deserves a thriving local economy with highly skilled workers. I am proud to support career and technical education, and look forward to working with our community partners to implement this very important legislation. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG ), a subcommittee chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee for the Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee. b1300 Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. I also thank my colleagues and sponsors of this legislation, Representative THOMPSON from Pennsylvania and my good friend from Illinois, Representative KRISHNAMOORTHI . As I have met with students, teachers, and employers in my district, I have consistently heard the need to expand CTE opportunities and invest in a skilled workforce. In today’s economy, we need to celebrate the fact that not everyone follows the same path. While many students pursue 4year degrees, many others know their sweet spots lie somewhere else. Career and technical education provides students with handson experience that can lead to a good paying job and a rewarding career. I am also pleased this bipartisan legislation includes my provisions to address unnecessary and duplicative licensing requirements that act as a barrier for workers trying to get their foot in the door. I commend my colleagues on the Education and the Workforce Committee for making it a priority to modernize and strengthen CTE programs. Coming from a manufacturing hub like Michigan, this bill will make a big difference for the hardworking men and women of our State. Let’s pass it today and help every American pursue their personal paths to the American Dream. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ). Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee in strong support of the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This bill will reauthorize the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act for the first time since 2006. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Chairwoman FOXX, Ranking Member S COTT, Congressman THOMPSON , and Congressman KRISHNAMOORTHI for their hard work getting this measure through both chambers for the first time in 12 years. This bill is about preparing secondary and postsecondary students with the academic, technical, and employability skills required to be successful in the workforce at a critical time for our economy. 
For example, according to the National Association of Manufacturers, there will be more than 3.5 million open manufacturing jobs through 2025, and unless we can better prepare that future workforce, 2 million of these jobs will go unfilled. This reauthorization will incentivize technical schools to boost performance by providing schools with more flexibility that will allow schools to use Federal grant money to align casework and training with the workforce needs in their region. In eastern Connecticut and Rhode Island, as we ramp up submarine production that will require 14,000 new workers over the next 8 years, an updated Perkins law will be an asset to the Electric Boat shipyard and submarine suppliers for years to come. My district is home to four technical high schools: Norwich, Windham, Grasso, and Ellis Technical High School. In May, I had the opportunity to visit Ellis Tech in Danielson and saw firsthand the impressive programs offered to their 600plus students from 20 towns in the region. In addition to the programming at the school, Ellis partners with local community colleges to offer juniors and seniors the opportunity to receive college credits and reduce the cost of higher education. This bill will take programs like Ellis to a higher and better place just in the nick of time for our economy. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support final passage of this important measure to build a stronger American workforce. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ), another of our subcommittee chairmen in the House Education and the Workforce Committee, and the chairman of the Workforce Protections Subcommittee. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, we have a skills crisis in our country. We actually have more job openings than we have unemployed Americans. This is keeping our economy from reaching full potential. So how do we solve this problem? Well, a big way is through expanding career and technical education programs. As the demands of the workforce continue to change and become more complex, these programs are critical to building the workforce of the 21st century. I have seen these programs firsthand back in Alabama in our high schools, when I was the chancellor of postsecondary education, and I saw it at work in our 2year colleges. They benefit the local economy by helping fill open jobs, but they make the lives of our students intrinsically better by connecting them with the skills they need to thrive. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and show the strong bipartisan support that we showed when it passed the House the first time. Career and technical education is for everybody in America, and America’s House needs to stand up and support it. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ). Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. As a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2353, the bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, a bill to support students and prepare them for the future. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their work on this important legislation. In Oregon, current technical education classes, like Beaverton’s Aloha High School’s Auto Tech program and Newberg High School’s CAD Lab, engage more students, boost graduation rates, and give students the opportunity to learn real world skills. Federal CTE funding provides critical equipment that schools need to make these handson classes meaningful experiences for students in Oregon and across the country. I am proud that this bill includes the amendment I worked on with Representative ELISE STEFANIK , my cochair of the STEAM Caucus, to encourage the integration of arts and design skills into STEM CTE programs. Our provision will help make sure that the next generation of students are creative and innovative by fully engaging and educating both halves of the brain through art and design. Mr. Speaker, I want to, again, thank my colleagues, and especially Ranking Member SCOTT and Chairwoman F OXX for their leadership on this issue. We have been waiting for a long time for this bipartisan bill, and I am proud to stand in strong support today. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN ). Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on this bill. As anybody who talks to the average person knows, in this country today, we have a huge labor shortage of people ready to do the type of jobs that industry needs. I have more manufacturing jobs in my district than any other congressman around the country, and the number one problem we have is we can’t find people to do those jobs. We all have medical facilities around this country, and again and again, nurses or other skilled people are not available for the huge number of job openings that are out there. Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people getting 4year degrees or part of 4year degrees and not finding jobs that pay anywhere near as good as some of the jobs you can get at a technical school. Earlier this morning I looked at a local technical school here in town that had a demonstration project on some of the robotics training that they are doing, and we had people who are starting at $25, $30, $35 an hour, and that is before overtime. And these people, because the degrees take only 2 years to get and frequently allow you to live at home, are graduating without debt, unlike many people who have been foolishly told to go to a 4year college and are not getting a lot out of it. So I am pleased today to vote for the Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which will also reduce, to a degree, paperwork required by the Federal Government. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. EMMER ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Wisconsin. Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would also just like to thank those businesses out there that are training people out there without the benefit of government education at all, because those are also sometimes frequently very good jobs. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ), a fellow colleague from the Education and the Workforce Committee. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of H.R. 2353. It has been a year since this House passed reauthorization, and I am thrilled the Senate finally took action to pass the bill earlier this week. This legislation is vital to supporting career and technical education, such as apprenticeship programs, all across my district. As I have spoken with folks back home, I have heard time and time again from businessowners the importance of training a new generation of skilled workers. Many of the current employees are nearing retirement age, and these businessowners are facing an evershrinking pool of skilled labor. I also see students seeking more opportunities other than a 4year degree. CTE programs are a solution for both of these groups, and I am proud that there are so many examples of this in the Third District of Georgia. In fact, today, Kathy Carlisle from the THINC Academy in LaGrange, Georgia, testified in front of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Dr. Carlisle shared how THINC has contributed to a community revitalization success story and what happens when the local leaders of the business community and innovative educators come together. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. FERGUSON. This bill will continue these opportunities, increasing funding, and giving States more flexibility to implement innovative programs. Most importantly, a diverse group of members from our community from all socioeconomic backgrounds stand on the edge of success, and this will help get them there. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to seeing this bill pass, and I urge everyone to support it. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to say thank you, again, to Congressman G.T. THOMPSON , Chairwoman F OXX, Ranking Member SCOTT, all the members of the Education and the Workforce Committee, all the staff on the Education and the Workforce Committee, and a point of personal privilege, Sam Morgante and Brian Kaissi for their yeoman’s work on my staff. The CTE bill will begin a career and technical education revolution in this country. It will allow us to equip millions of young people and those in career transition with the skills to take the jobs of the future. There are 6.7 million unfilled jobs that are waiting to be filled by motivated, enterprising, hardworking people who seek a middle class lifestyle, which is the American Dream. Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support of this landmark legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on my side of the aisle? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 5 minutes remaining. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today what we are talking about is restoring rungs in the ladder of opportunity. This is about providing better access to more effective skillsbased education for all Americans. A lot of people listening sometimes think about career and technical education, and appropriately, they think about our kids who we are trying to equip and prepare them to be successful in life, to have better lives than what we have had as their parents, and we certainly are here to do that. This legislation does serve those kids. But this legislation serves Americans at any age, at every point in their life, to be able to tap back into a system, to get a little bit more training, a certification, a specialization, to be able to get a promotion, to get a better job. And it really is about upward mobility, Mr. Speaker. I would say on every school day somewhere around this country, there is a student, maybe a young lady, that is not really motivated to get out of bed to go off to school, because she is someone that doesn’t learn perhaps as well as others in a conventional education setting where people are lecturing and, you know, just being in the classroom setting. And she is reluctant. When she does go to school, my guess is she is probably in that classroom, and many times you find her with her head down on her desk. But if you put the tools, Mr. Speaker, of career and technical education in her hands, she becomes inspired. Now, that could be a welder, it could be wrenches, it could be a hammer, it could be a keyboard, it could be a paintbrush, it could be a stethoscope, it could be the tools of agriculture. There are just so many tools. You put one of those tools in her hands, she is inspired. You have lit her life on fire of what is possible. I would say this morning, when we all got up and we are having our breakfast, somewhere in America, many places in America, there were young families sitting around the table, maybe a husband and wife that have maybe young children, who, because of unemployment or underemployment, they are just wondering how they are going to pay the bills. This is a piece of legislation that serves that man and that woman to be able to get back into the workforce. Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, to get back into the workforce for the first time in a generation. b1315 For those folks who are living in intergenerational poverty, they have been in poverty so long that they don’t recall what happened in generations past that placed their family in that situation. But this is a rung on the ladder of opportunity to climb out of those circumstances. Mr. Speaker, there are many places in this country today where employers are waking up faced with a difficult decision. They have had a business that has been very, very successful. They have done well in life, and they have got a great product or a great service. They have got a great location. They have got a great marketing plan. They have got a great compliance plan to deal with overregulation. But what they don’t have is a qualified and trained workforce. They have two decisions to make that morning. All of it involves shuttering that business, closing it, putting plywood on the doors and the windows, and just walking away and enjoying what they have earned and accumulated; or moving that business overseas where, perhaps, there are more warm bodies to be able to fill those jobs. This bill serves those employers as well. And so, once again, I want to thank Representative KRISHNAMOORTHI as well as all of the Members of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the Senate amendment to H.R. 2353, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, and representative of Kansas’ manufacturing hub known as the Air Capital of the World . . . I have heard repeatedly about the skills gap facing employers and today’s labor force. For a generation . . . many have stressed the importance of a 4year degree over that of a technical skill. While a 4year degree remains vitally important . . . we must not forget the equal need for career and technical education . . . especially when our economy now has more job openings than qualified applicants. That’s why I’m proud to support H.R. 2353. This bipartisan bill helps more Americans enter the workforce with skills they need to succeed. The bill provides local leaders more resources and flexibility to adapt to changing education and economic needs; supports more collaboration between employers and educators to close the skills gap; streamlines performance measures for CTE programs; and reigns in Washington’s control over individual curriculums and performance. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 2353. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
CONDEMNING THE VIOLENCE, PERSECUTION, INTIMIDATION, AND MURDERS COMMITTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF NICARAGUA AGAINST ITS CITIZENS Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 981) condemning the violence, persecution, intimidation, and murders committed by the Government of Nicaragua against its citizens, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. R ES. 981 Whereas Daniel Ortega has taken systematic steps to weaken democratic institutions in Nicaragua since 2006, including by manipulating the Nicaraguan Constitution through actions such as eliminating presidential term limits; Whereas Daniel Ortega selected his wife, Rosario Murillo, as his vicepresidential candidate in 2016; Whereas domestic and international observers have repeatedly documented and criticized irregularities in the 2011 and 2016 presidential elections as well as the 2012 and 2017 municipal elections in Nicaragua; Whereas, on April 18, 2018, students in Nicaragua began to protest the unilateral decision of the Government of Nicaragua to impose reforms on the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute; Whereas the protests were met with a violent and brutal response from the Nicaraguan National Police, subsequently resulting in a widespread call by the Nicaraguan 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would really like to begin by thanking our Foreign Affairs chairman emeritus, ILEANA ROS LEHTINEN , and I do also want to thank my other colleagues on the committee. I also thank ALBIO SIRES for his work on this measure, along with Colonel Cook. I think it is very timely. It is very important. I think, for those whose families have experienced what it is like under a totalitarian system, there is a special identification with what the victims are going through right now as a result of the authoritarian bent, right now, of President Daniel Ortega, the same Daniel Ortega we remember from 1979. But he lost an election, I think it was, in 1990. He has had five terms. But in consolidating his power, he has moved to an authoritarian approach in tightening that grip where he has now resorted to using brutal force against the students on their campuses if they protest; brutal force against the people who seek refuge in the churches, shooting up the churches, something that Congressman JUAN VARGAS was talking to me about the other day; brutal force in the villages against those who protest, creating a situation with hundreds and hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. I can just tell you personally, I have a constituent and friend in the district, and she is from one of those villages. She saw me and gave me a little letter the other day about the fate of some of her neighbors who died at the hands of one of these attacks in the villages. They were murdered there on the streets of her small village. I think the reason that this resolution represents such a broad, bipartisan consensus in this condemnation of Ortega’s regime is because of the nature of that violence. What this resolution does is support the people of Nicaragua in their pursuit of freedom. Nicaraguans, understandably, want selfdetermination. They want an end to corruption. They are asking for free and fair elections. The international community—in particular, the Organization of American States regional leaders—must continue to stand with these brave students and church leaders and villagers who are being targeted and being assassinated by thugs working on behalf of and at the behest of Daniel Ortega. When we think about this circumstance and other authoritarian leaders, one of the allies of Daniel Ortega is Nicolas Maduro. He uses these same tactics against the Venezuelan people, and the people deserve better than this. This resolution shows this body’s commitment to standing shoulder to shoulder with those without a voice, seeking freedom from those authoritarians who are becoming dictators. The administration was correct earlier this month in sanctioning three senior Nicaraguan officials for human rights abuses and corruption under the U.S. Global Magnitsky Act, a measure that we passed out of our committee, and that is something that this resolution affirms. But more can still be done. This resolution encourages the administration to continue to pressure Ortega to stop the violence and to move forward with free and fair elections. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. In response to Ortega’s brutal crackdown on peaceful protests and human rights violations, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 981, condemning the violence, persecution, and intimidation committed by the Government of Nicaragua against its citizens. As we know, the Nicaraguan people are suffering as the Ortega government continues to punish citizens for pursuing greater democratic rights. Since Ortega came into power, he has worked hard to consolidate power in the hands of his family and party loyalists at the expense of Nicaraguan citizens. The peaceful protests that began in April initially opposed the proposed government reform to social security. However, as Ortega ordered violent crackdowns by government security forces, the demonstrations gradually became a call for a more democratic Nicaragua. The Catholic Church has attempted numerous times to mediate dialogue between Ortega and opposition groups, but the Ortega regime has repeatedly failed to uphold its end of the agreement. We are seeing new reports every week on how Ortega’s paramilitary forces are opening fire against sanctuaries and shooting and injuring people seeking refuge in churches across the country. It is shameful. As negotiations over dialogue have devolved, hundreds of Nicaraguan citizens are estimated to have been killed, with thousands more injured. Recently, international observers from the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and the European Union have arrived in Nicaragua to begin investigating the violence. Now, many Nicaraguans are demanding political reform and the resignation of Ortega and his wife before the scheduled elections in 2021. Mr. Speaker, the United States cannot stand idly by and ignore the demands of the Nicaraguan people while the Ortegas and his confidants push the country towards authoritarianism. That is why my colleagues, Congresswoman ROSLEHTINEN , Ranking Member ENGEL , Chairman C OOK, and I have introduced this bipartisan resolution condemning the ongoing violence in Nicaragua. We are urging the administration to impose sanctions on individuals who qualify under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. I have also worked with my friend ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN to pass the Nicaragua Investment Conditionality Act, to hold the regime accountable for its misuse of international loans. This bill would direct the U.S. to not support international loans to Nicaragua until the government increases transparency and has free and fair elections. Unified pushback from the international community shows the courageous Nicaraguans on the ground that the world stands shoulder to shoulder with them. It is the only way for Ortega to see the writing on the wall. He has to give up his grip and enact long overdue and meaningful political reform that people are yearning for. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for their continued bipartisanship on these important issues. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), the chairman emeritus of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the author of this resolution. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman ROYCE for his amazing leadership and also Ranking Member ENGEL . They brought this important and timely resolution to the floor, and I am so grateful to have worked not only with Chairman ROYCE  and Ranking Member ENGEL , but also with Chairman COOK and Ranking Member SIRES of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee. All of us introduced H. Res. 981, and this resolution, as Mr. SIRES and Mr. ROYCE have pointed out, condemns the persecution; it condemns the intimidation, the violence, and the murders that are being committed by the Government of Nicaragua against its citizens under the orders of Daniel Ortega. Mr. Speaker, 450, that is how many Nicaraguans have been killed by Ortega’s regime and its thugs just since April of this year. Heaven knows how many today or how many just these past days. The death toll is rising every day. And as the regime has now authorized a shoottokill policy in cities like Masaya and Jinotega, shoot to kill against dissidents, against protesters, and add that to the thousands who have been injured, arrested, and forced disappearances, we are talking about a massive and severe repression by a regime that will do anything to stay in power. That is what this is all about. Ortega and his wife want to stay in power at all costs. On Monday, Daniel Ortega had the nerve, the audacity, to go on our news channel, FOX News, American TV, to say that everything was under control in Nicaragua and that it was, in fact, the Nicaraguan people who were committing the acts of violence, that the Nicaraguan people are the ones responsible for the bloodshed. It is a desperate attempt by a desperate but dangerous fool. Mr. Speaker, it is a dire situation, and it is getting worse by the day. That is why we need to hold Ortega accountable for his evil and violent acts and put additional pressure on his regime. The administration has shown great leadership in condemning Ortega and in sanctioning some of his regime’s top officials under the Global Magnitsky Act. b1330 My resolution urges the administration to do more, to target more of Ortega’s goons for sanctions, and to urge this very body to do more, because time is of the essence. The measure before us is simple and straightforward. It rightfully identifies Ortega, not the Nicaraguan people, as the orchestrator of the violence. It urges the administration to take more action against the regime. It also demonstrates our unwavering support for the people of Nicaragua in their support for democracy and their pursuit of justice. It includes the call for early, free, fair, and transparent elections overseen by domestic and international observers. This resolution also calls upon responsible nations to stand in solidarity with the people of Nicaragua, because their silence has been deafening. Today, this body is standing up for some of the most cherished values and ideals that we hold true to our hearts, and we are unequivocally rejecting the Ortega regime’s abuses and its corruption. Today, we can send a strong, unified, and clear message that we are watching; we are acting; and we are supporting the aspirations of all freedomloving Nicaraguans. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Florida an additional 1 minute. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, in my congressional district, I am so blessed to have so many Nicaraguan Americans. In fact, one of them is right here behind me, Gaby Boffelli, who is very proud of her Nicaraguan heritage, and she keeps me abreast of what is happening in Nicaragua every day. My constituents tell me they are heartbroken about the situation. They are heartbroken because people don’t seem to be paying attention. But they know that the United States Congress is standing with them. Today, with this vote, we will stand ever so strongly with them. Ortega is receiving help, as the chairman pointed out, from Venezuela’s Maduro, from Castro in Cuba, and from DiazCanel in Cuba. These thugs know how to repress and kill dissidents. Let’s do the right thing. Let’s not stand with the oppressors. Let’s stand with the people of Nicaragua. Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for the purpose of closing. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. In response to Ortega’s brutal crackdown on peaceful protests and human rights violations, H. Res. 981 condemns the violence, persecution, and intimidation committed by the Government of Nicaragua against its citizens. The Nicaragua National Police, or militias, controlled by the Nicaraguan 
Government have murdered, detained, and tortured innocent people peacefully standing up for their rights. Stories of Nicaraguan protesters being electrocuted and waterboarded by gangs aligned with the Ortega regime continue to horrify the international community. While the Ortegas may condemn foreign interference in their affairs, let us be clear: The United States condemns the violence, the persecution, the intimidation, and the murders of peaceful protesters by the Ortega security forces and his henchmen. We support the people of Nicaragua in their pursuit for democracy, including their call for free and fair elections overseen by credible domestic and international observers, and we demand that Nicaragua release those individuals wrongfully detained by the government. Again, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, EDROYCE and E LIOT ENGEL . I want to take this opportunity to thank EDROYCE for his last 3 years of bipartisan work. I want to tell the gentleman that I really appreciate being on his committee and serving with him on this committee. I thank the gentleman for his service. I also want to thank both my good friend ELIOT ENGEL as well, who is my counterpart on the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, and Chairman PAULCook for their strong bipartisan leadership. I also want to thank my good friend from Florida, ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN , whom I have worked with and admired for many, many years, for her decades of unwavering dedication to promoting democracy and human rights around the world. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I urge all Members to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I shared with this body the letter from my constituent and neighbor outlining what had happened to her village where she had grown up and how she had lost friends at the hands of a gang allied with Daniel Ortega quite recently who attacked the village. So I want to thank ALBIO SIRES, Chairman Emeritus Ros Lehtinen, and others who worked on this resolution for bringing this bipartisan measure forward. I want to thank them for their continued leadership. Because of the continued attacks on demonstrators in Nicaragua, the shooting up of churches, and the threatening of priests there, hundreds of protesters have been murdered, and thousands more have been injured. This is unacceptable. Mr. Speaker, in closing, it is imperative that this body, and our friends and allies across the region, continue to call on Daniel Ortega to end the violence and to allow free and fair elections in Nicaragua. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 981, and to condemn the Ortega regime’s escalating, brutal campaign against its own people. Ortega has now been in charge of Nicaragua for 22 of the last 39 years. After years of consolidating power by installing his wife as vice president, and gradually chipping away at the power of the judiciary and congress, Ortega has now dropped all pretense of being anything other than an authoritarian leader. More than 300 people have now died in Nicaragua for having the courage to speak out against his and his wife’s dictatorial rule. Ortega has now shown himself willing to target members of the clergy for fulfilling their sacred duty to recognize the value of human life, and for putting themselves in harm’s way to try to protect their people. This should be unacceptable to the U.S. and to the international community. I commend my colleague Rep. ROSLEHTINEN for taking a stand, and I encourage the executive branch to use all nonmilitary means available to hold Ortega accountable for these deaths and to stop the carnage in Nicaragua. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 981, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ENERGY DIPLOMACY ACT OF 2018 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5535) to amend the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 regarding energy diplomacy and security within the Department of State, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5535 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Energy Diplomacy Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on this measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? 
There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as America’s energy production has increased, and as Chairman MIKEMCCAUL, the author of the measure, can tell you, our Nation’s influence in global energy policy has grown. The U.S. is now the world’s top producer of petroleum. It is also the top producer of natural gas for the fifth straight year. I will add to that: The United States has become more energy efficient. Our abundant supply of energy resources is not only good for our economy, it is also good for our national security. It offers American allies a critical alternative to countries like Russia, which use their energy resources to bully their neighbors, in the case of Vladimir Putin, and, in the case of the global oil cartel OPEC, enrich its member states at the expense of U.S. consumers. In this moment of heightened American energy leadership, it is critical that the State Department have the leadership and direction needed to fulfill its statutory responsibilities governing international energy diplomacy. This bill, the Energy Diplomacy Act, will elevate America’s energy security and diplomacy priorities. It authorizes an Assistant Secretary for Energy Resources at the State Department. This Assistant Secretary will replace the Coordinator for International Energy Affairs, demonstrating the importance of energy issues to our foreign policy and our national interests. The Assistant Secretary will be responsible for developing and implementing policies to advance U.S. energy interests abroad by managing our relations in petroleum, in natural gas, in biofuels, in renewable energy, and in nuclear and other energy resources. This bill also requires the State Department to use diplomacy to support the development of U.S. energy resources to bolster our energy security, grow our economy, and support our allies. Mr. Speaker, for years, the world’s leading petroleum producers have been rigging the world market by cutting production to drive up gasoline prices, and this hurts families in places like our home States. It is in our interests to promote the availability of diversified energy supplies in a functioning global market for energy resources, technologies, and expertise. That is exactly what this bill requires. Energy policy expertise must be more deeply integrated in our foreign policy. As a major energy producing nation, it is time we elevate this important issue within our diplomatic ranks, which is what this bill will do. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman MCCAULfor his work on this important measure with us today. Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5535. I would like to thank Congressman MCCAUL, Chairman R OYCE , and Ranking Member ENGEL for their bipartisan work on this timely issue. As it has for decades, energy will continue to play a key role in shaping United States foreign policy. But the international landscape is changing, and so are the players. Global energy demand is set to rise 30 percent by the year 2030. This reflects an expanding global economy, rapid industrialization, population growth, urbanization, and improved energy access among developing countries. For the United States to maintain a leading role on the global stage, the State Department must be positioned to protect and promote favorable energy policies abroad. The Energy Diplomacy Act of 2018 helps this effort by creating an Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources and requiring the State Department to employ sufficient personnel dedicated to international energy matters. By passing this legislation, we can prepare the State Department to engage in robust energy diplomacy and encourage strong international partnerships that promote our own political, economic, environmental, and national security concerns. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), who is the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and a senior member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The gentleman is the author of this measure. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, the Energy Diplomacy Act. Across the globe, our friends and allies want a stable and reliable supply of American energy. America, in turn, must actively engage our friends and allies to provide alternatives to energy from rogue regimes. Look what is happening in Europe. For over a decade, Russia has used their natural gas pipelines flowing into Eastern and Central Europe as a point of leverage over these countries. Ukraine has been most affected, with Russia turning off their natural gas supply in the winter of 2008 and during the annexation of Crimea in 2014. By twisting a knob and turning off Ukrainian heat, they were able to exert an outsized amount of influence on Ukraine. Now, Russia’s proposed Nord Stream II pipeline with Germany further threatens to expand Russia’s energy influence throughout Eastern and Central Europe. Make no mistake: Russia is a destabilizing regime that constantly exploits the vulnerabilities posed by Europe’s reliance on their natural gas. The United States must be involved to curb this influence. Over the past decade, the United States has reduced our reliance on foreign sources of energy in order to achieve energy independence. As a result, we are now exporting energy abroad, including from my home State of Texas. In fact, in 2015, I helped champion the repeal of the outdated crude oil export ban. Now, U.S. producers are finding new customers in both Asia and Europe. That is why I authored the Energy Diplomacy Act. It elevates the Bureau of Energy Resources at the State Department. It replaces the International Energy Affairs Coordinator with an Assistant Secretary. This Assistant Secretary will carry out the State Department’s functions on behalf of the United States. It also ensures the State Department is staffed with sufficient personnel to support this mission. This will empower the State Department to promote and advance a bold U.S. energy diplomacy policy. As energyrich adversaries expand their malign influence and our allies continue to purchase from such states, the United States must project strong energy diplomacy now more than ever. It is not just Russia with whom we are contending. One of Iran’s main goals in negotiating their nuclear deal was to open up their energy markets to more foreign investment and to expand their oil exports globally. Since the U.S. departed from the JCPOA, our European allies and our strategic partner India are deciding between complying with United States sanctions or ignoring them and buying Iranian oil. b1345 We also need our diplomats on the front lines promoting reliable American energy. These two circumstances underscore the need for an Assistant Secretary for Energy Resources to project U.S. energy diplomacy throughout the world. I want to thank Chairman ROYCE for his leadership, as well as Ranking Member ENGEL , an original cosponsor of my bill. Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, the United States has long recognized that global energy security and cooperation are necessary to advance our economic, foreign policy, and national security interests. We must work with our established friends and allies to seize the opportunities and address the challenges we face. We must also work with the emerging economies that account for an everincreasing amount of energy consumption and production. H.R. 5535, the Energy Diplomacy Act, takes an important step toward ensuring that the State Department has the leadership and the capacity it needs to appropriately advance this critical aspect of U.S. foreign policy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues, Chairman MCCAUL, Ranking Member E NGEL , and Mr. SIRES, for crafting bipartisan legislation to ensure that the State Department has the leadership and the direction to support America’s energy diplomacy priorities. Working with our allies and partners in the private sector, we can counter Putin’s weaponization of his energy resources and provide our allies with a stable alternative to unreliable energy suppliers whose priorities are selfenrichment and geopolitical selfinterest at the expense of a functioning market. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bipartisan bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5535, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
