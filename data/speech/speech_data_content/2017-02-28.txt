Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, tonight at the President’s address, I will be joined by a young man, Eliel Aguillon, a new American, in the great tradition of this great country. Eliel grew up surrounded by poverty, yet he found his path to the American Dream through hard work and edu-cation. Eliel is my neighbor. He at-tended the same public high school

Today, Eliel encourages young students to pursue careers in science and math. Eliel is a DACA student. Let me re-peat. Eliel is a DACA student. He and his family left Mexico when he was 7 years old to pursue the American Dream through hard work and dedica-tion. We must ensure that Eliel and hun-dreds of other hardworking DACA stu-dents stay in America, the only home they have known, so that they can also contribute to the greatness of our great country. DACA students are our new Americans. Let us help our great Nation stay great. Let us do the right thing. Let’s give our DACA students and other hardworking taxpayers in our Nation a pathway to citizenship.

VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING DO NOT BELONG IN SHACKLES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. P
OE) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in her formative years, Lena wore turtle-necks and baggy clothes to school every day. Why did she do so? To hide the bruises that covered her entire body. Soon, Lena’s abusive foster mother lost custody of her. And when her fos-ter mother lost custody, Lena just ran away. She was 13. After bolting from the front lawn at the Houston middle school, she ran into a friendly-looking stranger, and that is when she discovered a false sense of comfort in the hands of a das-tardly human trafficker. He offered to look after her, protect her, and love her; that was if she made him a little money. And he offered her the one thing she was missing in her 13 years, someone who said they loved her. Mr. Speaker, love doesn’t come with black eyes and bruises, however. The trafficker even promised Lena drugs so she could focus on something else while she was having sex with the buyers of children. For the next 3 months, Lena would have many different traffickers and many different buyers. She would spend a few months or weeks with them, moving from motel to motel, then she would get scared and try to go back to foster care, and then just dis-appear again. Finally, she was arrested after police responded to an internet post adver-tising sex with children. They arrested her trafficker in the hotel next door. With her help, the police ultimately charged two individuals with forcing a child into prostitution, or human traf-ficking, as we call it. Upon her arrest, it was revealed that not only did she have three sexually transmitted diseases, she was also pregnant. The problem then, Mr. Speaker, is that Lena had nowhere to go. Authori-ties found themselves with an abused, traumatized, demoralized trafficking victim, a child, on their hands. Re-member, Lena was a victim of crime. She was not a criminal. Children can-not be willing prostitutes under the law. But there were no resources to put her anywhere, no resources to get her help and the support that she needed. The very limited number of nearby trafficking shelters were all full and there was no place to send her, so she was locked up in the county jail. Victims of trafficking, Mr. Speaker, do not belong in shackles and orange jumpsuits. They belong in safe, nur-turing environments. They deserve to have access to resources and help to get their stolen lives back for them. How can a victim begin to recover, while a child, languishing in jail? The justice system failed Lena and many others just like her, but it doesn’t have to be this way. Lena de-serves justice. Sitting here in Washington, D.C., there is a victims’ fund totaling over $12 billion. Money in this fund comes from fines and fees imposed on con-victed felons, people like deviants who trafficked Lena. Unfortunately, year after year, only a small amount of this money is actually taken out of the fund to help victims. Most of it stays in the fund and is used by appropri-ators to offset the costs of their pet projects that have nothing to do with victims of crime. This is not acceptable, Mr. Speaker. The money, remember, is not taxpayer money. It is money that comes from criminals when they are convicted in Federal court, and we should give this money to victims of crime. Money in the fund should be spent only on what victims like Lena des-perately need so that they can get their lives back together and recover from the trafficking abuse they suf-fered. Lena and other trafficking victims deserve justice. They deserve the money that is in the fund, and bureau-crats need to quit using that money as an offset for other projects. The victim fund is partially the answer. Mr. Speaker, this should be spent on victims of crime because no trafficking victim belongs in the shackles of a county jail. And that is just the way it is.

SENSELESS ACTS OF GUN VIOLENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. T
ORRES ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Jonah Min Hwang, another victim of a sense-less act of gun violence. Jonah was only 8 years old when he was killed last week in a drive-by shooting in my home city of Pomona. Jonah, his parents, and his brother were enjoying dinner hosted by friends of his parents, two schoolteachers, when a bullet ripped through the house and hit Jonah. Crimes like this are heartbreaking. A talented soccer player, an avid reader who loved superheroes, Jonah was an adopted child from a Taiwanese orphanage just 3 years ago. It eats at your soul to think that such a young child with his whole life ahead of him could be taken so ruthlessly. Perhaps most frustrating is that Jonah’s killer is still at large. When I first heard of Jonah’s death, it brought me back to a similar trag-edy when I served as mayor of my home city of Pomona. In 2006, little Ethan Esparza was shot and killed while he was playing in his front yard during his birthday party. He would have turned 4 years old. Ethan’s murder shocked our commu-nity and was a stark reminder of the violence that plagues our city. Sadly, over 10 years later, we are still fighting those same battles. The murders of Jonah and Ethan were completely senseless, but they are not rare. In fact, Pomona was recently ranked California’s eighth most dan-gerous city, which doesn’t surprise those of us who have seen gangs take ahold of our city. Our local police department puts their lives on the line every single day to try to keep us safe, and our local of-ficials have made significant invest-ments in law enforcement. During my time as mayor, we implemented gang injunctions to try to get hold of the problem. b1015 But as the number of guns on the streets continues to rise and ruthless gang members get their hands on these deadly weapons, it often feels like a losing battle. We are alone fighting these battles. As a matter of fact, today marks the 23rd anniversary of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, better known as the Brady bill, which has blocked more than 3 million people who had no business owning a gun from buying a gun from a federally licensed dealer. As the new President makes his first address to Congress today, it is espe-cially infuriating that, despite the countless gun-related tragedies occur-ring across our country, this Congress and this new administration have not taken one single step to reduce gun vi-olence. I have come to this floor before demanding action, and I stand here be-fore you yet again today, Mr. Speaker, to demand action on behalf of Jonah, of Ethan, and of the millions of innocent lives lost. There are steps that we can take im-mediately to expand the Brady bill to save lives and make our communities safer: First, we should close the loophole that allows guns to be sold online or at gun shows without background checks.

Second, we should make sure that there are resources available to re-search gun violence—research. We can’t find effective solutions if we can’t research and understand the problem. Lastly, we should enhance the Na-tional Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS, and make sure that States are inputting records in a way that allows Federal agencies to run complete background checks on in-dividuals. Background checks are only as effective as the quality of the records in the background check sys-tem. There is no excuse for making it easy for dangerous people to get their hands on a deadly weapon. It is my deepest hope that this Congress will take ac-tion on gun control so that none of us has to attend another vigil in Po-mona—or anywhere else in America— to honor the memory of another child taken from us much too soon. We owe it to the victims and to their loved ones to act.

AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Y
OHO) for 5 minutes. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not only to celebrate African American History Month, but to celebrate two stories lost to mainstream history. The first story is the original Underground Railroad, and the other story is of Jo-siah T. Walls. Students across the country have heard stories about the Underground Railroad during the Antebellum Pe-riod; however, there was a Road to Freedom that existed before the United States was even established, and that road went south to the free territory of Spanish Florida. In fact, the National Park Service held its sixth annual Un-derground Railroad Conference in St. Augustine in 2012 to highlight this very story which started with eight re-corded families seeking freedom in 1608 in Florida. During this period, thousands of men, women, and children fled from the colonies of North Carolina, South Caro-lina, and Georgia. These individuals headed to Florida to gain their freedom thanks to the Edict of 1693, which was issued by the then-Spanish Govern-ment that stated that any man, woman, or child who found their way to Spanish Florida would be granted freedom. The people at the heart of this story are the Gullah Geechee who trace their lineage to West Africa. Once free in Florida, the Gullah Geechee people thrived, establishing communities, forts, and deep roots throughout Flor-ida’s Third Congressional District, roots that still can be felt today. The second story is of Josiah T. Walls. He was a man who was born into slavery in 1842 in Virginia. He worked as a slave. The Civil War broke out, and he was conscripted by the Confed-erate Army to serve as a cook in the Civil War. He got freed by the Union soldiers, served with the Union sol-diers, and after the war, he moved to Florida to fight in the Seminole Amer-ican wars. During that time period, the war ended, and he moved to Gaines-ville, Florida, where he became the first African-American mayor of our city where I come from. During that time, he became a very successful businessperson. He was elected to the Florida Assembly, and then later he was elected to the U.S. Congress, serving in this very body here today. His elections got chal-lenged, and he lost his role as a Rep-resentative in the House. He ran again the next year, won again, and served a full term. Then the third term he ran, he won again. His election got chal-lenged by a Confederate soldier, and he lost his seat. He went on to become a prominent businessman in north central Florida, owned a farm, and was very successful until the freeze of 1906, which put him out of business. He moved to Tallahas-see and became a newspaper owner and printed a local newspaper. He rose to prominence, but at his death, he was but a footnote in the his-tories not just of our State, but of our country. Here is a man that was born into slavery, rose to prominence, and was forgotten by history. I tell these stories because these sto-ries, like many stories in our early his-tory, must never be forgotten and must be remembered by our history lest we repeat it. It must also be taught to our children so that they are inspired and they see themselves in the history books like these other folks.

RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 21 minutes a.m.), the House stood in re-cess.

PRAYER Chaplain Harvey Klee, American Le-gion National Chaplain, Bluffton, Texas, offered the following prayer: Almighty God, we thank You when heroic leadership has been undertaken in this House during times of crises, for their labor well into the night, for ef-forts to seek compromise where com-promise is warranted, and for creative solutions proposed and acted upon in the best interests of the American peo-ple. May unity prevail even when parties are in conflict. When progress is im-peded and negotiations break down, grant them fresh ideas for discussion and ultimate resolution. May all Members of this House re-main faithful to the oath of office they have taken as Representatives of ‘‘We the people . . . ’’ and may political ideologies be tempered by intellectual honesty. Lord, bless this land we love so much and save us from our own self-inflicted wounds. This we pray in the name of all that is holy. Amen. f

NGEL ) come for-ward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. ENGEL led the Pledge of Alle-giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING CHAPLAIN HARVEY KLEE The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. C
ON-
AWAY ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent of mine who is here with us today. Chap-lain Harvey H. Klee, a resident of Llano, Texas, joins us today as the na-tional chaplain of the American Le-gion. We just heard Chaplain Klee give a beautiful invocation, calling for us all to be unified in our actions, with the best interest of the American people at heart. Chaplain Klee has dedicated himself to living by those words, serv-ing our Nation and its people in many ways. Chaplain Klee served in the Navy during the Korean war and later worked as a missionary helping drug addicts and designing training pro-grams for inmates at a prison in Cali-fornia. Later, he founded the Texas Chap-lains Association, and has been ap-pointed Texas Department Chaplain nine times, which is more times than any other chaplain in the history of the department. Chaplain Klee, thank you for joining us today and reminding us of the great power of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I am proud today to have Dr. Mona Hanna- Attisha, the daughter of Iraqi-Amer-ican scientists, the physician who helped expose the Flint water crisis, as my guest at the joint session and the address by the President tonight. Simply put, Dr. Mona, as her pa-tients call her, is a hero. Her persist-ence exposed a terrible manmade crisis that poisoned my hometown, and she has been an incredible partner in the fight for resources to help fix the prob-lems in Flint. Her personal story of coming to America from Iraq reminds us of the many important contribu-tions that immigrants make. In Donald Trump’s world, though, Dr. Mona may not have been there for Flint kids. She is an Iraqi immigrant. In Donald Trump’s world, she would ac-tually have been turned away. She would not have been the hero to thou-sands of Flint families. She is the epitome of what makes America great and what it means to be an American citizen. She stood up for what was right. She exposed the facts in Flint, Michigan. In the face of bul-lying, she spoke truth to power, and she persisted. She is a hero. She is what makes this country great. She is what is good about the United States of America—an immigrant to this country who stood for the people of my hometown. She is a message, and her presence here today is intended to send a mes-sage to the President of the United States and to the rest of the country that that is what makes America great. She adds to the fabric of this country, and I am grateful to have her here today.

REVOKE PASSPORTS OF THOSE WHO JOIN FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, over 260 Americans have traveled to Iraq and Syria to fight for known foreign terrorist organizations. When they re-turn back to America, they are not coming back to open up coffee shops. They are coming back to do mischief against us. The most important job of govern-ment is to protect the citizens. That is why my colleague, B
ILLKEATING , and I have introduced the Foreign Terrorist Organization Passport Revocation Act. It directs the Secretary of State to re-voke passports of those Americans who have joined foreign terrorist organiza-tions. They are still citizens, but they cannot travel back to the United States or to any other country. The only way they come back to the United States is under arrest by law enforce-ment in handcuffs. This is a bipartisan bill that will stop these Benedict Arnolds from coming back at all. If someone takes arms up with our enemies, that person deserves to be treated like an enemy. And that is just the way it is. f 
WELCOMING BRUCE BAILLIE TO THE JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, when you come in to Bremerton, Washington, on the ferry, you see one of my favorite sights. It is Building 460 of the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and it says on the side of the building: ‘‘Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Building on a Proud Tradition.’’ Puget Sound Naval Ship-yard is far and away the largest em-ployer in the region I represent, and these are men and women who take great pride in their work and have done so for over 125 years. They are also critical to the success of our Navy’s national security mis-sion, but too often in this town, they don’t get the respect they deserve. That is why my guest this evening is Bruce Baillie with the Bremerton Building and Metal Trades Council. Bruce is a local leader for our shipyard workers, and I want to make sure that this new administration understands how important this workforce is to our country. These are not just talented profes-sionals. They have been amazing part-ners in putting together an action agenda for shipyard workers that we introduced last week: exempting our shipyard workers from the hiring freeze which is critical to our Nation’s security, making sure that retired servicemembers—our veterans—are able to secure jobs in our Defense De-partment, and halting policies that lower the compensation of defense workers—changes in per diem and over-time policies that affect their take- home pay. It is important that we have the backs of these vital workers, and that is why I have invited Bruce Baillie as my guest this evening.

RARE DISEASE WEEK ON CAPITOL HILL (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week marks Rare Disease Week on the Hill. Many Mem-bers of this House will meet with pa-tients, caregivers, physicians, family members, and advocates from across the country about how their lives are impacted by disease. The National Institutes of Health considers a disease rare if it affects fewer than 200,000 people across the United States. Many times the disease is accompanied by uncommon or mis-matched symptoms that make diag-nosing the illness difficult, and many times such illnesses are without a cure. Mr. Speaker, before I came to Con-gress, I was a healthcare professional, and I have seen firsthand how dev-astating a disease or injury can be to an individual and to families. I welcome the rare disease commu-nity to Washington this week, and I look forward to meeting with Rep-resentatives from the Fifth District of Pennsylvania, including Tom Weiser, James and Jean Rickard from Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. Education can help shape healthcare policy, Mr. Speaker, to better meet the needs of the rare disease community, and I am pleased to be a part of that conversation. f 
DONALD TRUMP AND VLADIMIR PUTIN (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, last week I hosted a dozen of con-stituent events in my district. At every turn, families asked the same question: When will Congress investigate the President’s involvement with Russia? I have received many calls and e- mails about Russia for weeks. The American people are deeply and rightly concerned with this administration’s involvement with the Putin regime. We know the President’s hand-picked na-tional security adviser was forced to resign over his communications with Russia. We know that if Moscow did in-deed influence our free elections, we have a duty to stand up against those threats and not sweep them under the rug. We do not support Putin’s human rights record, his treatment of journal-ists, or his invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, where my grandmother was born. So why is the people’s House pro-tecting Vladimir Putin? Why are we not standing up to President Trump and investigating his dealings with the Putin regime? What are we afraid of? To my colleagues on the House Over-sight and Government Reform Com-mittee, what are you afraid we will find out if we investigate? Mr. Speaker, when are we going to get answers for the American people? Lastly, I welcome Chicago WVON’s Matt McGill and Planned Parenthood’s Donna Miller to tonight’s joint session.

E PLURIBUS UNUM (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, what a wonderful country that we live in. It is wonderful because we have come—maybe some because of the Statue of Liberty’s wonderful words or others who have come in different ways, we are different, but we are one. Tonight in his message, wouldn’t it be well to focus on our unity and not our divisiveness? Since the election, there have been 1,000 hate crimes. And, of course, in the last 72 hours to last week, two Indo Americans—Indians—engineers, one dead, one shot. And the perpetrator in-dicated in his words: I shot two Middle Easterners. What kind of hate is being generated? It has been generated, and it needs to cease. We need to have a speech to-night that will speak to the unity, speak against anti-Semitism and the attacks that are going on the Jewish community. We need to recognize the distinctions and the differences. We need to stop the siege against His-panics, mass deportation, African- American discrimination and others, women and many others. This needs to be a time of unity, re-spect, and dignity. I will be waiting to hear and to see what kind of America are we going to be guided by and what kind of America will we live in? I hope for the best.

ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, health care is important to every family in America. The Afford-able Care Act increased access to health care for about 20 million Ameri-cans. Is the Affordable Care Act perfect? No bill that has ever been debated on this floor and passed is perfect. Let’s make our goal not to have any-one who received access to health care to lose it. We need to make it better and to guarantee access to quality health care for all Americans. America can do better.

PRESIDENT TRUMP NEEDS TO WORK WITH ALL PEOPLE (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I have long prided myself on working across the aisle to get things done for my con-stituents and all the American people. That is what the American people want: a government that grapples with tough issues in a constructive way. Unfortunately, since January 20, the new administration has shown no in-terest in working with the Congress on both sides to tackle problems, includ-ing Russia’s unlawful interference in last year’s election. That is why I de-cided not to stand on the aisle in the House Chamber to shake the Presi-dent’s hand during the joint session of Congress, as I have done in the past through Democratic and Republican administrations alike. This will be the first time during my 29 years in this House I have made this decision. I have deep respect for the Presi-dency, and I will attend the joint ses-sion, but that respect between the branches must be mutual. The Presi-dent has attacked the free press by calling it the enemy of the people. He has rejected America’s traditional role welcoming refugees who have helped to make our country great. He has cozied up to Vladimir Putin, the strongman who attacks our democracy. He has moved to gut the Affordable Care Act. He has looked the other way when threats against the Jewish community have increased in the recent year. This isn’t part of our normal polit-ical discourse. This goes beyond ideo-logical and political differences. The President needs to work with all peo-ple. Therefore, I will listen to what he has to say today, but I will not greet him and shake his hand. f

chairman and ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Com-mittee. The rule also provides for a mo-tion to recommit for both pieces of un-derlying legislation. Additionally, the rule makes in order 12 amendments—11 from our friends across the aisle—to the SCRUB Act. Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from Chairman C
HAFFETZ and Congressman C ART-
WRIGHT on behalf of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Congressmen B
YRNE and C OURTNEY on behalf of the Education and the Work-force Committee. Both pieces of legislation before us today take steps to remove unneces-sary burdens that the government has levied on hardworking Americans from coast to coast. The regulatory burden in this country is staggering. In fact, the Code of Federal Regulations spans more than 178,000 pages and contains more than 1 million regulatory restric-tions. Let’s let that sink in for just a mo-ment, Mr. Speaker. Let’s think about that for a second. 178,000 pages and over 1 million regulatory restrictions. An average of nearly 12,000 new restric-tions are added each year. Let me be clear. Some regulations are necessary. They are completely what we need to have. I don’t believe that all regulation is bad. So before we go down that path, let me just say that this is a fact, and we can continue this. I believe we need clean air, clean water, smart standards for how we han-dle nuclear energy, and worker protec-tions, just to name a few. I also believe that we have allowed the regulatory scheme to run amok. Congress has ceded power to agencies, which have implemented more and more regula-tions, oftentimes with less and less benefit to Americans. Far too many regulations offer our citizens minimal benefits at con-founding cost. Taxpayers and busi-nesses alike are withering under regu-lations that are outdated, irrelevant, and nonsensical. Do we really need a regulation to mandate what kind of latch a baker uses on a flour bin? Do we really want to tell people that their dishwashers are forbidden to use enough water to actually clean their dishes, forcing them to wash their dishes twice rather than it actually conserving water? Unfortunately, these stories aren’t works of fiction. They are real regula-tions put in place by Federal agencies. We have to take steps to restore com-mon sense to the regulatory process and clean up the regulation roster. It is time we identify and abolish those regulations that are pointless, those that prevent people from doing their jobs, and those that are ineffi-cient and ineffective. The SCRUB Act, Mr. Speaker, takes steps to do just that and contributes to our efforts to rein in overregulation. The SCRUB Act, introduced by my friend from Missouri, Congressman JASON SMITH, establishes a bipartisan Retrospective Regulatory Review Com-mission to identify unnecessary rules that are hindering economic growth. The commission will then identify which rules need to be repealed imme-diately and which ones can be ad-dressed by more flexible procedures outlined in the legislation. The commission will report these findings to Congress, and Congress can then vote on these recommendations and take steps either to begin imme-diately repealing regulations or imple-menting a CutGo process. Importantly, the commission created by the SCRUB Act will also ensure that redundant regulations from dif-ferent agencies will be reviewed. Cur-rently, agencies implement their direc-tives absent a systemwide view, mean-ing that overlapping and even con-flicting regulations are enacted far too often. From conversations with my con-stituents in northeast Georgia, I have witnessed how overregulation is sti-fling growth in our communities. The remedy for this economic anemia is to get unnecessary regulations off the books and, instead, focus on enforcing regulations that are actually achieving benefits for our neighbors. The second piece of legislation that this rule provides for also returns us to reasonable policies that reinstate the spirit of the law. H.J. Res. 83, intro-duced by my fellow Rules Committee member, Congressman B
YRNE from Alabama, utilizes the Congressional Review Act to overturn a rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Ad-ministration, or OSHA. Worker protections are critically im-portant, yet they lose their purpose when they fail to protect workers and jobs effectively. Too often, OSHA for-gets that mission, and the rule we are talking about today is the latest exam-ple of misguided regulatory zeal. In the waning days of the previous administration, OSHA put forth a final rule implementing punitive standards on employers, a move that contradicts the underlying statute. Under the law, employers are required to record and maintain logs of workplace injuries and illnesses that occur during a 5-year period; however, the employers can only be cited for recordkeeping viola-tions within a 6-month time period. Now, think about what was just said here. They have to keep it for 5 years, but they can only be cited for viola-tions within a 6-month time period. This arrangement is constructive. Logs should be kept up to date so that businesses can make informed deci-sions about health and safety in the workplace. This requirement encour-ages businesses to improve safety measures in a timely manner. However, the previous administration decided to rewrite the law through regulation in a way that penalizes and burdens small businesses without achieving meaning-ful benefit. OSHA finalized a rule that would extend the threat of penalty for recordkeeping violations up to 5 years. Aside from ignoring existing law and court decisions that directly contradict this new regulation, OSHA has chosen to punish small businesses for paper-work violations rather than focusing resources on improving worker safety. We can agree that keeping our work-places safe is nonnegotiable, but OSHA has repeatedly overstepped its mission in order to collect fines and apply op-pressive rules at the expense of oppor-tunities to cultivate healthier working conditions. It is time to bring this reg-ulatory mischief to an end, which is why I am glad to see this resolution of disapproval to overturn the most re-cent OSHA overstep. Mr. Speaker, both the SCRUB Act and the resolution of disapproval pro-vided for by this rule take common-sense steps to unlock the regulatory shackles Federal agencies have put on our economy and taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, my friend, for yielding me the cus-tomary 30 minutes for debate. Mr. Speaker, I rise to debate the rule for consideration. As my friend across the aisle has already noted, this rule bundles together two unrelated pieces of legislation. We are developing a pat-tern here of doing that in the Rules Committee. The first of these is H.J. Res. 83, a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval that seeks to overturn a Department of Labor rule on workplace injuries, undermining workplace safety and health in the process. The second measure is H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act, which establishes a new commission to review Federal regula-tions with the aim of needlessly politi-cizing and, thereby, undermining the regulatory framework that keeps our air clean and our water safe to drink. I note that my friend on the other side of the aisle did not mention that this commission will cost $30 million for work that last night’s presenter at the Rules Committee said that Con-gress can do, the argument being that Congress doesn’t have enough staff so we are going to send it over to nine people and pay $30 million, starting, to have them do the work that we in Con-gress should be doing. Beginning with the CRA resolution— the 14th such resolution considered by the House this month—the Republican leadership is continuing its onslaught against well-thought-out and measured regulations. I get it. Republicans con-trol the House, the Senate, and the White House. They are desperately try-ing to ram through their priorities be-fore anyone notices what they are doing. It is interesting to me, Mr. Speaker, where the Republican majority has fo-cused its attention throughout the past month. I can’t help but notice that 40 days into Donald John Trump’s admin-istration, he has not put forth one sin-gle jobs measure. Democrats, on the

other hand, continue to talk about the need for good, well-paying jobs. The United States Senate put out the Democrats’ trillion-dollar jobs plan that anybody can read on their website on where we stand when it comes to well-paying jobs. Yet, as we advocate for our plan to rebuild our Nation’s infrastructure and create over 15 million jobs in the proc-ess, Republicans pass measures to drug-test applicants for unemployment insurance and repeal rules that require Federal contractors to disclose viola-tions of Federal labor and worker safe-ty laws. This resolution repeals a Department of Labor rule pertaining to the Occupa-tional Safety and Health Administra-tion. The rule in question requires em-ployers to keep and maintain accurate records of every recordable injury and illness in federally mandated logs for a period of 5 years. It is worth mentioning that this pol-icy has been upheld in cases dating back to 1993. The rule, when imple-mented, added zero new compliance ob-ligations, zero new reporting obliga-tions, and cost a total of—you guessed it—zero dollars. Yet, once again, this is what we are spending our time on this week: repealing a thoughtful rule de-signed to protect workers. I am particularly concerned by this resolution as it actually jeopardizes workplace safety by allowing employ-ers to avoid penalties for the under-reporting of injuries over many years. Longstanding workplace hazards will and can certainly be masked. b1230 This makes it less likely that em-ployers or employees will take correc-tive actions or that OSHA will find the hazards when they do an inspection, leaving workers in danger. It is also worth noting that due to its very small budget, OSHA is only able to inspect a workplace, on average, once every 140 years. You heard me correctly, once every 140 years. That makes data even more important. Yet, by diminishing the reliability of a worksite’s injury data, which some em-ployers systematically underreport, this resolution also takes away OSHA’s ability to protect workers from the most significant hazards. Mr. Speaker, throughout the past week, concerned Americans attended town halls across the country, and for those who were actually able to meet with their Republican representative in Congress, the conversations focused on protecting health care, creating jobs, and protecting the environment. At these meetings, constituents did not ask for fewer workplace protections, they did not ask for Congress to act to make it easier for people with severe mental illness to purchase guns, they didn’t ask for Congress to ease disclo-sure requirements for oil companies making payments to foreign govern-ments, and yet these are the things the Republican majority has already cho-sen to focus on this month. Watching the news, I did not hear one person say: if only Congress would repeal anticorruption rules, undermine my retirement security, and then allow endangered animals on national wild-life refuges to be killed using inhu-mane methods, if only Congress would do these things, my life would be bet-ter. Not one person, Mr. Speaker. Yet, in the past month, the House voted to do all of the things that I just men-tioned. I submit to the American peo-ple watching at home right now that this is the face of today’s Republican Party. Tell me who you think is really on your side. Turning our attention to the SCRUB Act, this bill would establish a $30 mil-lion commission with unlimited sub-poena authority that is empowered to dismantle long-established, science- based public health and safety stand-ards. The SCRUB Act would undermine the ability of agencies to react to im-mediate public health threats by adopting the regulatory CutGo process. The CutGo system is, in my opinion, completely detached from reality. This requirement will prohibit agencies from issuing any new rules, even in the case of emergencies or imminent harm to the public, until they repeal an ex-isting rule to offset the cost. Along with bills that have already come to the House floor under this Republican Congress, as well as Donald Trump’s executive actions mandating a regu-latory freeze, this legislation dem-onstrates a continued attack on stand-ards set in place to protect American families. I guess it is not all that surprising that my Republican friends are pushing through legislation that prioritizes corporate profit over health and safety of the American people. Whether it is denying access to women’s health care or rolling back environmental protec-tions, Republicans are making it clear where their allegiances lie. For a party that prides itself on being anti-red tape, the SCRUB Act strangely dupli-cates existing requirements to conduct retrospective reviews of rules, rules on top of rules on top of rules. Our regu-latory system should work for all American families and encourage com-panies to run safe, forward-thinking businesses. This legislation would move us in the opposite direction. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I enjoy coming down here. I love being a part of debating and coming here to the floor. My friend from Florida and I do that quite regu-larly in the Committee on Rules, and it is a good thing. He has brought up a lot of bills over the last month. He listed out a list of horribles that was all dis-cussed on this floor. I would encourage everyone to go back and look at the other side, as Paul Harvey used to say, and the rest of the story. So for all the list of horribles, Mr. Speaker, we also need to balance on the votes that were cast on this floor and the debate had on this floor was not a one-sided affair. It was two, and the applicants were going. The other thing that just struck me, Mr. Speaker, was this, especially deal-ing with the CRA, the records. It was interesting to see that this was a care-fully thought-out proposal. It was not a carefully thought-out proposal. It was a reaction to a 2012 court case, the Volks case, in which the three D.C. Ap-pellate Court judges, including Hender-son, Brown, and Garland, said: OSHA, you can’t do this, you can’t go back and maintain the records and then only be able—what the law actually says is, punish within 6 months of this. So this is not long and thought out. It was a way, as was established in the Volks case, actually the case said: ‘‘We do not believe Congress’’—these were the judges speaking—‘‘expressly estab-lished a statute of limitations only to implicitly encourage the Secretary to ignore it.’’ So this goes back to the heart, Mr. Speaker. If we are wanting to discuss the face of a Republican majority that is listening to the Constitution and the American people saying we need relief from some of these regulatory burdens in which good people—I will never not state that good people work in these agencies, but when you give good peo-ple a job, and you tell them to go do something and to sit in their cubicles or sit in their offices and say how can I come up with more regulatory, they are going to do it. Americans are the best workers in the world. They are going to use their talents. The problem is when you put them in a position in which many times their talents do not equal what is happening in the real world. Mr. Speaker, you have seen that in your State. I have seen that in my State. In fact, we have seen it in Florida, as well, and other States. It is simply bringing us back to commonsense reasoning in this in say-ing why, when you cannot by law pun-ish this, why are you keeping it? The court actually also made an in-teresting statement as well in this, and in one of the footnotes it said: ‘‘That OSHA did not cite Volks for a failure to retain injury records when that is the only conduct for which the statute of limitations would not have clearly expired suggests that OSHA had, at some point, correctly understood that an unmade record cannot be said to have not been retained and that an em-ployer’s obligations with respect to making and keeping records are dis-tinct.’’ The idea that you are somehow going to harm recordkeeping here—which is a separate violation, by the way, which has nothing to do with the keeping of the records 5 years, let’s at least get this process straight here. If you do not, as an employer, record workplace injuries and record these incidents, you are in an issue there. You are violating the law there. So let’s look at this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH1366 February 28, 2017 
OSHA has a great place. It should be the teaching arm. It should be the en-couraging arm for every employer to look to for best practices and standards on how to do what I believe every em-ployer here inherently gets up every morning wanting to do. They do not want to have a workforce that is hurt, maimed, or put at risk in their jobs every day. Instead, OSHA has morphed, over time, and this body is partially to blame. It has morphed into something that, frankly, has left its Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It has become punitive. It has become a way of not being helpful, but yet actu-ally hurtful in the marketplace. So as we look at this, as we talk about this—and I appreciate my friend from Florida, and he makes a good case for his side—I am going to simply make the case for our side that when you look at regulatory burdens that shouldn’t be there, when you are look-ing at it, as we just talked about, where every regulatory burden does not come down to clean air and clean water. Every regulatory burden we talk about does not come down to clean water, clean air, or working on airplanes or anything else. There are some that just simply are in the way in business. Like I mentioned earlier in my talk concerning how the linchpin on a baker’s can actually should work. Really, Mr. Speaker? So in this issue, let’s continue to move how we are, let’s continue to put forward commonsense regulations. We can disagree, and that is why that vote total on that board will show up in just a little while. But at the end of the day, who is on your side? It is the Re-publican majority who says: let’s get to work safely, helpful, let’s make sure everybody has the opportunity to con-tinue to do what they intended to do, but do so in a sense that makes sense and doesn’t continue to be punitive. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the passion of my friend from Georgia. I would suggest to him that I am amused that he would get in the weeds in a rather substantial legal opinion. A portion of it he correctly cited, but he omitted the continuing part of the judge’s remarks that said that, indeed, you could go back and put forth a resolution. I find it particularly amusing that my friends on the other side, after not granting that judge a hearing so that he could become a Supreme Court Jus-tice, now want to say what a great judge he is and what a great amount of work he does. Shame on everyone who did not give him an appropriate hear-ing. But I understand what it is to steal a Justice of the Supreme Court, and that is what my friends on the Re-publican side did. This judge’s opinion continued on to say that you could es-tablish regulations. Mr. Speaker, up until now, every President since Gerald Ford has dis-closed his tax return information. These returns have provided a basic level of transparency that has helped to ensure the public’s interest is placed first. The American people deserve the same level of disclosure from Donald John Trump. If they continue to refuse to provide it, it is incumbent upon us, as the people’s elected representatives, to hold the executive branch account-able. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-vious question, I will offer an amend-ment to the rule to bring Representa-tive A
NNAESHOO ’s bill which would re-quire Presidents and major party nomi-nees for the Presidency to release their tax returns. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-sent to insert the text of my amend-ment in the R
ECORD , along with extra-neous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the distinguished gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. E
SHOO ), my good friend and classmate, to discuss our proposal. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. H
AS-
TINGS ), my friend, classmate, and won-derful colleague, for yielding time to me. I rise today in opposition to the rule and the underlying bills. I urge my col-leagues to defeat the previous question so that this bipartisan bill that I have written, the Presidential Tax Trans-parency Act, can be made in order for immediate floor debate and a vote. The Presidential Tax Transparency Act would require the President and all future Presidents and Presidential nominees of the major parties, Demo-crats and Republicans, to publicly dis-close their tax returns. It came as a surprise to many Americans, during the 2016 campaign, that this disclosure was not required by law. Instead, we have had a tradition of voluntary dis-closure among every President of both parties since the post-Watergate era. Until now, our Presidents have recog-nized that those who seek or hold the most powerful office in the world should be held to the highest standard of transparency. Donald Trump is the first President to refuse to release his tax returns since Gerald Ford, a man of the House. I remember when his remains were brought to the Capitol where he rested in the rotunda but came by the doors of the House. He was a man of the House and a man of integrity. b1245 He along with a host of others, Democrats and Republicans, volun-tarily released their tax returns. But Mr. Trump’s 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission shows that he has 564 financial posi-tions in companies located both in the United States and around the world, including relationships with state-af-filiated businesses in several countries. Why is this important to note? The President had an opportunity to re-solve these potential conflicts of inter-est by divesting and placing his busi-ness assets into a true blind trust, as other Presidents have done, Repub-licans and Democrats. Instead, he chose to turn over control of his busi-ness to his sons in an arrangement that the Director of the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics called ‘‘wholly inadequate’’ and ‘‘meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective.’’ Since he is taken office, these ethics con-cerns have been borne out in the form of his and his campaign’s connections to Russia, deeply, deeply troubling to all of us and to the American people, legitimately so; his family’s potential new business dealings in the Domini-can Republic and Uruguay; and the hir-ing of a ‘‘director of diplomatic sales’’ at his Washington, D.C., hotel to at-tract high-priced business among for-eign diplomats. This is deeply unset-tling, to say the least. Simply put, the President’s business empire makes him more susceptible to conflicts of interest than any other President in the history of our coun-try. Three of the President’s nominees have already withdrawn their names from consideration due to potential fi-nancial conflicts of interest. Only a full release of the President’s tax re-turns will provide the public with clear information as to his potential con-flicts of interest and his potential en-tanglements with foreign governments and foreign businesses. Last night, here on the floor, the House voted along party lines, unfortu-nately, to block an effort to obtain the President’s tax returns under the House’s existing authority. Today, we have another chance to honor the will of the American people and write this important disclosure tradition into law—into law. According to a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, 74 percent of Americans believe the President should release his tax returns—74 percent. The top petition on the White House website has over 1 million signatures to it, calling on the President to re-lease his tax returns. I think the voice of the people, the American people, is clear. As their rep-resentatives, they deserve to have us take action on this because we all want a conflict of interest-free President. I urge my colleagues to reject the previous question so we can hold an immediate vote on the Presidential Tax Transparency Act. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As my friend from Florida just said, I think we can sum it up very easily right here on this discussion. And, no, I did not choose not to continue the other quotes in the ruling which were, again, pretty amazing. I will just say

this. The reason is because I was saving it for now. They said: Well, you can go ahead and do a new regulation you can make them keep for 5 years. But as an Old Scripture taught me years ago: all things may be lawful, but not all things are profitable. You can do some things, but, in the end, are they really getting at the end result of what OSHA is supposed to do? Are you protecting employers and employees? Are you making the workplace safer? And right here, we are just not seeing that. I think what is also interesting as we look at this is let’s just have common sense in this. You still cannot punish up to 6 months. The court actually even said also, as well, as much the same on page 13 of their opinion. I think what we have to look at here is, in looking at this, let’s talk about the issues of common sense; let’s talk about regulatory burden that works in-stead of regulatory burden that does not. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This evening, Donald John Trump will address a joint session of Congress. I expect we will hear some version of the same message we have heard throughout the first month of his cha-otic administration—talk of jobs and American workers and protecting our country—but that is all it has been up to now, just talk. Instead of actually doing any of those things, Republicans are sowing chaos trying to turn their absurd campaign speeches into some-thing that resembles policy; and, frankly, that just will not fly. Donald John Trump’s campaign rhet-oric doesn’t fit the actual challenges of governing, and I believe my friends on the other side of the aisle are starting to come to this realization. If they haven’t, may I urge upon them that the rubber is going to hit the road with the debt ceiling and with tax reform and with repeal and replace of the Afford-able Care Act. I ask the American pub-lic to watch the divisions on the other side when the rubber hits the road. Mr. Speaker, with every action they take, reality and facts keep stopping them in their tracks. The un-American Muslim ban was put in check by the ju-dicial branch. Their attempts to repeal ObamaCare have been checked by their own constituents at their own town-halls. The majority needs to wake up and realize that these are not sound policies, but reckless chaos. It is past time for the majority to get serious about the serious business of governing. And yet, with these meas-ures here today, all we continue to see are antiworker, antienvironment, and, in the final analysis, anti-American proposals. The American people want solutions, not a governing party that just checks the box of unrealistic, cha-otic, and harmful campaign promises. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule and the underlying measure. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As we come to the close of this time of rule debate, I think we have laid this out. I think, again, it is very clear, Mr. Speaker, what we determine and what we go forward with in the process. As we move forward, it is interesting to me—and I would be, too, if I were in the minority and didn’t really have a plan except the one that has been tear-ing up the health insurance market, that has been hurting others. And now as we look to actually make movement on a replacement and repeal of that, I would say that I would watch for divi-sions. I would watch for cracks and the fissures. I would do whatever I could. But the truth of the matter is that, over the next month, in this body, we are going to move forward with what we have said we are going to do. We are going to be working on those aspects. We are going to be bringing it to the floor, and the American people can make the judgment for themselves. People will continue to discuss. It is healthy in our country to have that discussion. It is healthy that we move forward. It is also healthy we examine all of the facts. This rule today, though, simply deals with common sense. Let’s look at our regulatory burden. Let’s look at issues that—again, it is one thing to look at a rule that is there for protection. Workplace safety is enhanced by mak-ing you record what is going on and making you be able to then correct what may be a problem in your busi-ness. But simply keeping records for 5 years when you can’t be punished but for 6 months of those is simply putting a burden on business to keep records that are really at the end of the day not accomplishing your bottom line. It goes back to what I said earlier, Mr. Speaker. I believe that OSHA is a valuable organization when doing what it is supposed to be doing: protecting workplace safety, doing things that ac-tually matter, doing things that actu-ally help. But many times in my busi-nesses that I go to, they have put in rules over the years that say that we are now in a continuing violation. In other words, if one time they come in and they say that an electrical out-let is not plugged in properly to an ex-tension cord, you fix that. When they come back 2 or 3 months later and see something on the other side of the building that deals with electrical, then they will say, well, it is a con-tinuing violation, not the violation previous, and they triple the fines. OSHA now, and the good folks who work there, I believe, truly want to help. They truly have set out best prac-tices. But they have grown to the point where we have allowed them to become not the help that they should be, but are basically and many times a hin-drance and a menace to our businesses, from the farms to the factories, to the coal mines, all that. It has just gotten out of hand. So my discussion, Mr. Speaker, is this. How do you get regulatory burden that actually makes sense? We are not going to stand here and argue over a rule that makes sense. I will never sit here and say that we should not record workplace injuries and let businessowners then be fined if they are doing something wrong. We will never argue about that. But when it comes to the point of ex-cessive recordkeeping that, at the end of the day, does nothing except burden the business, how do you explain that as helping workplace safety? If my son is in the pool and can’t get to the side and I do nothing, I can have great in-tentions; but unless I get in and bring him to the side, then I have actually done something. A rule that has no end result to the bottom line of what you are doing is simply waving and saying, ‘‘Oh, I am doing something,’’ instead of getting back to the purpose that OSHA should be about. When businesses and OSHA cannot work together collaboratively to seek and to set a process in which businesses are safer and employees are healthier, then OSHA is failing and they have become punitive in nature. Why don’t they come in and help businesses? Why don’t they come in and start? And if there is a business that continues the process of being bad actors in the marketplace, then take them out, fine them, do what you need to do. But I, myself, believe that most businessowners—and I was one at one point—that we don’t go in every day wanting to hurt employees. We don’t want to do that. We want to have a safe workplace that presents a good prod-uct, that presents a good service, that presents the activity that continues our economic engine. Let’s quit defending rules that don’t work. Let’s quit wasting time defend-ing rules and having our agencies in this city determine that all they want to do is generate rules because that is their job description. Let’s see the things that actually work. If they want to be policy experts, then let them run for office. But if you are going to at least look at it, do it by the law. Mr. Speaker, these rules before us today provide two very important bills that take steps to get our economic en-gine going again. They do, as we have talked about, look at unnecessary rules. They look at things that need to be examined. But we also can’t simply pretend ex-isting nonsensical regulations don’t exist, because they are being enforced at the expense of innovators and job creators across the country, and they are being enforced without using any common sense. A case in point, did you know that trains have to have an F painted on the front of them so that people can tell which end is the front? I don’t know about you, but I believe Americans can tell the front from the back of a train. We have got to identify existing busi-ness regulations like this that are out-dated and simply don’t make sense

EC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consider-ation of the bill (H.R. 305) to amend the Eth-ics in Government Act of 1978 to require the disclosure of certain tax returns by Presi-dents and certain candidates for the office of the President, and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consider-ation of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not ex-ceed one hour equally divided among and controlled by the respective chairs and rank-ing minority members of the Committees on Ways and Means and Oversight and Govern-ment Reform. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the con-clusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and re-port the bill to the House with such amend-ments as may have been adopted. The pre-vious question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without in-structions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no reso-lution on the bill, then on the next legisla-tive day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. S
EC. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 305. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT I
TREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against or-dering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), de-scribes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject be-fore the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the de-mand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party of-fered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitz-gerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy im-plications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Repub-lican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Rep-resentatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Al-though it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member con-trolling the time will not yield for the pur-pose of offering an amendment, the same re-sult may be achieved by voting down the pre-vious question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the pre-vious question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amend-ment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amend-ment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, sec-tion 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon re-jection of the motion for the previous ques-tion on a resolution reported from the Com-mittee on Rules, control shifts to the Mem-ber leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for de-bate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy impli-cations. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican major-ity’s agenda and allows those with alter-native views the opportunity to offer an al-ternative plan. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this question will be post-poned.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their re-marks and include extraneous mate-rials on H.R. 998. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COL-
LINS of Georgia). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to House Resolution 150 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consider-ation of the bill, H.R. 998. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. P

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 998) to provide for the establishment of a proc-ess for the review of rules and sets of rules, and for other purposes, with Mr. P
ALMER in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Utah (Mr. C
HAFFETZ ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. C
UMMINGS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 998, the Search-ing for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act, also known as the SCRUB Act, was in-troduced by our colleague J
ASON  S
MITH. I happen to be a cosponsor of this bill, as well as the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. G
OODLATTE ), the chair-man of the Committee on the Judici-ary, and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. S
ESSIONS ), the chairman of the Committee on Rules. We rise in sup-port of this bill, the SCRUB Act. Regulatory accumulation is a signifi-cant problem for the Federal Govern-ment. Year after year, Federal agencies add regulation after regulation, piling on to an already very complex and crowded regulatory system. The Code of Federal Regulations, also known as the CFR, has some 178,000 pages. These are the regulations that you are sup-posed to understand if you are in a business—small business, big business, medium-sized business. It contains more than 1 million regulatory restric-tions. Every year the Federal Govern-ment adds, on average, nearly 12,000 new regulations on top of those. The regulatory accumulation has considerable impact upon our economy. According to the Competitive Enter-prise Institute, regulatory compliance hurts economic growth by pulling near-ly $1.8 trillion out of the economy. Regulations are particularly hard on small businesses that don’t have the legal resources and the wherewithal to understand all of the complexities. Many small- and medium-sized busi-nesses will be doing things that they don’t necessarily even know or under-stand could be problematic. There is room for regulation, don’t get me wrong. I am not suggesting there should be no regulation, but we are trying to clean up some of this reg-ulation and weed out the good from the bad. The SCRUB Act will enable the government to do so, and that is why I appreciate our colleague JASON SMITH for championing and bringing this bill to the floor again. The SCRUB Act establishes a bipar-tisan—and I can’t say that enough, a bipartisan—Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission to conduct a com-prehensive review of Federal regula-tion. The commission’s goal is to re-duce regulatory costs to the economy by at least 15 percent. The act charges the commission with identifying outdated, obsolete, and un-necessary regulations in need of repeal or amendment. The commission gives priority to those regulations that are 15 years old and older. I think that is an appropriate direction that they should go. The commission will consist of regu-latory experts chosen on a bipartisan basis and confirmed by the United States Senate. They will take a gov-ernmentwide look at the regulatory system, allowing for impartial and wide-ranging review of outdated and unnecessary regulations. This is not a new or a partisan con-cept. In fact, in 1978, President Jimmy Carter issued an executive order re-quiring agencies to ‘‘periodically re-view their existing regulations to de-termine whether they are achieving the policy goals.’’ In addition, every President since has required some level of retrospective regulatory self-review by those agencies themselves. In fact, it was President Obama who issued three executive orders on regulatory review. He required agencies to develop retrospective review plans and to set priorities for implementing that re-view. The commission is tasked with iden-tifying regulations that ought to be re-pealed or amended. The commission will use commonsense criteria to deter-mine whether regulations are overlaps, duplicates, or just flat-out conflicts with existing regulations. After expe-dited congressional approval, agencies are required to repeal some regulations based on the commission’s rec-ommendations. So you have people who are selected, they are Senate con-firmed, then they bring forward a pack-age that is allowed to be viewed by Congress. Some have said, well, you know, this is excusing Congress from its duties. Quite to the contrary. The committees, Members, everybody should be paying attention to this, but to have a bipar-tisan group go out and look and make a recommendation, then it is up to Congress whether or not to accept it. We need to go through the House, the Senate, and be signed on by the Presi-dent in a bipartisan way because there

will be Members from both sides of the aisle who will be able to appoint mem-bers. Other regulations would be subject to innovative, regulatory CutGo proce-dures. The CutGo process gives agen-cies flexibility on how to prioritize reg-ulatory elimination. It allows agencies to choose which regulations to repeal or amend and at what time. However, new regulations may not be promul-gated until equally costly regulations are repealed. The SCRUB Act gives agencies the direction and momentum needed to im-plement the regulatory reform our economy needs. We all know that regu-lations can improve health and safety; but sometimes, with the best inten-tion, these outdated and excessive reg-ulations hurt our economy and put other people in jeopardy. The accumu-lation over decades is something that should just simply be reviewed. I think it is pretty hard to argue that a review process is unwarranted or unneeded, given the amazing and impactful status that it puts upon those things that are damaging our economy. I again want to thank J
ASON SMITH for his leadership on this issue. I also want to thank Chairman B
OBGOOD-
LATTE and the Judiciary staff for their dedicated work on this, as well as Chairman P
ETESESSIONS for his good work on this. A lot of good people have worked on this. I do support it. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

EARMR. CHAIRMAN : On February 14, 2017, the Committee on Oversight and Govern-ment Reform ordered reported without amendment H.R. 998, the ‘‘Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act of 2017’’ (SCRUB Act) by a vote of 22 to 17. The bill was referred pri-marily to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, with an additional re-ferral to the Committee on the Judiciary. I ask that you allow the Committee on the Judiciary to be discharged from further con-sideration of the bill so that it may be sched-uled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In ad-dition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on the Judiciary rep-resented on the conference committee. Fi-nally, I would be pleased to include this let-ter and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Oversight and Govern-ment Reform, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration, to memo-rialize our understanding. Thank you for your consideration of my request. Sincerely, J

EARCHAIRMAN CHAFFETZ : I write with re-spect to H.R. 998, the ‘‘Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act.’’ As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions within H.R. 998 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by fore-going consideration of H.R. 998 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legisla-tion and that our committee will be appro-priately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appro-priate number of conferees to any House- Senate conference involving this or similar legislation and asks that you support any such request. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 998 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be in-cluded in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 998. Sincerely, B
OBGOODLATTE , Chairman. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposi-tion to this legislation. The SCRUB Act would establish a $30 million com-mission of unelected—and I emphasize that, unelected—bureaucrats to dupli-cate work that agencies are already supposed to be doing. The bill would focus on the costs of regulations while disregarding their benefits and pro-tecting the most vulnerable popu-lations in our country, like the chil-dren in Flint, Michigan. b1430 If there is any doubt about this, one need look no further than the so-called CutGo provision in this bill. That pro-vision would require that, when an agency makes a new rule, it must off-set the cost of that new rule for the re-peal of an existing rule. This applies even if the new rule is in response to an imminent health or safety threat. Agency compliance with this CutGo provision would also be subject to judi-cial review, which prolongs the process even more. This would inevitably re-sult in lengthy delays, as both industry and nonprofit groups routinely file challenges to agency decisions. President Obama has already issued two executive orders to eliminate un-necessary regulations. On January 18, 2011, he issued Executive Order 13563, requiring each agency to implement plans for reviewing existing rules. That executive order requires each agency to: ‘‘periodically review its existing significant regulations to determine whether any such regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or re-pealed.’’ In addition, President Obama issued Executive Order No. 13610 on May 10, 2012, requiring agencies to report twice a year to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs on the status of their review efforts. In November 2014, a report prepared for the Administra-tive Conference of the United States highlighted the impact of these man-dated reviews, concluding: ‘‘Imple-menting President Obama’s executive orders on retrospective review of regu-lations, agencies identified tens of bil-lions of dollars of cost savings and tens of millions of hours of reduced paper-work and reporting requirements through modifications of existing regu-lations.’’ Congress has the authority and cer-tainly the responsibility to conduct oversight to review existing agency rules and to recommend or mandate re-forms, yet this bill would create a new commission, a new commission that would cost taxpayers $30 million to do what agencies and Congress are already supposed to be doing. In addition, the commission’s report to Congress on the rules it recommends repealing would be subject to an up-or- down vote by the Congress. Congress would not be allowed to vote on each regulation individually, and this would usurp the authority of Congress. One of the most troubling aspects of this bill is that it would entrust this unelected commission with extraor-dinary and virtually unlimited author-ity to subpoena witnesses or docu-ments. Section 101(c) of the bill states: ‘‘The commission may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testi-mony of witnesses and the production of any evidence relating to the duties of the commission. The attendance of witnesses and the production of evi-dence may be required from any place within the United States at any des-ignated place of hearing within the United States.’’ Most agency inspectors general do not have such broad authority to com-pel witness testimony. Yet this unelected commission would have this authority. This means that it could compel an individual to testify on any subject. For example, a schoolteacher could be compelled to testify about education rules or a senior citizen could be compelled to testify about Medicare or Social Security rules. This extraordinary subpoena power is espe-cially troubling because the commis-sion’s jurisdiction is limitless. There is no restriction on what regu-lations the commission can review. Three prominent law professors with the Center for Progressive Reform sent a letter opposing an identical bill in the last Congress. The letter said this proposal would: ‘‘create a convoluted,

complex, and potentially very expen-sive new bureaucracy to review exist-ing agency rules and make rec-ommendations for the repeal or weak-ening of those rules with little mean-ingful oversight, transparency, or pub-lic accountability to ensure that these recommendations do not subvert the public interest.’’ In addition, Citizens for Sensible Safeguards, a coalition of more than 150 consumer, labor, and good-govern-ment groups, also oppose the bill. This bill could have dangerous con-sequences for the health and safety of the American public; therefore, I strongly urge every Member to oppose it. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. R
OSS). Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for allowing me this oppor-tunity. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. M
CMORRIS RODGERS ). Mrs. M
CMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, America is home to some of the most creative, innovative, inspirational people imaginable. When empowered, Americans design and build in ways that change the world, and change it for the better. But far too often, our innovators are bogged down by red tape, thanks to a government that thinks it knows bet-ter how to think, how to believe, how to run their businesses, and how to live their lives. It is not only making life more difficult. It costs us nearly $2 trillion a year. That is about $15,000 a family. So we are rolling back these regulations and offering much-needed relief to families and businesses across the country. Thanks to my good friend, Rep-resentative J
ASON SMITH’s leadership, the SCRUB Act provides another pow-erful tool that gives control back to the American people through their Representatives. This bill creates a long, overdue process to identify inef-fective, outdated, and duplicative regu-lations for repeal, with priority being given to the older, major, more expen-sive rules. We made a promise to the American people. Their voice matters in our gov-ernment. We are going to do whatever we can to restore that voice and put it at the center of every decision we make. I am proud of Representative S
MITH’s work to rein in government. I am proud to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. W
ATSON COLE-
MAN), a very distinguished member of our committee. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Chair-man, I thank the ranking member. Mr. Chairman, there are many trou-bling aspects of this bill, but most pressing is that this legislation, with-out clear policy rationale, caters to de-mands of my Republican colleagues to slash existing regulations and muddy the process of passing new ones. Congress already has a responsibility of reviewing existing rules and man-dating reform. Why delegate that to those not elected to do so? This unsettling bill spends millions of taxpayer dollars to create a hand- picked commission to do the job of Congress without accountability. No, thank you. This unelected and unaccountable commission, appointed by the Presi-dent and Congress, would submit regu-latory changes without the oppor-tunity to amend the measure, taking regulatory review out of the hands of the agency experts. This is counter-productive and an insult to the demo-cratic process. To add insult to injury, this bill makes the regulatory process trans-actional. By forcing agencies to repeal regula-tions in order to adopt a new one, we risk public health and safety. Why have they prioritized costs over benefit? Why are American lives on the chopping block? I urge my colleagues to vote no against this bill. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SMITH). Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chair-man, on January 20, America witnessed the end of the most regulation-happy Presidency in American history. Under the Obama administration, the pages of the Code of Federal Regulations reached the highest level in the history of our country. The Obama administration issued 3,037 finalized regulations, which means almost two new regulations were added each and every day on American farmers, families, and small- business owners. Regulations from the last administration alone cost tax-payers $873 billion. That is a burden of over $12 million an hour added by the Obama White House on the American taxpayer. Back home in Missouri alone, the cost of complying with regu-lations just added by the Obama ad-ministration totaled $19 billion, which is equal to over $9,000 in costs per per-son. Regulations written by unelected bureaucrats in Washington are suffo-cating the very farmers and small-busi-ness owners who we need to hire and expand in order to get full workforce participation. Today, we are considering a solution to this problem with the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Un-necessarily Burdensome Act, otherwise known as the SCRUB Act. The SCRUB Act’s objective is to reduce the overall cost of regulations by at least 15 per-cent. With the passage of the SCRUB Act today, we are simply putting the tools in place to support what President Trump has already started. During his first full week in office, President Trump authored an executive order for the purpose of reducing regulation and controlling regulatory costs. The order is simple. For every new proposed regu-lation, two existing ones must be taken off the books. This order will help prioritize regulations truly in the best interest of the American people and re-move ones that are outdated, burden-some, and costly. And just last week, the President began a regulatory review task force to review existing regulations. The SCRUB Act mirrors and supports the President’s actions, ensuring that our regulatory burdens never again reach the heights that they are today. The SCRUB Act makes sure that farmers, small-business owners, and families impacted by Washington regu-lators have a seat at the table in prioritizing which ones the Trump White House should remove. We must help the President put an end to the Washington-knows-best mentality that has polluted our Nation’s Capital and plagued the American people for the past 8 years. Many of you voted in favor of this legislation last Congress. However, with this new administration, the American people are calling for us to change the way things are done in Washington. So it is my hope that you will join me once again in helping put an end to the Washington regulatory machine. I also call on my colleagues on the other side of the Capitol, who seem lately more bent on obstruction, to re-evaluate why their districts and States sent them to Washington. I am hopeful they will consider supporting the legis-lation, policies, laws, and nominations that will help alleviate the burden of an oversized Federal Government. With the SCRUB Act, we have a real oppor-tunity to shrink the size of government and get Washington off the backs of the American people. I want to thank Chairman C
HAFFETZ  and Chairman G
OODLATTE for bringing this bill up today, and I urge my col-leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the SCRUB Act. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. S
PEIER ). Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, a great leader in our Congress, and some-one who I admire greatly. The only thing clever about this bill is the title. Everything else about this bill is truly diabolical. The SCRUB Act isn’t going to clean anything up. Its toxic suds will just make people sicker, our environment dirtier, and our prod-ucts more dangerous. Creating an unelected commission to oversee the entire regulatory policy of the United States is undemocratic and unimaginably damaging. Essentially, five people appointed by the President

would be able to sacrifice the health and safety of the American public to the altar of big business. b1445 Say good-bye to protections from big banks, big polluters, and big pharma-ceutical companies; and hello to finan-cial ruin, environmental destruction, and unsafe food and drugs. These Presidential pawns would also have unlimited subpoena power. Now, think about this: they are going to have more subpoena power than the in-spectors general in this country. Also, the SCRUB Act’s senseless and dangerous regulatory cut-go process would force agencies to choose between maintaining existing protections and responding to new threats to our health and safety. For example, in order to clean up the air, an agency might have to allow a corporation to pollute our drinking water. Talk about death panels—this, my friends, is a death panel. The only thing the SCRUB Act washes away is commonsense governance. This is a di-abolical bill; and this, my friends, is what being drunk with power delivers. Mr. ROSS. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. F
ARENTHOLD ). Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, you know what? We have got over 1 million pages of regulations. We have got so many laws nobody could pos-sibly know them. I would venture to say there are very few people today who can’t go a day without violating some law or some regulation. It has gotten too complex. Nobody wants a dirty environment. Nobody wants dirty water, but we need a reasonable amount of regulation that we can understand, that we can follow, and that will protect America and cre-ate jobs. The SCRUB Act creates a commis-sion that comes back to Congress with recommendations of what to get rid of. You know what? I would like to do it all here in Congress, too, but we sure face a lot of obstruction in getting things done here. It doesn’t move fast here. Let’s get a commission to do the basic work. Let’s bring it back to Con-gress, and let us decide and let us get rid of regulations. Let’s make the agencies pick and choose which regula-tions that they think are important, and they will do it. This is commonsense legislation to get the regulatory state under control, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. The SCRUB Act poses real and sig-nificant dangers to the health and wel-fare of the American public. By focus-ing predominantly on the cost of the rules, the SCRUB Act’s CutGo provi-sion will repeal rules with little regard for how they benefit and protect the American people. The commission’s virtually unlim-ited authority to subpoena witnesses or documents, combined with its uncircumscribed ability to review and recommend repeal of any current rules, is an extraordinary grant of power that could have tragic repercussions for the health and safety of the American peo-ple. The SCRUB Act is a waste of $30 mil-lion of hard-earned taxpayer money for work that is already being done by Federal agencies. I strongly urge every Member to op-pose this act. Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Madam Chair, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. You know, some time ago, when I first got involved in this political proc-essing, I made it known that I felt that the silent killer of American business was the regulatory regime that we have in place, where over 50 years this Congress has ceded its authority to unelectable, unaccountable bureau-crats. Today we have 175,000 pages in the Code of Federal Register that is evidence of that. It is time that we, as a Congress, on behalf of our constitu-ency, on behalf of the future well-being of this country, take back that author-ity with oversight and accountability through this SCRUB Act. It has been said that there is approxi-mately, on average, $20,000 a year per employee of a manufacturer that is at-tributable just to compliance with reg-ulation. We need to make sure that we have our manufacturers, our busi-nesses, doing that which they do best within a reasonable regulatory scheme, and that is what this act offers: a rea-sonable regulatory scheme that allows Congress who has the authority—actu-ally has the only authority—to hold accountable these unelectable bureau-crats. The SCRUB Act will allow us to do that. It will allow due process through a discovery process. More importantly, the review board, the commission, the five bipartisan members who are ap-pointed by the President must be con-firmed by the Senate. This, in and of itself, is a sense of due process, a sense of accountability, and, more impor-tantly, a strong sense of purpose that the American people would want to see this Congress be able to go in and take back the authority that they have del-egated—at sometimes recklessly—to these bureaucratic organizations. We talk about the $30 million. I know the $30 million is always big in any equation that you have, but when you allow the $30 million to be spent over 5 years and you allow that to have the removal of certain regulations, you will pay for this $30 million 10 times over in no time at all. So it is with a sense of advocacy on behalf of not only congressional au-thority, but also a sense of advocacy on behalf of American business and the fu-ture economic growth of this country, that I ask my colleagues to whole-heartedly support the SCRUB Act. Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act. This ill-advised bill would require agencies to undertake a regulatory cut-go process to re-peal rules identified by the Commission, with little to no consideration of the benefits, prior to issuing any new rule. The SCRUB Act’s regulatory cut-go proce-dures are unsafe, dangerous, and would tie the hands of agencies responding to public health crises requiring timely regulatory re-sponses. In fact, this bill lacks any mechanism for consideration of public health and safety, thus leaving no option for agencies to issue emergency rules to protect the public and en-vironment from imminent harm. The bill’s proponents may claim that the title I of the H.R. 1155 would allow the Commis-sion to consider whether the costs of the bill are not justified by the benefit to society. But as witnesses testified during the Judiciary Committee’s consideration of a previous version of this bill, the catch-all language of subsection (h)(2)(I) would allow the Commis-sion to completely disregard any benefit of regulation. In both Republican and Democratic adminis-trations, the benefits of our system of regu-latory protections have made our country safer, stronger, healthier, and cleaner. While consideration of the costs of regulations is im-portant, there is overwhelming consensus that the benefits of regulation vastly exceed the costs. The Government Accountability Office has observed that these benefits ‘‘include, among other things, ensuring that workplaces, air travel, foods, and drugs are safe; that the na-tion’s air, water and land are not polluted; and that the appropriate amount of taxes is col-lected.’’ This evidence overwhelmingly refutes the assertion that regulatory costs are burden-some, eliminate jobs, or harm our economic competitiveness. We should be empowering our agencies, not hindering them, to take the steps needed to protect our environment, con-sumer products, public health, and safety. I ask my colleagues to oppose this bill. The Acting CHAIR (Ms. F
OXX). All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5- minute rule. The bill shall be consid-ered as read. The text of the bill is as follows:

UTIES OF THE COMMISSION .— (1) I
N GENERAL .—The Commission shall conduct a review of the Code of Federal Reg-ulations to identify rules and sets of rules that collectively implement a regulatory program that should be repealed to lower the cost of regulation to the economy. The Com-mission shall give priority in the review to rules or sets of rules that are major rules or include major rules, have been in effect more than 15 years, impose paperwork burdens or unfunded mandates that could be reduced substantially without significantly dimin-ishing regulatory effectiveness, impose dis-proportionately high costs on entities that qualify as small entities within the meaning of section 601(6) of title 5, United States Code, or could be strengthened in their effec-tiveness while reducing regulatory costs. The Commission shall have as a goal of the Commission to achieve a reduction of at least 15 percent in the cumulative costs of Federal regulation with a minimal reduction in the overall effectiveness of such regula-tion. (2) N
ATURE OF REVIEW .—To identify which rules and sets of rules should be repealed to lower the cost of regulation to the economy, the Commission shall apply the following criteria: (A) Whether the original purpose of the rule or set of rules was achieved, and the rule or set of rules could be repealed without significant recurrence of adverse effects or conduct that the rule or set of rules was in-tended to prevent or reduce. (B) Whether the implementation, compli-ance, administration, enforcement, imposi-tion of unfunded mandates, or other costs of the rule or set of rules to the economy are not justified by the benefits to society with-in the United States produced by the expend-iture of those costs. (C) Whether the rule or set of rules has been rendered unnecessary or obsolete, tak-ing into consideration the length of time since the rule was made and the degree to which technology, economic conditions, market practices, or other relevant factors have changed in the subject area affected by the rule or set of rules.

(D) Whether the rule or set of rules is inef-fective at achieving the purposes of the rule or set of rules. (E) Whether the rule or set of rules over-laps, duplicates, or conflicts with other Fed-eral rules, and to the extent feasible, with State and local governmental rules. (F) Whether the rule or set of rules has ex-cessive compliance costs, imposes unfunded mandates, or is otherwise excessively bur-densome, as compared to alternatives that— (i) specify performance objectives rather than conduct or manners of compliance; (ii) establish economic incentives to en-courage desired behavior; (iii) provide information upon which choices can be made by the public; (iv) incorporate other innovative alter-natives rather than agency actions that specify conduct or manners of compliance; or (v) could in other ways substantially lower costs without significantly undermining ef-fectiveness. (G) Whether the rule or set of rules inhib-its innovation in or growth of the United States economy, such as by impeding the in-troduction or use of safer or equally safe technology that is newer or more efficient than technology required by or permissible under the rule or set of rules. (H) Whether or not the rule or set of rules harms competition within the United States economy or the international economic com-petitiveness of enterprises or entities based in the United States. (I) Whether or not the rule or set of rules limits or prevents an agency from applying new or emerging technologies to improve ef-ficiency and effectiveness of government. (J) Whether the rule or set of rules harms wage growth, including wage growth for min-imum wage and part-time workers. (K) Such other criteria as the Commission devises to identify rules and sets of rules that can be repealed to eliminate or reduce unnecessarily burdensome costs to the United States economy. (3) M
ETHODOLOGY FOR REVIEW .—The Com-mission shall establish a methodology for conducting the review (including an overall review and discrete reviews of portions of the Code of Federal Regulations), identifying rules and sets of rules, and classifying rules under this subsection and publish the terms of the methodology in the Federal Register and on the website of the Commission. The Commission may propose and seek public comment on the methodology before the methodology is established. (4) C
LASSIFICATION OF RULES AND SETS OF  
RULES .— (A) I
N GENERAL .—After completion of any review of rules or sets of rules under para-graph (2), the Commission shall classify each rule or set of rules identified in the review to qualify for recommended repeal as either a rule or set of rules— (i) on which immediate action to repeal is recommended; or (ii) that should be eligible for repeal under regulatory cut-go procedures under title II. (B) D
ECISIONS BY MAJORITY .—Each decision by the Commission to identify a rule or set of rules for classification under this para-graph, and each decision whether to classify the rule or set of rules under clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A), shall be made by a sim-ple majority vote of the Commission.

BERS .—Each member of the Commission shall file the financial disclosure reports re-quired under title I of the Ethics in Govern-ment Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.) in accord-ance with the requirements of such title. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. C
UMMINGS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chair, I am very pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. B
EYER ), the maker of the amendment. Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, my amendment today is meant to address only one of several troubling provisions in the bill. As my colleagues have pointed out, the SCRUB Act is a radical approach to deregulation and would prioritize cost savings through repeal of rules without considering their public benefit. The underlying bill would also prohibit agencies from making any new rules— even in the case of an imminent threat to public health or safety—unless the cost is offset by repealing an existing rule. We have heard often on this floor my Republican friends rail against regula-tions promulgated by faceless bureau-crats. Well, this bill seeks to accom-plish all of this through the work of an unelected commission—faceless—with virtually unlimited subpoena authority and jurisdiction over every existing regulation. This body would work in the shadows to roll back environmental and work-place protections, putting dollars and cents over public health. The legisla-tion grants so much in the way of au-thority, but comes with so little in the way of oversight, transparency, or pub-lic accountability. President Trump and my friends on the other side of the aisle like to talk a lot about draining the swamp. Madam Chair, what the Republicans are proposing today makes a swamp look like the Hanging Gardens of Bab-ylon, all at the cost of $30 million to the American taxpayer. My amendment today would bring a modicum of transparency and ethical oversight to the shadow bureaucracy by requiring commission members to follow the same financial disclosure rules as Members of Congress, congres-sional staff, or any Federal official. My amendment would also ensure that commission members don’t come in through the ‘‘revolving door’’ by in-serting a requirement that the indi-vidual must not have been a registered lobbyist at any point during the pre-vious 2 years. Congress not only has the authority, but the duty to review existing regulations and, when nec-essary, to mandate reforms. But I understand why Republicans want to delegate this work. Because who wants to be the one to recommend rolling back rules governing clean air, clean water, food safety, workplace protections, domestic violence, victim protections, and many other rules that are in place to keep Americans healthy and safe? Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment simply to give transparency, openness, and clar-ity to the people who will be making the decisions under the SCRUB Act. Mr. ROSS. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 min-utes. Mr. ROSS. Madam Chair, although I am not in opposition to the amend-ment, I do wish to speak in support and further explain my support, because I believe that the gentleman from Vir-ginia offers some very good merit to his amendment. The amendment clarifies that the commissioners are covered by the Eth-ics in Government Act, which is in line with current law. Commissioners should be free from financial conflict as much as any other Federal employee should. The Beyer amendment pro-hibits the appointment of a commis-sioner to the retrospective regulatory review commission who has been a reg-istered lobbyist in the previous 2 years. Ensuring commissioners are not lob-byists with financial interests in the commission’s work is in line with the commission’s goal of identifying waste-ful or unfair regulations. The 2-year ban allows genuine experts with some past lobbying experience to contribute their knowledge to the commission. This provision is very similar to the President’s 2-year ban on former lobby-ists working in the administration. For those reasons, I do support the amendment. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chair, I have no further comments. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Maryland (Mr. C
UMMINGS ). The amendment was agreed to. b1500 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . DESAULNIER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 115–20. Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
Page 14, after line 22, insert the following new subparagraph (and redesignate the fol-lowing subparagraph accordingly): (K) Whether, and the extent to which, the repeal of the rule or set of rules would im-pact public health. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman from California (Mr. D
ESAULNIER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Madam Chair, I rise today in support of this amend-ment to H.R. 998. As drafted, the SCRUB Act requires Federal agencies to repeal existing regulations to offset the cost of new regulations. The bill also authorizes up to $30 million for a new commission to review the Code of Federal Regulations and recommend regulatory repeals. This commonsense amendment en-sures the impacts of public health, in-cluding the costs and benefits associ-ated with those impacts, are considered under processes established by the SCRUB Act. This, I believe, is a reason-able improvement to the bill. It en-sures that Federal agencies appro-priately consider the true costs and benefits of Federal rules with an eye towards saving hard-earned taxpayer money. As a member of the California State Senate, I worked with a Republican ad-ministration to help enact this legisla-tion as the first-ever health act of its type in the country in a State. It was based on the sensible premise that un-derstanding the impacts of government actions on public health not only saves lives, but saves money. This effort helped provide California State agencies with the direction they needed to effectively collaborate on the complex environmental, financial, and sustainability factors that contribute to poor health and inequities. Over the 6 years of its existence, this policy has resulted in increased collaboration across large State agencies, saving tax-payer money while promoting im-proved public health throughout the Nation’s largest State. Today, U.S. taxpayers face a growing burden of largely preventable chronic illnesses. Heart disease, stroke, obe-sity, and diabetes are but a few of the myriad health issues that millions of Americans face every day that also drive many of their financial and pro-fessional decisions. In many of our most disadvantaged communities, fewer resources are available to benefit health outcomes that are clearly seen in the levels of chronic illness in these communities and shorter life expectancies. It doesn’t take a genius to connect the dots of government policies on public health in our economy. If the goal of this legislation is elimi-nating existing regulations to pay for new regulations, doesn’t it make busi-ness sense to understand the impacts of these decisions on our Nation’s public health? For example, eliminating the Department of Labor’s silica rule might save an employer the expense of

purchasing mitigation equipment, but does that employer truly save money if his health insurance premiums go up due to associated respiratory illness? When the majority pushed to elimi-nate the Department of the Interior’s stream protection rule, thereby allow-ing mountaintop mining companies to dump potentially toxic mining debris in nearby streams, there was little con-sideration to the costs associated with mitigating the inevitable drinking water contamination and healthcare costs of those who will be sickened after drinking contaminated water. This amendment ensures that Fed-eral agencies, at the very least, con-sider the health impacts and costs as-sociated with eliminating a regulation. This amendment will help to go a long way in preventing unnecessary healthcare costs, which I hope we can agree is a positive improvement to the bill. If my colleagues across the aisle in-sist on eliminating Federal regula-tions, I hope that they agree that at least we can make sure that this inde-pendent commission will at least con-sider the benefits of public health as they do their analysis. I urge my col-leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this common-sense amendment. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act. As currently drafted, the SCRUB Act re-quires federal agencies to repeal existing reg-ulations to offset the cost of new regulations. The bill also authorizes up to $30 million for a new commission to review the Code of Fed-eral Regulations and recommend regulatory repeals. This commonsense amendment ensures that impacts to public health, including the costs associated with those impacts, are con-sidered under processes established by the SCRUB Act. This is a reasonable improve-ment to the bill ensures that federal agencies appropriately consider the true costs and ben-efits of federal rules with an eye towards sav-ing hard-earned taxpayer money. As a member of the California State Senate, I helped to enact legislation focused on pro-moting public health throughout the state while saving taxpayer dollars. Based on the sensible premise that understanding the impacts of government actions on public health not only saves lives, but saves money. This effort helped provide California state agencies with the direction they needed to ef-fectively collaborate on the complex environ-mental, financial, and sustainability factors that contribute to poor health and inequities. Over six years of existence, this policy has resulted in increased collaboration across state agen-cies, saving taxpayers money while promoting improved public health throughout the state. Today, U.S. taxpayers face a growing bur-den of largely preventable chronic illnesses. Heart disease, stroke, obesity, and diabetes are but a few of the myriad health issues that millions of Americans face every day that also drive many of their financial and professional decisions. In many of our most disadvantaged commu-nities, fewer resources are available to benefit health outcomes that are clearly seen in the levels of chronic illness and shorter life expectancies. It doesn’t take a genius to con-nect the dots of government policies on public health and our economy. If the goal of this legislation is to eliminate existing regulations to pay for new regulations, doesn’t it make business sense to understand the impacts of those decisions on public health? For example, eliminating the Department of Labor’s Silica Rule might save an employer the expense of purchasing mitigation equip-ment, but does that employer truly save money if his health insurance premiums go up due to associated respiratory illness? When the Majority pushed to eliminate the Interior Department’s Stream Protection rule, thereby allowing mountaintop mining compa-nies to dump potentially toxic mining debris in nearby streams, there was little consideration to the costs associated with mitigating the in-evitable drinking water contamination and health care costs of those who will be sickened after drinking contaminated water. This amendment ensures that federal agen-cies, at the very least, consider the health im-pacts and costs associated with eliminating a regulation. This effort will go a long way in preventing unnecessary health care costs, which I hope we can agree is a positive im-provement to the bill. If my colleagues across the aisle insist on eliminating federal regulations, it only makes sense to ensure that removing such rules does not harm the public. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘YES’’ on this commonsense amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-tion, the gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. ROSS. Madam Chair, this com-mission that we have here in the SCRUB Act is established to clear out old and unnecessary regulations. It currently requires the commission to consider whether the rule could be re-pealed without significant adverse ef-fects, whether the rule is unnecessary, whether the costs are justified by the benefits, and certain other criteria. I think that the consideration of pub-lic health certainly fits within whether the rule would have significant adverse effects, whether it is necessary, and whether the benefits justify the cost. Health, safety, and welfare of the American people is foremost to what we do, and I laud my colleague from California for filing this amendment. This amendment clarifies that the commission should consider the impact on public health of repealing any regu-lation. I think that, again, my col-league from California gave fine exam-ples of that particular balance. We agree that we want regulations that are necessary to protect public health. I am excited to see one of my Democratic colleagues working with us to improve regulatory reform legisla-tion. I look forward to future opportu-nities to continue this work. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Madam Chair, I look forward to, in the future, working on true bipartisan regulation. I think it is one of those areas, at least in my experience in local and State govern-ment, that we should be working in a bipartisan manner. Unfortunately, this bill I do not believe accomplishes that. So regulatory oversight is probably the most important thing we could do, and I hope that we can do it in a bipar-tisan way in the future. I would en-courage my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from California (Mr. DESAULNIER ). The question was taken; and the Act-ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-peared to have it. Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-ceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed.

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 115–20. Ms. M
CSALLY. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
Page 14, after line 22, insert the following new subparagraph (and redesignate the sub-sequent subparagraph accordingly): (K) Whether the rule or set of rules is in full compliance with the requirements of section 801(a)(1)(A) of title 5, United States Code.

CSALLY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentle-woman from Arizona. Ms. M
CSALLY. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of the under-lying legislation, H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act, and urge adoption of my amend-ment. The Retrospective Regulatory Re-view Commission created in the SCRUB Act is an important tool to help Congress reclaim its constitu-tional role of serving as a check to the executive branch and will help bring back jobs and opportunity to hard-working Americans. In 2016 alone, the Obama administra-tion added 97,110 pages to the Federal Register. That is over 75 times more than the Bible, without any of the good news. These rules and regulations accu-mulate with no relief and touch every aspect of life all the way down to rec-ordkeeping for contact lenses, vending machine food labeling, and walk-in freezer testing. Of the over 3,500 final regulations issued in 2016, 34 will cost over $100 mil-lion, and 105 are deemed to have sig-nificant impacts on small business. We

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1379 February 28, 2017 
need to reduce this regulatory burden on American households and small businesses, which costs the economy over $2 trillion per year. The Congressional Review Act gives Congress 60 legislative days to intro-duce and pass into law a disapproval resolution overturning a rule or a regu-lation. Once agency actions are over-turned using this process, agencies are unable to reissue, substantially in the same form, a regulation or guidance in the future. A little known provision in the Con-gressional Review Act requires Federal agencies to submit to Congress and the Government Accountability Office a report on the rule or regulation. The 60-day clock for congressional action begins either when the rule is pub-lished or when Congress receives this report, whichever comes later. Independent studies have shown many rules since 1996 have been imple-mented without this report, often due to Federal agencies’ push to hastily implement new rules. This means that there are still many rules and regula-tions that may still be eligible for Con-gress to overturn using the Congres-sional Review Act disapproval resolu-tions process. My amendment to the SCRUB Act re-quires the Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission to consider for re-moval rules and regulations for which Congress did not receive the report as required by the Congressional Review Act. According to GAO, approximately 29 percent of final rules failed to sub-mit required reports in 2013. This pru-dent step will help give Congress the opportunity to, where appropriate, make use of the Congressional Review Act disapproval process to expedite the rollback of flawed rules and regula-tions that are choking our economy. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-utes. Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chair, again I claim the time in opposition, but I will not oppose this amendment even though it does nothing to change the substance of the SCRUB Act or reduce the danger that it poses to the health and safety of the American public. This amendment would add another criterion to identify which rules the commission would recommend for re-peal, specifically, whether an agency has complied with the requirements of title 5 U.S.C., section 801(a)(1)(A). That section requires agencies, prior to promulgating a rule, to submit to each House of Congress and the Comp-troller General a report containing a copy of the rule; a concise general statement relating to the rule, includ-ing whether it is a major rule; and the proposed effective date of the rule. So this amendment would require this unelected commission to report to Congress on what information Congress has or has not received. This just un-derscores the point that Congress should do its own job rather than pass-ing this bill to set up a commission to do our job for us. Like the other criteria in the bill, Representative M
CSALLY ’s amendment does nothing to address the SCRUB Act’s focus on the costs of the rules. The amendment fails to make sense of the CutGo provision, which would re-sult in the repeal of rules with little re-gard for how these rules have benefited and protected the American public. The amendment fails to address the fact that agencies are already doing a retrospective review of regulations. This amendment fails to reduce the $30 million price tag that the American public would be responsible for paying to create the unelected commission under this bill. The amendment fails to reduce the commission’s virtually unlimited au-thority to subpoena witnesses or docu-ments. This amendment is nothing more than a window dressing, and it is nice. It does not address any of the SCRUB Act’s failings and dangers that it poses to the health and safety of all Ameri-cans. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. M
CSALLY. Madam Chair, may I ask how much time I have remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Arizona has 2
1⁄2minutes remain-ing. Ms. M
CSALLY. Madam Chair, again, my amendment is simple under the SCRUB Act. Right now, these agencies are not complying with the law. They have not submitted necessary reports to Congress and the GAO. So this amendment is simply asking, among other things that are being reviewed in this act, that we take a look at which reports have not been submitted, there-fore, which are not in compliance with the Congressional Review Act so that we can decide whether any of those would be appropriate for disapproval resolutions or, quite frankly, whether the rule is even one that should be en-forced because it hasn’t complied with the law. This is a good amendment. I appre-ciate our colleagues supporting it. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. A
RRINGTON ). Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Chair, the cumulative cost of regulations in our country is now at the tune of $2 tril-lion, and it costs us $60 billion just to enforce those regulations every year. With all due respect, that is not win-dow dressing. When you take a look at those numbers, it is clear to see that the bureaucratic state of our Federal Government is threatening our job cre-ators and killing our economy. Today, we have an opportunity to re-verse course on the stifling regulations flowing from Washington by passing H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act, as amended here by my colleague, Congresswoman M
ARTHA MCSALLY . The SCRUB Act will establish a com-mission to review existing Federal reg-ulations and identify for Congress which of those place unnecessary costs on our economy. The amendment of-fered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) will take the SCRUB Act a step further by requiring this commission to consider for removal all regulations dating back to 1996 that did not comply with the law that states that there must be an accompanying report to Congress. According to the GAO, that is almost 30 percent of final rules. All of this is done in a manner con-sistent with my colleague’s standalone bill, the Require CRA Compliance Act, that I was also proud to join her in sponsoring. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. M
CSALLY. Madam Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gen-tleman from Texas. b1515 Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Chair, in closing, we owe this to the American people. We owe this to my children and your grandchildren. We owe this to our local job creators to break the chains of these burdensome regulations and, once again, unleash the spirit of Amer-ican innovation and enterprise that made this country the envy of the world by passing the SCRUB Act and the McSally amendment. Ms. M

RRINGTON for his sup-port. I want to thank Chairman C
HAFFETZ and Mr. S MITH for their hard work on this important legislation. I want to urge the passage of my amend-ment and encourage my colleagues to support the underlying legislation.

It seeks to reduce the size of bureaucracy by establishing a new commission to serve a function already performed without the con-tribution of an additional $30 million in taxpayer funding. Now, $30 million may not be too much to the true benefactors of this bill on K Street, but to seniors, vet-erans, students, and workers all across this country, it can go a long way. For example, Social Security’s meager 0.3 percent cost-of-living adjustment for 2017 amounts to $4 more in benefits per month for the average beneficiary. That means that $30 million would be enough to double that cost-of-living ad-justment for 7.5 million seniors. We all know that the cost of addi-tional sequestration cuts on education, health, and the environmental protec-tion loom at the end of this fiscal year. The double talk and schizophrenia of my esteemed colleagues on the Over-sight and Government Reform Com-mittee who pushed this bill through the committee has me truly concerned for the mental state of this Congress. They want to defund Planned Parent-hood, but want to fund a nine-member task force at a cost of $30 million. They drag their feet and hem and haw to assist Flint, Michigan, in fund-ing to promote clean water and save the lives of a community, but we can sure fund a task force to duplicate al-ready-carried-out activities by the Federal Government so we can say we did it to the tune of $30 million. The chair of the Oversight and Gov-ernment Reform Committee wouldn’t allow the people of the Virgin Islands, for 100 years as part of the United States, to receive $100,000 already ear-marked for our interior. But, we have money for this bill. And let’s not dis-cuss all the block-granting discussions going on around here in this Congress. Today, the House majority is now asking to authorize $30 million on a bill that would handcuff enforcement agencies in their ability to respond to even more pressing new public health and safety problems. Let me be clear. Reducing the burden of unnecessary red tape on small busi-nesses is a goal that we all share. I rec-ognize that some regulation is burden-some, and there should be a review of the code to determine what can be con-solidated or repealed to reduce compli-ance costs. One of the things that we seem to agree on is that retrospective review is helpful in the regulatory process. But, retrospective review is already going on with money that has already been authorized. All of the agencies have been required to do this under standing executive orders issued by President Obama. As has been discussed before, the re-sults have been successful in reducing regulations. Agencies have yielded bil-lions of dollars in cost savings and re-duced reporting requirements through the modification of existing regula-tions. People in my district get it that there is a cost to protecting the envi-ronment, but they know that keeping our workers safe and our waters clean is worth it. There can be and is red tape that is unnecessary, and there is ongoing work and focus to eliminate and reduce that. Could there be ways to improve upon existing review regulations? There very well may be, and I am willing to work with anyone on a good idea. Even if $30 million were to come from elsewhere in the budget instead of addi-tional spending, it would be that much less that agencies would have to con-duct the already ongoing retrospective review process now going on. Furthermore, we in Congress also have existing responsibility to actively conduct oversight of government oper-ations and make legislative changes as we see fit. There is simply no reason to spend $30 million on this messaging effort to ignore the successful work that is al-ready going on by qualified people, and to hobble the ability of regulators to safeguard public health and safety in the process. This Congress has money to throw at solutions in search of a problem, but requires cost offsets to provide aid for victims of Flint or toward Zika fund-ing. Please approve my amendment to save this money. Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Con-necticut (Mr. C
OURTNEY ). Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of Ms. P
LASKETT ’s amendment and just want to drill down on one point, which is, in the name of job creation, we have this bill before us, and we are going to spend $30 mil-lion which will, I suppose, create some jobs here in Washington with some folks who sit on the commission and the staff who are going to have to pop-ulate it. But just a couple of days ago, Presi-dent Trump had the manufacturing CEOs of this country at the White House, and what they said was jobs exist, but skills don’t; that there is a skills gap in this country, and that we need to have job training out there to connect people to these jobs. Well, we have the Workforce Invest-ment Act that was signed into law by President Obama in 2014, which created a framework for apprenticeship pro-grams, advance manufacturing pro-grams, all the things that these CEOs were talking about, and we are under-funding those programs—just to take one, the Adult Formula Grants—by just about $30 million. You want to create jobs? Don’t spend $30 million on this ridiculous commis-sion when, again, we have so many other resources here in Washington to review regulations. Let’s put that money directly into the programs that will create the skill sets so that people can actually get a job to support them-selves and their families. And don’t take it from us, take it from the CEOs who were with President Trump just a few days ago about the fact that at a time when we have jobs in existence, the fact that we are underfunding job training programs is just totally crimi-nal. Let’s use this $30 million in a more productive way that will actually con-nect people to the jobs that are out there in the economy. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. LONG). The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, the com-mission is permitted, under this bill, to spend $30 million over 5 years for ad-ministrative purposes. By removing the funding in this amendment, the commission will not be able to hire staff, rent office space, establish the public website as required in the bill, or hold the public meetings, which are also required in the bill. This amend-ment essentially guts the bill. The commission established under this bill has a momentous job ahead of it. The Code of Federal Regulations to-tals more than 178,000 pages. This is ap-proximately 36,000 pages of regulations for review every year of the 5 years the commission has to conduct its work. But it is not just simply reading the pages. There is work behind under-standing whether the regulations are effective. There is outreach and public hearings to understand how the regula-tions are or aren’t effective. I believe the savings from elimi-nating unnecessary costs and the im-proved efficiency from weeding out unneeded regulations will far outweigh the resources applied to this effort. The Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that regulations impose a cost on the economy of $1.8 trillion. Who bears that cost but the con-sumers? This amendment would gut the bill. $30 million over 5 years is more than reasonable, considering the economic impact that these regula-tions have had on the American busi-ness and the American economy. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amend-ment and support the bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . MCNERNEY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in House Report 115–20. Mr. M
CNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
Page 31, line 17, insert after ‘‘Code’’ the fol-lowing: ‘‘, except that the term does not in-clude any rule relating to the physical and cyber security of the bulk-power system (as defined in section 215(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824o(a)), including any emer-gency action to protect and restore reli-ability of the bulk-power system’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CNERNEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. M
CNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is straightforward. It ex-empts from the bill any agency rule re-lating to the physical and cybersecu-rity of the bulk power system, includ-ing any emergency action to protect and restore reliability. The bulk power system is comprised of facilities and control systems necessary for oper-ating an interconnected electrical transmission network to maintain reli-ability. Our Nation’s electrical system touch-es each and every part of our lives, hos-pitals, schools, transportation, homes, businesses, and our national security. Our electrical system is the central element of our Nation’s critical infra-structure because all other components of our infrastructure depend on it. The electrical system is composed of 640,000 miles of high-voltage trans-mission lines and more than 6 million miles of distribution lines. This net-work is undergoing a transformation. There are an ever-increasing number of devices that are connected to the grid; technological advancements are allow-ing for efficiencies and cheaper produc-tion of power, whether it is renewable energy or natural gas; and consumers have more choices and more control. With increased digitization, automa-tion and interaction also have en-hanced grid flexibility and security. While these developments present tremendous opportunities, such as new jobs and reducing carbon emissions, they also pose additional physical and cyber threats to the transmission and distribution systems. Stakeholders across the system are facing numerous new threats and challenges in detect-ing problems, responding to intrusions, and keeping rates affordable while maintaining reliability. The long-term health of the electricity sector is now, more than ever, a shared responsibility between communities, consumers, in-dustry, and government. Despite these challenges, the bulk power system is an example of industry stakeholders and the Federal Govern-ment working well together, when needed, and working independently, when needed and succeeding. Transmission and distribution pro-viders have taken it upon themselves to establish industry-led standards, best practices, and supply chain man-agement when it comes to grid secu-rity. They have worked well with NERC and FERC in developing Critical Infrastructure Protection standards for the bulk power system. These Critical Infrastructure Protec-tion standards cover critical cyber asset identification, security manage-ment, personnel and training, elec-tronic security, physical security, sys-tems security, incident reporting and response planning, and recovery plans. There are 72 inactive CIP standards, and 11 that are now subject to enforce-ment. These standards aren’t always perfect, but they do represent com-promise and collaboration. A well-protected and reliable grid makes economic sense. Power outages and disturbances can cost more than $180 billion annually, and data suggests that electrical system outages attrib-utable to weather-related events are increasing, costing the U.S. economy an estimated $20 billion to $55 billion annually. Electric companies are pro-jected to spend more than $7 billion of their own money on cybersecurity alone by the year 2020, and are ex-pected to invest nearly $53 billion to enhance the grid. b1530 These are significant investments, but essential investments as well. A more resilient, secure electric sector is something we all benefit from. It will continue to require investments at all levels, including from the Federal Gov-ernment. We should enhance funding for our national laboratories that have partnered together via the Grid Mod-ernization Lab Consortium. We should provide high levels of funding for the Office of Electricity and its mission to ensure the energy delivery system is more secure, resilient, and reliable. We must promote R&D that helps bring new, innovative technologies to the grid. We will always struggle to keep ahead of those bad actors who are seek-ing to attack us, but we can establish metrics, procedures, and technological capabilities that allow us to respond and adapt. I agree with many of my colleagues that we should work to identify and re-move regulations that are no longer relevant. The Critical Infrastructure Protection standards have worked. My amendment ensures that Federal agen-cies will have the flexibility needed to respond to challenges without sacri-ficing any other necessary protections. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 min-utes. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, this bill re-quires the commission to identify regu-lations that should be repealed. These are all regulations under the bill. While I appreciate my colleague from Califor-nia’s efforts in his amendment, I just cannot support it. The commission focuses on rules and regulations that are out of date, no longer useful, and otherwise unneces-sary or obsolete. No regulations should be exempt from this bill. Ensuring the physical and cybersecu-rity of the bulk power system is abso-lutely important and critical. We should know whether or not the exist-ing regulations are effective and are useful. This amendment would prevent the commission from reviewing these im-portant regulations and ensuring that they are current and effective. I would urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. M
CNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from California (Mr. M

AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . 
KRISHNAMOORTHI  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in House Report 115–20. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair-man, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
Page 31, after line 24, add the following new title (and update the table of contents accordingly): TITLE VI—EXEMPTIONS 
SEC. 601. EXEMPTION RELATING TO NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM. 
The provisions of this Act do not apply to any rule or set of rules relating to the safety of the national airspace system. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. K
RISHNAMOORTHI ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair-man, my amendment today is a probusiness, pro-innovation amend-ment. This would exempt any regula-tions that affect the safety of our Na-tional Airspace System. It is important to note that commer-cial drone operations are only possible because of FAA rules. Last August, the FAA’s small UAS rule—unmanned aer-ial systems rule—opened the door for small businesses to use unmanned sys-tems easily and without cumbersome paperwork.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH1382 February 28, 2017 
The current inaction on the ‘‘flights over people’’ rule could limit UAS op-erations, such as news reporting, dis-aster relief, and public safety from be-coming a reality. As a result, many businesses and the country could lose out on the full societal and economic benefits of UAS. Once UAS are fully integrated into the national airspace, the full benefits of these tools will help businesses to expand and our economy to grow—with a projected 100,000 jobs and over $82 bil-lion in economic impact over the next decade. That is why this particular amendment is supported by the UAV Coalition as well as the Automated Ve-hicles Symposium. But we need action from regulatory authorities to fully integrate UAS into our airspace. Without my amendment, the SCRUB Act has the potential to stifle a growing industry and prevent the modernization of air traffic. I want to reiterate: UAS operators need guid-ance and regulations from the FAA so they can operate safely and without unnecessary paperwork. I urge the House to support my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 min-utes. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, as I men-tioned earlier, the bill requires the commission to identify regulations— all regulations—which should be re-pealed. The commission focuses on rules and regulations that are out of date, no longer useful, and otherwise unnecessary or obsolete. Again, no reg-ulations should be exempt from this bill. Ensuring the safety of the National Airspace System is critically impor-tant. We should know whether or not the existing regulations are effective and useful. This amendment would pre-vent the commission from reviewing these very important regulations and ensuring that they are not only current but also effective. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair-man, investments into this particular industry are predicated on whether or not regulations are predictable. As a former small-business man, I can tell you that investments will not happen if there is an unelected commission that exists that might change the very rules and regulations upon which cur-rent investments have been made. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, while I ap-preciate the argument about an unelected commission, I must say that these regulations are already being promulgated by unelected, unaccount-able bureaucrats. Again, if we are going to have to have a review—an oversight—of our regulatory scheme, we should not ex-empt any regulations. I, therefore, would submit that this amendment would do just that. It would create a slippery slope of exceptions. Therefore, I, again, would urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair-man, as a small-business man, I can tell you that small businesses rely on the predictability of regulatory rules and the regulatory regime. This com-mission is creating unpredictability in the system. Therefore, it is going to stifle investment, it is going to prevent innovation, and it is going to further throw a monkey wrench into our Na-tional Airspace System. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair-man, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Illinois (Mr. K
RISHNAMOORTHI ). The question was taken; and the Act-ing Chair announced that the noes ap-peared to have it. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair-man, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR.

AMENDMENT NO . 7 OFFERED BY MR . 
KRISHNAMOORTHI  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in House Report 115–20. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair-man, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
Page 31, after line 24, add the following new title (and update the table of contents accordingly): TITLE VI—EXEMPTIONS 
SEC. 601. EXEMPTION RELATING TO AIRPORT NOISE RESTRICTIONS. 
The provisions of this Act do not apply to any rule or set of rules relating to airport noise restrictions. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. K
RISHNAMOORTHI ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair-man, my second amendment to the SCRUB Act would protect the count-less citizens, including many of my own constituents, who depend on air-port noise restrictions to sleep through the night or learn uninterrupted in school. Thousands of my constituents near O’Hare International Airport benefit from these restrictions, as do the mil-lions of people that live near major air-ports across the country. As the father of a 10-month-old baby girl, I can speak from experience to the value of an un-interrupted night of sleep. Many FAA noise rules are the prod-uct of careful discussions between air-ports and local authorities. While noise restrictions have a slight economic im-pact on air carriers, the economic ben-efit to surrounding communities more than outweighs this. The unelected commission created by this bill should not have the ability to overturn restrictions that have been carefully considered by local govern-ments, the FAA, and airport officials. Without FAA noise restrictions, peo-ple and businesses would suffer, Mr. Chairman. This would decrease prop-erty values in my district, make it harder for people to start a business, and have a negative effect on people’s health. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 min-utes. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, everyone agrees that airport noise is very annoy-ing. Effective regulations that protect our communities from unwarranted noise are very important. However, regulations that impose excessive and costly restrictions that are ineffective at achieving their goals do not help anyone. Why not take a look at these regula-tions and just consider whether they are working? If they are, then the regulation stays in place and we continue to protect our communities from unwarranted noise. If those regulations are not working, then we repeal them and put in regula-tions that achieve the goals and reduce costs. There is no reason why we should create special carve-outs from the com-mission’s consideration. For those reasons, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair-man, these particular rules and regula-tions were crafted carefully at the local level, and I believe very strongly that this commission, which is a Fed-eral commission, should not somehow upset the balance that has been achieved through local voices having a say in these particular regulations. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I will tell you that regulations are regulations. They need to be reviewed at every level. What the SCRUB Act offers is that opportunity. What this amend-ment does is limit that ability.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Private First Class Buford Johnson, a World War II Army veteran for his service to our country. Buford Johnson served in the United States Army from June 1943 to September 1945. During this time, he served as a half-track driver, gunner driver and a convoy driver. On August 10, 1944, Buford was deployed to the United Kingdom where he and his company crossed the English Channel and landed in France. Buford and his company were on the beach for three days and three nights, marched by foot, traveled by train, and finally arrived at their trucks. After driving more than 40 miles to deliver their supplies, they then marched seven miles over the mountains of France to the front lines. Buford served in France, Germany, Nor-mandy, and Northern France in the 5th Divi-sion, 3rd Army under the command of General George Patton during the Battle of the Bulge. On November 10, 1944, Buford was injured by a piece of shrapnel which hit below his knee. After receiving battlefield care, he returned to fighting on the front lines. His military awards and decorations include the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart Medal, Army Good Con-duct Medal, American Campaign Medal, Euro-pean-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal (with 3 bronze service stars), World War II Victory Medal, Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp, Combat Infantryman Badge, 1st Award, Marksman Badge—Expert, Sharp-shooter with the Marksman Clasp, and the WWII Honorable Service Lapel Pin. After Buford returned home, he worked in both Wyoming and Montana as a ranch hand performing jobs including fence mending, cat-tle herding and irrigation work for 40 years. Seventeen years ago, Buford moved to Den-ver where he now lives with his daughter, Dar-lene, and son-in-law, Vincent. I extend my deepest appreciation to Private First Class Buford Johnson for his dedication, integrity and outstanding service to the United States of America.

TRIBUTE TO NATE BOULTON 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Nate Boulton for being named a 2017 Forty Under 40 honoree by the award-winning central Iowa publication, Business Record. Since 2000, Business Record has under-taken an exhaustive annual review to identify a standout group of young leaders in the Greater Des Moines Area that are making an impact in their communities and their careers. Each year, forty up-and-coming community and business leaders under 40 years of age are selected for this prestigious honor based on a combined criteria of community involve-ment and success in their chosen career field. The 2017 class of Forty Under 40 honorees will join an impressive roster of 680 past busi-ness leaders and growing. Nate is a partner at Hedberg & Boulton, P.C., where he practices workers compensa-tion, personal injury, and labor law. Nate is a former Vice President of the Iowa Association for Justice, and former President of the Iowa Workers’ Compensation Advisory Committee. He also serves as a grader for the Iowa Bar Examination. Last year, Nate was elected to the Iowa State Senate, representing the east side of Des Moines and Pleasant Hill. When he is not passionately advocating for workers, Nate serves as an Adjunct Professor at Simp-son College, and has completed 32 marathons in 17 states since 2011. He is married to his wife, Andrea. Mr. Speaker, it is a profound honor to rep-resent leaders like Nate in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I rec-ognize him today for utilizing his talents to bet-ter both his community and the great state of Iowa. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Nate on receiving this es-teemed designation, thanking those at Busi-ness Record for their great work, and wishing each member of the 2017 Forty Under 40 class a long and successful career. f 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF AC-TIVIST AND CONSTITUENT DAVID BURWELL 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor David Burwell who passed away on February 1, 2017. David will be remembered as a passionate activist for conservation and environmental advocacy. In a decades-long career, he made many important contributions to environmental progress through his early work with the National Wildlife Federation, by co-founding the visionary Rails-to-Trails Con-servancy (RTC), and in serving as director of the Energy and Climate Program at the Car-negie Endowment for International Peace. Mr. Burwell is remembered by his RTC co- founder Peter Harkin as ‘‘a voracious learner and a fearless instigator,’’ for whom ‘‘no unex-plored fact was too insignificant, and no chal-lenge was too large.’’ These qualities served him well in the 1980s, when all across the country, thousands of miles of railroad were falling out of use each year. Instead of simply watching this land be sold-off and re-devel-oped, Mr. Burwell worked with Congress to preserve railroad corridors as hiking trails for current and future generations of outdoor en-thusiasts and railroad history buffs. He is survived by his wife Irini, his son and daughter-in-law, his two granddaughters, and his brother. May his life’s work be an inspira-tion to all of us. f 
RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE KHOJALY MAS-SACRE 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 25th Anniversary of the massacre of hun-dreds of people in the town of Khojaly in what was the largest killing of ethnic Azerbaijani ci-vilians in the course of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. Khojaly, which is located in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, was once home to 7,000 people. That was before Armenian armed forces descended on the town in a final attempt to take over the city on February 26, 1992. Armenian armed forces massacred over 600 unarmed people, includ-ing 106 women and 83 children, and left less than 2,000 survivors. Hundreds more became disabled due to their horrific injuries. More than one hundred children lost a parent and 25 children lost both parents. At least 8 fami-lies were completely killed. Even though a ceasefire went into effect over two decades ago, more than 20 percent of Azerbaijan’s territory, including Nagorno- Karabakh and seven surrounding districts, re-main occupied and more than 1 million Azerbaijanis remain refugees unable to return to their home villages. Ongoing violence along the line of contact surrounding occupied Azer-baijani territory reinforces the urgency of ro-bust American participation in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) Minsk Group as it works toward a peaceful resolution of the Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict. Azerbaijan is the only country that borders both Russia and Iran, and yet Azerbaijan has been a strong partner of the United States and its allies in security and energy matters. This cooperation has included: playing a leadership role in nonproliferation issues; providing troops to serve shoulder-to-shoulder with U.S. forces in Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan; allowing transit of non-lethal equipment used by coali-tion forces through Azerbaijan to Afghanistan; construction of the Southern Gas Corridor from the Caspian Sea to Italy, thereby pro-viding Europe with an alternative to Russian energy sources; and supplying 40 percent of Israel’s oil. Azerbaijan also has a thriving Jew-ish community and has outstanding relations with Israel. I invite my colleagues to join me and our Azerbaijani friends in recognizing and remem-bering the horrible events that occurred during

TRIBUTE TO BRIANNE SANCHEZ 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Brianne Sanchez for being named a 2017 Forty Under 40 honoree by the award-winning central Iowa publication, Business Record.

Brianne is the Community Relations Man-ager at Principal Financial Group, and is very active in the young professional’s community in Des Moines. She was honored as the 2015 YPC Amy Jennings YP Impact Award winner, and co-founded the Des Moines Chapter of the Young Nonprofit Professionals Network.

OBSERVING MARFAN AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in observance of February as National Marfan Awareness Month and to pay tribute to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are living with Marfan syndrome and related con-nective tissue disorders. Marfan syndrome is a rare genetic condi-tion. About 1 in 5,000 Americans carries a mu-tation in a gene called fibrillin–1 which results in an overproduction of a protein called trans-forming growth factor beta or TGFB. The in-creased TGFB impacts connective tissue and since connective tissue is found throughout the body, Marfan syndrome features can manifest throughout the body. Patients often have disproportionately long limbs, a pro-truding or indented chest bone, curved spine, and loose joints. However, it is not the out-ward signs that concern Marfan syndrome pa-tients, but the effects the condition has on the internal systems of the body. Most notably, in Marfan patients the large artery, known as the aorta, which carries blood away from the heart, is weakened and prone to enlargement and potentially fatal rupture. An early and accurate diagnosis, regular monitoring, and, in some cases, therapies or medical interventions are necessary to prevent cardiac events. This is why I believe it is im-portant to develop a program to support, as-sist, and encourage states to incorporate Marfan syndrome testing into their sports screening criteria for at-risk young athletes. Few states include Marfan syndrome testing in their sports screening for high school athletes which leads to Marfan syndrome-related tho-racic aortic aneurysm and dissection claiming the lives of young athletes across the country each year. I am proud to have come to know the na-tion’s foremost organization working to support the Marfan community, the Marfan Founda-tion, through their strong advocacy work on Capitol Hill. The Foundation was founded in 1981 and has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of individuals affected by Marfan syn-drome and related connective tissue disorders by advancing research, raising awareness, and providing support. I urge my colleagues to stand with me and reflect on the work that needs to be done to ensure that patients with rare conditions can expect to see sustained and meaningful im-provements in their health and healthcare over the next 30 years. I urge my colleagues to stand with me and recognize National Marfan Awareness Month. f 
RECOGNIZING LONDON ROBERSON 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor McKamy Middle School student London Roberson for her dedication and commitment to helping those affected by heart disease. The 13 year old, who started fundraising in kindergarten, has raised an astounding $55,000 for the American Heart Association through Jump Rope for Heart and Hoops for Heart. London’s passion for helping those affected by heart disease started at a young age. After losing a grandfather to a heart attack and wit-nessing several family members struggle with cardiovascular issues, London jumped into ac-tion and began fundraising for the American Heart Association. This month, London and the American Heart Association have orga-nized a students versus teachers basketball game at her Flower Mound middle school that will not only raise funds for those in need, but will increase awareness of this devastating disease. London’s compassion for those suffering from heart disease and her commitment to or-ganizing creative and fun ways to raise funds and increase awareness is inspirational and I am proud to represent her and McKamy Mid-dle School in the United States House of Rep-resentatives. f

ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, twenty-five years ago, in New Haven’s Science Park, in an incubator space dedicated to research and development in the biotech industry, Dr. Leon-ard Bell celebrated the opening of Alexion Pharmaceuticals. From that day forward, Alexion has strived to meet its mission, to de-velop and deliver life-transforming therapies for patients with devastating and rare dis-eases.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE245 February 28, 2017 
Alexion is one of New Haven and Connecti-cut’s greatest biotech success stories. In less than a decade, the company grew far beyond the incubator space of Science Park, first moving to new facilities in Cheshire, opening a bio-manufacturing facility in Rhode Island and establishing operations in Europe. I am proud to say that just last year we celebrated the return of Alexion’s global headquarters to New Haven where they continue their good work in a new state-of-the-art facility that is anchor to an entire downtown revitalization ef-fort. Alexion is special in many ways, but what makes them most unique is their commitment to patients who are all too often invisible to others. Alexion is dedicated to the develop-ment of drugs and therapies for some of the most rare diseases in the world, extending hope to patients and families who have no-where else to turn. Alexion first found success with the develop-ment of Soliris, the world’s first approved ter-minal complement inhibitor. Today, Soliris is approved in nearly 50 countries for the treat-ment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal he-moglobinuria (PNH) and in more than 40 countries for the treatment of patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), two life-threatening, ultra-rare disorders caused by uncontrolled complement activation. In more recent years, Alexion’s metabolic fran-chise has grown to include two highly innova-tive enzyme replacement therapies for patients with life-threatening and ultra-rare disorders: Strensiq is approved for patients with hypophosphatasia (HPP) and Kanuma is ap-proved for patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. Patients with these life-threatening diseases have no effective treatment options, and they and their families suffer with little hope. Alexion’s goal has and continues to be to de-liver medical breakthroughs where none cur-rently exist. They are driven because they know people’s lives depend on their work. Today, Alexion employs nearly 3,000 people around the world, serving patients in 50 coun-tries. From that small incubator space in Science Park, Alexion has emerged as one of the world’s leading rare disease companies, advancing the most robust rare disease pipe-line in the biotech industry. I was proud to stand with Dr. Bell as Alexion opened its doors and I am proud to stand today to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Alexion Phar-maceuticals as they celebrate this remarkable milestone. Happy 25th Anniversary and best wishes for continued success.

RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN JOHN ‘‘GIDDY UP’’ BUNCH 
HON. FRANCIS ROONEY 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Captain John ‘‘Giddy Up’’ Bunch, a Southwest Flo-ridian and a Marine Corps veteran who served in Vietnam. As the owner of GiddyUp Fishing Charters in St. James City, Florida, Captain Bunch combined his love for fishing with his love for our country when he invited a group of servicemen fishing out of gratitude for their service. This inspired him to dedicate his time to giving back to our veterans, which he did by founding Operation Open Arms. The organization’s mission is to recruit peo-ple and businesses that are willing to donate their services and support to troops on leave, or those returning home, to give them a much- needed respite from their service. Since 2005, with over 300 volunteers supporting the pro-gram, Operation Open Arms has provided joy to over 3,000 servicemen and women and their families by providing services including vacations, weddings, fishing trips, counseling programs and funeral funds, totaling over $13 million in benefits. Captain Bunch was awarded the status of Honorary Life Member of American Legion Post 135 in Naples, Florida, and received the Outstanding Civilian Service Award at the Chief of Staff of the Army Salute last Sep-tember, further exemplifying his dedication to making Operation Open Arms a success. His generosity and patriotism are an inspiration to us all. f

HONORING THE GREATER NEW HAVEN NAACP ON THEIR 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Greater New Haven NAACP as they mark their centennial anniversary, a remarkable milestone for this tremendous organization. Over the course of its 100-year history, the Greater New Haven NAACP has been an in-valuable resource for our community. Serving fourteen towns, they are constantly working to bring awareness to a variety of issues. From racial disparities in employment, housing, transportation, health, law enforcement and education, their fight for justice has been tire-less. They have strived to continually educate, impact and engage our community by spon-soring events like an annual health expo, cele-brating the contributions of community mem-bers at their annual Freedom Fund dinner and organizing voter registration and turn-out pro-grams. Their efforts have gone a long way to-ward making sure that all of our community members enjoy equal opportunity. Though inequality and injustice continue to challenge our society, it is organizations like the Greater New Haven NAACP who help us all to meet overcome those challenges. It is through the commitment of their leadership and their members that they are ensuring a promising future for our families, our children, and our communities. I would be remiss if I did not extend a spe-cial note of thanks and appreciation to the leadership of the Greater New Haven NAACP for their outstanding vision. It has been a privi-lege to work with them over my tenure in Con-gress. As the voice of our African-American com-munity, the Greater New Haven NAACP has improved countless lives. Today, as we mark their 100th Anniversary, we also renew our commitment to those ideals upon which the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was founded, the causes of social justice and equality, the importance of community and public service, and the hope for a better tomorrow. I am honored to stand today to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Greater New Haven NAACP on their cen-tennial anniversary. As we say in Italian, Cent’ Anni to another 100 years.

RECOGNIZING AMERICAN RED CROSS MONTH 2017 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize American Red Cross Month. In Missouri’s Eighth Congressional Dis-trict we have a long history of helping our neighbors in need. American Red Cross Month is a special time to recognize and thank our heroes, those Red Cross volunteers and donors who give of their time and resources to help community members. These heroes help families find shelter after a home fire. They give blood to help trauma victims and cancer patients. They deliver com-fort items to military members in the hospital. They use their lifesaving skills to save some-one from a heart attack, drowning or choking. They enable children around the globe to be vaccinated against measles and rubella. The American Red Cross depends on local heroes to deliver help and hope during a dis-aster. We applaud our heroes here in Mis-souri’s Eighth Congressional District who give of themselves to assist their neighbors when they need a helping hand. Across the country and around the world, the American Red Cross responds to disasters big and small. In fact, every eight minutes the organization responds to a community disaster by providing shelter, food, emotional support and other necessities to those affected. It col-lects nearly 40 percent of the nation’s blood supply; provides 24-hour support to military members, veterans and their families; teaches millions lifesaving skills, such as lifeguarding and CPR; and through its Restoring Family Links program, connects family members sep-arated by crisis, conflict or migration. We dedicate the month of March to all those who support the American Red Cross mission to prevent and alleviate human suffering in the face of emergencies. Our community depends on the American Red Cross, which relies on donations of time, money and blood to fulfill its humanitarian mission. As we celebrate March 2017 as American Red Cross Month, it is my pleasure to recog-nize the organization before the House of Representatives and thank them for their com-mitment to communities all across this great nation. f 
HONORING NATASSJA KUZNET- SOVA OF BASKING RIDGE, NEW JERSEY 
HON. LEONARD LANCE 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and honor a student from my dis-trict who has achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in her community. Nastassja Kuznetsova, of Basking Ridge, has just been named one of the top honorees in New Jersey by the 2017 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on the most impressive student vol-unteers in each state. Ms. Kuznetsova is being recognized for or-ganizing a 5k run that has raised more than $12,000 for lung cancer research since 2014. Nastassja started the Legwork for Lungs 5k run to help support a family friend who had been diagnosed with lung cancer. In addition to her philanthropy initiative, Nastassja also started the Legwork for Lungs club at her high school, created an exhibit at the Liberty Science Center and launched a social media campaign to raise awareness of the disease. It’s vital that we encourage and support the kind of selfless contribution this young citizen has made. People of all ages need to think more about how we, as individual citizens, can work together at the local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighbor-hoods. Young volunteers like Nastassja are in-spiring examples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow. The program that brought this young role model to our attention, The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, was created by Prudential Financial in partnership with the National As-sociation of Secondary School Principals in 1995 to impress upon all youth volunteers that their contributions are critically important and highly valued, and to inspire other young peo-ple to follow their example. Over the past 22 years, the program has become the nation’s largest youth recognition effort based solely on community service, and has honored more than 115,000 young volunteers at the local, state and national level. Ms. Kuznetsova should be extremely proud to have been singled out from the thousands of dedicated volunteers who participated in this year’s program. I heartily applaud Ms. Kuznetsova for her initiative in joining the fight against cancer. She has demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today’s world, and de-serves our sincere admiration and respect. Her actions show that young Americans can and do play important roles in our commu-nities, and that America’s community spirit continues to hold tremendous promise for the future. f

IN RECOGNITION OF KAREN BAYNES-DUNNING 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Karen Baynes-Dunning for her noteworthy work as a lawyer and former Juvenile Court judge in the state of Georgia. Ms. Baynes-Dunning will be honored at the 18th Annual Justice Robert Benham Awards for Community Service on Tuesday, February 28, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia. Since 1998, the Benham Awards have been presented to Georgia lawyers and judges in recognition of their commitment to volunteerism and the positive contributions to their communities. Karen Baynes-Dunning earned a bachelor’s degree in Politics from Wake Forest University in 1989 and a juris doctorate degree from the University of California at Berkeley in 1992. She began her legal career as an associate at Alston & Bird in Atlanta. In 1996–1998, she served in the Fulton County Juvenile Court as the first Executive Director of the new Court Appointed Special Advocates program and then as Director of Program Development. In 1998, she was appointed as an Associate Judge in the Fulton County Juvenile Court. Following these legal roles, Ms. Baynes- Dunning became involved in the world of aca-demia. She served in the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the University of Georgia and was appointed as an Associate Professor at the University of Alabama College of Human Environmental Science. Drawing upon her experience with juveniles in the court sys-tem, she was appointed in 2013 to lead the State Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative, an Alabama statewide juvenile justice reform effort. In Georgia, Ms. Baynes-Dunning now serves as President of Baynes-Dunning Con-sulting and as one of two Federal Monitors overseeing reform efforts in the Georgia De-partment of Family and Children Services. With a passion for improving the lives of children and young adults in the court system, Ms. Baynes-Dunning has been a strong advo-cate for juvenile justice reform. She served on the American Bar Association’s Project for Ju-dicial Excellence in Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings and taught a juvenile justice course as a Visiting Clinical Professor at Emory University School of Law. Ms. Baynes-Dunning lives in Albany, Geor-gia, where her husband, Art Dunning, serves as president of Albany State University. She is an active member of many professional and civic organizations through which she continu-ously devotes her time to bettering the com-munity, both in Albany and throughout the state of Georgia. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, ‘‘Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’’ Karen Baynes-Dun-ning undoubtedly lives by this philosophy. From her advocacy for young people in court to her efforts to reform juvenile justice, her work has made a tremendous impact on the lives of children and families. Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me, my wife, Vivian, and the more than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second Con-gressional District in congratulating Karen Baynes-Dunning on receiving a well-deserved Justice Robert Benham Award recognizing her commitment and contributions to the commu-nity. f 
IN HONOR OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAMUEL SILER 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Siler for his service in the U.S. Air Force and Army, his leadership with the Gloucester Township Council and as a community leader in many other areas. Sam Siler passed away a week ago at the age of 84. He will be remembered by not only his wife Joyce, his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren but also by many people across this country. From Southern New Jer-sey to the Pentagon and beyond, Sam made a profound impression on the lives of many. Lt. Col. Siler joined the armed forces and served with distinction in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars. He served with the United States Air Force for three years and with the United States Army for seventeen more. Sam retired from the armed services in 1974 at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and his honorable services with the armed forces earned him many medals, achievements and accolades that are a testament to the pride taken in him by his nation. An active member of his community, Sam served on the Gloucester Township Council for over a decade including a year as Presi-dent of Council. Never forgetting his fellow veterans, Lt. Col. Siler never stopped volunteering for and lead-ing efforts to support those less fortunate than himself. Additionally, the Blackwood Rotary Club benefited from years of his volunteering and fundraising efforts. Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Siler, was a great American whose dedication to serving our country and our community is an inspiration to us all. I join with his family, friends, and a grateful nation in honoring the selfless service of this extraordinary man.

HONORING GREATER MOUNT ZION AME CHURCH 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize the 108th Anni-versary of Greater Mount Zion AME Church in Dania Beach, Florida. First organized in 1909, Greater Mount Zion has a rich and inspirational history. Not long after establishing its home in 1923, the church was demolished by a hurricane three short years later, leaving only a bible and the pulpit standing. Church members worked faithfully and were determined to rebuild, even if only in spirit and worship, and under the stewardship of several pastoral leaders, the Greater Mount Zion fam-ily always pressed forward together. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s Greater Mount Zion flourished as a spiritual beacon for Dania Beach residents and in the 1960s, a building fund was started with just five hun-dred dollars. This fund would increase over time and help the church continue to expand and grow until a permanent church home was built. The resilience and determination of Greater Mount Zion is testament to the character and steadfast faith of leadership and parishioners alike. They never allowed temporary setbacks to hold them down. With their unshakeable faith and hard work, members gained new strength with each year and in 1986, with the groundbreaking of a beautiful new church, they witnessed a dream become a reality. Today, under the leadership of Reverend Paul R. Wiggins, Greater Mount Zion has ele-vated its congregation with an enthusiastic spirit to meet the needs of all its members, from the elders who persevered to keep the congregation alive, to the new generation who follow in the footsteps of their ancestors. It is with great admiration that I commend the visionary leadership of Greater Mount Zion

IN RECOGNITION OF THE HONORABLE LEROY JOHNSON 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work and service of a prominent attorney, exemplary civil rights lead-er, and former Georgia State Senator, the Honorable Leroy Reginald Johnson. Senator Johnson will be honored at the 18th Annual Justice Robert Benham Awards for Commu-nity Service on Tuesday, February 28, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia. Senator Johnson will be awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award, the highest recognition given by the State Bar of Georgia and the Chief Justice’s Commission on Professionalism to a lawyer or judge who has demonstrated an extraordinarily long and distinguished commitment to volunteer partici-pation in the community throughout his or her legal career. Leroy Reginald Johnson was born on July 28, 1928 in Atlanta, Georgia. He graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in 1945. He went on to earn a bachelor’s degree from Morehouse College in 1949 and a mas-ter’s degree from Atlanta University (now Clark Atlanta University) in 1951. From 1950 to 1954, Senator Johnson taught social science in the Atlanta school system. He then enrolled in law school at North Carolina Central Univer-sity, earning his law degree in 1957. Following his graduation from law school, Fulton County hired him as a criminal investi-gator, the first African American to be hired by the solicitor general’s office (now the district attorney’s office). As the Civil Rights Move-ment ramped up, he became involved in dem-onstrations and protests. When black college students conducted mass sit-ins at Rich’s De-partment Store lunch counters in October 1960, he was present as one of the several community leaders advising the students, who included Julian Bond. In 1962, he was elected to the Georgia State Senate, making him the first African American to be elected to the Georgia Gen-eral Assembly since the end of the Recon-struction Era. He was also the first African American elected to public office in the South-east United Mates that year. In the beginning, Senator Johnson faced many obstacles due to segregation but rose above the adversity, be-coming an influential lawmaker and attaining the position of chairman of the Judiciary Com-mittee. All the while, Senator Johnson has main-tained a successful law practice. He was the driving force in getting the legendary Muham-mad Ali’s boxing license reinstated in 1970. Ali had been stripped of his boxing license in the prime of his career due to his opposition to the Vietnam War. After big cities across the coun-try refused to host a match in which Ali would participate, Senator Johnson offered Atlanta as a location where the fight could take place. Senator Johnson fought behind the scenes to get state and local officials to agree so that ul-timately, Muhammad Ali could fight inside the ring in a match that would lead the way for Ali to eventually reclaim the heavyweight crown. Over the years, Senator Johnson received many awards and accolades for his legal, po-litical, and social work. In 1996, his portrait was hung on the third floor of the State Cap-itol near the Senate chamber where he served for twelve years. In 2000, the Senate passed a resolution renaming a portion of Fulton In-dustrial Boulevard as Leroy Johnson-Fulton In-dustrial Boulevard. Senator Johnson has ac-complished much in his life but none of this would be possible without the love and sup-port of his wife, Cleopatra, and son, Michael Vince. On a personal note, I have had the great pleasure of knowing Senator Johnson since high school in 1964 when he spoke in Mont-gomery, Alabama at the Alabama State Asso-ciation of Student Councils’ meeting where I was presiding as State Student Council Presi-dent. I was inspired by this successful lawyer and public official and was motivated to emu-late his career path. I became a lawyer and twelve years after meeting him, I was elected to the Georgia General Assembly and later, to the U.S. Congress. I have truly been blessed by Senator Johnson’s friendship, counsel and mentorship throughout the years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me and my wife, Vivian, and the people of the state of Georgia, in honoring former State Senator Leroy Johnson for his outstanding professional achievements and service. We congratulate Senator Johnson on receiving the Justice Robert Benham Lifetime Achievement Award.

HONORING REVEREND JENNIE LOU DIVINE REID 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to honor South Florida spir-itual leader Reverend Jennie Lou Divine Reid. Reverend Reid serves as spiritual leader of St. Faith’s Episcopal Church in Cutler Bay, Florida and is retiring after seventeen years of service as an ordained minister. Reverend Reid has provided religious guid-ance to church members and their families, enhancing their spiritual lives through music, art and liturgy. She has continuously uplifted vulnerable populations through her selfless work with the parish food pantry, her dedica-tion to seniors in a nearby retirement commu-nity, and her work with Episcopal Charities. Further demonstrating her commitment to social justice, Reverend Reid has ensured ev-eryone may worship comfortably and created a Spanish congregation and a regular service for those affected by AIDS. Reverend Reid’s heart is larger than life. Her compassionate nature serves as an ex-ample for not only church members, but for all who are fortunate enough to be touched by her generous spirit. Her wisdom and guidance will certainly be missed by parishioners whom she has coun-seled and cared for throughout the years. Under her leadership, St. Faiths has grown and thrived as a beacon of hope in the South Miami-Dade community. I am proud to call Reverend Jennie Lou Reid my good friend and congratulate her on a well-earned retirement.

attitude will be missed, and it was an honor to have known him. He is a sterling example of what it means to be an effective legislator who has earned the full respect of those whom he represents. He was not just a great represent-ative for the Commonwealth, but he was also a genuine person who brought honor and in-tegrity to everything he did. Senator Colgan accomplished much in his career, and he will be remembered not just for his legislative achievements, but also for the manner in which he treated those around him, with re-spect and decency. Senator Colgan adopted a service oriented mindset long before his time in the Virginia State House. After serving in the Army Air Forces during World War II, he started Colgan Air—a regional commuter airline based in Ma-nassas, Virginia. Not only did this commuter airway provide a valuable service to Ameri-cans and Virginians, but it also helped create jobs and economic opportunity in Prince Wil-liam County. After many successful years at Colgan Air, Senator Colgan was elected to the Virginia Senate in 1975 to represent several fast-grow-ing areas of Virginia including Manassas, Ma-nassas Park and parts of Prince William County. During his time in the Senate, he co- chaired the Senate Finance Committee, taking a particular interest in the economic and edu-cational development of Prince William County and the surrounding area. He was instru-mental in bringing Northern Virginia Commu-nity College Campuses to Woodbridge, as well as establishing George Mason University’s Manassas location. Senator Colgan truly car-ried himself as a citizen-politician—a trait which today we aspire to exemplify. Senator Colgan lost his wife of 52 years, the former Agnes Footen, in 2001. He remarried in 2008 and is survived by his wife of eight years, Carmen Alicia Bernal, of Gainesville; as well as eight children from his first marriage, Charles J. Colgan Jr. of Nokesville, Va., Ruth C. Willis of Brewerton, N.Y., Michael J. Colgan and Dot Chaplin, both of Gainesville, Ray-mond T. Colgan, Mary C. Finnigan and Patrick S. Colgan, all of Manassas, and Timothy C. Colgan of Warrenton, Va.; a brother, Robert Colgan, of Manassas; 24 grandchildren; and 22 great-grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, we ask you to join us and countless others as we recognize the many contributions of Senator Charles Colgan. The services he provided to the Commonwealth of Virginia and to our country will never be for-gotten, and we wish his family the best.

RECOGNIZING BETH MORRIS 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Beth Morris, an out-standing member of the Gainesville Commu-nity. Ms. Morris has been an invaluable asset to the development of the community’s suc-cessful youth athletics program at Gainesville Parks and Recreation. It has often been said that the strength of a community depends upon the spirit of commu-nity in each person. ‘‘Miss Beth,’’ as the stu-dents in her youth program call her, epito-mizes this truth through her dedication to her friends, family, and neighbors. For more than 40 years, she has been a member of the Georgia Recreation and Park Association and has served as a longstanding committee member on the GRPA State Ath-letic committee. Throughout her time of serv-ice, Ms. Morris has become a mentor to other Parks and Recreation professionals, indicating that her passion will endure through others for years to come. Miss Beth’s compassionate communication style has made her a role model for many GRPA Young Professionals. In addition to her work at Gainesville Parks and Recreation, she serves as a volunteer for Gainesville Meals on Wheels, with United Way, and as a mentor for young, at-risk men and women in the Gainesville community. Ms. Morris’s leadership has left a significant mark on the thousands of participants that she has led through the youth athletics program at Gainesville Parks and Recreation. It is my honor to recognize Beth’s contribution to our northeast Georgia community. f

INTRODUCTION OF THE RARE DISEASE DAY RESOLUTION HON. ANDRE´CARSON 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, in the United States, rare disorders and diseases are defined as conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 Americans. These conditions range from neurological diseases to dev-astating disorders that affect development. One thing that all of the patients and families affected by these conditions have in common is the need for education, research and treat-ment. Though supporting research and develop-ment at the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, Congress has recognized the necessity for investment in lifesaving innovations that have an impact on rare diseases. On the last day in February each year, people all around the world unite to share their stories and educate communities of researchers, health professionals, govern-ments, families and friends about how rare diseases affect them. I am introducing this resolution to encourage my colleagues in Con-gress to recognize the challenges facing the rare disease patient community and support efforts to improve access to treatments and cures.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100 YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE LOUDOUN COUNTY CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN RED CROSS 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the 100th anniversary of the Loudoun County Chapter of the American Red Cross. Established in 1917, this chapter, comprised of staff, local organizations, and volunteers, has worked tirelessly to protect our Loudoun community. The success of the American Red Cross can be largely attributed to its network of local branches and chapters, like that of Loudoun County. For years, these local branches have established strong partnerships and garnered large groups of volunteers that allow for the broader organization to prosper on both a national and international level. According to the chapter’s Executive Direc-tor, Erwin Stierle, the five fundamental lines of service the American Red Cross aims to pro-vide in Loudoun include disaster services, service to the armed forces, preparedness and safety, blood services, and international serv-ices. Additionally from a local community per-spective, there are a growing number of Red Cross clubs across Loudoun County’s high schools, and they have established several different local initiatives, including the Home Fire Campaign, in which smoke alarms and fire safety preparedness information are in-stalled and provided in homes. Under the leadership of Erwin Stierle and his staff, the local chapter has seen enormous growth in community engagement and a surge in volun-teers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE250 February 28, 2017 
To speak to some of the recent work of the Loudoun Chapter, in the past year they col-lected 2,000 units of blood, which is enough to save 6,000 people, and they trained 2,600 people in life saving skills such as CPR and first aid. Most recently in response to a fire in Ashburn, Virginia in which families lost their apartments, the Loudoun County Chapter of the American Red Cross gave these families gift cards for food and hotels, helped replace their clothes, and more. First responders play a key role in aiding in emergency situations, but it is groups, like the Loudoun County Chapter of the American Red Cross, that fol-low closely behind the first responders to aid members of the community in times of dis-tress. These recent endeavors are only a small sample of the work the Loudoun Chapter has been able to accomplish over the past 100 years. On behalf of Virginia’s 10th District and our great Commonwealth, I thank them for their hard work and dedication to our commu-nity, nation, and world. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join in recognizing the 100th an-niversary of the Loudoun County Chapter of the American Red Cross.

TRIBUTE TO CHRISTIE SULLIVAN 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Christie Sullivan for being named a 2017 Forty Under 40 honoree by the award-winning central Iowa publication, Business Record. Since 2000, Business Record has under-taken an exhaustive annual review to identify a standout group of young leaders in the Greater Des Moines Area that are making an impact in their communities and their careers.

Christie is the Acquisitions and Divestitures Director for Kum & Go convenience stores. Over the past nine years, Christie has gained significant insight into how departments within an organization best interact to optimize suc-cess. Outside of work, she is involved in the Kum & Go Women’s Network, Women’s Lead-ership Council and Commercial Real Estate Women. She and her husband Zeb are the proud parents of three beautiful daughters, Zoe, Elsa and Onnika. Mr. Speaker, it is a profound honor to rep-resent leaders like Christie in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I applaud her today for utilizing her talents to better both her community and the great state of Iowa. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Christie on receiving this es-teemed designation, thanking those at Busi-ness Record for their great work, and wishing each member of the 2017 Forty Under 40 class a long and successful career. AMERICAN HEART MONTH HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give additional recognition to the tireless advocacy of the staff and volunteers of the American Heart Association, as well as the organizations in my home state of New Jersey and across the country and to mark the end of American Heart Month. Their ongoing efforts to combat the leading cause of death among men and women are essential, this month, and every month. On February 7, 2017, in an effort to raise par-ticular awareness of the risk this disease poses to women, the Coalition for Heart and Stroke, which I co-chair, held a briefing in co-ordination with the American Heart Association and WomenHeart: The National Coalition for Women with Heart Disease. Despite the fact that heart disease is the number one cause of death among women in the U.S. and almost 400,000 women succumb to this disease an-nually, heart disease is often erroneously thought of as a man’s disease. Awareness campaigns like Heart Disease Month aim to correct misinformation and can help save lives. Among the issues discussed at our Feb-ruary 2017 Heart Month kick-off was the im-portance of having women, in representative numbers, in federally funded studies so that we can understand how heart disease pre-sents differently in women; if current diag-nostic methods are effective in detecting car-diovascular disease (CVD) in women; and if women react similarly to men to different therapeutic treatments. On February 14, 2017, the American Heart Association released a new study that in-cluded projections for the prevalence of heart disease in 2035. These projections show that in the next two decades, the number of Ameri-cans with CDV will rise to 131.2 million peo-ple. This represents a dramatic increase from the last report, published in 2011, which esti-mated that 100 million Americans would suffer from CVD by 2030. However, the previously projected estimate of 100 million was already surpassed in 2015. That same year, the death rate from heart disease rose by 1 percent for the first time since 1969. This report also shows that by age 45, the risk of developing CVD rises to 50 percent, and it increases to 80 percent by age 65. Not only does CVD extract a devastating human toll, it is also the costliest disease in America, inflicting a $555 billion impact in 2016. The report released last week indicates that by 2035, the cost of heart disease will ap-proximately double to $1.1 trillion. That cost is borne in no small part by the American tax-payer, with CVD accounting for significant spending through Medicare Fee-For-Service. While heart disease and stroke account for 27 percent of all deaths combined, the NIH in-vests only 7 percent of its budget on related research. That is why, as co-chair of the Congres-sional Coalition on Heart and Stroke, I have worked to increase funding for critical pro-grams at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For FY 17, the Heart and Stroke Coalition requested $3.4 billion for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and $1.8 billion for the National Institute of Neuro-logical Disorders and Stroke. Despite the $2 billion increase in funding for NIH in FY 2016, NIH’s purchasing power was 19 percent less than in FY 2003 last year. This loss has occurred at a time of heightened scientific opportunity and enhanced investment in the scientific field by other countries. We need to restore our purchasing power for NIH and capitalize on investments to improve health, spur economic growth, innovation, and advances in science. The Coalition also requested $160.037 mil-lion for CDC’s Heart Disease and Stroke Pre-vention Program. Funding for this CDC pro-gram goes toward State Public Health Actions on Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention as well as for the actions to prevent obesity and diabetes. Funding for this also goes into na-tional surveillance on stroke and heart dis-ease. The Coalition additionally requested a com-bined $42 million for CDC’s Million Hearts and WISEWOMAN (Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women across the Nation) pro-grams. These programs offer preventative health services, referrals to local health care providers, and lifestyle programs and health counseling tailored to identified risk factors for those most vulnerable. American Heart Month has motivated life- saving initiatives across the country. For in-stance, in my home state of New Jersey, in my district, the Monmouth Medical Center, Southern Campus is on the forefront of the fight against CVD. This year, the Medical Cen-ter hosted its fourth annual American Heart Month event on February 11, providing cardiac screenings to nearly 100 people. February 22, 2017 marked the first annual National Heart Valve Awareness Day. This year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has for the first time ever listed this day on the National Health Ob-servances Calendar. More than 5 million peo-ple in the U.S. have been diagnosed with this particular disease, which involves damage to one or more of the heart’s four valves and can result in reduced blood flow, causing the heart to work harder and the body to get less oxy-gen. Tragically, more than 22,000 people in the U.S. die from this condition every year. It is my hope that inclusion of this day in Heart Month will raise awareness of the risks of heart valve disease among those at risk, as well as the medical community. I am honored to once again serve as the co-chair of the Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition, which was founded in 1996 for the purpose of raising awareness of the seriousness of cardiovascular diseases and to act as a resource center for heart and stroke issues, including biomedical research, quality and availability of care, health promotion and disease prevention. Over the past twenty-one years, this bi-partisan, bi-cameral coalition, which now numbers nearly 150 members, has also worked to advance public policy aimed at fighting cardiovascular diseases. I would like to acknowledge my colleagues who are fellow members of the Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition and thank them for their efforts. I encourage those members who have not yet joined the Coalition to do so.

I would also like to thank WomenHeart and The American Heart Association for their dedi-cation and impact and look forward to con-tinuing to work in cooperation with them throughout this Congress. Those suffering from cardiovascular dis-ease, as well as their loved ones and care-givers, need vocal advocates on Capitol Hill to ensure access to quality care and treatments. We have a duty to see that programs aimed at combating CVD, as well as medical re-search for prevention and treatment of stroke and heart attacks are supported appropriately at a federal level. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress and with advocates across the nation as we con-tinue this critical work throughout the year in the fight against America’s number one killer. RECOGNIZING SARA THOMAS FOR HER COURAGOUS SERVICE AND COMMITMENT TO CAL FIRE 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 28, 2017 Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an outstanding leader in my district, Sara Thomas of Indio, California. Sara was a re-markable leader, firefighter, wife, mother, and daughter. She had a deep passion for serving others and giving voice to the voiceless. Sara spent her career serving residents in the Coachella Valley with dedication and pas-sion, and was widely respected by her com-munity. As a firefighter with the California De-partment of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), Sara was a source of strength and an anchor of hope to those around her. For sixteen years, Sara protected countless individuals in moments of tragedy. She began her career in 2000 as a seasonal Firefighter 1 in El Cajon, California, and then in the San Benito-Monterey Unit. In 2004, she transferred to the Riverside Unit as a limited term Fire-fighter II. Four years later, Sara became a per-manent firefighter with the Riverside Unit. She last served with Fire Station 80 Unit in Indio, California. Sara was not only an impressive firefighter, but also a dedicated mentor to emerging young leaders. Her work inspires me. In December of 2015, Sara was diagnosed with cancer. Her family and loved ones stood with Sara throughout her battle until the end. Sara will be deeply missed, but her spirit will live on through the legacy of her work. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize and honor Sara Thomas. She is an example to all of us to serve our community with courage and passion.
