Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, tonight at the President’s address, I will be joined by a young man, Eliel Aguillon, a new American, in the great tradition of this great country. Eliel grew up surrounded by poverty, yet he found his path to the American Dream through hard work and education. Eliel is my neighbor. He attended the same public high school 
that my daughter attends. He is the first person in his family to attend college, and his goal is to earn a Ph.D. in engineering and to address our Nation’s affordable housing crisis. Today, Eliel encourages young students to pursue careers in science and math. Eliel is a DACA student. Let me repeat. Eliel is a DACA student. He and his family left Mexico when he was 7 years old to pursue the American Dream through hard work and dedication. We must ensure that Eliel and hundreds of other hardworking DACA students stay in America, the only home they have known, so that they can also contribute to the greatness of our great country. DACA students are our new Americans. Let us help our great Nation stay great. Let us do the right thing. Let’s give our DACA students and other hardworking taxpayers in our Nation a pathway to citizenship. 
VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING DO NOT BELONG IN SHACKLES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in her formative years, Lena wore turtlenecks and baggy clothes to school every day. Why did she do so? To hide the bruises that covered her entire body. Soon, Lena’s abusive foster mother lost custody of her. And when her foster mother lost custody, Lena just ran away. She was 13. After bolting from the front lawn at the Houston middle school, she ran into a friendlylooking stranger, and that is when she discovered a false sense of comfort in the hands of a dastardly human trafficker. He offered to look after her, protect her, and love her; that was if she made him a little money. And he offered her the one thing she was missing in her 13 years, someone who said they loved her. Mr. Speaker, love doesn’t come with black eyes and bruises, however. The trafficker even promised Lena drugs so she could focus on something else while she was having sex with the buyers of children. For the next 3 months, Lena would have many different traffickers and many different buyers. She would spend a few months or weeks with them, moving from motel to motel, then she would get scared and try to go back to foster care, and then just disappear again. Finally, she was arrested after police responded to an internet post advertising sex with children. They arrested her trafficker in the hotel next door. With her help, the police ultimately charged two individuals with forcing a child into prostitution, or human trafficking, as we call it. Upon her arrest, it was revealed that not only did she have three sexually transmitted diseases, she was also pregnant. The problem then, Mr. Speaker, is that Lena had nowhere to go. Authorities found themselves with an abused, traumatized, demoralized trafficking victim, a child, on their hands. Remember, Lena was a victim of crime. She was not a criminal. Children cannot be willing prostitutes under the law. But there were no resources to put her anywhere, no resources to get her help and the support that she needed. The very limited number of nearby trafficking shelters were all full and there was no place to send her, so she was locked up in the county jail. Victims of trafficking, Mr. Speaker, do not belong in shackles and orange jumpsuits. They belong in safe, nurturing environments. They deserve to have access to resources and help to get their stolen lives back for them. How can a victim begin to recover, while a child, languishing in jail? The justice system failed Lena and many others just like her, but it doesn’t have to be this way. Lena deserves justice. Sitting here in Washington, D.C., there is a victims’ fund totaling over $12 billion. Money in this fund comes from fines and fees imposed on convicted felons, people like deviants who trafficked Lena. Unfortunately, year after year, only a small amount of this money is actually taken out of the fund to help victims. Most of it stays in the fund and is used by appropriators to offset the costs of their pet projects that have nothing to do with victims of crime. This is not acceptable, Mr. Speaker. The money, remember, is not taxpayer money. It is money that comes from criminals when they are convicted in Federal court, and we should give this money to victims of crime. Money in the fund should be spent only on what victims like Lena desperately need so that they can get their lives back together and recover from the trafficking abuse they suffered. Lena and other trafficking victims deserve justice. They deserve the money that is in the fund, and bureaucrats need to quit using that money as an offset for other projects. The victim fund is partially the answer. Mr. Speaker, this should be spent on victims of crime because no trafficking victim belongs in the shackles of a county jail. And that is just the way it is. 
SENSELESS ACTS OF GUN VIOLENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. TORRES ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Jonah Min Hwang, another victim of a senseless act of gun violence. Jonah was only 8 years old when he was killed last week in a driveby shooting in my home city of Pomona. Jonah, his parents, and his brother were enjoying dinner hosted by friends of his parents, two schoolteachers, when a bullet ripped through the house and hit Jonah. Crimes like this are heartbreaking. A talented soccer player, an avid reader who loved superheroes, Jonah was an adopted child from a Taiwanese orphanage just 3 years ago. It eats at your soul to think that such a young child with his whole life ahead of him could be taken so ruthlessly. Perhaps most frustrating is that Jonah’s killer is still at large. When I first heard of Jonah’s death, it brought me back to a similar tragedy when I served as mayor of my home city of Pomona. In 2006, little Ethan Esparza was shot and killed while he was playing in his front yard during his birthday party. He would have turned 4 years old. Ethan’s murder shocked our community and was a stark reminder of the violence that plagues our city. Sadly, over 10 years later, we are still fighting those same battles. The murders of Jonah and Ethan were completely senseless, but they are not rare. In fact, Pomona was recently ranked California’s eighth most dangerous city, which doesn’t surprise those of us who have seen gangs take ahold of our city. Our local police department puts their lives on the line every single day to try to keep us safe, and our local officials have made significant investments in law enforcement. During my time as mayor, we implemented gang injunctions to try to get hold of the problem. b1015 But as the number of guns on the streets continues to rise and ruthless gang members get their hands on these deadly weapons, it often feels like a losing battle. We are alone fighting these battles. As a matter of fact, today marks the 23rd anniversary of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, better known as the Brady bill, which has blocked more than 3 million people who had no business owning a gun from buying a gun from a federally licensed dealer. As the new President makes his first address to Congress today, it is especially infuriating that, despite the countless gunrelated tragedies occurring across our country, this Congress and this new administration have not taken one single step to reduce gun violence. I have come to this floor before demanding action, and I stand here before you yet again today, Mr. Speaker, to demand action on behalf of Jonah, of Ethan, and of the millions of innocent lives lost. There are steps that we can take immediately to expand the Brady bill to save lives and make our communities safer: First, we should close the loophole that allows guns to be sold online or at gun shows without background checks. 
Second, we should make sure that there are resources available to research gun violence—research. We can’t find effective solutions if we can’t research and understand the problem. Lastly, we should enhance the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS, and make sure that States are inputting records in a way that allows Federal agencies to run complete background checks on individuals. Background checks are only as effective as the quality of the records in the background check system. There is no excuse for making it easy for dangerous people to get their hands on a deadly weapon. It is my deepest hope that this Congress will take action on gun control so that none of us has to attend another vigil in Pomona—or anywhere else in America— to honor the memory of another child taken from us much too soon. We owe it to the victims and to their loved ones to act. 
AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) for 5 minutes. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not only to celebrate African American History Month, but to celebrate two stories lost to mainstream history. The first story is the original Underground Railroad, and the other story is of Josiah T. Walls. Students across the country have heard stories about the Underground Railroad during the Antebellum Period; however, there was a Road to Freedom that existed before the United States was even established, and that road went south to the free territory of Spanish Florida. In fact, the National Park Service held its sixth annual Underground Railroad Conference in St. Augustine in 2012 to highlight this very story which started with eight recorded families seeking freedom in 1608 in Florida. During this period, thousands of men, women, and children fled from the colonies of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. These individuals headed to Florida to gain their freedom thanks to the Edict of 1693, which was issued by the thenSpanish Government that stated that any man, woman, or child who found their way to Spanish Florida would be granted freedom. The people at the heart of this story are the Gullah Geechee who trace their lineage to West Africa. Once free in Florida, the Gullah Geechee people thrived, establishing communities, forts, and deep roots throughout Florida’s Third Congressional District, roots that still can be felt today. The second story is of Josiah T. Walls. He was a man who was born into slavery in 1842 in Virginia. He worked as a slave. The Civil War broke out, and he was conscripted by the Confederate Army to serve as a cook in the Civil War. He got freed by the Union soldiers, served with the Union soldiers, and after the war, he moved to Florida to fight in the Seminole American wars. During that time period, the war ended, and he moved to Gainesville, Florida, where he became the first AfricanAmerican mayor of our city where I come from. During that time, he became a very successful businessperson. He was elected to the Florida Assembly, and then later he was elected to the U.S. Congress, serving in this very body here today. His elections got challenged, and he lost his role as a Representative in the House. He ran again the next year, won again, and served a full term. Then the third term he ran, he won again. His election got challenged by a Confederate soldier, and he lost his seat. He went on to become a prominent businessman in north central Florida, owned a farm, and was very successful until the freeze of 1906, which put him out of business. He moved to Tallahassee and became a newspaper owner and printed a local newspaper. He rose to prominence, but at his death, he was but a footnote in the histories not just of our State, but of our country. Here is a man that was born into slavery, rose to prominence, and was forgotten by history. I tell these stories because these stories, like many stories in our early history, must never be forgotten and must be remembered by our history lest we repeat it. It must also be taught to our children so that they are inspired and they see themselves in the history books like these other folks. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Chaplain Harvey Klee, American Legion National Chaplain, Bluffton, Texas, offered the following prayer: Almighty God, we thank You when heroic leadership has been undertaken in this House during times of crises, for their labor well into the night, for efforts to seek compromise where compromise is warranted, and for creative solutions proposed and acted upon in the best interests of the American people. May unity prevail even when parties are in conflict. When progress is impeded and negotiations break down, grant them fresh ideas for discussion and ultimate resolution. May all Members of this House remain faithful to the oath of office they have taken as Representatives of ‘‘We the people . . . ’’ and may political ideologies be tempered by intellectual honesty. Lord, bless this land we love so much and save us from our own selfinflicted wounds. This we pray in the name of all that is holy. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. ENGEL led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING CHAPLAIN HARVEY KLEE The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent of mine who is here with us today. Chaplain Harvey H. Klee, a resident of Llano, Texas, joins us today as the national chaplain of the American Legion. We just heard Chaplain Klee give a beautiful invocation, calling for us all to be unified in our actions, with the best interest of the American people at heart. Chaplain Klee has dedicated himself to living by those words, serving our Nation and its people in many ways. Chaplain Klee served in the Navy during the Korean war and later worked as a missionary helping drug addicts and designing training programs for inmates at a prison in California. Later, he founded the Texas Chaplains Association, and has been appointed Texas Department Chaplain nine times, which is more times than any other chaplain in the history of the department. Chaplain Klee, thank you for joining us today and reminding us of the great power of our Lord, Jesus Christ. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I am proud today to have Dr. Mona Hanna Attisha, the daughter of IraqiAmerican scientists, the physician who helped expose the Flint water crisis, as my guest at the joint session and the address by the President tonight. Simply put, Dr. Mona, as her patients call her, is a hero. Her persistence exposed a terrible manmade crisis that poisoned my hometown, and she has been an incredible partner in the fight for resources to help fix the problems in Flint. Her personal story of coming to America from Iraq reminds us of the many important contributions that immigrants make. In Donald Trump’s world, though, Dr. Mona may not have been there for Flint kids. She is an Iraqi immigrant. In Donald Trump’s world, she would actually have been turned away. She would not have been the hero to thousands of Flint families. She is the epitome of what makes America great and what it means to be an American citizen. She stood up for what was right. She exposed the facts in Flint, Michigan. In the face of bullying, she spoke truth to power, and she persisted. She is a hero. She is what makes this country great. She is what is good about the United States of America—an immigrant to this country who stood for the people of my hometown. She is a message, and her presence here today is intended to send a message to the President of the United States and to the rest of the country that that is what makes America great. She adds to the fabric of this country, and I am grateful to have her here today. 
REVOKE PASSPORTS OF THOSE WHO JOIN FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, over 260 Americans have traveled to Iraq and Syria to fight for known foreign terrorist organizations. When they return back to America, they are not coming back to open up coffee shops. They are coming back to do mischief against us. The most important job of government is to protect the citizens. That is why my colleague, BILLKEATING , and I have introduced the Foreign Terrorist Organization Passport Revocation Act. It directs the Secretary of State to revoke passports of those Americans who have joined foreign terrorist organizations. They are still citizens, but they cannot travel back to the United States or to any other country. The only way they come back to the United States is under arrest by law enforcement in handcuffs. This is a bipartisan bill that will stop these Benedict Arnolds from coming back at all. If someone takes arms up with our enemies, that person deserves to be treated like an enemy. And that is just the way it is. f 
WELCOMING BRUCE BAILLIE TO THE JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, when you come in to Bremerton, Washington, on the ferry, you see one of my favorite sights. It is Building 460 of the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and it says on the side of the building: ‘‘Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Building on a Proud Tradition.’’ Puget Sound Naval Shipyard is far and away the largest employer in the region I represent, and these are men and women who take great pride in their work and have done so for over 125 years. They are also critical to the success of our Navy’s national security mission, but too often in this town, they don’t get the respect they deserve. That is why my guest this evening is Bruce Baillie with the Bremerton Building and Metal Trades Council. Bruce is a local leader for our shipyard workers, and I want to make sure that this new administration understands how important this workforce is to our country. These are not just talented professionals. They have been amazing partners in putting together an action agenda for shipyard workers that we introduced last week: exempting our shipyard workers from the hiring freeze which is critical to our Nation’s security, making sure that retired servicemembers—our veterans—are able to secure jobs in our Defense Department, and halting policies that lower the compensation of defense workers—changes in per diem and overtime policies that affect their take home pay. It is important that we have the backs of these vital workers, and that is why I have invited Bruce Baillie as my guest this evening. 
RARE DISEASE WEEK ON CAPITOL HILL (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week marks Rare Disease Week on the Hill. Many Members of this House will meet with patients, caregivers, physicians, family members, and advocates from across the country about how their lives are impacted by disease. The National Institutes of Health considers a disease rare if it affects fewer than 200,000 people across the United States. Many times the disease is accompanied by uncommon or mismatched symptoms that make diagnosing the illness difficult, and many times such illnesses are without a cure. Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress, I was a healthcare professional, and I have seen firsthand how devastating a disease or injury can be to an individual and to families. I welcome the rare disease community to Washington this week, and I look forward to meeting with Representatives from the Fifth District of Pennsylvania, including Tom Weiser, James and Jean Rickard from Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. Education can help shape healthcare policy, Mr. Speaker, to better meet the needs of the rare disease community, and I am pleased to be a part of that conversation. f 
DONALD TRUMP AND VLADIMIR PUTIN (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, last week I hosted a dozen of constituent events in my district. At every turn, families asked the same question: When will Congress investigate the President’s involvement with Russia? I have received many calls and e mails about Russia for weeks. The American people are deeply and rightly concerned with this administration’s involvement with the Putin regime. We know the President’s handpicked national security adviser was forced to resign over his communications with Russia. We know that if Moscow did indeed influence our free elections, we have a duty to stand up against those threats and not sweep them under the rug. We do not support Putin’s human rights record, his treatment of journalists, or his invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, where my grandmother was born. So why is the people’s House protecting Vladimir Putin? Why are we not standing up to President Trump and investigating his dealings with the Putin regime? What are we afraid of? To my colleagues on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, what are you afraid we will find out if we investigate? Mr. Speaker, when are we going to get answers for the American people? Lastly, I welcome Chicago WVON’s Matt McGill and Planned Parenthood’s Donna Miller to tonight’s joint session. 
E PLURIBUS UNUM (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, what a wonderful country that we live in. It is wonderful because we have come—maybe some because of the Statue of Liberty’s wonderful words or others who have come in different ways, we are different, but we are one. Tonight in his message, wouldn’t it be well to focus on our unity and not our divisiveness? Since the election, there have been 1,000 hate crimes. And, of course, in the last 72 hours to last week, two Indo Americans—Indians—engineers, one dead, one shot. And the perpetrator indicated in his words: I shot two Middle Easterners. What kind of hate is being generated? It has been generated, and it needs to cease. We need to have a speech tonight that will speak to the unity, speak against antiSemitism and the attacks that are going on the Jewish community. We need to recognize the distinctions and the differences. We need to stop the siege against Hispanics, mass deportation, African American discrimination and others, women and many others. This needs to be a time of unity, respect, and dignity. I will be waiting to hear and to see what kind of America are we going to be guided by and what kind of America will we live in? I hope for the best. 
ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, health care is important to every family in America. The Affordable Care Act increased access to health care for about 20 million Americans. Is the Affordable Care Act perfect? No bill that has ever been debated on this floor and passed is perfect. Let’s make our goal not to have anyone who received access to health care to lose it. We need to make it better and to guarantee access to quality health care for all Americans. America can do better. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP NEEDS TO WORK WITH ALL PEOPLE (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I have long prided myself on working across the aisle to get things done for my constituents and all the American people. That is what the American people want: a government that grapples with tough issues in a constructive way. Unfortunately, since January 20, the new administration has shown no interest in working with the Congress on both sides to tackle problems, including Russia’s unlawful interference in last year’s election. That is why I decided not to stand on the aisle in the House Chamber to shake the President’s hand during the joint session of Congress, as I have done in the past through Democratic and Republican administrations alike. This will be the first time during my 29 years in this House I have made this decision. I have deep respect for the Presidency, and I will attend the joint session, but that respect between the branches must be mutual. The President has attacked the free press by calling it the enemy of the people. He has rejected America’s traditional role welcoming refugees who have helped to make our country great. He has cozied up to Vladimir Putin, the strongman who attacks our democracy. He has moved to gut the Affordable Care Act. He has looked the other way when threats against the Jewish community have increased in the recent year. This isn’t part of our normal political discourse. This goes beyond ideological and political differences. The President needs to work with all people. Therefore, I will listen to what he has to say today, but I will not greet him and shake his hand. f 
b1215 PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 998, SEARCHING FOR AND CUTTING REGULATIONS THAT ARE UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME ACT, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 83, DISAPPROVING THE RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO ‘‘CLARIFICATION OF EMPLOYER’S CONTINUING OBLIGATION TO MAKE AND MAINTAIN AN ACCURATE RECORD OF EACH RECORDABLE INJURY AND ILLNESS’’ Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 150 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on House Resolution 150, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act, and H.J. Res. 83, a resolution disapproving a Department of Labor rule relating to employee recordkeeping. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate for each piece of legislation, equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the 
chairman and ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee. The rule also provides for a motion to recommit for both pieces of underlying legislation. Additionally, the rule makes in order 12 amendments—11 from our friends across the aisle—to the SCRUB Act. Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from Chairman CHAFFETZ and Congressman C ARTWRIGHT on behalf of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Congressmen BYRNE and C OURTNEY on behalf of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Both pieces of legislation before us today take steps to remove unnecessary burdens that the government has levied on hardworking Americans from coast to coast. The regulatory burden in this country is staggering. In fact, the Code of Federal Regulations spans more than 178,000 pages and contains more than 1 million regulatory restrictions. Let’s let that sink in for just a moment, Mr. Speaker. Let’s think about that for a second. 178,000 pages and over 1 million regulatory restrictions. An average of nearly 12,000 new restrictions are added each year. Let me be clear. Some regulations are necessary. They are completely what we need to have. I don’t believe that all regulation is bad. So before we go down that path, let me just say that this is a fact, and we can continue this. I believe we need clean air, clean water, smart standards for how we handle nuclear energy, and worker protections, just to name a few. I also believe that we have allowed the regulatory scheme to run amok. Congress has ceded power to agencies, which have implemented more and more regulations, oftentimes with less and less benefit to Americans. Far too many regulations offer our citizens minimal benefits at confounding cost. Taxpayers and businesses alike are withering under regulations that are outdated, irrelevant, and nonsensical. Do we really need a regulation to mandate what kind of latch a baker uses on a flour bin? Do we really want to tell people that their dishwashers are forbidden to use enough water to actually clean their dishes, forcing them to wash their dishes twice rather than it actually conserving water? Unfortunately, these stories aren’t works of fiction. They are real regulations put in place by Federal agencies. We have to take steps to restore common sense to the regulatory process and clean up the regulation roster. It is time we identify and abolish those regulations that are pointless, those that prevent people from doing their jobs, and those that are inefficient and ineffective. The SCRUB Act, Mr. Speaker, takes steps to do just that and contributes to our efforts to rein in overregulation. The SCRUB Act, introduced by my friend from Missouri, Congressman JASON SMITH, establishes a bipartisan Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission to identify unnecessary rules that are hindering economic growth. The commission will then identify which rules need to be repealed immediately and which ones can be addressed by more flexible procedures outlined in the legislation. The commission will report these findings to Congress, and Congress can then vote on these recommendations and take steps either to begin immediately repealing regulations or implementing a CutGo process. Importantly, the commission created by the SCRUB Act will also ensure that redundant regulations from different agencies will be reviewed. Currently, agencies implement their directives absent a systemwide view, meaning that overlapping and even conflicting regulations are enacted far too often. From conversations with my constituents in northeast Georgia, I have witnessed how overregulation is stifling growth in our communities. The remedy for this economic anemia is to get unnecessary regulations off the books and, instead, focus on enforcing regulations that are actually achieving benefits for our neighbors. The second piece of legislation that this rule provides for also returns us to reasonable policies that reinstate the spirit of the law. H.J. Res. 83, introduced by my fellow Rules Committee member, Congressman BYRNE from Alabama, utilizes the Congressional Review Act to overturn a rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. Worker protections are critically important, yet they lose their purpose when they fail to protect workers and jobs effectively. Too often, OSHA forgets that mission, and the rule we are talking about today is the latest example of misguided regulatory zeal. In the waning days of the previous administration, OSHA put forth a final rule implementing punitive standards on employers, a move that contradicts the underlying statute. Under the law, employers are required to record and maintain logs of workplace injuries and illnesses that occur during a 5year period; however, the employers can only be cited for recordkeeping violations within a 6month time period. Now, think about what was just said here. They have to keep it for 5 years, but they can only be cited for violations within a 6month time period. This arrangement is constructive. Logs should be kept up to date so that businesses can make informed decisions about health and safety in the workplace. This requirement encourages businesses to improve safety measures in a timely manner. However, the previous administration decided to rewrite the law through regulation in a way that penalizes and burdens small businesses without achieving meaningful benefit. OSHA finalized a rule that would extend the threat of penalty for recordkeeping violations up to 5 years. Aside from ignoring existing law and court decisions that directly contradict this new regulation, OSHA has chosen to punish small businesses for paperwork violations rather than focusing resources on improving worker safety. We can agree that keeping our workplaces safe is nonnegotiable, but OSHA has repeatedly overstepped its mission in order to collect fines and apply oppressive rules at the expense of opportunities to cultivate healthier working conditions. It is time to bring this regulatory mischief to an end, which is why I am glad to see this resolution of disapproval to overturn the most recent OSHA overstep. Mr. Speaker, both the SCRUB Act and the resolution of disapproval provided for by this rule take commonsense steps to unlock the regulatory shackles Federal agencies have put on our economy and taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate. Mr. Speaker, I rise to debate the rule for consideration. As my friend across the aisle has already noted, this rule bundles together two unrelated pieces of legislation. We are developing a pattern here of doing that in the Rules Committee. The first of these is H.J. Res. 83, a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval that seeks to overturn a Department of Labor rule on workplace injuries, undermining workplace safety and health in the process. The second measure is H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act, which establishes a new commission to review Federal regulations with the aim of needlessly politicizing and, thereby, undermining the regulatory framework that keeps our air clean and our water safe to drink. I note that my friend on the other side of the aisle did not mention that this commission will cost $30 million for work that last night’s presenter at the Rules Committee said that Congress can do, the argument being that Congress doesn’t have enough staff so we are going to send it over to nine people and pay $30 million, starting, to have them do the work that we in Congress should be doing. Beginning with the CRA resolution— the 14th such resolution considered by the House this month—the Republican leadership is continuing its onslaught against wellthoughtout and measured regulations. I get it. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House. They are desperately trying to ram through their priorities before anyone notices what they are doing. It is interesting to me, Mr. Speaker, where the Republican majority has focused its attention throughout the past month. I can’t help but notice that 40 days into Donald John Trump’s administration, he has not put forth one single jobs measure. Democrats, on the 
other hand, continue to talk about the need for good, wellpaying jobs. The United States Senate put out the Democrats’ trilliondollar jobs plan that anybody can read on their website on where we stand when it comes to wellpaying jobs. Yet, as we advocate for our plan to rebuild our Nation’s infrastructure and create over 15 million jobs in the process, Republicans pass measures to drugtest applicants for unemployment insurance and repeal rules that require Federal contractors to disclose violations of Federal labor and worker safety laws. This resolution repeals a Department of Labor rule pertaining to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The rule in question requires employers to keep and maintain accurate records of every recordable injury and illness in federally mandated logs for a period of 5 years. It is worth mentioning that this policy has been upheld in cases dating back to 1993. The rule, when implemented, added zero new compliance obligations, zero new reporting obligations, and cost a total of—you guessed it—zero dollars. Yet, once again, this is what we are spending our time on this week: repealing a thoughtful rule designed to protect workers. I am particularly concerned by this resolution as it actually jeopardizes workplace safety by allowing employers to avoid penalties for the underreporting of injuries over many years. Longstanding workplace hazards will and can certainly be masked. b1230 This makes it less likely that employers or employees will take corrective actions or that OSHA will find the hazards when they do an inspection, leaving workers in danger. It is also worth noting that due to its very small budget, OSHA is only able to inspect a workplace, on average, once every 140 years. You heard me correctly, once every 140 years. That makes data even more important. Yet, by diminishing the reliability of a worksite’s injury data, which some employers systematically underreport, this resolution also takes away OSHA’s ability to protect workers from the most significant hazards. Mr. Speaker, throughout the past week, concerned Americans attended town halls across the country, and for those who were actually able to meet with their Republican representative in Congress, the conversations focused on protecting health care, creating jobs, and protecting the environment. At these meetings, constituents did not ask for fewer workplace protections, they did not ask for Congress to act to make it easier for people with severe mental illness to purchase guns, they didn’t ask for Congress to ease disclosure requirements for oil companies making payments to foreign governments, and yet these are the things the Republican majority has already chosen to focus on this month. Watching the news, I did not hear one person say: if only Congress would repeal anticorruption rules, undermine my retirement security, and then allow endangered animals on national wildlife refuges to be killed using inhumane methods, if only Congress would do these things, my life would be better. Not one person, Mr. Speaker. Yet, in the past month, the House voted to do all of the things that I just mentioned. I submit to the American people watching at home right now that this is the face of today’s Republican Party. Tell me who you think is really on your side. Turning our attention to the SCRUB Act, this bill would establish a $30 million commission with unlimited subpoena authority that is empowered to dismantle longestablished, science based public health and safety standards. The SCRUB Act would undermine the ability of agencies to react to immediate public health threats by adopting the regulatory CutGo process. The CutGo system is, in my opinion, completely detached from reality. This requirement will prohibit agencies from issuing any new rules, even in the case of emergencies or imminent harm to the public, until they repeal an existing rule to offset the cost. Along with bills that have already come to the House floor under this Republican Congress, as well as Donald Trump’s executive actions mandating a regulatory freeze, this legislation demonstrates a continued attack on standards set in place to protect American families. I guess it is not all that surprising that my Republican friends are pushing through legislation that prioritizes corporate profit over health and safety of the American people. Whether it is denying access to women’s health care or rolling back environmental protections, Republicans are making it clear where their allegiances lie. For a party that prides itself on being antired tape, the SCRUB Act strangely duplicates existing requirements to conduct retrospective reviews of rules, rules on top of rules on top of rules. Our regulatory system should work for all American families and encourage companies to run safe, forwardthinking businesses. This legislation would move us in the opposite direction. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I enjoy coming down here. I love being a part of debating and coming here to the floor. My friend from Florida and I do that quite regularly in the Committee on Rules, and it is a good thing. He has brought up a lot of bills over the last month. He listed out a list of horribles that was all discussed on this floor. I would encourage everyone to go back and look at the other side, as Paul Harvey used to say, and the rest of the story. So for all the list of horribles, Mr. Speaker, we also need to balance on the votes that were cast on this floor and the debate had on this floor was not a onesided affair. It was two, and the applicants were going. The other thing that just struck me, Mr. Speaker, was this, especially dealing with the CRA, the records. It was interesting to see that this was a carefully thoughtout proposal. It was not a carefully thoughtout proposal. It was a reaction to a 2012 court case, the Volks case, in which the three D.C. Appellate Court judges, including Henderson, Brown, and Garland, said: OSHA, you can’t do this, you can’t go back and maintain the records and then only be able—what the law actually says is, punish within 6 months of this. So this is not long and thought out. It was a way, as was established in the Volks case, actually the case said: ‘‘We do not believe Congress’’—these were the judges speaking—‘‘expressly established a statute of limitations only to implicitly encourage the Secretary to ignore it.’’ So this goes back to the heart, Mr. Speaker. If we are wanting to discuss the face of a Republican majority that is listening to the Constitution and the American people saying we need relief from some of these regulatory burdens in which good people—I will never not state that good people work in these agencies, but when you give good people a job, and you tell them to go do something and to sit in their cubicles or sit in their offices and say how can I come up with more regulatory, they are going to do it. Americans are the best workers in the world. They are going to use their talents. The problem is when you put them in a position in which many times their talents do not equal what is happening in the real world. Mr. Speaker, you have seen that in your State. I have seen that in my State. In fact, we have seen it in Florida, as well, and other States. It is simply bringing us back to commonsense reasoning in this in saying why, when you cannot by law punish this, why are you keeping it? The court actually also made an interesting statement as well in this, and in one of the footnotes it said: ‘‘That OSHA did not cite Volks for a failure to retain injury records when that is the only conduct for which the statute of limitations would not have clearly expired suggests that OSHA had, at some point, correctly understood that an unmade record cannot be said to have not been retained and that an employer’s obligations with respect to making and keeping records are distinct.’’ The idea that you are somehow going to harm recordkeeping here—which is a separate violation, by the way, which has nothing to do with the keeping of the records 5 years, let’s at least get this process straight here. If you do not, as an employer, record workplace injuries and record these incidents, you are in an issue there. You are violating the law there. So let’s look at this. 
OSHA has a great place. It should be the teaching arm. It should be the encouraging arm for every employer to look to for best practices and standards on how to do what I believe every employer here inherently gets up every morning wanting to do. They do not want to have a workforce that is hurt, maimed, or put at risk in their jobs every day. Instead, OSHA has morphed, over time, and this body is partially to blame. It has morphed into something that, frankly, has left its Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It has become punitive. It has become a way of not being helpful, but yet actually hurtful in the marketplace. So as we look at this, as we talk about this—and I appreciate my friend from Florida, and he makes a good case for his side—I am going to simply make the case for our side that when you look at regulatory burdens that shouldn’t be there, when you are looking at it, as we just talked about, where every regulatory burden does not come down to clean air and clean water. Every regulatory burden we talk about does not come down to clean water, clean air, or working on airplanes or anything else. There are some that just simply are in the way in business. Like I mentioned earlier in my talk concerning how the linchpin on a baker’s can actually should work. Really, Mr. Speaker? So in this issue, let’s continue to move how we are, let’s continue to put forward commonsense regulations. We can disagree, and that is why that vote total on that board will show up in just a little while. But at the end of the day, who is on your side? It is the Republican majority who says: let’s get to work safely, helpful, let’s make sure everybody has the opportunity to continue to do what they intended to do, but do so in a sense that makes sense and doesn’t continue to be punitive. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the passion of my friend from Georgia. I would suggest to him that I am amused that he would get in the weeds in a rather substantial legal opinion. A portion of it he correctly cited, but he omitted the continuing part of the judge’s remarks that said that, indeed, you could go back and put forth a resolution. I find it particularly amusing that my friends on the other side, after not granting that judge a hearing so that he could become a Supreme Court Justice, now want to say what a great judge he is and what a great amount of work he does. Shame on everyone who did not give him an appropriate hearing. But I understand what it is to steal a Justice of the Supreme Court, and that is what my friends on the Republican side did. This judge’s opinion continued on to say that you could establish regulations. Mr. Speaker, up until now, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed his tax return information. These returns have provided a basic level of transparency that has helped to ensure the public’s interest is placed first. The American people deserve the same level of disclosure from Donald John Trump. If they continue to refuse to provide it, it is incumbent upon us, as the people’s elected representatives, to hold the executive branch accountable. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring Representative ANNAESHOO ’s bill which would require Presidents and major party nominees for the Presidency to release their tax returns. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. ESHOO ), my good friend and classmate, to discuss our proposal. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), my friend, classmate, and wonderful colleague, for yielding time to me. I rise today in opposition to the rule and the underlying bills. I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that this bipartisan bill that I have written, the Presidential Tax Transparency Act, can be made in order for immediate floor debate and a vote. The Presidential Tax Transparency Act would require the President and all future Presidents and Presidential nominees of the major parties, Democrats and Republicans, to publicly disclose their tax returns. It came as a surprise to many Americans, during the 2016 campaign, that this disclosure was not required by law. Instead, we have had a tradition of voluntary disclosure among every President of both parties since the postWatergate era. Until now, our Presidents have recognized that those who seek or hold the most powerful office in the world should be held to the highest standard of transparency. Donald Trump is the first President to refuse to release his tax returns since Gerald Ford, a man of the House. I remember when his remains were brought to the Capitol where he rested in the rotunda but came by the doors of the House. He was a man of the House and a man of integrity. b1245 He along with a host of others, Democrats and Republicans, voluntarily released their tax returns. But Mr. Trump’s 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission shows that he has 564 financial positions in companies located both in the United States and around the world, including relationships with stateaffiliated businesses in several countries. Why is this important to note? The President had an opportunity to resolve these potential conflicts of interest by divesting and placing his business assets into a true blind trust, as other Presidents have done, Republicans and Democrats. Instead, he chose to turn over control of his business to his sons in an arrangement that the Director of the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics called ‘‘wholly inadequate’’ and ‘‘meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective.’’ Since he is taken office, these ethics concerns have been borne out in the form of his and his campaign’s connections to Russia, deeply, deeply troubling to all of us and to the American people, legitimately so; his family’s potential new business dealings in the Dominican Republic and Uruguay; and the hiring of a ‘‘director of diplomatic sales’’ at his Washington, D.C., hotel to attract highpriced business among foreign diplomats. This is deeply unsettling, to say the least. Simply put, the President’s business empire makes him more susceptible to conflicts of interest than any other President in the history of our country. Three of the President’s nominees have already withdrawn their names from consideration due to potential financial conflicts of interest. Only a full release of the President’s tax returns will provide the public with clear information as to his potential conflicts of interest and his potential entanglements with foreign governments and foreign businesses. Last night, here on the floor, the House voted along party lines, unfortunately, to block an effort to obtain the President’s tax returns under the House’s existing authority. Today, we have another chance to honor the will of the American people and write this important disclosure tradition into law—into law. According to a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, 74 percent of Americans believe the President should release his tax returns—74 percent. The top petition on the White House website has over 1 million signatures to it, calling on the President to release his tax returns. I think the voice of the people, the American people, is clear. As their representatives, they deserve to have us take action on this because we all want a conflict of interestfree President. I urge my colleagues to reject the previous question so we can hold an immediate vote on the Presidential Tax Transparency Act. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As my friend from Florida just said, I think we can sum it up very easily right here on this discussion. And, no, I did not choose not to continue the other quotes in the ruling which were, again, pretty amazing. I will just say 
this. The reason is because I was saving it for now. They said: Well, you can go ahead and do a new regulation you can make them keep for 5 years. But as an Old Scripture taught me years ago: all things may be lawful, but not all things are profitable. You can do some things, but, in the end, are they really getting at the end result of what OSHA is supposed to do? Are you protecting employers and employees? Are you making the workplace safer? And right here, we are just not seeing that. I think what is also interesting as we look at this is let’s just have common sense in this. You still cannot punish up to 6 months. The court actually even said also, as well, as much the same on page 13 of their opinion. I think what we have to look at here is, in looking at this, let’s talk about the issues of common sense; let’s talk about regulatory burden that works instead of regulatory burden that does not. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This evening, Donald John Trump will address a joint session of Congress. I expect we will hear some version of the same message we have heard throughout the first month of his chaotic administration—talk of jobs and American workers and protecting our country—but that is all it has been up to now, just talk. Instead of actually doing any of those things, Republicans are sowing chaos trying to turn their absurd campaign speeches into something that resembles policy; and, frankly, that just will not fly. Donald John Trump’s campaign rhetoric doesn’t fit the actual challenges of governing, and I believe my friends on the other side of the aisle are starting to come to this realization. If they haven’t, may I urge upon them that the rubber is going to hit the road with the debt ceiling and with tax reform and with repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act. I ask the American public to watch the divisions on the other side when the rubber hits the road. Mr. Speaker, with every action they take, reality and facts keep stopping them in their tracks. The unAmerican Muslim ban was put in check by the judicial branch. Their attempts to repeal ObamaCare have been checked by their own constituents at their own townhalls. The majority needs to wake up and realize that these are not sound policies, but reckless chaos. It is past time for the majority to get serious about the serious business of governing. And yet, with these measures here today, all we continue to see are antiworker, antienvironment, and, in the final analysis, antiAmerican proposals. The American people want solutions, not a governing party that just checks the box of unrealistic, chaotic, and harmful campaign promises. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule and the underlying measure. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As we come to the close of this time of rule debate, I think we have laid this out. I think, again, it is very clear, Mr. Speaker, what we determine and what we go forward with in the process. As we move forward, it is interesting to me—and I would be, too, if I were in the minority and didn’t really have a plan except the one that has been tearing up the health insurance market, that has been hurting others. And now as we look to actually make movement on a replacement and repeal of that, I would say that I would watch for divisions. I would watch for cracks and the fissures. I would do whatever I could. But the truth of the matter is that, over the next month, in this body, we are going to move forward with what we have said we are going to do. We are going to be working on those aspects. We are going to be bringing it to the floor, and the American people can make the judgment for themselves. People will continue to discuss. It is healthy in our country to have that discussion. It is healthy that we move forward. It is also healthy we examine all of the facts. This rule today, though, simply deals with common sense. Let’s look at our regulatory burden. Let’s look at issues that—again, it is one thing to look at a rule that is there for protection. Workplace safety is enhanced by making you record what is going on and making you be able to then correct what may be a problem in your business. But simply keeping records for 5 years when you can’t be punished but for 6 months of those is simply putting a burden on business to keep records that are really at the end of the day not accomplishing your bottom line. It goes back to what I said earlier, Mr. Speaker. I believe that OSHA is a valuable organization when doing what it is supposed to be doing: protecting workplace safety, doing things that actually matter, doing things that actually help. But many times in my businesses that I go to, they have put in rules over the years that say that we are now in a continuing violation. In other words, if one time they come in and they say that an electrical outlet is not plugged in properly to an extension cord, you fix that. When they come back 2 or 3 months later and see something on the other side of the building that deals with electrical, then they will say, well, it is a continuing violation, not the violation previous, and they triple the fines. OSHA now, and the good folks who work there, I believe, truly want to help. They truly have set out best practices. But they have grown to the point where we have allowed them to become not the help that they should be, but are basically and many times a hindrance and a menace to our businesses, from the farms to the factories, to the coal mines, all that. It has just gotten out of hand. So my discussion, Mr. Speaker, is this. How do you get regulatory burden that actually makes sense? We are not going to stand here and argue over a rule that makes sense. I will never sit here and say that we should not record workplace injuries and let businessowners then be fined if they are doing something wrong. We will never argue about that. But when it comes to the point of excessive recordkeeping that, at the end of the day, does nothing except burden the business, how do you explain that as helping workplace safety? If my son is in the pool and can’t get to the side and I do nothing, I can have great intentions; but unless I get in and bring him to the side, then I have actually done something. A rule that has no end result to the bottom line of what you are doing is simply waving and saying, ‘‘Oh, I am doing something,’’ instead of getting back to the purpose that OSHA should be about. When businesses and OSHA cannot work together collaboratively to seek and to set a process in which businesses are safer and employees are healthier, then OSHA is failing and they have become punitive in nature. Why don’t they come in and help businesses? Why don’t they come in and start? And if there is a business that continues the process of being bad actors in the marketplace, then take them out, fine them, do what you need to do. But I, myself, believe that most businessowners—and I was one at one point—that we don’t go in every day wanting to hurt employees. We don’t want to do that. We want to have a safe workplace that presents a good product, that presents a good service, that presents the activity that continues our economic engine. Let’s quit defending rules that don’t work. Let’s quit wasting time defending rules and having our agencies in this city determine that all they want to do is generate rules because that is their job description. Let’s see the things that actually work. If they want to be policy experts, then let them run for office. But if you are going to at least look at it, do it by the law. Mr. Speaker, these rules before us today provide two very important bills that take steps to get our economic engine going again. They do, as we have talked about, look at unnecessary rules. They look at things that need to be examined. But we also can’t simply pretend existing nonsensical regulations don’t exist, because they are being enforced at the expense of innovators and job creators across the country, and they are being enforced without using any common sense. A case in point, did you know that trains have to have an F painted on the front of them so that people can tell which end is the front? I don’t know about you, but I believe Americans can tell the front from the back of a train. We have got to identify existing business regulations like this that are outdated and simply don’t make sense 
anymore and start taking steps to repeal them. The bills before us today are a step in the right direction. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. HASTINGS is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 998. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 150 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 998. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. PALMER ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1421 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 998) to provide for the establishment of a process for the review of rules and sets of rules, and for other purposes, with Mr. PALMER in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Utah (Mr. CHAFFETZ ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 998, the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act, also known as the SCRUB Act, was introduced by our colleague JASON  SMITH. I happen to be a cosponsor of this bill, as well as the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ), the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ), the chairman of the Committee on Rules. We rise in support of this bill, the SCRUB Act. Regulatory accumulation is a significant problem for the Federal Government. Year after year, Federal agencies add regulation after regulation, piling on to an already very complex and crowded regulatory system. The Code of Federal Regulations, also known as the CFR, has some 178,000 pages. These are the regulations that you are supposed to understand if you are in a business—small business, big business, mediumsized business. It contains more than 1 million regulatory restrictions. Every year the Federal Government adds, on average, nearly 12,000 new regulations on top of those. The regulatory accumulation has considerable impact upon our economy. According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, regulatory compliance hurts economic growth by pulling nearly $1.8 trillion out of the economy. Regulations are particularly hard on small businesses that don’t have the legal resources and the wherewithal to understand all of the complexities. Many small and mediumsized businesses will be doing things that they don’t necessarily even know or understand could be problematic. There is room for regulation, don’t get me wrong. I am not suggesting there should be no regulation, but we are trying to clean up some of this regulation and weed out the good from the bad. The SCRUB Act will enable the government to do so, and that is why I appreciate our colleague JASON SMITH for championing and bringing this bill to the floor again. The SCRUB Act establishes a bipartisan—and I can’t say that enough, a bipartisan—Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission to conduct a comprehensive review of Federal regulation. The commission’s goal is to reduce regulatory costs to the economy by at least 15 percent. The act charges the commission with identifying outdated, obsolete, and unnecessary regulations in need of repeal or amendment. The commission gives priority to those regulations that are 15 years old and older. I think that is an appropriate direction that they should go. The commission will consist of regulatory experts chosen on a bipartisan basis and confirmed by the United States Senate. They will take a governmentwide look at the regulatory system, allowing for impartial and wideranging review of outdated and unnecessary regulations. This is not a new or a partisan concept. In fact, in 1978, President Jimmy Carter issued an executive order requiring agencies to ‘‘periodically review their existing regulations to determine whether they are achieving the policy goals.’’ In addition, every President since has required some level of retrospective regulatory selfreview by those agencies themselves. In fact, it was President Obama who issued three executive orders on regulatory review. He required agencies to develop retrospective review plans and to set priorities for implementing that review. The commission is tasked with identifying regulations that ought to be repealed or amended. The commission will use commonsense criteria to determine whether regulations are overlaps, duplicates, or just flatout conflicts with existing regulations. After expedited congressional approval, agencies are required to repeal some regulations based on the commission’s recommendations. So you have people who are selected, they are Senate confirmed, then they bring forward a package that is allowed to be viewed by Congress. Some have said, well, you know, this is excusing Congress from its duties. Quite to the contrary. The committees, Members, everybody should be paying attention to this, but to have a bipartisan group go out and look and make a recommendation, then it is up to Congress whether or not to accept it. We need to go through the House, the Senate, and be signed on by the President in a bipartisan way because there 
will be Members from both sides of the aisle who will be able to appoint members. Other regulations would be subject to innovative, regulatory CutGo procedures. The CutGo process gives agencies flexibility on how to prioritize regulatory elimination. It allows agencies to choose which regulations to repeal or amend and at what time. However, new regulations may not be promulgated until equally costly regulations are repealed. The SCRUB Act gives agencies the direction and momentum needed to implement the regulatory reform our economy needs. We all know that regulations can improve health and safety; but sometimes, with the best intention, these outdated and excessive regulations hurt our economy and put other people in jeopardy. The accumulation over decades is something that should just simply be reviewed. I think it is pretty hard to argue that a review process is unwarranted or unneeded, given the amazing and impactful status that it puts upon those things that are damaging our economy. I again want to thank JASON SMITH for his leadership on this issue. I also want to thank Chairman BOBGOODLATTE and the Judiciary staff for their dedicated work on this, as well as Chairman PETESESSIONS for his good work on this. A lot of good people have worked on this. I do support it. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC, February 16, 2017. Hon. BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN : On February 14, 2017, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported without amendment H.R. 998, the ‘‘Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act of 2017’’ (SCRUB Act) by a vote of 22 to 17. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, with an additional referral to the Committee on the Judiciary. I ask that you allow the Committee on the Judiciary to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on the Judiciary represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration, to memorialize our understanding. Thank you for your consideration of my request. Sincerely, JASON CHAFFETZ , Chairman. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY , Washington, DC, February 21, 2017. Hon. JASON CHAFFETZ , Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN CHAFFETZ : I write with respect to H.R. 998, the ‘‘Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act.’’ As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions within H.R. 998 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 998 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House Senate conference involving this or similar legislation and asks that you support any such request. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 998 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 998. Sincerely, BOBGOODLATTE , Chairman. 
complex, and potentially very expensive new bureaucracy to review existing agency rules and make recommendations for the repeal or weakening of those rules with little meaningful oversight, transparency, or public accountability to ensure that these recommendations do not subvert the public interest.’’ In addition, Citizens for Sensible Safeguards, a coalition of more than 150 consumer, labor, and goodgovernment groups, also oppose the bill. This bill could have dangerous consequences for the health and safety of the American public; therefore, I strongly urge every Member to oppose it. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. ROSS). Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for allowing me this opportunity. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS ). Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, America is home to some of the most creative, innovative, inspirational people imaginable. When empowered, Americans design and build in ways that change the world, and change it for the better. But far too often, our innovators are bogged down by red tape, thanks to a government that thinks it knows better how to think, how to believe, how to run their businesses, and how to live their lives. It is not only making life more difficult. It costs us nearly $2 trillion a year. That is about $15,000 a family. So we are rolling back these regulations and offering muchneeded relief to families and businesses across the country. Thanks to my good friend, Representative JASON SMITH’s leadership, the SCRUB Act provides another powerful tool that gives control back to the American people through their Representatives. This bill creates a long, overdue process to identify ineffective, outdated, and duplicative regulations for repeal, with priority being given to the older, major, more expensive rules. We made a promise to the American people. Their voice matters in our government. We are going to do whatever we can to restore that voice and put it at the center of every decision we make. I am proud of Representative SMITH’s work to rein in government. I am proud to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN), a very distinguished member of our committee. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member. Mr. Chairman, there are many troubling aspects of this bill, but most pressing is that this legislation, without clear policy rationale, caters to demands of my Republican colleagues to slash existing regulations and muddy the process of passing new ones. Congress already has a responsibility of reviewing existing rules and mandating reform. Why delegate that to those not elected to do so? This unsettling bill spends millions of taxpayer dollars to create a hand picked commission to do the job of Congress without accountability. No, thank you. This unelected and unaccountable commission, appointed by the President and Congress, would submit regulatory changes without the opportunity to amend the measure, taking regulatory review out of the hands of the agency experts. This is counterproductive and an insult to the democratic process. To add insult to injury, this bill makes the regulatory process transactional. By forcing agencies to repeal regulations in order to adopt a new one, we risk public health and safety. Why have they prioritized costs over benefit? Why are American lives on the chopping block? I urge my colleagues to vote no against this bill. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SMITH). Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, on January 20, America witnessed the end of the most regulationhappy Presidency in American history. Under the Obama administration, the pages of the Code of Federal Regulations reached the highest level in the history of our country. The Obama administration issued 3,037 finalized regulations, which means almost two new regulations were added each and every day on American farmers, families, and small business owners. Regulations from the last administration alone cost taxpayers $873 billion. That is a burden of over $12 million an hour added by the Obama White House on the American taxpayer. Back home in Missouri alone, the cost of complying with regulations just added by the Obama administration totaled $19 billion, which is equal to over $9,000 in costs per person. Regulations written by unelected bureaucrats in Washington are suffocating the very farmers and smallbusiness owners who we need to hire and expand in order to get full workforce participation. Today, we are considering a solution to this problem with the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act, otherwise known as the SCRUB Act. The SCRUB Act’s objective is to reduce the overall cost of regulations by at least 15 percent. With the passage of the SCRUB Act today, we are simply putting the tools in place to support what President Trump has already started. During his first full week in office, President Trump authored an executive order for the purpose of reducing regulation and controlling regulatory costs. The order is simple. For every new proposed regulation, two existing ones must be taken off the books. This order will help prioritize regulations truly in the best interest of the American people and remove ones that are outdated, burdensome, and costly. And just last week, the President began a regulatory review task force to review existing regulations. The SCRUB Act mirrors and supports the President’s actions, ensuring that our regulatory burdens never again reach the heights that they are today. The SCRUB Act makes sure that farmers, smallbusiness owners, and families impacted by Washington regulators have a seat at the table in prioritizing which ones the Trump White House should remove. We must help the President put an end to the Washingtonknowsbest mentality that has polluted our Nation’s Capital and plagued the American people for the past 8 years. Many of you voted in favor of this legislation last Congress. However, with this new administration, the American people are calling for us to change the way things are done in Washington. So it is my hope that you will join me once again in helping put an end to the Washington regulatory machine. I also call on my colleagues on the other side of the Capitol, who seem lately more bent on obstruction, to reevaluate why their districts and States sent them to Washington. I am hopeful they will consider supporting the legislation, policies, laws, and nominations that will help alleviate the burden of an oversized Federal Government. With the SCRUB Act, we have a real opportunity to shrink the size of government and get Washington off the backs of the American people. I want to thank Chairman CHAFFETZ  and Chairman GOODLATTE for bringing this bill up today, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the SCRUB Act. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ). Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, a great leader in our Congress, and someone who I admire greatly. The only thing clever about this bill is the title. Everything else about this bill is truly diabolical. The SCRUB Act isn’t going to clean anything up. Its toxic suds will just make people sicker, our environment dirtier, and our products more dangerous. Creating an unelected commission to oversee the entire regulatory policy of the United States is undemocratic and unimaginably damaging. Essentially, five people appointed by the President 
H.R. 998 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act’’ or as the ‘‘SCRUB Act’’. 
The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget shall review and certify the accuracy of agency determinations of the costs of new rules under section 201. The certification shall be included in the administrative record of the relevant rulemaking by the agency promulgating the rule, and the Administrator shall transmit a copy of the certification to Congress when it transmits the certification to the agency. TITLE III—RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF NEW RULES 
This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take effect beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act. 
The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to the bill shall be in order except those printed in House Report 115–20. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . CUMMINGS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 115–20. Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chair, as the designee of the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ), I offer amendment No. 1. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 5, line 16, insert after ‘‘reviews.’’ the following: ‘‘During the twoyear period prior 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chair, I am very pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ), the maker of the amendment. Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, my amendment today is meant to address only one of several troubling provisions in the bill. As my colleagues have pointed out, the SCRUB Act is a radical approach to deregulation and would prioritize cost savings through repeal of rules without considering their public benefit. The underlying bill would also prohibit agencies from making any new rules— even in the case of an imminent threat to public health or safety—unless the cost is offset by repealing an existing rule. We have heard often on this floor my Republican friends rail against regulations promulgated by faceless bureaucrats. Well, this bill seeks to accomplish all of this through the work of an unelected commission—faceless—with virtually unlimited subpoena authority and jurisdiction over every existing regulation. This body would work in the shadows to roll back environmental and workplace protections, putting dollars and cents over public health. The legislation grants so much in the way of authority, but comes with so little in the way of oversight, transparency, or public accountability. President Trump and my friends on the other side of the aisle like to talk a lot about draining the swamp. Madam Chair, what the Republicans are proposing today makes a swamp look like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, all at the cost of $30 million to the American taxpayer. My amendment today would bring a modicum of transparency and ethical oversight to the shadow bureaucracy by requiring commission members to follow the same financial disclosure rules as Members of Congress, congressional staff, or any Federal official. My amendment would also ensure that commission members don’t come in through the ‘‘revolving door’’ by inserting a requirement that the individual must not have been a registered lobbyist at any point during the previous 2 years. Congress not only has the authority, but the duty to review existing regulations and, when necessary, to mandate reforms. But I understand why Republicans want to delegate this work. Because who wants to be the one to recommend rolling back rules governing clean air, clean water, food safety, workplace protections, domestic violence, victim protections, and many other rules that are in place to keep Americans healthy and safe? Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment simply to give transparency, openness, and clarity to the people who will be making the decisions under the SCRUB Act. Mr. ROSS. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROSS. Madam Chair, although I am not in opposition to the amendment, I do wish to speak in support and further explain my support, because I believe that the gentleman from Virginia offers some very good merit to his amendment. The amendment clarifies that the commissioners are covered by the Ethics in Government Act, which is in line with current law. Commissioners should be free from financial conflict as much as any other Federal employee should. The Beyer amendment prohibits the appointment of a commissioner to the retrospective regulatory review commission who has been a registered lobbyist in the previous 2 years. Ensuring commissioners are not lobbyists with financial interests in the commission’s work is in line with the commission’s goal of identifying wasteful or unfair regulations. The 2year ban allows genuine experts with some past lobbying experience to contribute their knowledge to the commission. This provision is very similar to the President’s 2year ban on former lobbyists working in the administration. For those reasons, I do support the amendment. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chair, I have no further comments. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ). The amendment was agreed to. b1500 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . DESAULNIER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 115–20. Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
purchasing mitigation equipment, but does that employer truly save money if his health insurance premiums go up due to associated respiratory illness? When the majority pushed to eliminate the Department of the Interior’s stream protection rule, thereby allowing mountaintop mining companies to dump potentially toxic mining debris in nearby streams, there was little consideration to the costs associated with mitigating the inevitable drinking water contamination and healthcare costs of those who will be sickened after drinking contaminated water. This amendment ensures that Federal agencies, at the very least, consider the health impacts and costs associated with eliminating a regulation. This amendment will help to go a long way in preventing unnecessary healthcare costs, which I hope we can agree is a positive improvement to the bill. If my colleagues across the aisle insist on eliminating Federal regulations, I hope that they agree that at least we can make sure that this independent commission will at least consider the benefits of public health as they do their analysis. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this commonsense amendment. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act. As currently drafted, the SCRUB Act requires federal agencies to repeal existing regulations to offset the cost of new regulations. The bill also authorizes up to $30 million for a new commission to review the Code of Federal Regulations and recommend regulatory repeals. This commonsense amendment ensures that impacts to public health, including the costs associated with those impacts, are considered under processes established by the SCRUB Act. This is a reasonable improvement to the bill ensures that federal agencies appropriately consider the true costs and benefits of federal rules with an eye towards saving hardearned taxpayer money. As a member of the California State Senate, I helped to enact legislation focused on promoting public health throughout the state while saving taxpayer dollars. Based on the sensible premise that understanding the impacts of government actions on public health not only saves lives, but saves money. This effort helped provide California state agencies with the direction they needed to effectively collaborate on the complex environmental, financial, and sustainability factors that contribute to poor health and inequities. Over six years of existence, this policy has resulted in increased collaboration across state agencies, saving taxpayers money while promoting improved public health throughout the state. Today, U.S. taxpayers face a growing burden of largely preventable chronic illnesses. Heart disease, stroke, obesity, and diabetes are but a few of the myriad health issues that millions of Americans face every day that also drive many of their financial and professional decisions. In many of our most disadvantaged communities, fewer resources are available to benefit health outcomes that are clearly seen in the levels of chronic illness and shorter life expectancies. It doesn’t take a genius to connect the dots of government policies on public health and our economy. If the goal of this legislation is to eliminate existing regulations to pay for new regulations, doesn’t it make business sense to understand the impacts of those decisions on public health? For example, eliminating the Department of Labor’s Silica Rule might save an employer the expense of purchasing mitigation equipment, but does that employer truly save money if his health insurance premiums go up due to associated respiratory illness? When the Majority pushed to eliminate the Interior Department’s Stream Protection rule, thereby allowing mountaintop mining companies to dump potentially toxic mining debris in nearby streams, there was little consideration to the costs associated with mitigating the inevitable drinking water contamination and health care costs of those who will be sickened after drinking contaminated water. This amendment ensures that federal agencies, at the very least, consider the health impacts and costs associated with eliminating a regulation. This effort will go a long way in preventing unnecessary health care costs, which I hope we can agree is a positive improvement to the bill. If my colleagues across the aisle insist on eliminating federal regulations, it only makes sense to ensure that removing such rules does not harm the public. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘YES’’ on this commonsense amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. ROSS. Madam Chair, this commission that we have here in the SCRUB Act is established to clear out old and unnecessary regulations. It currently requires the commission to consider whether the rule could be repealed without significant adverse effects, whether the rule is unnecessary, whether the costs are justified by the benefits, and certain other criteria. I think that the consideration of public health certainly fits within whether the rule would have significant adverse effects, whether it is necessary, and whether the benefits justify the cost. Health, safety, and welfare of the American people is foremost to what we do, and I laud my colleague from California for filing this amendment. This amendment clarifies that the commission should consider the impact on public health of repealing any regulation. I think that, again, my colleague from California gave fine examples of that particular balance. We agree that we want regulations that are necessary to protect public health. I am excited to see one of my Democratic colleagues working with us to improve regulatory reform legislation. I look forward to future opportunities to continue this work. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Chair, I look forward to, in the future, working on true bipartisan regulation. I think it is one of those areas, at least in my experience in local and State government, that we should be working in a bipartisan manner. Unfortunately, this bill I do not believe accomplishes that. So regulatory oversight is probably the most important thing we could do, and I hope that we can do it in a bipartisan way in the future. I would encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. DESAULNIER ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MS . MCSALLY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 115–20. Ms. MCSALLY. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. Ms. MCSALLY. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of the underlying legislation, H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act, and urge adoption of my amendment. The Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission created in the SCRUB Act is an important tool to help Congress reclaim its constitutional role of serving as a check to the executive branch and will help bring back jobs and opportunity to hardworking Americans. In 2016 alone, the Obama administration added 97,110 pages to the Federal Register. That is over 75 times more than the Bible, without any of the good news. These rules and regulations accumulate with no relief and touch every aspect of life all the way down to recordkeeping for contact lenses, vending machine food labeling, and walkin freezer testing. Of the over 3,500 final regulations issued in 2016, 34 will cost over $100 million, and 105 are deemed to have significant impacts on small business. We 
1⁄2minutes remaining. Ms. MCSALLY. Madam Chair, again, my amendment is simple under the SCRUB Act. Right now, these agencies are not complying with the law. They have not submitted necessary reports to Congress and the GAO. So this amendment is simply asking, among other things that are being reviewed in this act, that we take a look at which reports have not been submitted, therefore, which are not in compliance with the Congressional Review Act so that we can decide whether any of those would be appropriate for disapproval resolutions or, quite frankly, whether the rule is even one that should be enforced because it hasn’t complied with the law. This is a good amendment. I appreciate our colleagues supporting it. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ). Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Chair, the cumulative cost of regulations in our country is now at the tune of $2 trillion, and it costs us $60 billion just to enforce those regulations every year. With all due respect, that is not window dressing. When you take a look at those numbers, it is clear to see that the bureaucratic state of our Federal Government is threatening our job creators and killing our economy. Today, we have an opportunity to reverse course on the stifling regulations flowing from Washington by passing H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act, as amended here by my colleague, Congresswoman MARTHA MCSALLY . The SCRUB Act will establish a commission to review existing Federal regulations and identify for Congress which of those place unnecessary costs on our economy. The amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) will take the SCRUB Act a step further by requiring this commission to consider for removal all regulations dating back to 1996 that did not comply with the law that states that there must be an accompanying report to Congress. According to the GAO, that is almost 30 percent of final rules. All of this is done in a manner consistent with my colleague’s standalone bill, the Require CRA Compliance Act, that I was also proud to join her in sponsoring. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. MCSALLY. Madam Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas. b1515 Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Chair, in closing, we owe this to the American people. We owe this to my children and your grandchildren. We owe this to our local job creators to break the chains of these burdensome regulations and, once again, unleash the spirit of American innovation and enterprise that made this country the envy of the world by passing the SCRUB Act and the McSally amendment. Ms. MCSALLY. Madam Chair, I want to thank Mr. ARRINGTON for his support. I want to thank Chairman CHAFFETZ and Mr. S MITH for their hard work on this important legislation. I want to urge the passage of my amendment and encourage my colleagues to support the underlying legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MS . PLASKETT  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 115–20. Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands. Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
My amendment is simple. It rescinds the authority to spend up to $30 million on a commission to do what Congress and the agencies already do. If you want duplication, look no further than this bill. It seeks to reduce the size of bureaucracy by establishing a new commission to serve a function already performed without the contribution of an additional $30 million in taxpayer funding. Now, $30 million may not be too much to the true benefactors of this bill on K Street, but to seniors, veterans, students, and workers all across this country, it can go a long way. For example, Social Security’s meager 0.3 percent costofliving adjustment for 2017 amounts to $4 more in benefits per month for the average beneficiary. That means that $30 million would be enough to double that costofliving adjustment for 7.5 million seniors. We all know that the cost of additional sequestration cuts on education, health, and the environmental protection loom at the end of this fiscal year. The double talk and schizophrenia of my esteemed colleagues on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee who pushed this bill through the committee has me truly concerned for the mental state of this Congress. They want to defund Planned Parenthood, but want to fund a ninemember task force at a cost of $30 million. They drag their feet and hem and haw to assist Flint, Michigan, in funding to promote clean water and save the lives of a community, but we can sure fund a task force to duplicate alreadycarriedout activities by the Federal Government so we can say we did it to the tune of $30 million. The chair of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee wouldn’t allow the people of the Virgin Islands, for 100 years as part of the United States, to receive $100,000 already earmarked for our interior. But, we have money for this bill. And let’s not discuss all the blockgranting discussions going on around here in this Congress. Today, the House majority is now asking to authorize $30 million on a bill that would handcuff enforcement agencies in their ability to respond to even more pressing new public health and safety problems. Let me be clear. Reducing the burden of unnecessary red tape on small businesses is a goal that we all share. I recognize that some regulation is burdensome, and there should be a review of the code to determine what can be consolidated or repealed to reduce compliance costs. One of the things that we seem to agree on is that retrospective review is helpful in the regulatory process. But, retrospective review is already going on with money that has already been authorized. All of the agencies have been required to do this under standing executive orders issued by President Obama. As has been discussed before, the results have been successful in reducing regulations. Agencies have yielded billions of dollars in cost savings and reduced reporting requirements through the modification of existing regulations. People in my district get it that there is a cost to protecting the environment, but they know that keeping our workers safe and our waters clean is worth it. There can be and is red tape that is unnecessary, and there is ongoing work and focus to eliminate and reduce that. Could there be ways to improve upon existing review regulations? There very well may be, and I am willing to work with anyone on a good idea. Even if $30 million were to come from elsewhere in the budget instead of additional spending, it would be that much less that agencies would have to conduct the already ongoing retrospective review process now going on. Furthermore, we in Congress also have existing responsibility to actively conduct oversight of government operations and make legislative changes as we see fit. There is simply no reason to spend $30 million on this messaging effort to ignore the successful work that is already going on by qualified people, and to hobble the ability of regulators to safeguard public health and safety in the process. This Congress has money to throw at solutions in search of a problem, but requires cost offsets to provide aid for victims of Flint or toward Zika funding. Please approve my amendment to save this money. Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ). Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of Ms. PLASKETT ’s amendment and just want to drill down on one point, which is, in the name of job creation, we have this bill before us, and we are going to spend $30 million which will, I suppose, create some jobs here in Washington with some folks who sit on the commission and the staff who are going to have to populate it. But just a couple of days ago, President Trump had the manufacturing CEOs of this country at the White House, and what they said was jobs exist, but skills don’t; that there is a skills gap in this country, and that we need to have job training out there to connect people to these jobs. Well, we have the Workforce Investment Act that was signed into law by President Obama in 2014, which created a framework for apprenticeship programs, advance manufacturing programs, all the things that these CEOs were talking about, and we are underfunding those programs—just to take one, the Adult Formula Grants—by just about $30 million. You want to create jobs? Don’t spend $30 million on this ridiculous commission when, again, we have so many other resources here in Washington to review regulations. Let’s put that money directly into the programs that will create the skill sets so that people can actually get a job to support themselves and their families. And don’t take it from us, take it from the CEOs who were with President Trump just a few days ago about the fact that at a time when we have jobs in existence, the fact that we are underfunding job training programs is just totally criminal. Let’s use this $30 million in a more productive way that will actually connect people to the jobs that are out there in the economy. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. LONG). The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, the commission is permitted, under this bill, to spend $30 million over 5 years for administrative purposes. By removing the funding in this amendment, the commission will not be able to hire staff, rent office space, establish the public website as required in the bill, or hold the public meetings, which are also required in the bill. This amendment essentially guts the bill. The commission established under this bill has a momentous job ahead of it. The Code of Federal Regulations totals more than 178,000 pages. This is approximately 36,000 pages of regulations for review every year of the 5 years the commission has to conduct its work. But it is not just simply reading the pages. There is work behind understanding whether the regulations are effective. There is outreach and public hearings to understand how the regulations are or aren’t effective. I believe the savings from eliminating unnecessary costs and the improved efficiency from weeding out unneeded regulations will far outweigh the resources applied to this effort. The Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that regulations impose a cost on the economy of $1.8 trillion. Who bears that cost but the consumers? This amendment would gut the bill. $30 million over 5 years is more than reasonable, considering the economic impact that these regulations have had on the American business and the American economy. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and support the bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by 
the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . MCNERNEY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in House Report 115–20. Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCNERNEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is straightforward. It exempts from the bill any agency rule relating to the physical and cybersecurity of the bulk power system, including any emergency action to protect and restore reliability. The bulk power system is comprised of facilities and control systems necessary for operating an interconnected electrical transmission network to maintain reliability. Our Nation’s electrical system touches each and every part of our lives, hospitals, schools, transportation, homes, businesses, and our national security. Our electrical system is the central element of our Nation’s critical infrastructure because all other components of our infrastructure depend on it. The electrical system is composed of 640,000 miles of highvoltage transmission lines and more than 6 million miles of distribution lines. This network is undergoing a transformation. There are an everincreasing number of devices that are connected to the grid; technological advancements are allowing for efficiencies and cheaper production of power, whether it is renewable energy or natural gas; and consumers have more choices and more control. With increased digitization, automation and interaction also have enhanced grid flexibility and security. While these developments present tremendous opportunities, such as new jobs and reducing carbon emissions, they also pose additional physical and cyber threats to the transmission and distribution systems. Stakeholders across the system are facing numerous new threats and challenges in detecting problems, responding to intrusions, and keeping rates affordable while maintaining reliability. The longterm health of the electricity sector is now, more than ever, a shared responsibility between communities, consumers, industry, and government. Despite these challenges, the bulk power system is an example of industry stakeholders and the Federal Government working well together, when needed, and working independently, when needed and succeeding. Transmission and distribution providers have taken it upon themselves to establish industryled standards, best practices, and supply chain management when it comes to grid security. They have worked well with NERC and FERC in developing Critical Infrastructure Protection standards for the bulk power system. These Critical Infrastructure Protection standards cover critical cyber asset identification, security management, personnel and training, electronic security, physical security, systems security, incident reporting and response planning, and recovery plans. There are 72 inactive CIP standards, and 11 that are now subject to enforcement. These standards aren’t always perfect, but they do represent compromise and collaboration. A wellprotected and reliable grid makes economic sense. Power outages and disturbances can cost more than $180 billion annually, and data suggests that electrical system outages attributable to weatherrelated events are increasing, costing the U.S. economy an estimated $20 billion to $55 billion annually. Electric companies are projected to spend more than $7 billion of their own money on cybersecurity alone by the year 2020, and are expected to invest nearly $53 billion to enhance the grid. b1530 These are significant investments, but essential investments as well. A more resilient, secure electric sector is something we all benefit from. It will continue to require investments at all levels, including from the Federal Government. We should enhance funding for our national laboratories that have partnered together via the Grid Modernization Lab Consortium. We should provide high levels of funding for the Office of Electricity and its mission to ensure the energy delivery system is more secure, resilient, and reliable. We must promote R&D that helps bring new, innovative technologies to the grid. We will always struggle to keep ahead of those bad actors who are seeking to attack us, but we can establish metrics, procedures, and technological capabilities that allow us to respond and adapt. I agree with many of my colleagues that we should work to identify and remove regulations that are no longer relevant. The Critical Infrastructure Protection standards have worked. My amendment ensures that Federal agencies will have the flexibility needed to respond to challenges without sacrificing any other necessary protections. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, this bill requires the commission to identify regulations that should be repealed. These are all regulations under the bill. While I appreciate my colleague from California’s efforts in his amendment, I just cannot support it. The commission focuses on rules and regulations that are out of date, no longer useful, and otherwise unnecessary or obsolete. No regulations should be exempt from this bill. Ensuring the physical and cybersecurity of the bulk power system is absolutely important and critical. We should know whether or not the existing regulations are effective and are useful. This amendment would prevent the commission from reviewing these important regulations and ensuring that they are current and effective. I would urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCNERNEY). The amendment was rejected. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in House Report 115–20. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 31, after line 24, add the following new title (and update the table of contents accordingly): TITLE VI—EXEMPTIONS 
The provisions of this Act do not apply to any rule or set of rules relating to the safety of the national airspace system. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chairman, my amendment today is a probusiness, proinnovation amendment. This would exempt any regulations that affect the safety of our National Airspace System. It is important to note that commercial drone operations are only possible because of FAA rules. Last August, the FAA’s small UAS rule—unmanned aerial systems rule—opened the door for small businesses to use unmanned systems easily and without cumbersome paperwork. 
The current inaction on the ‘‘flights over people’’ rule could limit UAS operations, such as news reporting, disaster relief, and public safety from becoming a reality. As a result, many businesses and the country could lose out on the full societal and economic benefits of UAS. Once UAS are fully integrated into the national airspace, the full benefits of these tools will help businesses to expand and our economy to grow—with a projected 100,000 jobs and over $82 billion in economic impact over the next decade. That is why this particular amendment is supported by the UAV Coalition as well as the Automated Vehicles Symposium. But we need action from regulatory authorities to fully integrate UAS into our airspace. Without my amendment, the SCRUB Act has the potential to stifle a growing industry and prevent the modernization of air traffic. I want to reiterate: UAS operators need guidance and regulations from the FAA so they can operate safely and without unnecessary paperwork. I urge the House to support my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned earlier, the bill requires the commission to identify regulations— all regulations—which should be repealed. The commission focuses on rules and regulations that are out of date, no longer useful, and otherwise unnecessary or obsolete. Again, no regulations should be exempt from this bill. Ensuring the safety of the National Airspace System is critically important. We should know whether or not the existing regulations are effective and useful. This amendment would prevent the commission from reviewing these very important regulations and ensuring that they are not only current but also effective. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chairman, investments into this particular industry are predicated on whether or not regulations are predictable. As a former smallbusiness man, I can tell you that investments will not happen if there is an unelected commission that exists that might change the very rules and regulations upon which current investments have been made. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, while I appreciate the argument about an unelected commission, I must say that these regulations are already being promulgated by unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats. Again, if we are going to have to have a review—an oversight—of our regulatory scheme, we should not exempt any regulations. I, therefore, would submit that this amendment would do just that. It would create a slippery slope of exceptions. Therefore, I, again, would urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chairman, as a smallbusiness man, I can tell you that small businesses rely on the predictability of regulatory rules and the regulatory regime. This commission is creating unpredictability in the system. Therefore, it is going to stifle investment, it is going to prevent innovation, and it is going to further throw a monkey wrench into our National Airspace System. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois will be postponed. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in House Report 115–20. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 31, after line 24, add the following new title (and update the table of contents accordingly): TITLE VI—EXEMPTIONS 
The provisions of this Act do not apply to any rule or set of rules relating to airport noise restrictions. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chairman, my second amendment to the SCRUB Act would protect the countless citizens, including many of my own constituents, who depend on airport noise restrictions to sleep through the night or learn uninterrupted in school. Thousands of my constituents near O’Hare International Airport benefit from these restrictions, as do the millions of people that live near major airports across the country. As the father of a 10monthold baby girl, I can speak from experience to the value of an uninterrupted night of sleep. Many FAA noise rules are the product of careful discussions between airports and local authorities. While noise restrictions have a slight economic impact on air carriers, the economic benefit to surrounding communities more than outweighs this. The unelected commission created by this bill should not have the ability to overturn restrictions that have been carefully considered by local governments, the FAA, and airport officials. Without FAA noise restrictions, people and businesses would suffer, Mr. Chairman. This would decrease property values in my district, make it harder for people to start a business, and have a negative effect on people’s health. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, everyone agrees that airport noise is very annoying. Effective regulations that protect our communities from unwarranted noise are very important. However, regulations that impose excessive and costly restrictions that are ineffective at achieving their goals do not help anyone. Why not take a look at these regulations and just consider whether they are working? If they are, then the regulation stays in place and we continue to protect our communities from unwarranted noise. If those regulations are not working, then we repeal them and put in regulations that achieve the goals and reduce costs. There is no reason why we should create special carveouts from the commission’s consideration. For those reasons, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chairman, these particular rules and regulations were crafted carefully at the local level, and I believe very strongly that this commission, which is a Federal commission, should not somehow upset the balance that has been achieved through local voices having a say in these particular regulations. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I will tell you that regulations are regulations. They need to be reviewed at every level. What the SCRUB Act offers is that opportunity. What this amendment does is limit that ability. 
For those reasons, I, again, urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chairman, the SCRUB Act should not have the ability to review regulations and rules that were developed by local people with local concerns in mind. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois will be postponed. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 115–20 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following order: Amendment No. 2 by Mr. DESAULNIER  of California. Amendment No. 4 by Ms. PLASKETT  of the Virgin Islands. Amendment No. 6 by Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI of Illinois. Amendment No. 7 by Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI of Illinois. The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote after the first vote in this series.
