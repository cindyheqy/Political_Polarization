Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, much has been said about the tumultuous times in which we live, and it is true, we do face enormous challenges. But I would like to remind the American people of the things that will get us through these times. My parents were part of the Greatest Generation. My father was a pilot in World War II, and I am honored to wear his Air Force wings. My mother was a mother of 10 amazing children, many of which are with me today. They are the best friends that I have ever had. Our parents taught us something that each of us has embroidered and now hangs on our individual family walls, and it is this: Our family’s motto is duty, honor, service to God, family, and country. We are, as Abraham Lincoln said: ‘‘The last best hope of Earth.’’ That was true when he said it. It is still true today. We created the miracle of the Con-stitution; we survived the catastrophe of the Civil War; we defeated com-munism, totalitarianism, fascism; we have the strength to get through the challenges that we face today. But it will only be true if we are true to that principle: Duty, honor, service to God, family, and country. f 
TAKE BACK HEALTHCARE FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, for far too long, Big Pharma has played by its own rules, benefiting from sky-rocketing drug prices on the backs of our most vulnerable populations. Back in 2003, legislation was passed establishing Medicare part D to make prescription drugs more affordable for people, but Big Pharma lobbyists influ-enced those policies and made it so there is a provision included that would ban the Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating lower prices directly with pharma-ceutical companies, something that the VA can already do today. Over 42 million Americans who are enrolled in Medicare part D continue to face rising costs on brand name drugs, fewer generic drugs, and higher pre-miums, making it difficult, if not im-possible, for many to fill their prescrip-tions. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Ne-gotiation Act to take back our healthcare from pharmaceutical com-panies and allow the Secretary of HHS to negotiate drug prices directly with manufacturers to secure affordable, lifesaving medication for millions of Americans.

E-VERIFY SAVES AMERICAN JOBS (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House Judiciary Com-mittee approved the Legal Workforce

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8230 October 26, 2017 
Act, a bill I introduced that saves jobs for citizens and legal workers. It re-quires U.S. employers to use the E- Verify system to check the work eligi-bility of all future hires. A September 2017 Washington Post- ABC News poll shows that 82 percent of voters favor requiring business owners to check the immigration status of prospective employees. E-Verify is the most popular immi-gration reform that reduces illegal im-migration. E-Verify is a free and quick system that already is used voluntarily by employers to cover one-third of the workforce. The Legal Workforce Act has the backing of both national business orga-nizations and immigration enforce-ment groups. This bill deserves the en-thusiastic support of all Members of Congress who want to put the interest of American workers first.

OPPOSING THE BILLIONAIRES- FIRST TAX PLAN (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, today, House Republicans will move one step closer to giving a budget-busting $2 trillion tax cut to the superwealthy on the backs of hardworking Americans, one step closer to increasing taxes on vulnerable Americans, one step closer to gutting Medicaid by $1 trillion and slashing Medicare by $500 billion, one step closer to decimating programs that help veterans, seniors, students, and families. Many families in my home district in Ohio are struggling—struggling be-cause they haven’t had a pay increase in over a decade. That is why, instead of pushing Donald Trump’s ‘‘Billion-aire’s First Tax Cut Plan,’’ we need to ensure that all Americans have a chance to achieve an American Dream by expanding the earned income tax credit, child care tax credit, and low housing income tax credit, not capping retirement contributions, and elimi-nating tax loopholes that allow U.S. companies to profit from shipping jobs overseas. Mr. Speaker, it is time that we pro-vide a level playing field for all fami-lies to truly help them have a better life.

C.J. RUDOLPH INSPIRES WITH GRIT AND PERSEVERANCE (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of C.J. Rudolph of Sellersville, Pennsylvania. C.J. was born in December 2015, at Grand View hospital. Before he was born, he tested positive for the Trisomy-21 gene, meaning that he was going to be born with Down syndrome. But his parents, Chris and Donna, had faith he would be a fighter. From day one, C.J. battled just to stay alive. He had two heart defects and was immediately put in the neo-natal ICU. As the condition became more critical, he was transferred to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and ultimately ended up at the University of Pennsylvania hospital. After 5 weeks at the University of Pennsylvania hospital, at the age of 58 days, C.J. underwent heart surgery per-formed by a miracle worker named Dr. Spray. Four days later, C.J. was finally able to come home with his parents. Mr. Speaker, at almost 2 years old, C.J. has overcome more obstacles than many of us will face in a lifetime. Today, C.J. serves as the inspiration of the Sellersville Fire Department and continues to inspire all those he en-counters with his grit and persever-ance. f

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8243 October 26, 2017 
Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Senate amendment to H. Con. Res. 71, the budget resolution for fiscal year 2018. Passing a budget is never easy, and it has, once again, been a challenge this year. But I am encouraged with where we are now, and I am pleased that the Senate did its work by approving a budget, one that we can support in order to unlock tax reform for the American people. Without question, there are plenty of things that I wish were included in what the Senate passed, ideas that the House put forward earlier this month when we approved our budget. For ex-ample, I still feel strongly about ad-dressing unsustainable mandatory spending, and that hasn’t changed. The growing burden of debt caused by man-datory spending is a real problem that cannot be ignored. We owe it to the American people to do something, to offer serious reforms that ensure government programs are financially sustainable and working well for generations to come, and I think we will tackle this important issue in the future. Really, we don’t have a choice. But despite any shortcomings of the Senate-passed budget, I am encouraged that it does reflect the shared prior-ities of both Chambers. Moving forward with this budget is also supported by our President. I want to remind my colleagues that before final passage last week, the Sen-ate did include numerous provisions previously passed by the House, and I was proud to be involved in those nego-tiations with the leaders of the House, the Senate, and the White House. For example, the Senate-passed budget creates a mechanism that would permit the Budget Committee chairman to adjust the budget alloca-tions if there is future legislation signed into law that revises the BCA spending caps. The Senate-passed budget also in-cludes numerous improvements to the House budget’s enforcement that are designed to strengthen fiscal dis-cipline. Because we worked together to find a common ground, we can move ahead toward tax reform and expand upon the ideas in the conservative framework unveiled last month. Throughout my nearly 7 years as a Member of the House, Republicans have talked about modernizing our outdated and overly complicated tax system, and today, we have the oppor-tunity to take that next big step to unlock tax reform for the American people, fulfilling the promise that we made long ago to our constituents. By advancing tax reform, we can help Americans keep more of their hard- earned paychecks; we can make it pos-sible for most Americans to file their taxes on a simple postcard; we can level the playing field for business and help them compete better globally; and we can empower entrepreneurs and small businesses, encouraging them to create more jobs. This budget acknowledges that our economy is in desperate need of a jolt, and the tax cuts included in the Sen-ate-passed budget hold that promise of doing just that. Put simply, we have the opportunity to make history by re-forming our tax system for the first time in nearly three decades. President Trump is with us on this, and I agree that we must move quick-ly, and that is why I urge my col-leagues to pass this budget today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b0915 Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the bill we are debating today is not a real effort at responsible budgeting. It is a means to an end: a single-minded plan to make it easier to enact tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations, regardless of the con-sequences for everyone else. If approved by the House today, an irresponsible $1.5 trillion tax bill will come to the floor in a matter of weeks. It is being rushed because Republicans don’t want the American people to know what is in it. They don’t want you to find out that it overwhelmingly benefits the wealthy while increasing taxes on millions of middle class fami-lies. Rushing through legislation that im-pacts nearly every American family and business is reckless, and voting on a bill that rewrites our Nation’s Tax Code a week or two after it is intro-duced without any real input from the people who will be impacted is neg-ligent. But that is what you do when you can’t defend your own policy. And there are a lot of unjustifiable provisions in this budget. On top of massive tax cuts for the rich, it cuts vital national investments, threat-ening our economic progress and our national security. It cuts more than $4 trillion in mandatory spending, includ-ing nearly $2 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid alone. The enormity of these cuts and the severity of the consequences for Amer-ican families cannot be overstated. But more cuts will be coming once the Re-publican tax cuts blow an enormous hole in the budget. We will see a tax on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, nutrition assistance—on important benefits that help American families get ahead. I know my Republican colleagues desperately want to believe that the tax cuts in their budget will pay for themselves and usher in a new era of economic growth—or at least they want the American people to believe that. But the record is clear, this ap-proach has failed time and time again. And now, even though the evidence and experts have concluded that these tax cuts will not create an economic boom but will, instead, lead to a higher concentration of wealth among the rich while dramatically increasing deficits and debt, my Republican col-leagues are trying to do it again. Everything we do in Congress should be about making the lives of American families better and more secure. We owe them a budget that invests in their future, a Tax Code that is fair, and a full and honest debate on both. This budget and the tax cuts that will fol-low are a failure on all fronts. I, therefore, urge my Republican col-leagues to abandon this dangerous budget and start addressing the needs and priorities of the American people. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks and to include ex-traneous material on the Senate amendment to H. Con. Res. 71. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentle-woman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. S
MITH). Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the chair-woman of the Budget Committee for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, we need to pass this budget not only to rein in out-of-con-trol spending, but also to give Congress the go-ahead on much-needed tax re-form. We need to reduce the tax burden on hardworking Americans. The typical household in the 21st Congressional District of Texas pays over $15,700 in Federal taxes. Past experience shows that tax relief generates strong eco-nomic growth. It enables Americans to save, invest, create jobs, and spend more of their income. Our vision of tax reform benefits families across America. For example, in my congressional district, one-sixth of households utilize the child tax cred-it. Increasing the child tax credit will help families keep more of their hard- earned money to use on child care or parental leave, school supplies, college savings, and other expenses associated with raising a child. Let’s help American families enjoy a more prosperous future rather than pay more of their hard-earned dollars to the Federal Government. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gen-tlewoman from Washington (Ms. D
ELBENE), a distinguished Member of the House Budget Committee and Ways and Means Committee. Ms. D
ELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this budget proposal. With many working families and businesses still struggling to adapt to a rapidly changing economy, our top pri-ority in Congress should be helping ex-pand opportunities, opportunities to sustain long-term economic growth

and security so no American is left be-hind. Unfortunately, the bill we are voting on today is not a serious budget de-signed to help middle class families. In-stead, this budget is simply a vehicle to rush through a partisan tax proposal using a process known as reconcili-ation. And what is worse, the Ryan-McCon-nell tax plan would add trillions of dol-lars to the deficit, making our children foot the bill for tax cuts that dis-proportionately benefit the wealthiest. In fact, the Tax Policy Center has esti-mated that the Ryan-McConnell tax plan could raise taxes by an average of $1,209 a year on families earning be-tween $50,000 and $150,000 a year. This is moving in the wrong direction. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. N
ORMAN ). Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution, which is a critical first step to achieving com-prehensive tax reform and making the American economy great again. I also applaud Chairwoman D
IANE BLACK for her leadership in producing this budg-et. Our Nation has not significantly re-formed our Tax Code in more than three decades, which has allowed the Tax Code to explode in complexity and unnecessary burden on hardworking American families and businesses. Moreover, while the United States is a world leader in innovation and entre-preneurship, we have failed to reduce our corporate tax rate, which stands at 35 percent, the highest in the developed world. And I would add, corporations don’t pay tax; the American people pay tax. The unified framework unveiled ear-lier this year will simplify the Tax Code for everyone, eliminate wasteful tax loopholes, and reduce taxes on businesses. I am also pleased to see that the plan eliminates the death tax on farmers and moves to full expens-ing. Under this plan, the average fam-ily will see an increase in income be-tween $4,000 and $9,000, annually. While I believe this budget is nec-essary to spur economic growth and in-crease wages, I am extremely dis-appointed that the Senate removed the $203 billion of mandatory spending cuts, given the challenge the national debt poses to our great United States. However, we should not make the per-fect the enemy of the good, and I un-derstand that issues as complex as the budget and tax reform require com-promise. I appreciate the leadership of Speak-er R
YAN, Chairman B RADY , and the rest of the leadership team for their hard work on tax reform, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to mov-ing tax reform over the finish line and to President Trump’s desk. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 11⁄2minutes to the gen-tlewoman from Washington (Ms. J
AYAPAL ), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Y
ARMUTH for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposi-tion to this fiscal year 2018 budget res-olution for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that the under-lying assumptions are grossly mis-leading. It assumes fictions like hun-dreds of billions of dollars from the re-peal of the Affordable Care Act, and it assumes an economic growth rate of 3 percent, which most economists on both sides do not believe is possible. This budget is merely a vehicle for Republicans to fast-track tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and large corporations. Any assertion of cuts for working families is debunked by ex-perts like Leonard Burman, cofounder of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, who has called this ‘‘utterly implau-sible.’’ Mr. Speaker, the facts are these: 80 percent of the Republican tax cuts go to the top 1 percent by 2027; the aver-age tax cut for the top 1 percent in 2027 will be $207,000; and 42 million middle class households will face a tax in-crease, including those earning be-tween $50,000 and $150,000, who will see a tax increase of one-third. That is what this budget lays the path for. If we want to see where this will lead, let’s just look at Kansas, a place where the Republican legislature has rolled back the tax cuts that they passed from several years ago because they simply didn’t work and put Kansas’ economy into a downward spiral. We know who wins under this budget resolution. It simply paves the way for a huge tax cut for the wealthiest mil-lionaires, billionaires, and corpora-tions. That is wrong, and I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this budget. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CCLINTOCK ), a member of the Budget Committee. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, unsustainable govern-ment spending drives both taxes and debt. The budget resolution sets the spend-ing architecture for the fiscal year. The House version provided for $200 bil-lion of enforceable mandatory spending reductions over 10 years and balanced within the decade. The Senate amend-ments gut these provisions, squan-dering the one opportunity Congress has each year to bring mandatory spending under control, taking us an-other year closer to a sovereign debt crisis. This is tragic, and I condemn it in the strongest terms. The Senate, though, has retained just one key provision from the House budget. It makes tax reform possible this year. Tax reform is essential to economic growth, and economic growth is essential to confront our debt. Many are alarmed that it provides for $1.5 trillion of additional debt, but this is due solely to the Senate’s rules that require tax cuts to be scored only as revenue losses without taking into account economic expansion. During the Obama years, our econ-omy grew at an average of 11⁄2percent, annually. That is about half the aver-age rate since World War II. Reagan averaged 3
1⁄2percent. Reagan did this by reducing the tax burdens that were crushing our economy. He slashed the top income tax rate from 70 percent down to 28 percent, and income tax re-ceipts nearly doubled because of the economic expansion he unleashed. Taxes driven by spending are the greatest threat to our economy today, and debt driven by spending is the greatest threat to our future. Control-ling spending is currently impossible in the Senate. So it is obvious that we can’t balance the budget and reduce our debt without significantly increas-ing economic growth; we can’t increase economic growth without tax relief; and we can’t get tax relief without the provisions in the Senate budget. Arthur Laffer, the architect of the Reagan tax policy, forecasts that the corporate tax reform alone will in-crease GDP growth at a rate that should generate a temporary bump of 5 percent, settling down to an average of 2.6 percent over the decade. This will add $5 trillion to the American econ-omy and directly increase revenues to all levels of government between $1.8 trillion and $2 trillion. We have tried a static approach to tax policy during the Obama years. The economy stagnated and the debt dou-bled. I remember what it was like in the Reagan era. Wages were rising and op-portunities for better jobs were every-where. There was a sense of optimism that comes with prosperity and abun-dance. When we abandoned these poli-cies, we lost that prosperity to a dec-ade of despair. I want my kids to know what that sense of relief and optimism was like, what it feels like when morning dawns again on the American economy. This resolution starts that transformation, and I urge its adoption. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I re-mind the prior speaker, my friend from California, that Arthur Laffer was also the architect of the Kansas plan, which was disastrous for that State. So citing him as a source, I would be a little bit careful. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1
1⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. L
EE), a distinguished mem-ber of the Budget Committee and the Appropriations Committee. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his tre-mendous leadership. And also, just very briefly, I want to mention to my colleague from Cali-fornia on the other side, I remember the Reagan-era tax cut period also, and there was a huge rise in homeless vet-erans as a result, unfortunately.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8245 October 26, 2017 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposi-tion to the so-called budget plan. I know that our budget shapes our national priorities and values, but the Republicans have put forward a budget that I think is downright sinister. This budget is morally bankrupt. It is a Tro-jan horse that steals healthcare from children and rips food from the hungry just to fast-track $1.5 trillion in tax breaks to billionaires and corporations. Budgets are moral documents. They should not be rigged in favor of special interests and the wealthy few, but the cruel and crooked Republican budget does just that. Our Nation’s budget should prioritize working families and the middle class, too many of whom are making low wages and living below the poverty line. b0930 It should assist those struggling to find a job. It should invest in workforce training, education, job creation and job training. Instead, this Republican budget creates tax cuts for billionaires, millionaires, and corporations. Our budget should expand to protect healthcare for all. Instead, this budget steals nearly $2 trillion from lifesaving Medicaid and Medicare. With nearly 40 million Americans liv-ing in poverty, our budget should in-vest in communities of color and rural communities, which have higher rates of poverty. Simply put, the House Republican budget would push more people into poverty. It slashes programs that help create good paying jobs for struggling families. It is a shame, it is immoral, it is un-American, and I hope we defeat it. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I just must make a comment on what went on in Kansas and the attribution that this was Mr. Laffer’s idea. I know Mr. Laffer personally and have had a conversation with him about his plan and suggestion. It was not followed. So I do want to lift up his good name and say that his plan was not followed. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. A
LLEN ). Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Chairman B
LACK on the markup of this important piece of leg-islation out of the Budget Committee. As we all know, tax season is the worst. It evokes images of stress, ac-countants, lawyers, and American fam-ilies sending hard-earned money to the Federal Government. I, for one, have never been excited when it is tax season, and as a businessowner, it took on a whole new meaning. Taxes affect all Americans, but tax season shouldn’t include months and months of preparation, often required to hire tax professionals. Our Tax Code is broken, and millions of Americans are looking to us to fix it. That is why Republicans have re-leased the Unified Tax Reform Frame-work to provide relief for hardworking Americans and jump-start our econ-omy. First, it lowers taxes at every income level, allowing Americans to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. It de-livers the lowest tax rates in modern history for job creators, allowing them to invest in growing their business. I will remind you that the small busi-ness community is responsible for 70 percent of all new jobs created. The vast majority of taxpayers will no longer have to deal with the com-plexity of itemizing due to the in-creased standard deduction. Small businesses will no longer be taxed under the individual side of the code. Families will no longer be penalized for inheriting family property or busi-nesses, when the death tax is removed. Finally, we will cut tax rates on per-sonal savings and investment in half. Americans should invest in their local economies and build towards a more financially secure future without exorbitant taxes. Now is the time for tax reform, and today we take a big step towards ac-tion. We must pass this budget. Hard-working Americans across the Nation will have the same April 15 they always have if we don’t, and that is unaccept-able. We cannot miss this opportunity. President Trump is with us on tax re-form, and we must act for the Amer-ican people. I urge all my colleagues to support this budget. It is critical to the American people. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. B
RENDAN F. B OYLE ), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the billionaires’ budget. That is exactly what the Republican budget is. 79.7 per-cent of it goes to the richest 1 percent. On top of that, who pays for it? The middle class and working class families of my district. Some 50 million Ameri-cans will be paying more in taxes, not less, as a result of this tax plan. Now, I have nothing against the bil-lionaires that my friends on the other side are so eager to help. I just don’t think the working class and middle class families of my district should be paying for their tax cuts. We should instead have a budget that focuses on building the middle class out, on lifting up those who have been working for the last 15 years and not getting a pay increase. This budget does absolutely nothing for those fami-lies, zero. On top of all of this, it adds $1.5 tril-lion to our national debt. It is wrong. It does not do anything to help the great American middle class, and it must be rejected. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. J
OHNSON ), a member of the Budget Committee. Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman B
LACK for yielding time. Mr. Speaker, I hear it all the time, and it is just a false narrative. This idea that the tax reform package pre-sented by Republicans is only a tax re-lief for the wealthy and that the mid-dle class and low-income families are not going to benefit from it is just ab-solutely untrue. We are talking about doubling the standard deduction. Millions of Ameri-cans aren’t even going to pay any taxes. That is particularly important in rural areas like I represent in Ohio. So I would urge my colleagues, let’s stop this false narrative that says that this is just a tax cut for the wealthy, because that is not true. By the way, when you cut taxes on businesses and corporations, who pays those taxes, Mr. Speaker? It is the American people who buy the products that pay those taxes. When they get a break, everybody wins. Look, the adoption of the Senate amendment to the House-passed budget that we are going to vote on today paves the way for tax reform. It is going to establish a path of balance through restrained spending, reduced taxes, and economic growth. It is going to allow for higher defense spending contingent on future adjustments to discretionary spending caps for defense and national security, but it begins to address our national debt. It reduces nondefense discretionary spending by over $600 billion over 10 years. It assumes more than $4 trillion in mandatory savings over 10 years. And it provides for budget enforcement in the House in order to strengthen fis-cal discipline. Mr. Speaker, this is a responsible path forward. The American people are screaming for a simpler, fairer, flatter Tax Code, one that makes American workers competitive, one that let’s the American people keep more of what they earn in their pockets. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support today’s vote, pass this budget amendment, and let’s get on to tax re-form. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. C
LYBURN ), the as-sistant Democratic leader. Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, the document before us is a partisan exercise to deliver large tax cuts to the wealthy. Working Americans will see their taxes go up, and our children and grandchildren will have to pay back the debt Republicans will create to finance these tax cuts. While they promise the American people revenue neutral tax reform that will simplify the Tax Code and close costly loopholes, the budget they are ramming through will borrow $1.5 tril-lion to finance these cuts. It will pre-cipitate cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and other safety net programs upon which middle-income families depend.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8246 October 26, 2017 
It proposes to eliminate the deduc-tion for State and local taxes, increas-ing the tax burden on over 500,000 peo-ple in my home State of South Caro-lina. This document threatens the earned income tax credit; lowers the ceiling on middle-income savings; and elimi-nates the inheritance tax, which only affects those with estates valued over $11 million. It creates a pass-through for busi-nesses that pay zero corporate taxes, effectively giving the owners of these companies a lower individual rate than the people they employ. If the Republicans would engage us, we could produce a bipartisan tax plan that would expand the earned income tax credit for single individuals and the child tax credit for working families. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. F
LO-
RES). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gen-tleman. Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, we could produce a bipartisan tax plan that would end the preferential treat-ment of investment income, which un-dermines working Americans while en-riching wealthy investors. We stand ready to engage with the other side. Until then, we will be reso-lute in our opposition to this unfair, immoral document. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. D
IAZ-BALART ), a member of both our Budget Committee and the Appro-priations Committee. Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the chairwoman for a phenomenal job. Look, our current fiscal environ-ment, according to the CBO, they project that the growth of our economy will be 2 percent or less for the next decade. I am reminded of what a good friend and Democratic colleague in the Budg-et Committee said one day: That 3 per-cent growth, that is just a dream, that is unrealistic. Yet, before the storms hit, what did we see as far as our economic growth of the country: 3.1 percent economic growth, something that one of our col-leagues, Democratic colleagues, said was a pipe dream. This is, in large part, because exces-sive regulations have been curtailed by both the administration and by Con-gress; but to keep that momentum, we need to pass tax reform. It will lead to a sustained strong economy. It will again lower the tax burden to our families. It will lead to increased wages for families, for the middle class, for individuals for the first time in such a long time, allowing the American people to keep more of their hard-earned money. It would make small-, mid-, and large-sized businesses more competitive so they can create millions of additional jobs here in the United States. Mr. Speaker, this legislation will allow us to do real tax reform to keep the economy growing, to get the econ-omy going, to get the American people working again, and this is an essential part. Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone’s sup-port. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. C
ARBAJAL ), a distin-guished member of the Budget Com-mittee. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Y
ARMUTH for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, snake oil is all that this Republican budget will give to the American middle class and working families. This Republican budget before Con-gress is squarely aimed at ramming through a tax plan without bipartisan consensus or input. This proposed tax plan will increase our deficit, adding $1.5 trillion over the next decade, and it leaves the middle class stuck footing the bill, with an increase in their an-nual Federal taxes. In fact, 80 percent of the tax cuts in this plan benefits only the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. That means those benefits are geared towards those earning $900,000 a year or more. One in three middle class families making between $50,000 and $150,000 will see their taxes go up. One proposal that Republicans have put forth to pay for their plan is elimi-nating the State and local tax deduc-tion. This will cost central coast home-owners and families in my district over $15,000 a year on average. As a member of the Budget Com-mittee, I encourage my colleagues to reject this plan and to get to work on bipartisan negotiations for lasting tax reform that benefits middle class fami-lies. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying that the Devil is in the details. And those details have not been released yet, so it is difficult for me to understand how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle make as-sumptions on just what this tax plan will do, calling it things such as snake oil, when I can assure you that, as a member of the Ways and Means Com-mittee, it is our goal and intent that the people in the middle- and low-in-come categories will see tax relief. I also want to remind them that what we know was the Devil in the details is the details given to the American peo-ple a number of years ago on the Af-fordable Care Act—which is neither af-fordable nor caring, in my opinion— was that people would see a return of about $2,500 on the average in their pocket as a result of the Affordable Care Act’s policies, and what we saw and what we are seeing now is a big in-crease in those premiums. Certainly they have not received $2,500 in their pocket. They were told they could keep their doctor, which we knew wasn’t true, and the other kinds of things that were done that caused people to lose their insurance in my very own State, be-cause we had a plan the people liked and people wanted to keep but could not because of the mandates that were put on by the Affordable Care Act. b0945 I want to remind my friends from the other side of the aisle that maybe the thing to do is to wait and see what really is in the plan, because the devil is in the detail, and I think you may like it enough that you perhaps will even vote for this tax plan that does give a jolt to the economy and does help the American people, especially in the lower- and middle-income, to keep more of their hard-earned dollars in their pockets. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. W
ASSERMAN SCHULTZ ), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, to my friend on the other side of the aisle, the gentle-woman from Tennessee, the reality is that the truth hurts. This budget reso-lution totally abandons America’s most cherished values and betrays its highest ideals. This extreme budget not only threat-ens programs for our veterans and hun-gry children, it makes drastic cuts to the Medicare and Medicaid programs that our seniors count on for survival. As it doles out that budgetary cru-elty, this resolution hands massive tax cuts to millionaires and powerful cor-porations all while adding $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. It also fails to protect our environ-ment, neglects our children’s edu-cation, and once more targets women’s healthcare for severe cuts. In short, the wealthy win, the middle class is ignored, and we all get saddled with more debt. Those are not values that this House should stand for. It is certainly not what veterans, children, seniors, or hardworking Americans de-serve. This irresponsible budget re-wards the rich and powerful and pun-ishes everyone else, and that is the best thing that I can say about it. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. J
EFFRIES ), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, while House Democrats are focused on deliv-ering better jobs, better wages, and a better future for the American people, House Republicans have once again presented a budget that is reckless, re-gressive, and reprehensible. It is a ‘‘billionaire-first, middle class- last tax plan.’’ It will not help the mid-dle class. The House Republican budget and tax proposal will hurt the middle

class by raising taxes on working fami-lies and middle-income Americans. The House Republican budget and tax plan is nothing more than a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It will benefit the wealthiest and the well-off here in this country. Eighty percent of the tax cuts proposed in the Ryan-McConnell plan will go to the wealthiest 1 percent in America, to millionaires and billion-aires, to the privileged few, to special interest corporations. It will not lead to economic growth. It will saddle this country with trillions of dollars in ad-ditional debt and deficit. It is based on a phony, fraudulent, and failed theory of trickle-down eco-nomics, which I finally figured out what it relates to in terms of the mid-dle class. You may get a trickle, but you are guaranteed to stay down. Stay down because they are going to under-mine your Medicare, stay down because they are going to undermine Social Se-curity, and stay down because they are going to saddle your children with tril-lions of dollars of additional debt. Mr. Speaker, reject this plan. It is a bad deal for the American people. They deserve a better deal. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gen-tleman from Illinois (Mr. R
OSKAM ), a member of the Ways and Means Com-mittee. Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I am al-most tempted to continue to yield time to my friend from the other side of the aisle. Just keep driving the expecta-tions of any tax relief further and fur-ther into the ground, and I think peo-ple are going to be surprised and de-lighted with ultimately what the House ends up considering. Mr. Speaker, this is why I am here. This is a prelude to tax reform. We vote on this. We then make it so that no single political party is able to deny a vote on tax reform, and both parties can come to the table and try and ne-gotiate something that is thoughtful, because here is what we know: it is the current Tax Code that is benefiting people that everybody is scandalized that they are benefiting. It is the cur-rent Tax Code that allows corporations to lock trillions of dollars offshore. It is the current Tax Code that is really stifling and so difficult. And it is the current Tax Code that nobody can de-fend. There is not a single person on this floor that is going to say: Oh, the Internal Revenue Code? I love that, Mr. Speaker. Just leave it the way it is. It is a disaster, and nobody likes the IRS. So rather than moaning and groaning and having posters and this and that, let’s do this: let’s dump the current Tax Code and let’s have a trans-formational moment. Mr. Speaker, that is what our country and our con-stituents are yearning for, not old bumper stickers, not old shabby phrases from the past, but they are looking for us to lead and to bring peo-ple together, and that is what we are trying to do. There is a meddlesome issue that af-fects my district as a high tax State, and it affects a lot of other folks, and that is how we deal with State and local tax deductibility. I am of the view that tax reform does not mean simply the redistribution of a tax li-ability from one part of the country to another, but it means tax relief for ev-erybody. Mr. Speaker, I think what we are looking for is to create middle class tax relief. And if the gentleman’s ex-pectations are that low, I think he is going to be pleased with what we ulti-mately are able to come up with. Mr. Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote. I thank the gentlewoman for the time, and I look forward to passing this reso-lution and moving forward to changing our Tax Code. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michi-gan (Mr. LEVIN), a distinguished mem-ber of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, the Repub-lican budget politically paving the way for their tax reform proposals can best be described as an elixir of growth, a magic cure-all. Instead, it is a fake, in-deed dangerous, potion. History has shown that a huge tax cut, primarily for the very wealthy and large corporations, does not promote growth, and will make life harder for the middle class and everyone else. This budget calls dangerously for raising our debt by $1.5 trillion, cre-ating a future deficit tax for middle-in-come families; cutting Medicare by nearly $500 billion; cutting Medicaid and other health programs by $1.3 tril-lion; and assuming $4 trillion in cuts to a broad range of programs, which could include education and health research. Mr. Speaker, vote ‘‘no’’ on this budg-et. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. W
ALKER ), who is the chair of our RSC. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I am torn as I rise today. First, there is no question I will vote in favor of the budget and encourage my colleagues to do so because there is no doubt this is the best way forward to achieve tax re-form and unlock the promise of bigger paychecks, more jobs, and the return of investing in America. However, I must also include that the Senate did not do its work. After months of hard work by Chairwoman B
LACK and the Budget Committee, the House was able to get it done. Even ac-knowledging the difficult position of our country, they put us on a path to balance the budget in less than a dec-ade. The House’s budget included rec-onciliation instructions to speed up the enactment of $203 billion in mandatory savings, and the House budget included instructions that allowed us for the first time to stay on the path to repeal ObamaCare, to help those who continue to suffer with rising premiums in the individual market. I would guess that nearly every Re-publican in the Chamber agrees that the House’s budget is superior. So why are we voting on the Sen-ate’s? Because our Senate colleagues seem allergic sometimes to making tough choices. But why will the Senate’s budget pass? Because the American people need tax relief. Families and small busi-nesses wrestle with an outdated and complicated Tax Code every year. It is true, we do have a once-in-a-generation opportunity. The specter of the IRS and dev-astating corporate rate mean that cap-ital and resources are held outside of the United States and not invested here. Making our Tax Code fairer and simpler will bring this capital back to the market and jump-start investment and growth like we have rarely seen in the United States. Despite my ongoing and deep frustra-tion sometimes with the Senate, I en-courage my colleagues to pass this budget and bring the promise of more jobs and bigger paychecks closer to re-ality. I am pleased by the Speaker’s com-mitment that the House will vote on important fiscal legislation in the form of balanced budget amendments, the Default Prevention Act, or some other deficit-reducing legislation. Mr. Speaker, the bottom line? It is vital that the House fulfill its promise to the American people. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. J
ACKSON LEE), a dis-tinguished member of the Budget Com-mittee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, the American people will look forward to a Thanksgiving and a Christmas of which families come together, but they will also see a Halloween. Today, on the floor of the House, the Republicans will vote for the worst Halloween of hobgoblins and ghosts and monsters that you can ever imag-ine. Monsters scare children, so today we will be voting on that monster that will scare children. Let me let you listen to Senator Sykes from Kansas, her State offering a Republican tax cut that was going to boost the economy. Her words are: ‘‘With the benefit of hindsight, we can say with certainty this promise was unfulfilled. In the following 5 years, Kansas experienced nine rounds of budget cuts, stress on State agencies, and the inability to effectively provide the core functions of government for our citizens.’’ Mr. Speaker, I include in the R
ECORD  Senator Sykes’ message to Congress. 
A M ESSAGE TO CONGRESS : DON’TMAKE THE  S
AMEMISTAKE WEDID IN KANSAS  (By Dinah Sykes, a Republican member of the Kansas State Senate) Americans want efficient government, re-sponsible spending and reasonable taxes. This is not difficult. Yet sometimes what

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8248 October 26, 2017 
seems so simple becomes complicated when these concepts are turned into buzzwords and used as weapons for political gain. In 2012, Republicans in Kansas enacted a ‘‘revolutionary’’ tax overhaul promised to be a ‘‘shot of adrenaline to the heart of the Kansas economy.’’ With the benefit of hind-sight, we can say with certainty this promise was unfulfilled. In the following five years, Kansas experienced nine rounds of budget cuts, stress on state agencies and the inabil-ity to effectively provide the core functions of government for our citizens. As Republicans in Congress begin working to modify the federal tax code, I worry that tax reform done poorly could lead to similar failure. I hope federal lawmakers learn from mistakes made at the state level. This year, the Kansas legislature—includ-ing many Republicans like me—voted to par-tially restore income-tax rates and to repeal a provision that allowed independent busi-ness owners to pay almost no state taxes on their income. We also overrode our gov-ernor’s veto, who opposed rolling back the tax cuts he championed. Critics of our vote claim that Kansas didn’t cut spending enough to accompany the tax cuts. In reality, we cut our budget through across-the-board cuts, targeted cuts, rescission bills and allotments. Roughly 3,000 state employee positions were cut, salaries were frozen, and road projects canceled. We delayed payments to the state employee re-tirement system and emptied our savings ac-counts. Even as we issued more than $2 bil-lion in new bonds to float our debt, Kansas received three credit downgrades, making that debt costlier. In Kansas, we understand the allure of tax- cut promises. We want to believe promises of amazing growth or outcomes. In 2012, tradi-tional budget forecast models accurately predicted the devastating effect the tax breaks would have on state revenue. Pro-ponents of the plan used dynamic scoring predicting incredible economic growth and supporting their own preconceived ideas. Today, we know which forecasts were cor-rect. Across the state, citizens may have been paying less in income taxes, but those de-creases were offset by increases in sales taxes, property taxes and fees. These changes alone were not enough to put the state on the right path. Education and infrastructure, key investments necessary for strong eco-nomic growth, were treated as the enemy. As we went through our 2017 legislative session, the ‘‘shot of economic adrenaline’’ still showed no signs of materializing. Our state functioned as though the Great Recession had never ended. Kansas should serve as a cautionary tale illustrating the damage done when the nor-mal order is shortchanged. America’s found-ers and countless generations of leaders em-bedded deliberative procedures into our leg-islative process for a reason. But in 2012, the governor’s tax proposal looked very different from the package he signed. A dispute be-tween House and Senate versions should have gone to conference committee; how-ever, the House cut short debate and rammed through a motion to concur with the Senate instead. I watch now as lawmakers in Con-gress use similar tactics, and I worry that backroom dealing and circumvention of process will lead to similar results. I never anticipated entering public service. I was content raising my family, partici-pating in the PTA and operating my busi-ness. However, I saw the impact that bad tax policy was having on the state. I felt the re-sults of growing class sizes and shrinking programs in the schools my children at-tended. I witnessed a gradual erosion of the quality of life that makes Kansas such a great place to live. There is a real temptation to let our frus-tration turn into anger. In our increasingly polarized world, we see what happens when we retreat to our ideological trenches. The antidote, it would seem to me, is listening carefully to those we disagree with and seek-ing common ground as a starting point. (We should also note that failing to listen to con-stituents while blindly holding to ideology can have consequences: About a third of Kansas legislators became ex-legislators in 2016.) As our country looks at the key issues ahead of us, including tax policy and health- care reform, we face important questions: How can we as Americans work together to improve our tax policy? How can we work to-gether to provide core government func-tions? Answering those questions requires having civil conversations, learning from our neighbors and sharing our experiences. We are better when we can work together to find compromise. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. What do you think will happen to this Nation if we vote for this budget plan, this Hal-loween of a plan? The latest Republican budget man-dates $4.9 trillion in budget cuts. Mr. Speaker, I cannot vote for this. I cannot vote for it because of the people in Texas after Hurricane Harvey; the people in Louisiana after Hurricane Nate; the people in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Florida after Hurri-canes Maria and Irma. I cannot vote for this. This will gut disaster relief, education, infrastructure, research, veterans benefits, and it will clearly provide tax cuts for the rich. The Republican budget provides $1.6 trillion in tax cuts to millionaires, bil-lionaires, wealthy corporations. It doesn’t give any money to the middle class. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. M
ITCHELL ). The time of the gentle-woman has expired. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentle-woman. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it explodes the deficit. How could this happen? It demands higher cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and education. This is a Halloween that America will not tol-erate. My good friend from North Carolina, there will be over a million people that will lose benefits under this plan and the tax plan that they are planning. They will pay higher taxes. This is a bad bill. Vote it down. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee, I rise in strong and unyielding op-position to the Senate Amendment to H. Con. Res. 71, the Congressional Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2018. As senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, the Ranking Member of the Judici-ary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I op-pose this phony budget resolution, which is in reality nothing more than a smoke screen de-signed to pave the way for massive tax cuts for the top 1 percent, while exploding the debt and deficit by $1.5 trillion over ten years. Here are five reasons why every Member of this House should vote against this Repub-lican budget resolution: 1. This Republican budget cuts nearly $1.3 trillion from Medicaid and nearly $500 million from Medicaid; 2. This Republican budget includes massive spending cuts to the priorities of the American people; 3. This Republican budget guts investment in areas critical to expanding economic oppor-tunity; 4. This latest Republican budget uses fast track procedures to increase the debt and deficits by $1.5 trillion, while showering tax cuts on billionaires, millionaires, and the wealthiest corporations; and 5. As we have learned from bitter and pain-ful experience, tax cuts do not pay for them-selves, notwithstanding the supply-side fairy tale claims that they do. This latest Republican budget mandates $4.9 trillion in spending cuts to top priorities like disaster relief, education, infrastructure, research, veteran benefits, and programs that expand opportunities for American families. This Republican budget provides $1.6 trillion in tax cuts to millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations, while raising taxes on working and middle class families by $470 bil-lion. Mr. Speaker, let us be very clear and direct: the resolution before us is not intended to rec-oncile tax and spending priorities to reflect the priorities of the American people or to reduce the deficit and national debt or to put our fiscal house on a sustainable path to economic growth. Rather the sole purpose of Republicans bringing this job-killing budget to the floor today is to fast-track their ‘‘Billionaires First’’ tax plan, which will cause significant harm to working and middle class families, especially to my constituents in the Eighteenth Congres-sional District of Texas. The McConnell-Ryan tax plan, which this budget resolution is designed to grease the skids for, would raise taxes on about 1.5 mil-lion Texas households, or 12.4 percent of households next year. On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a $794 increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on families struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook. An estimated 2.8 million Texas households deduct state and local taxes with an average deduction of $7,823 in 2015. The Ryan-McConnell plan eliminates this deduction, which would lower home values and put pressure on states and towns to col-lect revenues they depend on to fund schools, roads, and vital public resources. The proposed elimination of the personal exemption will harm millions of Texans by tak-ing away the $4,050 deduction for each tax-payer and claimed dependent; in 2015, rough-ly 9.3 million dependent exemptions were claimed in the Lone Star State. Equally terrible is that the McConnell-Ryan tax plan drastically reduces the Earned In-come Tax Credit, which encourages work for 2.7 million low-income individuals in Texas, helping them make ends meet with an aver-age credit of $2,689. The EITC and the Child Tax Credit lift about 1.2 million Texans, including 663,000 children, out of poverty each year. This reckless and irresponsible GOP tax plan is made all the more obscene by the fact that 80 percent of the GOP’s tax cuts go to the wealthiest 1 percent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8249 October 26, 2017 
To achieve this goal of giving more and more to the haves and the ‘‘have mores,’’ the GOP budget betrays seniors, children, the most vulnerable, and needy, and working and middle-class families. The steep reductions in program invest-ments proposed in this Republican budget fall most heavily on low-income families, students struggling to afford college, seniors, and per-sons with disabilities. This Republican budget immediately guts in-vestment critical to expanding economic op-portunity by lowering the already inadequate austerity-level spending caps by an additional $5 billion in 2018 and by even more in subse-quent years. Republican budget adopts Trumpcare but does even more damage because in addition to depriving more than 20 million Americans of healthcare, denying protection to persons with preexisting conditions, and raising costs for older and low-income adults, cuts more than $1.8 trillion from Medicaid and Medicare. Republican budget ends the Medicare guar-antee and calls for replacing Medicare’s guar-anteed benefits with fixed payments for the purchase of health insurance, shifting costs and financial risks onto seniors and disabled workers; this represents a $500 billion cut to Medicare over ten years. The Republican budget focuses too nar-rowly on the military, shortchanging American soft-power and other essential elements of na-tional security by increasing defense spending by $72 billion above the cap and hollowing out the State Department and foreign aid agencies with cuts of $11 billion and environmental and natural resource protection by more than $6 billion. Mr. Speaker, the federal budget is more than a financial document; it is an expression of our values and priorities as a nation. Sadly, this latest Republican budget, just like the previous one and the President’s ‘‘skinny budget,’’ fails this moral test of gov-ernment. America will not be made great by stealing another $1.8 trillion from Medicare and Med-icaid, abandoning seniors and families in need, depriving students of realizing a dream to attend college without drowning in debt, or disinvesting in the working families just to give unwanted tax breaks to wealthy corporations and the top 1 percent. America will not be positioned to compete and win in the global, interconnected, and dig-ital economy by slashing funding for scientific research, the arts and humanities, job retrain-ing, and clean energy. Even a cursory review leaves the inescap-able conclusion that this budget represents a betrayal—of our values as a nation, and of the promises made by the President during the election campaign. This Republican budget is not a budget for the real world that real Americans live in but is as much a fantasy budget as the Trump ‘‘Skinny Budget’’ in that it pretends to achieve balance by assuming that painless spending cuts can and will be made by the Congress. To put this reckless, irresponsible, and dra-conian budget in perspective, it is useful to ex-amine what the proposed cuts mean when ap-plied to the programs depended upon by Americans to rise up the economic ladder, plan for the future, provide for their families, and strive to achieve the American Dream. The elimination of funding for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) drains re-sources from communities, even in times of disaster because CDBG provides flexible grants to local communities for a wide range of unique needs, including Meals on Wheels, housing programs, and community infrastruc-ture improvements. The Republican budget targets disaster grants made by the Federal Emergency Man-agement Agency, which help families and businesses when their disaster-related prop-erty losses are not covered by insurance. The Republican budget makes higher edu-cation more expensive by cutting at least $211 billion from student financial aid programs, like Pell Grants, over ten years. The Republican budget also eliminates sub-sidized loans, making it difficult for students, particularly low-income students, to afford col-lege and compounds the damage by making it more difficult to repay student loans by elimi-nating the Public Sector Loan Forgiveness and Teacher Loan Forgiveness programs. The Republican budget’s solution to the af-fordable housing crisis currently facing cities large and small all across the country is to convert all discretionary spending on afford-able housing into a block grant, which means there will be even less assistance to help the 71 percent of extremely low income renter households who spend more than half their in-come on housing. The Republican budget cuts at least $150 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assist-ance Program (SNAP) over the next ten years by essentially converting it to a block grant, cutting off funding for eligible individuals and requiring cash-strapped states to either fill in the gap or take away food assistance from millions of working families, children, and sen-iors. Mr. Speaker, as economists and policy ex-perts have documented time and again, immi-gration reform would expand the size of the U.S. workforce, and in turn would increase the size of the economy and reduce deficits. The Republican budget, however, again re-jects comprehensive immigration reform that would bring clear and just rules for those seeking citizenship and help secure the na-tion’s borders. In doing so, the Republican budget squan-ders an opportunity to reduce deficits by an estimated $900 billion over the next two dec-ades, boost the economy by 5.4 percent, and extend the solvency of Social Security. The Republican budget continues to target federal employees by cutting their compensa-tion and benefits by at least another $163 bil-lion over ten years, which comes on top of the $182 billion in cuts federal employees have al-ready absorbed in the form of higher retire-ment contributions, pay freezes, and fur-loughs. The Republican budget cuts hurts veterans by cutting veterans benefits by nearly $50 bil-lion over the next ten years, with newly eligible veterans experiencing cuts in programs that pay for education benefits as well as loan guarantees. Finally, Mr. Speaker, it must be pointed out that the Republican budget’s pretension to bal-ance is based on reliance on trillions of dollars in budget games and gimmicks to rig the num-bers. The Republican budget counts a dubious $1.4 trillion ‘‘economic dividend’’ from cutting taxes and taking away consumer protections that is not backed up by any credible analysis or historical experience. The Republican budget assumes, despite all precedent and evidence to the contrary, that tax reform will be revenue neutral, even though Republican tax plans are projected to lose between $3 trillion and $7 trillion. Given these budgetary shenanigans, never could it more truly be said that ‘‘figures don’t lie, but liars figure.’’ In evaluating the merits of a budget resolu-tion, it is not enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal responsibility. To keep faith with the nation’s past, to be fair to the nation’s present, and to safeguard the nation’s future, the budget must also pass a ‘‘moral test.’’ The Republican budget resolution fails both of these standards. I strongly oppose the Senate Amendment to H. Con. Res. 71 and urge all Members to join me in voting against this reckless, cruel, and heartless budget resolution that will do nothing to improve the lives or well-being of middle and working class families, and the poor and vulnerable ‘caught in the tentacles of cir-cumstance.’ Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. F
LORES ). Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman B
LACK and her committee for all the great work that they have done in putting forth a budget that moves America in the right direction. Mr. Speaker, I have been astounded by the rhetoric that we have heard from the other side for a plan that they haven’t really seen. They are making up their facts as they go along to suit their wishes. Mr. Speaker, I support the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution. While I think the Senate’s version falls far short of the great work we did in the House and our budget, it is still the key thing that we need to have to move forward with tax reform for the American peo-ple. Our tax reform plan includes tax cuts for the working class Americans who have been struggling for the last sev-eral years under a broken Tax Code. It also makes America’s businesses the most competitive in the world in-stead of having to struggle with the world’s least competitive tax system. Mr. Speaker, in summary, this budg-et provides a way for a tax plan that provides for bigger paychecks, more jobs, a stronger economy, and a bal-anced budget. I strongly urge our col-leagues to support this budget. b1000 Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Kentucky has 12
3⁄4min-utes remaining. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2half minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. N
EAL), the ranking member of the Ways and Means Com-mittee. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, it is getting time for Halloween, so they have put on the disguise on the other side. So what we are hearing today is, from the last two Republican speakers: This is a bad budget. Let’s vote ‘‘yes.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8250 October 26, 2017 
The gentleman from Ohio said a while ago, this is all about the middle class. The middle class does not pay an estate tax. The middle class, because of our efforts—and, I think, mine in par-ticular—no longer pay the alternative minimum tax. And the people in the middle class are not locked into the 39.6 top rate in the Tax Code. This is a disguise. They are adding $1.5 trillion to the debt and, actually, over 10 years, when you borrow the money, they are adding $2.3 trillion to the debt, all for a tax cut for people at the very top. Now, let me say this: I am happy to negotiate a tax reform package that we can all live with. I am happy to sit down with the other side and acknowl-edge some parts of the Code that clear-ly don’t work any longer for the Amer-ican people. This is being done by one party, ex-clusively. They have not negotiated with us. They have not given us the opening. They have not said to us: ‘‘Where do you want to proceed on this?’’ Instead, if you pass this budget today, they suggest you are going to see their plan on November 1, and you are going to vote for it sometime around November 6. That is not nego-tiation. The Congress I signed up for actually negotiated these agreements, and if you couldn’t love the final passage, at least you could like it because you had sufficient input. That is not what has happened, Mr. Speaker, in this process. This process is one-sided. It is one-di-mensional. They interchangeably use the words ‘‘tax cut’’ and ‘‘tax reform.’’ This is about a tax cut. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Mary-land (Mr. H
OYER ), the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have been here—this is my 37th year. This is the most reckless and irresponsible budget that I have seen in the 37 years that I have been here. Today, we are considering the Sen-ate’s budget resolution, not because the House supports it, but because it is just a vehicle to get partisan tax re-form—strike that—tax cuts. On an issue as consequential as tax reform, the Congress should not be rushing to meet self-imposed political deadlines without enough time to read and analyze the effects. More importantly, we should not be considering a bill to cut taxes that is partisan and that is as terrible as we are hearing the majority’s proposal will be. I say that because we still haven’t seen the full details of a bill that this resolution provides for Re-publicans to jam through on an expe-dited process; one they will reportedly introduce, mark up, and bring to the floor in the few legislative days we have left before Thanksgiving. Is the sunshine too bright for you? Even my friends on the other side of the aisle don’t know exactly how bad it will be for their constituents. When asked about the details of the Repub-lican bill, Representative CHRIS COL-
LINS, a Republican from New York, said: ‘‘We don’t know, we don’t know, we don’t know, we don’t know, we don’t know.’’ That is a Republican Member of Con-gress who is saying he has no idea what this bill is empowering. But we do know that, based on a non-partisan analysis of their framework, it will raise taxes on 47 million Ameri-cans. We know that 80 percent of the tax cuts—80 percent of the tax cuts—will go to the top 1 percent. And we know, as well, that nearly half of all taxpayers with children, 44.5 percent, will see their taxes go up. Those same children will be on the hook for a $2.4 trillion cost. This is the biggest debt explosion of any bill that I have seen. Republican Representative M
ATT G
AETZ of Florida summed up today’s vote as being for a budget—hear this, my friends on both sides of the aisle. This is M
ATTGAETZ , Republican, Flor-ida, summed up today’s vote as being for a budget that ‘‘nobody believes in so that we have a chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody’s read.’’ That is not what we should be doing. We ought to be working together to craft a bipartisan tax reform package that is revenue neutral. It will be the height of hypocrisy to say that you are for fiscal discipline and to vote for this budget. Let’s not risk our fiscal future and the economic security of our people. Defeat this reso-lution. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Geor-gia (Mr. F
ERGUSON ), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the FY18 budget. I think that this is a very important step in doing something that this Na-tion needs, and that is for the United States Congress and the President to pass tax reform. For way too long, our national econ-omy has languished at a GDP growth that is far below historical averages. One of the most important things that we have got to do is to grow our econ-omy because that leads to families being successful, rising wages, being able to have careers for themselves and their family members, and I believe that tax reform unlocks the American economy in a way that we haven’t seen in decades. For far too long, we have looked at our Tax Code only through a set of do-mestic lenses and only looked at the rates; and we get into these ridiculous debates about the top bracket versus the lowest bracket, and we divide our Nation. But, for the first time, we are approaching our Tax Code through a set of global lenses that really give our American economy a chance to be com-petitive on the world stage. It is not simply about cutting rates. It is not simply about giving a break to one group or another and to get away from this rhetoric. It is about creating the most vibrant place in the world to do business by reforming the Code and creating fairness. If we do that and our American fami-lies succeed, and we see people moving from poverty into the middle class, and from the middle class up, and we see entrepreneurs, and we see new busi-nesses and innovation, we are going to see growth in our economy like we have not seen in a generation. The importance of that is it will give us the tools that we need to address the single biggest driver of our debt, and that is mandatory spending. And this body must have the political courage and integrity, along with the Senate, to address mandatory spending, to have an honest conversation about So-cial Security, about Medicare, about Medicaid, and, most importantly, about welfare entitlement reform, be-cause we can no longer trap generation after generation in poverty. We must create pathways out of poverty into the middle class for our fellow Ameri-cans. We can do this. We can be committed to it. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illi-nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, re-gardless of what the Republicans say, their budget paves the way for trillions of dollars in tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations. And who would pay for it? It would be the middle class families, children, seniors, and people with dis-abilities. It would slash Medicaid by $1 trillion, threaten healthcare for one in four Americans. It would slash Medi-care by $470 billion. And this budget proposes, yet again, to repeal the Af-fordable Care Act. Under the Republican tax plan, 1.9 million Illinoisans would no longer be able to claim State and local tax de-ductions; and nationwide, 47 million people in middle class households mak-ing between $50,000 and $150,000 a year would pay more in taxes. So I ask my colleagues: Did you real-ly come to Congress to take away healthcare and reduce income for mid-dle class families? If you care about anyone other than millionaires and billionaires, you need to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. W
ELCH ), a distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I want to say three things about this budget: First, deficits matter. Deficits mat-ter. This budget explicitly raises the deficit. It admits to $1.5 trillion, more likely $2.5 trillion. That means that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8251 October 26, 2017 
our children and our grandchildren are going to be the ones paying for the def-icit that is added. Second, process matters. We are hearing a lot of talk about tax reform, but there has been no process. There is no bill, and we are about to vote on a so-called tax reform package that has not been explicitly printed to paper. This is no way to do any business. We are making it up as we go along, and it is the same process that was used on healthcare. We went into committee with no bill and came out, 27 hours later, with 24 million people losing healthcare. There has been no process on this. And third, details matter, and the de-tails that are leaking out are very pun-ishing to the middle class. Anybody who is an income tax payer in a State, a property tax payer in a State, is going to lose that deduction. It is very tough on middle class ef-forts to save for retirement. That is in play. Folks’ deductions on their Keogh plans, their 401(k) plans, are very much a part of the process that is going to lower this. Reject this plan. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I almost can’t sit here and not make a comment on my colleagues’ budget on the other side of the aisle. All of a sudden, they seem to be very concerned about deficits when, as a matter of fact, their budget assumed almost $1 trillion worth of deficits in their budg-et. I want to also say that our com-mittee did a really good job in having a balanced budget, and we are, obvi-ously, looking at a budget from the Senate that we are going to be taking up so that we can do tax reform. But they also, in addition to that, had $2 trillion worth of new taxes that they placed on the American people. So all of a sudden, this purity of worrying about these deficits just makes me scratch my head, and about raising taxes on the people when their own plan did the very opposite of what we are trying to do is cut taxes. They added $2 trillion worth of taxes. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time we have re-maining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Kentucky has 5
3⁄4minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 5
1⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As we wind down our arguments here, once again, we have had a very fas-cinating discussion and, once again, we seem to disagree on virtually every-thing. For instance, I have heard from the other side many times over the last few days and today that we really can’t say what the impact is, the claims that we are making about whether this bill will help the rich or help the middle class or help lower income individuals, be-cause we don’t have the details. Well, that is absolutely correct; we don’t have the details. But then, if we don’t have the de-tails, how can the other side talk about the huge benefits that this proposal, this tax proposal that is yet unwritten, will provide for the middle class? And how can they deny that it will benefit the wealthy disproportionately? We know from the outline that was released by the other side in recent weeks that they intend to eliminate the estate tax. The estate tax only ben-efits wealthy Americans, people with estates over $11 million for a couple. They want to eliminate the alter-native minimum tax. We know the al-ternative minimum tax only affects wealthy individuals. There was one es-timate that the one year of President Trump’s tax return that we have, that in that year alone, the alternative min-imum tax, if it were repealed, would have saved him $30 million. So we know that affects very wealthy people. b1015 We know that if you reduce the top rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, that benefits very high-income people. So we do have enough information to draw some pretty definite conclusions about the impact that the released out-line, at least, will have on wealthy Americans, and we can draw some of the same conclusions about how it will hurt middle class Americans. If, in fact, the Republican tax bill re-peals the deduction for State and local taxes. In my State, there will be half a million people who will lose an average of $9,900 of deductions every year. So we absolutely know the impact that the proposal, as we know it now, will have, and I think it is fair—given that there will be no hearings on this bill— it is fair to raise the alarms about what the potential for this bill is. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it is my extreme honor to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE ), our majority whip, who is a wonderful member of our Conference. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman B
LACK for her lead-ership on this budget. It is important that we do a budget—and it is always difficult to bring a budget forward be-cause it represents the views that we have, and, of course, we in the House passed a budget that shows the country how we can get back to a balanced Fed-eral budget, how we can get our econ-omy moving again, and how we can fi-nally rebuild the middle class. Mr. Speaker, that is really what is at heart with this budget vote. This budg-et starts the process of actually going out and cutting taxes across the board so that middle class families can have a better opportunity for the American Dream. If you look over the last 10 years, we have seen our middle class evaporate in this country. So many times, we have seen com-pany after company move jobs over-seas. And anybody who has complained about that—and I sure have been angry about it—the first thing you do is you go ask them: Why did you move the jobs overseas? And they say: Because America is not competitive again. We have the highest corporate tax rate in the world, in the entire indus-trial world. And what it means is, mid-dle class jobs are being shipped to other countries. We can complain about it all day, Mr. Speaker, but how about we actually do something about it? This bill starts that process—work-ing with President Trump who wants to bring those middle class jobs back to America. We are talking about high-paying jobs, $60,000- to $150,000-a-year jobs that left our country. We can bring those jobs back. That is what this vote is about. That is what this budget is about: starting the process to finally rebuild our middle class, to finally bring those jobs back, and to finally give a tax break to families who have been struggling for so long under slow economic growth. Let’s actually grow our economy. Growing our economy is not just good for rebuilding the middle class and for those hardworking taxpayers who will get real relief under this bill, but also to our ability to reduce the deficit and finally get back to balanced Federal budgets so that we can create a healthier economy and a healthier America. Mr. Speaker, I urge everybody to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this budget. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I now have the distinct honor of yielding 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. PELOSI ), the Democratic leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to recognize Mr. Y
ARMUTH ’s extraordinary leadership as the ranking member on the Budget Committee. As we all know, budget should be a statement of our national values. What is important to us as a nation should be reflected in how we allocate our resources. Again, it is a statement of values, and who better to manage all of that in this Congress of the United States than Mr. Y
ARMUTH , who brings his values and his heartland priorities to the budget process, and I thank him for the leadership he has provided. Sadly though, I rise in opposition to what the Republicans have proposed which is a devastating Republican budget. The first step in the GOP’s dangerous plan to fast track their im-moral tax framework is to hand tril-lions of dollars to the wealthy while raising taxes on working American families. The Republican budget and tax plan cruelly rig an unfair system even fur-ther against hardworking Americans. It cuts a raw deal for families in every corner of our country. Democrats have a better deal, better jobs, better pay, better future.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8252 October 26, 2017 
But right here, before our eyes in this House, Republicans are replacing the great American ladders of oppor-tunity with the silver spoons of plutoc-racy and aristocracy. Their agenda raises taxes on the middle class. That is a fact. Tens of millions of middle class families will pay higher taxes, in-cluding a heavier burden for State and local taxes. It might be interesting to our distin-guished colleague, Mr. S
CALISE —and isn’t it a joy to see him in debate on the floor—in his State of Louisiana, 458,000 people will pay an average of nearly $7,000 more by losing their de-duction. And Congresswoman B
LACK , from the great State of Tennessee, in her State, 573,960 people will lose their deduction, around $5,600 a filer. Not only that, if that isn’t bad enough for assaulting the dream of homeownership in our country by at-tacking the deduction, this plan that the Republicans propose has been esti-mated to reduce the value of people’s homes by 10 percent. You not only are paying more money in order to give a tax break to the wealthy and to big corporations, you are reducing the value of your home, and, by the way, your neighbors’ homes as well. So with all of the unfairness in it, the one that is most understandable to people directly is how it affects them. And in that case, 44 million Americans will pay more because of what the Re-publicans have in their plan. So it raises taxes on middle class, particularly with the State and local tax deduction removed. And by the way—another by the way—if you are a corporation, your deduction is not re-moved, just if you are an individual filer, so again, an advantage to cor-porate America at the expense of America’s working families. Next, it borrows trillions from the fu-ture to give tax cuts to the wealthiest. Eighty percent of the tax cuts in this Republican proposal goes to the wealthiest 1 percent; 80 percent goes to the wealthiest 1 percent at the expense of America’s working families and chil-dren. The budget on the floor today re-veals the true cruelty behind the Re-publican’s tax plan. What words would be best to use it? It is looting the mid-dle class, massive looting of the middle class; rip-off of the middle class, be-cause there are many middle class peo-ple. So you take some money from all of those middle class people and those who aspire to it so that you can give a lot of money to the few. That is a big sucking up of assets from the middle class to the wealthy. That is what they are here for. It is in their DNA: trickle- down economics. It is in their DNA. That is what the Republicans come here to do, and that causes a deep addi-tion to the national debt. They are supposed to be deficit hawks, but I think they have become an endangered species because they don’t seem to care that, with the cuts that they are taking, the tax breaks they are giving to corporate and wealthy America will cost over $2 tril-lion—not counting service on the na-tional debt which would take it closer to $3 trillion additional. That is a very hard road to come back from. And as our distinguished ranking member has pointed out, the opportunity cost in the budget, wheth-er it is a trillion dollars from Medicaid, half a trillion dollars from Medicare, funds taken from education, the seed corn of America’s preeminence in the world. Why? To give a tax cut to the high end. And they will say: Oh, well, the growth will come from this. We will pay for that. It never has; never has. Don’t take it from me. Bruce Bartlett, who was one of the orchestrators of the supply-side economics said: We never said it paid for itself. Anyone who says it does, it is not true. It is nonsense. He went even further to call it BS. As I said, it ransacks Medicare and Medicaid, adding trillions to the debt in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy, looting the middle class, shaking down the middle class, ripping off the middle class, increasing the taxes of the middle class. It devastates vital investments, as our distinguished ranking member said, in good-paying jobs with higher wages for working families, the edu-cation of our children, the health of our working families. It really is a good example of what they say that Medicare should wither on the vine. In keeping with their trickle-down eco-nomics, Medicare should wither on the vine because they will take half a tril-lion dollars from Medicare in their budget that will follow. So Republicans will harm veterans, rural America, seniors, and children, again, all in the name of fast-tracking trillion-dollar tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent. What more do you need to know? Eighty percent goes to the wealthiest 1 percent. Again and again on the floor, the Re-publicans have tried to tilt the playing field against hardworking families. This is really quite remarkable though. This is a great transformative moment for America where we can reject this assault on the middle class, this addi-tion to the national debt, and instead, say: Let’s go to the table and work in a bipartisan way to truly reform our Tax Code so that we can be competitive in the world; so that families can thrive, and that they can have the de-ductions that are fair for them and needed, and not taken away from them, but not taken away from corporate America. So we stand ready to go in a bipartisan way to work to do this. Any tax cuts, because this isn’t just tax cuts to the rich—that is not tax re-form—any tax cuts, any agenda like that has to be bipartisan in order for it to be sustainable. So let’s come to our senses here. Common sense says—well, mathematics says, if you take a lot of money from many people to give it to a few, you are exacerbating the dis-parity of opportunity equity income in our country. This is the wrong thing to do. It is not what our values are about. It is really a shame that they would even bring such a document to the floor. Anybody who lives in a district where their deductions, the tax deductions for State and local taxes, are taken away from individual filers, but not for cor-porations, as the bill determines, to the tune—and I can read you all of the statistics across the country about how devastating this is—as our own Gov-ernor said: How could they do that to our State or any State without the de-partment of finance of our States say-ing: Wait a minute. Understand what this does to the economy of our State. Understand what this does to our indi-vidual filers in our State. Who said that this document that came over from the Senate should have such a devastating impact on States and Members coming to the floor and endorsing it. Some say: Oh, I am just voting for the budget, but it really isn’t what it—no. No. You are putting your name next to taking the deduc-tion of homeownership and of State and local taxes away from your con-stituents. They are going to know that. I would rather you reject this. We don’t want a political argument. We want to protect the American people. That is why I hope everyone here would come down in favor of the mid-dle class and reject this assault, this rip-off, this shakedown of the middle class that the Republicans have on the floor. b1030 Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 1 minute to the gen-tleman from West Virginia (Mr. M
OON-
EY). Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, we had a Democratic Presi-dent, John F. Kennedy, who cut taxes when he was President. I think he would take issue with a lot of the things that have been said by his own party. It has been 30 years since we ad-dressed taxes in this country. Presi-dent Ronald Reagan addressed it 30 years ago. We are way overdue for tax cuts in the United States of America. Everybody knows that the 35 percent tax rate on corporations has driven companies overseas. West Virginia saw, just a couple of years ago, one of our largest remaining corporate head-quarters, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, relo-cate overseas to avoid the taxes that are too high in this country. We all know that is a problem. We have a plan we are putting forward to try to solve it. I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle: Where is your plan? You have no plan. This is all polit-ical. All you do is make political at-tacks. You have had meetings recently and said: Don’t offer a plan. Let’s just attack the Republicans for their plan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8253 October 26, 2017 
At least we have a plan to address this because hardworking taxpayers in West Virginia and America need and expect us to deliver on these tax cuts. So I rise in strong support of the budg-et today so we can move forward with our tax cut plan. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I re-serve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, it is now my delight to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. B
RADY ), who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, with this budget, we have an oppor-tunity to move forward on a major pri-ority for the American people, which is delivering the first overhaul of Amer-ica’s broken Tax Code in more than three decades. When you look, today, at the way America is taxed, it doesn’t take long to recognize this is completely and ut-terly broken. You can see that it is so complex it forces millions of families and job creators to spend billions of hours and dollars each year just filing their taxes. It is unfair. It gives wasteful Wash-ington lobbyists loopholes and carve- outs to special interests by giving hardworking Americans nothing but frustration. You can see that our Tax Code is miserably uncompetitive. That is why more and more of our American busi-nesses and good-paying jobs are going overseas to countries with more mod-ern and more competitive tax systems. By passing this budget today, we can send a clear message to the American people: real tax reform is on the way. A ‘‘no’’ vote, as we heard from our Demo-cratic colleagues, is to block tax re-form and defend the status quo. We are all working closely with President Trump as he leads this charge. Together, we have bold ideas to deliver more jobs, fairer taxes, and big-ger paychecks for all Americans this year. I want to thank Chairman B
LACK and the Budget Committee for all their hard work. I want to encourage my col-leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’—vote ‘‘yes’’—on tax reform, and join me in taking an important historic step forward to de-liver on our tax reform promise. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just like to say that, for anyone watching this debate or watching any of our dis-cussions out there in the country, I know it often appears that we don’t get along, that we hate each other, and that we are at each other’s throat, but nothing could be further from the truth. It has been such an honor to work with Chairman B
LACK as a member of the Budget Committee and all the Members. We do all respect each other and get along. We just have some very serious disagreements about policy. That is fair. That is what this country is about. Once again, since I may not get to do it again as Chairman BLACK pursues another office and probably won’t ap-pear with me on the same program anymore, I just want to wish her the best and say what a joy it has been to work with her. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, may I in-quire as to how much time is remain-ing. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tlewoman from Tennessee has 30 sec-onds remaining. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, in 30 sec-onds, I want to once again say thank you to my colleague from the other side. I have enjoyed working with him. This is history. We are going to make history. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in their support of the budget because doing so means that we can truly benefit the American people, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. B
LACK ). The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8255 October 26, 2017 
Act sponsored by Representative B RUCE  W
ESTERMAN . We have all seen the devastating ef-fects of wildfires, especially this year. Unfortunately, the U.S. Forest Service estimates there are still nearly 58 mil-lion acres of forest at high or very high risk of wildfire. The bipartisan legisla-tion builds on our recovery efforts by giving the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management the tools nec-essary to better manage our public lands. The House will also consider H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors’ Access to Medi-care Act, sponsored by Representative P
HILROE. Supported by both Repub-licans and Democrats, this bill repeals ObamaCare’s Independent Payment Ad-visory Board—or, as most know it as, IPAB—and gives patients more control over their healthcare and not Wash-ington. Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider legislation to extend funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program and other important public health priorities. Now, this was marked up earlier this month by the Energy and Commerce Committee. This package will help low-income children get health coverage, continue funding important health priorities like community health centers, and do so in a fiscally responsible manner. I look forward to the House passing these commonsense bills next week without delay. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the major-ity leader announced that the CHIP bill will be on the floor next week. CHIP and community health centers have always been, as the majority lead-er points out, a bipartisan priority. Unfortunately, this bill did not come out of the committee as a bipartisan bill, and negotiations were essentially not fruitful, and the committee re-ported out legislation to extend these important programs that included bil-lions of dollars in partisan offsets. Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the ma-jority leader, does the gentleman know whether the $8.2 billion reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram, which serves nearly 9 million children from low-income working families, will be offset? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. b1115 Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. First, let me set the record straight. Yes, it did come out of committee, and, yes, we did hold it up three times be-cause your side of the aisle asked us to. But the reason why we are bringing it up next week is not because next week was the date we wanted. We wanted to get this done long ago. But the reason why we are doing it next week is be-cause Minnesota is about to run out of money. And my dear friend knows be-cause I sat with him, even this week, trying to work something out. Now, we know of these health cen-ters, and in this bill we doubled the money for them. Of course, this bill is offset. We do it in a fiscally responsible manner. But this is not something to play political games with because some leadership Member wants to hold it up and go into December. We believe com-mittees should be able to do their work. Now, we started out, and Committee Chair GREGWALDEN , three times, was asked to delay by the ranking Demo-crat of the committee, even though we know the timeline is about to hit a number of States that cannot wait for a lack of action here. So, yes, I am upset by this, but I am more upset about the number of times we sat down to try to work something out. And it was only yesterday I was told, Democrats said, no, they don’t want to do anything, so we should just go forward. That is not the way this place should work. If you look at this bill, I believe, if the committee had the freedom on the other side without the leadership tell-ing them they had to vote ‘‘no,’’ it would have come out of the committee with a much different vote. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. First, let me say, as far as I know, the leadership didn’t give any direction to the committee. The committee de-cided on its own that it thought that the cuts that were being proposed by the Republicans are very harmful to some very important programs in healthcare for seniors that the gen-tleman, in his previous remarks telling us what the schedule was, said were very important. So the reason that we have concerns is we believe the offsets being pro-posed, Mr. Speaker, by the Repub-licans, and why we don’t agree with the bill that is being brought forward is be-cause we think it hurts the healthcare of millions of Americans. Let me ask another question, Mr. Speaker, of the majority leader, and let me preface it with Mr. M
CCARTHY said in response to my question about the CHIP program: Of course, it is offset. Let me ask him a follow-up question. Does the gentleman know whether the $7.2 billion for community health centers that provide primary care serv-ices to 26 million medically under-served Americans will be offset? Mr. M
CCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HOYER. I yield to my friend from California. Mr. M
CCARTHY. Right before your question, you said you had concerns with the offsets. The gentleman knows that I reached out to him, I don’t know how many months ago, before a break, numerous times, right over on the floor on his side of the aisle, and I said: I am very concerned with what I am hearing on the Democratic side in the com-mittee; I would like to get CHIP done early. And I asked for your assistance, and you helped. There is one higher position on your side of the aisle who called the Speaker numerous times and pretty much shut down your committee. So three times we were asked to delay, and we did. That is why, this week, I went back to all of you and said: Let’s work out if you have a difference of opinion in pay- fors. It was not us who walked away from the table. It was the message I was de-livered from the other side of the aisle. So I don’t know why we are having this discussion. I don’t know why you are asking these questions. It is you and your side of the aisle that have said no. It is us who said: Let’s sit down and work this out. But let me walk through a few of the pay-fors so you understand them and so the American public can understand them, because I don’t think they are controversial. We require health insurance compa-nies to pay claims when they cover Medicaid enrollees while keeping Med-icaid as the payor of last resort. Now, that saves $4 billion. We say that individuals can’t skip on their premium for 90 days and get free coverage. That saves $5 billion. We say if somebody wins a high-dol-lar lottery, those winners should not be eligible for Medicaid. Now, your side of the aisle voted against that in committee. So the ar-gument that you are making that it is not bipartisan is true. Your side of the aisle believes that if someone wins mil-lions of dollars in the lottery, they should still be eligible for Medicaid. That will save $600 million that will actually go to the disabled, those who need this. And what is more important, these States should not have to wait. These States should not be put in this posi-tion. Colorado has just announced that it will freeze enrollment. It will freeze enrollment because you guys walked away from the table. It will freeze en-rollment because you say high-dollar millionaire lottery winners should still stay on Medicaid. I don’t think that is where the Amer-ican public believes this debate should go. I believe that is common sense. I believe that is an area that we can get to. Let’s care for the individuals, and let’s stop playing politics with this. I am personally stunned you are even asking about this because you know what has gone on. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I am cha-grined that I have stunned my friend, the majority leader. Yes, we don’t agree with some of those pay-fors. I happen to, by the way, agree. There is no reason why a lottery winner of millions of dollars ought to be on Medicaid. Mr. M
CCARTHY. Nobody did on your side of the aisle in the committee. They all voted against that. Mr. HOYER. I didn’t yield yet. I simply say to my friend, had I in-structed or the leader instructed, that outcome may have been different. How-ever, there are some really substantive issues that we had, we had for a long

time, we negotiated for a long time, and we didn’t reach agreement. My question to you was: Are they off-set? I think your answer was, yes, they were offset, and then you proceeded to tell me what the offsets were. Now, let me ask you a follow-up question to that. Does the gentleman know whether the repeal of IPAB is offset? That is a $17 billion deficit creation item. Is it offset? I yield to my friend. Mr. M
CCARTHY. If the gentleman’s question is if IPAB is offset, it doesn’t need to be. Mr. HOYER. Offset. Mr. M
CCARTHY. No, and it doesn’t need to be. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that answer. Perhaps now he knows why I asked the first two questions. Apparently, it is not the debt that is of concern, because if the debt were of concern, the $17 billion would be of concern. That was put in the bill, as the gen-tleman knows, to try to pay for, as we paid for every nickel of the Affordable Care Act, and that was one of the larg-er pay-fors. Now, many Members on your side of the aisle don’t like that pay-for, and many Members on my side of the aisle don’t like that pay-for. That pay-for said that we are going to decide, if we are exceeding expenditure caps, what needs to be cut. As the gentleman knows, that board has never been appointed. But if it had been appointed, we would have had 30 days—30 legislative days or calendar days—30 calendar days in which to say, no, we don’t agree with that. So the representatives of the people would have had that. But my point is we are selective in what we want to pay for, and I think that is a concern certainly to me, and I am sure it is to others. And the gentleman said: Of course, it is offset. The gentleman, here, says this is not offset. Can I ask the gentleman, why is this not offset? Why is this $17 billion ap-parently not a worry for the debt and the other dollars for children are nec-essary to be offset? I yield to my friend. Mr. M
CCARTHY. I appreciate the roundabout way of trying to get around why you are not involved in the CHIP program, but let me explain very eas-ily. Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, the gentleman is correct. The gen-tleman has come to me. We tried to work on getting it bipartisan. We didn’t reach that conclusion, and I re-gret that we didn’t reach that conclu-sion. The majority leader did, in fact, come to me in, I think, absolute good faith, and I wanted to try to get to a resolution. We didn’t get there, and I regret that. We are where we are. But I want to tell my friend that I am going to continue to try to work to-wards that objective. I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. I look forward to that. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. CHIP is in effect; IPAB is not. It hasn’t even created a board yet. So what you are saying to me is let’s off-set something that hasn’t even been created. What I am saying is the last time we had this bill on the floor, it was bipar-tisan votes. Democrats voted for it as well; 43 cosponsors on your side of the aisle. So I don’t think this question is just to me; it is probably for the whole body. But I think the reason the major-ity of the body wants to get rid of it is it hasn’t even been created, and the majority of the people think it is a bad idea. So let’s get rid of it now. And do you know what? CHIP is al-ready in effect. What is even worse on this process is it is in effect, but now people are freezing enrollments. So, if your argument why Democrats can’t help us on CHIP and why they want to defend millionaire lottery win-ners is somewhere that something not created has to be offset, I don’t think that is really a fair argument. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his response. I was going to respond later, but let me re-spond now. This bill was not marked up in com-mittee prior to its expiring, prior to the authorization ending. So when the gentleman talks to me about time, with all due respect, had it been an item of importance—which it is a bi-partisan bill. We both want to see this get done. The gentleman is correct, this program exists. The gentleman is also correct that, until we fix this, there will be States that will be run-ning out of money. That is a great con-cern to us. It will adversely affect mil-lions of children. We ought to get this done. We ought to get it done in a bipartisan fashion, and I am sorry that we didn’t. I am sorry the committee didn’t get it done so it didn’t have to come to the major-ity leader or come to my attention or the leader’s attention. But having said that, that does not answer the question of the gentleman says IPAB doesn’t exist. It certainly exists in scoring. As the gentleman surely knows, this is a $17 billion item that will have to be paid for at some point in time, and it will add to the debt if we don’t pay for it. It may not exist right now. It may not exist for reasons that the gentleman probably points out, correctly, that a large num-ber on his side and a large number on my side are not for it. I want to tell the gentleman that I am for it. I voted that way. But a large number of the majority of my party, I think, are not for it. I agree with that. But the fact of the matter is repeal-ing this is not paid for, and, as a result, the costs will have to come from some-where; but on CHIP we had to pay for it, and on community health centers we had to pay for it. I agree with that, by the way, Mr. Speaker. Mr. M
CCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HOYER. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. M
CCARTHY. Did I hear correctly that you voted to repeal IPAB? Mr. HOYER. I believe I did. No? I am checking on it. But I am saying here, publicly, I voted for the ACA. I think the ACA was good for the country, and one of the pay-fors we said we would pay for, and we did, one of the pay-fors was IPAB. If we want to substitute some other way to pay for the healthcare that we are giving, fine. That will not increase the debt. But if we don’t pay for repeal of this IPAB, it is going to increase the debt. I yield to my friend. Mr. M
CCARTHY. My question to the gentleman is: We have brought to the floor, twice, the repeal of IPAB. Am I understanding correctly that you voted to repeal that? Mr. HOYER. I thought I said, and let me reiterate, I voted against repealing IPAB. I am for IPAB. I will say it again. I know it is politically very con-troversial. It is a tough thing to do, but it helps pay for what we buy. And the problem in this House and the problem that we just did on the tax bill is we are not paying for what we buy. It is not spend-spend or tax-tax. We do not pay for what we buy. It is easy to buy and it is hard to pay. Here we are with another example. I yield to my friend. Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Let me repeat what happened on this floor in history. Twice, this bill has come to the floor. Neither time—the repealing of IPAB— has it been offset. And do you know what? Forty-three Members on your side of the aisle joined with us. So it was the will of this House, a majority. But if your argument is why we can-not fund children’s health, why we can-not say that millionaires winning a lottery have to stay on Medicaid, if that is the defense from the other side of the aisle why they walk away from the table, I am ashamed. We are better than that, and this House is better than that. I told you each time—and I tell the gentleman, I know it is not you, but there are other people on your side of the aisle who won’t even release their Members from committee. b1130 I know your members on the Energy and Commerce Committee did not want to vote ‘‘no’’ on that amendment. They don’t want to defend those mil-lionaires for being on Medicaid and taking away from the disabled and children. I know, in your heart, you don’t want to sit back and make CHIP have problems for States, that maybe

Minnesota and Colorado can’t increase enrollment, that they have to freeze it today. We are better than this. If twice it has come to the floor without an offset, and it is the majority of the House that voted on it and it is 43 of your members doing it, I think we should move on now. Let’s get back to the table. Let’s solve this problem. Mr. HOYER. I appreciate the gentle-man’s remarks and I appreciate the premise for which he stood. I look for-ward to having the Dream Act brought to the floor, which a majority of Mem-bers are for on this floor and will vote for. I believe my friend knows that to be the case, and I hope we would bring it to the floor. Let me go to this, if I can. The ma-jority leader did not mention whether Alexander-Murray was going to be on the floor next week. Obviously, as the gentleman knows, there is an extraor-dinary disruption of the marketplace in the healthcare insurance field. Alexander-Murray, at the request of President Trump, was an effort by Sen-ator A
LEXANDER , a Republican from Tennessee, a former Secretary of Edu-cation, and a former Governor of Ten-nessee, to respond to the President’s request and, as the gentleman has just noted, working in a bipartisan fashion to come to an agreement to stabilize markets to ensure that people are going to have healthcare and particu-larly to ensure that the poorest among us can afford their healthcare. Alex-ander-Murray is bipartisan and has over 60 Senators supporting it. Do you believe that that will be brought to the floor at any time in the near future? Mr. M
CCARTHY. I thank the gen-tleman for the question, but, as the gentleman knows, for a bill to come to the floor here, it first has to get out of the Senate. The Senate has not voted on that bill. I know the gentleman quotes a cer-tain number, but I would wait to see how many votes there are for the bill to see where it goes. As the gentleman knows, this House has passed a bill that repealed ObamaCare, reformed it, got us a new bill, but made those payments as it went forward. So there is a bill sitting in the Senate that they can take up and solve this problem at the same time. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the gen-tleman, my friend, the majority leader, with whom I work in a constructive way on many, many items mentioned earlier about how children may lose their health insurance or some of our less well-off citizens who rely on Com-munity Health Centers will lose access, and that, therefore, we need to get this bill done soon. Millions, I suggest to the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, will be adversely affected if we don’t pass a bill stabi-lizing it. Yes, I understand you introduced a bill to repeal. You control the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. We are now 10 months into the year. That bill hasn’t passed. So what we implore, Mr. Speaker, the administration and the majority party to do is not to do indirectly, that is, destroy access to affordable, quality healthcare for millions of Americans, that which they cannot do directly, and they haven’t done it directly. So I would hope that we could bring at least a bipartisan bill, in light of the failure to pass a partisan bill, which has, I am told, 60 Senators who have indicated they support it, maybe more. I would hope when it comes from the Senate, if Senator MCCONNELL will put it on the floor, that we will consider it forthwith, because the instability that grips the system now is hurting mil-lions, costing them millions, perhaps billions. So I hope that would be a pri-ority item for us, along with the bill that we call the Dream Act. We need to redeem the dream, Mr. Speaker, and continue a policy which the Speaker has indicated he thought was erroneously repealed by the Presi-dent of the United States, which I think many Republicans with whom I have talked to think is a policy that ought to be pursued. I hope we can bring that to the floor as soon as pos-sible, and certainly before Thanks-giving. Mr. Speaker, unless the majority leader has anything further to say, I yield back the balance of my time.

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF INDIAN ROCK DAM (Mr. PERRY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the 75th anniversary of Indian Rock Dam in York County, Pennsylvania. Indian Rock Dam was completed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1942 as part of an unprecedented boom of water resource infrastructure con-struction across America that stemmed from the Flood Control Act of 1936. It is an earth and rock structure measuring 1,000 feet long, rising 83 feet above the streambed that dams up to 9.1 billion gallons of water that other-wise would inundate downstream com-munities. While impossible to prevent all floods, we can limit the damage and risk. Since Indian Rock Dam was com-pleted in 1942, it has prevented more than $55 million in potential flood dam-age to our community of York, Penn-sylvania. Managed by the Corps’ Baltimore District, Indian Rock Dam is one of the 13 Corps dam projects in the Susque-hanna River watershed. For 75 years, Indian Rock Dam has been a silent protector for our citizens. For that and its continued benefit of reducing risks to Americans down-stream, I am proud to recognize the 75th anniversary of Indian Rock Dam. f 
HONORING SERGEANT BRYAN BLACK (Mr. HECK asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, Bryan Black was the kid in Puyallup, Washington, with boundless potential, always striv-ing to do more. He excelled in the classroom and, get this, both on the wrestling mat and at State chess tour-naments. Go figure. When he grew up, he took his poten-tial to the United States Army, where Staff Sergeant Bryan Black conquered Ranger School and Special Forces Se-lection. Sergeant Black was not just a war-rior and a protector, he was a healer. As a Green Beret in the elite 3rd Group, he served as a medic, always en-couraging and caring for those around him. On October 4, Sergeant Black was killed in Niger. Our hearts ache for his wife, Michelle; for his sons, Ezekiel and Isaac; and for his parents, Hank and Karen. Their son, husband, father, friend, and patriot will be remembered. Precious few among us dedicate our God-given ability to protection of our country, but as Sergeant Black’s fa-ther, Hank, so eloquently said: Some people could, would, should. Others do. Bryan did.

HONORING TROOPS ON DAY OF THE DEPLOYED (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the Day of the Deployed to honor the men and women of our Armed Forces who are serving overseas. Today we salute them for their serv-ice on behalf of the United States of America. We also acknowledge the sac-rifice of their families, who are sepa-rated from their loved ones during de-ployment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8258 October 26, 2017 
Mr. Speaker, serving one’s country is a noble and selfless act. These men and women have answered the call of duty, and today we honor their dedication, service, and courage. In 2016, there were nearly 1.3 million Active Duty military personnel. Nearly 200,000 of those Active Duty members are deployed overseas. From Japan to Germany, and from South Korea to Af-ghanistan, our American men and women serve with distinction. In the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-vania, more than 50 airmen from the 193rd Special Operations Wing are scheduled to return home this week following an overseas deployment in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. Mr. Speaker, I would like all of our deployed troops to know that we are proud of their efforts and are grateful for their service.

THE BUDGET AND TAX REFORM (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, just a month after the U.S. national debt sur-passed $20 trillion for the very first time, today this House passed an irre-sponsible budget that will add a shock-ing additional $1.5 trillion to that sum. This additional debt threatens our future prosperity and constricts our ability to respond to the challenges we face today. The cynical purpose of today’s budg-et is to pave the way so partisan tax reform can be fast tracked through the Senate, but financing tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit those at the very top by ballooning our Nation’s budget deficits is exactly the wrong ap-proach. We all agree our Tax Code is broken and needs reform, but true tax reform needs to be fiscally responsible. Rather than crafting plans behind closed doors, I urge my colleagues to reach across the aisle. Together, we can pursue reform of our Tax Code that focuses on the middle class, promotes entrepreneurship, job creation, and pri-vate investment, and supports public investment in our infrastructure. Let’s bring this tax reform debate into the open and get this done for the American people.

BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month, as well as all of the men, women, and families that have been affected by this devastating disease. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. Research, early diagnosis, and modern treat-ments are raising survival rates, but it remains the second leading cause of cancer mortality for women. During the month of October, we re-flect on the lives lost and the families affected by this cancer, including my own family and my own beautiful wife, Carol, who we just lost this last spring, but we also bring light to the actions that we can take to fight against it. I encourage all women to talk to your doctor about breast cancer screenings for early detection. I admire the unmatched courage of the survivors and those currently suf-fering from this disease. f 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, it is the 30th anniversary of Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Domestic violence is a crime that im-pacts every race, gender, class, and sex. In my home State, 33 percent of Cali-fornia women and 28 percent of Cali-fornia men will experience domestic vi-olence. Nevertheless, since this month was recognized for the first time in 1987, much progress has been made. I began my professional career as a prosecutor back in 1996, and I can tell you, back then it was tough to get a jury to understand and even listen to the circumstances behind domestic vio-lence, and it was tough to convince ju-rors that domestic violence is not a private issue that should be kept in the bedroom, but instead, it is a righteous issue that needed to be brought out in our courtrooms. Fortunately, there were police offi-cers to make arrests, there were pros-ecutors to try the cases, and there were advocates to give the victims the con-fidence they need to come forward. So this month we recognize those who support domestic violence victims, we vow to hold abusers accountable, and we strive to create and to update legislation that not only protects, but emboldens victims of domestic violence so that they can embrace living their lives.

LOCK HIM UP (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, when Derrick Harper stood in front of a Pittsburgh judge a few months ago, it was clear the defendant was a special kind of evil person. For years, Harper and his crew of de-viants ran the city’s most brutal and ruthless sex trafficking ring. The traf-fickers lined their pockets by forcing young women to have sex with count-less men every day. Any woman who attempted to escape their custody was tortured and gang raped. To degrade and dehumanize them, Harper shaved the women’s heads with butcher knives and branded them with hot irons. Harper was the ring leader of this massive trafficking organization, but it wasn’t until four of his young victims bravely escaped and testified against him that justice was served. His attempts to rob these women of their dignity had failed, and his reign of terror was finally over. Seeing the true depravity, the judge sentenced the defendant to 289 years in the peniten-tiary. As a former judge, I applaud this judge. Criminals need to be locked up, not victims. America must track down and prosecute these slave traders and rescue the victims from this scourge. And that is just the way it is. f 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed without amend-ment a bill of the House of the fol-lowing title: 
H.R. 1329. An ACT to increase, effective as of December 1, 2017, the rates of compensa-tion for veterans with service-connected dis-abilities and the rates of dependency and in-demnity compensation for the survivors of certain disabled veterans, and for other pur-poses. f 
THE HURRICANE AND OPIOID CRISES (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to urgently have set up an appeal process on an expedited basis for my constituents and those across the disaster-impacted areas of a FEMA denial appeal system. Thou-sands of my constituents have been de-nied FEMA assistance. Pictures just came to my phone last evening, and I am urging the FEMA Di-rector and all who can do so, including the President, we are not a 10. We are in desperate need of help. People do not have their lives restored. I also want to make mention of the fact that today there will be some statement made on this horrific opioid crisis, which we as Members of Con-gress have been dealing with for over a year. We understand that this may be called a public health service emer-gency versus a catastrophic emer-gency, using the Public Service Act or the Stafford Act. The Stafford Act funds are almost completely dimin-ished because of wildfires and hurri-canes. The casualties of opioid abuse are 142 per day, which is like an airplane crash every single day. With this amazing and unbelievable budget that has been passed, the Halloween budget of 2017, there will be trillions of dollars cut away from the budget. It is imperative that the President call this an emer-gency and begin to use emergency funds to deal with the opioid crisis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8259 October 26, 2017 
The only thing you can say today, Mr. Trump, is that you are committed to an emergency both for Hurricane disasters and others, but as well as the opioid crisis. Mr. Speaker, I include in the R
ECORD  my letter to the President: Mr. President, thank you for the invitation for Members of Congress to attend the unveiling of your emergency declaration on combatting the opioid epidemic. This is indeed an epidemic that I agree must be addressed immediately. This problem has claimed many lives throughout our coun-try, including my state of Texas and my home district of Houston. It is imperative that we act. It is equally im-perative that we act responsibly and intel-ligently. We cannot merely make promises on which the American people are waiting for us to de-liver, if we know that those promises will not come right away. We must have a clear goal and long-term commitment to truly combatting this dev-astating problem in the opioid crisis. Mr. President, where will this money come from, as this is a very costly endeavor? New funding streams would be required, and thus, making such a declaration without forethought relative to significant funding will prove to be a futile effort. There must be a strategy which we can re-alistically and effectively execute without caus-ing harm to equally important and urgent areas. Despite your previous promise to address the opioid crisis, at a Commission meeting last week, no real solution was developed. Instead, the Commission suggested that funding be taken out of the Public Health Service Act or the Stafford Act, both of which are problematic. First, I believe the nation’s public health emergency fund is empty. Second, the Stafford Act funds disaster re-lief for hurricanes and wildfires, which are under the jurisdiction of FEMA. As a Member of Congress that recently watched the fatal devastation inflicted upon my city of Houston, I can tell you firsthand, that we are still trying to wrap our minds around the catastrophic loss and how to now rebuild. America has experienced mass casualties due to recent hurricanes that occurred within the span of a month period, with approximate death tolls of 82 in Texas and Louisiana, 72 in Florida, 51 in Puerto Rico and countless disruptions and damages. The loss of lives, businesses and properties is astronomical as we continue to assess the damage in TX, LA, FL, VI and P.R. Therefore, I must caution the administration, to responsibly bear these facts in mind, as it attempts to combat the opioid epidemic, which is undoubtedly a very important issue.

THE 71ST RESCUE SQUADRON IS RECOGNIZED FOR ITS RESCUE EFFORTS (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to recognize the 71st Rescue Squadron of the United States Air Force, which is stationed at Moody Air Force Base in the first District of Georgia. They responded as part of the 23rd Wing effort by mobilizing their per-sonnel and equipment in order to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey in Texas. The 71st Rescue Squadron success-fully evacuated 308 flood victims and 38 family pets. They repositioned 15 res-cue crafts and teams to access difficult areas, saving 1,100 lives. In addition, they moved 83 tons of cargo and delivered 23,000 gallons of fuel, which was used to conduct heli-copter search and rescues. Because of their dedication to this country, this group received the That Others May Live Squadron of the Year Award for the Air Force. Thank you, 71st Rescue Squadron, for your extensive efforts to help the citi-zens of this country. f 
HANNAH AHLERS WAS THE ‘‘COOL’’ MOM (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, as I men-tioned a couple of weeks ago, I plan to speak on this floor about each victim who lost their life during the terrible shooting on October 1 in Las Vegas. My goal is to honor their lives and to en-sure that they will never be forgotten. Today I rise to remember Hannah Ahlers, a loving wife, mother, daugh-ter, sister, and friend, whose life was taken far too soon. Hannah lived in Beaumont, Cali-fornia, and had traveled to Las Vegas with her husband, Brian, and three other couples to attend the Route 91 Harvest music festival. Friends and family have described Hannah as a beautiful person inside and out, who was full of joy, and al-ways went out of her way to help her friends and family. Her commitment to her friends, fam-ily, and community was felt by every-one. She could light up the room at any moment she walked in. Her father- in-law described her as a young Mary Tyler Moore. She was also an amazing and devoted mother to her three children, Briannah, Brice, and Hailey. Her kids’ friends thought she was the cool mom, and they loved to be around her. She lived her life to the fullest, and enjoyed both the simple pleasures and outdoor thrills, like the skydiving community she was a part of. I would like to extend my deepest condolences to Hannah’s friends and family. Please know that the city of Las Vegas in Nevada and the whole country grieve with you. This is a trag-edy that should have never happened. OFFICER CRAIG LEHNER LIVED A LIFE OF HEROISM (Mr. COLLINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Officer Craig Lehner, a Buffalo police officer who lived a life of heroism and who tragically died during a recent training exercise on the Niagara River. Officer Lehner was a 9-year veteran of the Buffalo Police Department, serv-ing on the underwater recovery team, and also serving as a K–9 officer. His partner, a 4-year-old German Shepherd named Shield, served alongside him. Officer Lehner served our country for 16 years as an Army National Guard military police officer. Having served in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, he was a well-decorated staff sergeant, awarded more than a dozen medals for his brav-ery and military achievements. Officer Lehner made the ultimate sacrifice, and we will be forever grate-ful for his service. He will be remem-bered for his bravery and keeping Americans safe both abroad and in western New York. I offer condolences to his mother, Kathleen, and all of his surviving fam-ily during this very difficult time.

HONORING BERTHA WATSON HENRY (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hard work and esteemed career of Broward County Ad-ministrator Bertha Watson Henry. This week, Bertha is being honored at the International City and County Management Association’s annual con-ference in San Antonio as the recipient of the Mark E. Keane Memorial Award for Excellence. I could not think of a more deserving recipient for this pres-tigious award. Under Henry’s leadership, Broward County successfully navigated the 2008 recession with stable finances and a strong recovery. She has helped Broward maintain a triple A bond rat-ing since 2014, something only three other Florida counties have accom-plished. She has led construction of a new 714,000-square-foot county courthouse, a 40,000-square-foot animal adoption center, and she renegotiated financial agreements to protect Broward’s inter-est in the fourth largest National Hockey League venue in the U.S. Administrator Henry’s recognition at ICMA is also historic, as Bertha is the first-ever African-American woman to receive the Keane Award for Excel-lence. Most importantly, this achieve-ment is a reflection of Bertha’s com-mitment to her neighbors, the 1.9 mil-lion Floridians who called Broward County home.

HERKIMER CENTRAL SCHOOL DIS-TRICT SUPERINTENDENT ROB-ERT MILLER TURNS AROUND GRADUATION RATES (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Robert Miller, su-perintendent of the Herkimer Central School District. When Robert Miller became super-intendent of the Herkimer Central School District in 2013, he was facing a problem that many superintendents across this country are facing: a low and decreasing graduation rate. However, in the 4 years since Mr. Miller began in his new role, Herkimer has seen a drastic turnaround. The graduation rate has increased 11 per-cent, from 69 to 80 percent. However, in 2006, Herkimer’s gradua-tion rates were at 87 percent. Mr. Mil-ler has made it his mission to ensure that Herkimer Central School District reaches that number again. Mr. Miller noted that it was the dedi-cation of both teachers and administra-tors that led to the significant in-crease. Their ability and willingness to intervene with students at risk has helped these students successfully move to the next stage of their lives with the skills they need to contribute positively to our community. Thank you to Superintendent Miller and the dedicated staff at Herkimer Central School District for your tre-mendous work and commitment to our next generation of leaders. I know your effort will continue inspiring our stu-dents for years to come.

BOY SCOUT TROOP 728 CELEBRATES 70 YEARS (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Boy Scout Troop 728. This troop’s longstanding commit-ment to instilling positive social val-ues and building self-esteem and self- reliance in young men has provided a great benefit to our community. Opened in 1947, Troop 728 has pro-duced a tradition of excellence. It has been led by many dedicated Scoutmasters over its 70-year history, each of whom has contributed to the legacy of the troop. These passionate, active leaders allow the memories of past leaders to continue to flourish in the troop’s culture today. Traditions of Troop 728 include Scout breakfasts, hiking, camping trips, and summer camp. Additionally, Scoutmasters focus instilling leader-ship skills in troop members and devel-oping leaders for the 21st century. Troop 728 has produced over 30 Eagle Scouts, the most prestigious award that any young man can earn in Scout-ing. This demonstrates their continued commitment to their long legacy of service throughout the community. On this special anniversary, I would like to congratulate the leaders and members of Troop 728 for all of their successes. f 
HALLE THOMPSON LIVES AMONGST THE HEAVENLY HOST (Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, the image beside me is of a young lady named Halle Thompson, who was tragically killed in a car crash in my district. I penned this letter to her parents: ‘‘Dear Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, ‘‘Ryan, Janna, my own heart is rended as I pen this letter of encour-agement and condolence. ‘‘Your beautiful daughter Halle is, no doubt, in the presence of our beloved lady and our loving, forgiving Savior. You are each, no doubt, surrounded by the angels of Christ, as you endeavor each day to endure the grief of your loss, even as you present a strong and determined front to honor the life and spirit of your daughter. ‘‘I have personal insight relative to your pain, having lost my own first-born, my beautiful Daniela, long ago on the 10th day of November 1990. ‘‘I wish to compassionately convey it has come onto my heart that your Halle is present at this moment with my own Daniela, looking upon you both with adoration as you prayerfully honor and respect our Lord’s mys-terious will. ‘‘Please know that my prayers are with you and that my own quiet serv-ice to America and our fellow man is dedicated this day to the beautiful Halle, angelic now, as she lives amongst the Heavenly Host. ‘‘Respectfully, I remain, your humble servant.’’

NATIONAL FOREST PRODUCTS WEEK (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, as co- chair of the House Paper and Pack-aging Caucus, I rise today to recognize the 57th anniversary of National Forest Products Week. As an Oregonian, this week takes on special significance for me and my con-stituents. Oregon is home to over 174 wood products, paper, and packaging manufacturing facilities that make nearly $11 billion in products annually and contribute over $2 billion to the State and local economies through wages and compensation. I would like to recognize and thank the nearly 38,000 hardworking men and women employed by the forest prod-ucts industry in my State. Your con-tributions to our State and your local communities are greatly appreciated. In this country, we are fortunate to have the renewable natural resources and domestic manufacturing to be able to provide Americans with the paper or packaging tissue and wood products that are central to modern life and the modern economy. I want to thank and congratulate the people and employees in the forest products industry for the valuable role they play in the economy not only in my State and district, but to rural communities across this country. f 
b1200 LET’S WORK ON BIPARTISAN TAX REFORM (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, we can-not allow the Republican majority to trade away creating jobs here in Amer-ica for doling out massive tax breaks to wealthy corporations that have no intention of investing here in the United States of America. The Repub-lican plan will actually fuel more job outsourcing and move benefits to shareholders and overpaid CEOs, not the workers of our country. We can’t allow Republicans to cut education, cut Medicare, cut Social Se-curity, cut Medicaid, which serve the elderly and the ill. Eighty percent of the tax giveaways in their plan go to the top 1 percent. Untargeted tax cuts don’t create jobs. In fact, when Congress, during the 1980s, passed a tax cut, companies couldn’t outsource middle class jobs fast enough. It was a bad deal then, and it is a bad deal now. Our country can’t afford to balloon the deficit by $1.5 trillion so Wall Street can appease their shareholders a little more and stack the decks against American workers. Tax reform should not result in the outsourcing of our jobs. It should result in investing here in the United States of America, and that begins with real tax reform, not scam tax reform.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8261 October 26, 2017 
Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 60th anniversary of the publication of ‘‘Profiles in Courage.’’ John F. Kennedy’s famous volume tells the stories of eight American leaders who put country before party and pa-triotism before politics, men for whom personal integrity was more important than personal popularity or power. Unfortunately, the kind of political and moral courage that is described in Kennedy’s book is in tragically short supply within the modern Republican Party. Faced by a President intent on un-dermining the values and norms that sustain our democracy, frighteningly few Republicans have been willing to do more than wring their hands and roll their eyes. While Senator C
ORKER  and Senator F
LAKE have been boldly denouncing Donald Trump, they are ex-ceptions to a well-established rule. Indeed, when a new ‘‘Profiles in Cour-age’’ is written for the 21st century, we can be certain that no one from the current House Republican leadership is going to be featured in its pages. When questioned about Trump’s at-tacks on women, minorities, the dis-abled, and Gold Star families, Speaker R
YANhas been equivocal and evasive. When called upon to condemn Trump’s outrageous embrace of the White nationalists, Speaker R
YAN has deferred and deflected. When asked to defend Trump’s reck-less rhetoric on North Korea, Speaker R
YANhas done so enthusiastically. Earlier this week, on the Senate floor, Senator F
LAKE complained that ‘‘reckless, outrageous, and undignified behavior has become excused and coun-tenanced.’’ Mr. Speaker, P
AUL RYAN and the GOP leadership are the very people who are doing that excusing. They are normalizing and condoning actions that should shock us as Americans and shame us as a body. But don’t take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. With the help of my good friend, Congressman L
IEUof California, we will now read for you, in chrono-logical order, Speaker R
YAN’s re-sponses to Donald Trump’s most out-rageous and abusive behavior. Congressman L
IEU, let’s get started. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, before we do, let me just first say that today is Thursday. That means we all need to ask: Why do Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner still have their security clearances? But I digress. We are now going to read into the C
ONGRESSIONAL RECORD  outrageous and stupid things the Presi-dent of the United States has done or said, and then Representative G
ALLEGO  is going to give you Speaker R
YAN’s re-sponse. So I am going to start. On May 11, Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, and this is what Donald Trump said: ‘‘Regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey, knowing there was no good time to do it. And, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.’’ Mr. GALLEGO. Speaker RYAN’s re-sponse: Trump ‘‘acted and that’s what a President should do.’’ Real profile in courage there. Mr. TED LIEU of California. On May 16, it was revealed that Donald Trump asked Director Comey to drop an inves-tigation into General Flynn’s collusion with the Russians before he was fired. Trump said to Comey: Flynn ‘‘is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.’’ Mr. GALLEGO. The Speaker’s re-sponse: Trump’s ‘‘new to government, and so he probably wasn’t steeped in the long-running protocols that estab-lish the relationships between DOJ, FBI, and the White Houses. He’s just new to this.’’ Mr. TED LIEU of California. On May 22, Donald Trump confirmed he leaked classified information to Russian offi-cials at a meeting in the Oval Office. Mr. GALLEGO. The response from R
YAN’s office is, ‘‘The Speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration,’’ an explanation that the American people are still waiting for, by the way, 5 months later. There has been no explanation, and I am pretty sure there was no follow-up. Mr. TED LIEU of California. On July 17, Donald Trump defended his son, Don, Jr., for holding a highly inappro-priate and likely illegal meeting with agents of the Russian Government. Donald Trump said: ‘‘Most politi-cians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don, Jr., attended in order to get info on an opponent. That’s poli-tics!’’ Mr. GALLEGO. Speaker R
YAN was then asked whether he would have taken a meeting with a Russian official who offered opposition research on a political opponent. His evasive answer, of course, is: ‘‘I am not going into hypotheticals.’’ Mr. TED LIEU of California. On July 26, Trump announced a ban on transgender Americans serving our Na-tion in uniform. Let me just digress for a moment. Representative G
ALLEGO is a combat veteran. I served on Active Duty. We know that to have our strong, all-vol-unteer military, the best in the world, we need to recruit the best and the brightest. To discriminate against an entire class of people is not only wrong, it is harming our military read-iness. This is what Donald Trump said: Our military ‘‘cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disrup-tion that transgender in the military would entail.’’ Mr. GALLEGO. And to respond, and I will riff a little, the cost is minimal in terms of the medical costs. It is just an excuse for the President to be homophobic. But Speaker R
YAN’s condemnation of this, or renouncement, did not exist. He responded by pleading for more time, and said: ‘‘The DOD is reviewing this with the White House. I want to see what it is that they actually produce.’’ And, of course, that is another non-answer. Mr. TED LIEU of California. And we are still waiting. On August 8, Donald Trump reacted to escalating tensions with North Korea by irresponsibly threatening military action. Trump said: ‘‘North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.’’ Mr. GALLEGO. Speaker RYAN’s re-sponse, in regard to a potential nuclear war: ‘‘I think the President, in my own view of it, he likes the unpredictability side of this.’’ That is right. Speaker R
YAN thinks our Commander-in-Chief enjoys the un-predictability of bringing the world to the brink of a nuclear war. Mr. TED LIEU of California. On Au-gust 16, Donald Trump repeatedly re-fused to condemn a White supremacist rally in Virginia. Trump said: ‘‘I think there is blame on both sides. But you also had people that were very fine peo-ple, on both sides.’’ Mr. GALLEGO. Speaker R
YAN’s re-sponse: ‘‘I do believe that he messed up in his comments on Tuesday . . . he has since then cleared that up.’’ But Trump never clears up anything. He certainly did not in this case. Mr. TED LIEU of California. On Sep-tember 5, Trump announced his inten-tion to terminate the DACA program, a move that will expose 800,000 undocu-mented young people, Americans in every respect except on paper, to de-portation from the United States. Mr. GALLEGO. Before that decision was made, R
YANhad said: ‘‘Actually, I don’t think he should do that.’’ However, after the announcement was said, R
YANpulled an embarrassing U-turn so fast it would cause whiplash, saying: ‘‘President Obama was wrong to do it in the first place. . . . So Presi-dent Trump was right in his decision. He made the right call.’’ Shameless. Mr. TED LIEU of California. On Oc-tober 3, with millions in Puerto Rico without electricity or basic necessities, Donald Trump congratulated the peo-ple of the island on not losing hundreds of lives like in ‘‘a real catastrophe’’ like Hurricane Katrina. Despite massive flooding and over-whelming devastation, Trump called his administration’s response ‘‘unbe-lievable’’ and ‘‘incredible.’’ He attacked the mayor of San Juan and other local leaders who had plead-ed with his administration for addi-tional resources. Trump even criticized the brave people of Puerto Rico, claim-ing they are ‘‘throwing our budget out of whack.’’ And I would just also note that Trump was kind enough to dedicate a golf trophy cup to Puerto Rico. Mr. GALLEGO. Speaker R
YAN’s re-sponse: President Trump ‘‘has tremen-dous compassion.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8262 October 26, 2017 
You can see the compassion. ‘‘He is flying to these emergencies as soon as he can . . . it shows me that the people who are suffering from these tragedies are in his mind, front and center.’’ I am pretty sure the millions in Puerto Rico who still lack electricity and running water do not feel that way. They don’t feel that way about Trump, and they don’t feel that he has any compassion for them. And they definitely aren’t ‘‘front and center’’ for this President or his incompetent ad-ministration. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Finally, beginning October 17, President Trump repeatedly attacked one of our col-leagues, Congresswoman W
ILSON from Florida, and he essentially said that a Gold Star widow was lying. Mr. GALLEGO. So what was Speaker R
YAN’Sresponse? Actually, we are still waiting to hear from him. He hasn’t commented or issued a statement. When Trump repeatedly denigrates the personal integrity of a Member of this body, Speaker R
YANsays nothing. When Trump demeans a grieving widow whose husband has made the ul-timate sacrifice for our Nation, Speak-er R
YANstays silent. Frankly, it is em-barrassing. Congressman L
IEU, what do you think these responses from Speaker R
YAN say about the House Republican leadership and the state of the Repub-lican Party? Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative G
ALLEGO . There are really only two choices here. Either all of us in Con-gress can follow the leadership of Re-publican Senators J
OHN MCCAIN, BOB C
ORKER , and J EFFFLAKE and tell the truth, or we can be complicit. Senator J
EFFFLAKE is unwilling to be complicit. We are unwilling to be complicit. And keep in mind, when Senator B
OB C
ORKER , who is not a flamethrower, he is the chair of the Senate Foreign Rela-tions Committee, and he comes out and says that he is concerned that the President of the United States could lead us to world war III, Americans need to listen. So we call on Speaker R
YANto not be complicit and enable the reckless and dangerous behavior of our President, and that he have the courage to stand up and tell the truth and to really make sure that our President does not take our country off the rails. Mr. GALLEGO. Our Founding Fa-thers knew that there was danger in putting so much power in one person. They knew that giving too much power to one person, an irresponsible and im-mature leader, could use that to both effect democracy or enrich themselves. There is a reason why we have what we call the checks and balances. But one of those checks needs to be the U.S. House of Representatives. Under that, the person who is in charge of the U.S. House of Representatives is Speaker R
YAN. He is not providing that check. He is only helping this adminis-tration carry on with their abuse and with the destruction of what we under-stand are the norms of this democracy. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers are reminded to refrain from en-gaging in personalities toward the President. Members are also reminded to for-mally yield and reclaim time when under recognition. f 
b1215 ISSUES OF THE WEEK The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G
OHMERT ) is recognized for 60 min-utes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is in-teresting, when I am watching the news or looking at a newspaper, I can see what kind of pictures are there in the news story, and having been at press conferences where print media that is extremely slanted will come up, the photographer from such media source will come up and get right in front and then start taking pictures and have their camera on nonstop, just click, click, click, second after second. So you know they have got 100, 200 pic-tures. It is easy to know what they are doing. They are taking as many pic-tures as fast as they can. And you know that they are going to go through and they are going to take the picture in which your mouth is in the most contorted position, or where it looks like you are saying a word that would be inappropriate for an elected official to say. You know that is the picture they are going to put up, trying to make you look as stupid as possible be-fore you ever read the article. For some of us, it is not difficult to make us look stupid. We can’t help our looks. But you just know before you ever read the article, when you look at the picture, whether it is going to be a fair and objective article, or whether it is going to be totally skewed and to-tally subjective. I notice that, too, sometimes when friends across the aisle come with blown-up pictures. I can look at the pictures and tell whether it is going to be a fair and objective dissertation I am going to hear from my fellow Rep-resentatives across the aisle. But it is true of Republicans as well. I just don’t see those type of skewed pictures very often at all, if at all, from the Repub-licans. But, anyway, it seems to be a good rule of thumb. You look at the pictures and you can tell whether it is going to be fair or it is going to be a total hit piece. I have been very interested, though, to watch during the course of this last 9, 10 months as we come through 2017, the story nonstop from Representa-tives across the aisle has been about Russia, Russia, Russia. It sounds a bit like Sean Hannity, Russia, Russia, Russia, yes, but I don’t mind sounding like somebody I greatly admire. But isn’t it interesting that in the revelations that have been coming out in the last few days, our friends across the aisle have not been as anxious to run down and talk about Russia? But somebody needs to talk about it. I have been talking about it for quite some time, and for most of this year I have been pointing out that we actu-ally need a special prosecutor, a special counsel to investigate former FBI Di-rector Comey and to investigate the Clinton ties to Russia and the over $100 million in contributions that came from stakeholders, apparently, of Ura-nium One. It is just absolutely incred-ible. What is amazing, though, there are bound to be so many fingers going out emanating from that deal that we have not seen or heard of. We didn’t know what was going on, and now we know that the FBI headed by Director Rob-ert Mueller, at the same time that he was purging the FBI training materials of anything that offended radical Islamists that want to kill us, at the same time he was not investigating properly tips about the older Tsarnaev being radicalized that he was going to kill people. Let’s face it, when we get a tip that somebody has been radicalized as an Islamist, it means they are likely going to commit a terrorist act and try to take innocent lives, as Tsarnaev and his brother did. The FBI didn’t properly investigate. They didn’t know what to ask. They didn’t know how to investigate wheth-er or not somebody had been radicalized because Robert Mueller had purged the training materials so they couldn’t know what to ask, how to know if somebody has been radicalized, or they are a peace-loving Muslim, or they are radical Islamist. Mueller prevented that from hap-pening because he was so taken up with the idea of being friendly and neigh-borly, he called it his outreach pro-gram. He even testified before our Ju-diciary Committee years ago after I was there about—he kept wanting to make the point that the Muslim com-munity is exactly like every other community. Again, the Muslim com-munity is just like every other commu-nity. He kept making that point over and over as Democrats asked him ques-tions. And then he talked about his lovely outreach program with CAIR— the Council on American-Islamic Rela-tions—that has ties that were named as codefendants supporting terrorism with those who were actually convicted of supporting terrorism. Yet, even though the FBI had the evidence that convicted these sup-porting terrorists, and even though there was plenty of evidence that the people who he was trying to be friends with had radical terrorist ties, he con-tinued his so-called outreach program

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8263 October 26, 2017 
as people were plotting to kill Ameri-cans among those that he was trying to have meals with and be friendly with. But I asked him the question: You keep saying that the Muslim commu-nity here in America is just like every other community, and you keep brag-ging about your outreach program with the Muslim community. So I would like to ask you, Director Mueller, how was your outreach program going with Jews, Catholics, Baptists, and other re-ligious groups? How is that outreach going? How is your outreach going with the Buddhists and the Confucianists? Anyway, that was the basic question I asked. Of course, he was taken aback and he couldn’t explain because even-tually we got the truth. There is no outreach program like that that the FBI had with any other religious group. So it is kind of disingenuous, if not to say dishonest, to say that a group that requires special attention and cod-dling is somehow exactly like every other group in America. No, they re-quire special attention, at least that is what Robert Mueller thought. I don’t think any religious group that believes in our Constitution and sup-ports our Constitution requires any such special attention, as Robert Mueller was giving the outreach part-ner CAIR that has done so much dam-age to America and continues to under-mine evidence to find, arrest, and con-vict radical Islamists. It is normally like clockwork. As soon as a radical Islamist has com-mitted a terrorist act, it really is like clockwork. You can count on CAIR—C- A-I-R; not the kind that actually helps people around the world, but CAIR—to be out there with the news conference saying: This guy was not one of us. But at some point, I hope that people who are Muslims will quit listening to CAIR and will listen to the words of a much wiser individual, President el- Sisi in Egypt, who stood in a room with imams and told them: We have got to get our religion back away from the radicals, or they are going to de-stroy it. That is a courageous man, and I don’t find that kind of courage among the people who have these press con-ferences to deflect instead of helping us find and capture the radical Islamists before they kill too many people. They are out there trying to make it appear that they are not really radical Islamists; that they are something else. No, they are radical Islamists. They clearly are. I was kind of saddened that General Kelly ended up being the chief of staff for President Trump because I thought he was starting out to do a superb job as Secretary of Homeland Security. It turns out, as some of us had warned, that during the Obama admin-istration, all of this blather about countering violent extremism, CVE, that found its way into legislation that this body passed: Oh, let’s don’t call it ‘‘fighting radical Islamists.’’ Call it, ‘‘countering violent extremism.’’ Well, some of us had figured out the game, and Michele Bachmann was one of those people. Yes, it is not coun-tering violent extremism. It is fighting radical Islam. Thank God President Trump is now occupying the Oval Of-fice. He understood that ISIS was not just a JV team. They are people who are radical Islamists and they would love to kill as many Americans as pos-sible. They didn’t need to have their groups denigrated. They needed to have their groups destroyed. These were not people who were going to be rehabilitated. They were radical extremists that actually be-lieve with all of their heart that they win a place in paradise by killing inno-cent people. If you really want to go back to why there is an English translation copy of the Koran in the Library of Congress that was purchased, owned by Thomas Jefferson, it was because he was nego-tiating with the radical Islamists, the Barbary pirates in North Africa. He was so well-educated, so well-read, he couldn’t understand why the Barbary pirates, who were radical Islamists, kept attacking American ships. As he indicated: We are not a threat to you. We don’t even have a Navy to speak of. We are not your enemy. We don’t understand why you keep attack-ing American ships. And he was told that, under their be-lief system, those Islamists believed they went to paradise if they died kill-ing what we would consider innocent people and they consider people worthy of death; they would go to paradise. Jefferson, as well-read as he was, he couldn’t believe that there was any re-ligion anywhere in the world that be-lieved you could go to Heaven or para-dise if you are killed while you are killing innocent, unsuspecting people who are not military. They are not a threat to the radical Islamists’s life, yet they thought they were going to go to paradise and have 70-some-odd vir-gins or so waiting for them. He couldn’t believe it. So that is when he got his own copy of the Koran, because he just couldn’t believe there was a re-ligion that believed you could go to paradise if you are killing innocent people. Hopefully that will set the record straight with some folks who thought it showed how open-minded Thomas Jefferson was. Actually, he was quite open-minded. Some have tried to deni-grate him because he had slaves. The man made plenty of mistakes, and one of them was an egregious wrong he did upon John Adams. b1230 They had been friends for years. It was Adams who asked him to do the first draft of the Declaration of Inde-pendence. Jefferson was wise enough that, when he did the first draft of the Declaration of Independence, if you look at the different grievances that he set out as to why they should be inde-pendent from England, the longest paragraph of the grievance was about how King George allowed slavery to ever start in America. At the time, Virginia had a law mak-ing it illegal to free your own slaves, so he was law-abiding. But he believed that one of the worst things that ever happened to America was King George’s allowing slavery to start and exist in this country and that it was going to cause massive problems that would be very difficult to cure. He was exactly right on all fronts. There are some even claiming that George Washington should have his name removed from schools or public places when the fact is there would be no free America without George Wash-ington having lived at the time he did. I believe with all my heart that George Washington was the man for such a time as that. There has never been a man in all of history who led a mili-tary in a revolution, won the revolu-tion, and then tendered his resignation, as we see down the Hall, his outreached hand. I think it is the most important scene in all of the Capitol. It is a mas-sive mural. He is handing in his res-ignation. He sought no further power. He could have been king of America or an emperor. There were a couple of coups they tried to involve him in. He stopped them. Anybody else in the world we know from history would not have done what he did. He was reluc-tant to take any power, yet because of his humility and his focus on creating a free and independent land, we have a free and independent land. Yes, he had slaves, but he was deal-ing with a Virginia where there was a law against freeing the slaves. But even so, he put in his will that their slaves would be free upon the death of his wife. Certainly, there are better ways to have done that. He was trying to abide by the law. We have such an incredible history with people like Washington. Some of us were attending an address by an au-thor who had researched and done a bi-ography on Benjamin Franklin, over at the Library of Congress, we were hear-ing. Someone asked him: Is there any-body you can think of in modern Amer-ica who reminds you of Ben Franklin? He said: Actually, we have got many people who are witty, clever, and very inventive. Yes, Ben Franklin was an absolutely incredible man. Of course, I am paraphrasing. But he said: It wasn’t like he was George Washington. There was only one of those, just only one of those. We had the director of The Society of the Cincinnati speak at the Library of Congress on one occasion. He was asked—since most biographers, the more they dig into the background of an individual, and he had studied Washington every year of his adult life—did he come to a point where he had less respect for Washington be-cause of all of the details he discerned about Washington’s life.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8264 October 26, 2017 
He indicated that he could honestly say that, in addition to knowing more about Washington every year of his adult life, that he had more respect, admiration, and awe of George Wash-ington with each passing year, with every bit of information he learned. That is the kind of incredible history we have, the kind of selflessness. People say, oh, yeah, but Wash-ington, look at the big payoff he got. He didn’t take a salary, but, boy, did he take a lot of money after the Revo-lution. Actually, he didn’t take a salary. He didn’t take a payoff. He was reim-bursed some of his out-of-pocket ex-penses. He had been paying for spies to work for the country. He had paid so much out of his own pocket, and he was only seeking part of what had come out of pocket knowing that, if the Revolution failed, not only would he have been killed, but, obviously, his family would not have had all that money he spent. So I think that kind of puts in per-spective, when we start looking at peo-ple who are willing to sell off Amer-ica’s national security for millions of dollars—well, you have to admire their appreciation for large amounts of money, but not at the price of selling our safety. So, for all this year, I have been say-ing that Robert Mueller should never have accepted the role of special coun-sel because we knew that James Comey was such a close and dear friend of his, and Comey was a witness central to this investigation. He could not be a fair arbiter, a fair investigator. If he had been properly morally inclined, he should have said: I can’t be the special counsel because I am too close—espe-cially to Comey—to these people. Comey, himself, testified that, before he testified up here at Congress, he talked to Mueller. There is a 2013 Washingtonian article that was just a long, glowing piece on Comey that, in effect, if the world were burning down, the one person Comey would know would be right there with him would be Robert Mueller standing with him. These guys were so close. He looked at Mueller as a mentor. They were really tight. The question in my mind, because of that tightness, since we know Comey leaked in order to, as he said, try to get a special counsel, that Mueller en-couraged him to do that: Was Mueller behind this setup to get a special coun-sel so he could be appointed and start making massive amounts of money and hire all of these Republican-hating Democrats, contributors to Hillary Clinton, some of them? Wow, what a great setup for a guy who obviously held grudges against some Republicans. This is somebody who should not have been appointed, even though he was appointed to be Di-rector of the FBI by George W. Bush. Obviously, George W. Bush was try-ing hard to pick the right people and taking other advice like his father’s mistake in appointing David Souter. Wow, what a disaster that appointment turned out to be. He turned out to be a wolf in sheep’s clothing, appearing to act as one thing when we saw his teeth as he went to the Supreme Court. Edith Jones and David Souter came under consideration. I have been told they were both sitting in the White House as President H.W. Bush tried to figure out which one to appoint. If he had appointed Edith Jones, history would be totally different, and we would not have either Justice Kagan or Justice Sotomayor because whom he appointed would never have resigned during President Obama’s Presidency. So those kinds of mistakes have long- reaching effects. But President Bush appointed Mueller. And the more I find out, un-like the director of The Society of the Cincinnati finding out about Wash-ington and growing in awe and admira-tion, the more I find out about Robert Mueller, the more concerned I am. The disclosures this week about what this man knew, what this man was involved in, and what he did—I thought he was accepting the role of special counsel because of some possible revenge mo-tive: he had a dislike for some Repub-licans, loved the idea of doing what Patrick Fitzgerald did, who happened to be not just a friend of James Comey; he was the godfather of a Comey child. Of course, we found out later that Comey recommended to Attorney Gen-eral Ashcroft he should recuse himself so that he could appoint the godfather of his child, Patrick Fitzgerald, to be the special counsel. We found out this year, well, Comey leaked information— which may or may not have been a crime; it needs to be investigated—in order to get a special counsel ap-pointed. So he is using the same type of ma-nipulative behavior as he did to get the godfather of his child appointed special counsel in order to get the one guy who would be with him through thick and thin, no matter how bad things got, Robert Mueller, get him appointed spe-cial counsel. I had no idea that Robert Mueller had been involved and been Director of the FBI as they investigated Russia’s efforts to corner the market on ura-nium and to spend millions and mil-lions of dollars to acquire United States uranium. He is Director of the FBI. They are investigating this. Even knowing that, it appears that he and now-Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein actually covered up their investigation so that people would not get upset with Secretary Hillary Clin-ton for being an approver of the deal of selling America’s uranium to an enemy of the United States. According to all the Democrats, for all this year, Russia, Russia, Russia is this big horrible enemy, and how dare anybody do business with them. It turns out that, actually, they were the ones who were involved in this terribly sordid business of selling our national security to the Russians. The FBI had investigated. They had all of this information, and they even had an FBI informant, as Mueller knew as Director of the FBI. The informant had been working with the Russians. It was an undercover operation, perhaps the most important one the FBI had going on at that time. They did have the operation going on under Director Mueller of creating a fictitious case against Senator Ted Stevens, Republican from Alaska, in which they created evidence. They con-spired to hide evidence that completely didn’t just exonerate Ted Stevens; it showed that he was law abiding. They hid that evidence, and they manufac-tured a case that would cost him his Senate seat. The loss of his Senate seat ended up putting him on a small plane that crashed, and he lost his life. As far as I know, there were no ties of the plane crash to Mueller, but Mueller was the FBI Director. Thank God that there was an FBI agent involved in that investigation and that, after Ted Stevens was con-victed, he couldn’t stand it. His con-science would not allow him to sit quietly by after the FBI and the U.S. Attorney—but this FBI lead agent, under Director Mueller as Director, just fabricated a case. It turns out not only did Ted Stevens not accept hundreds of thousands of dollars of improvements to his home without paying for them, he paid more, hundreds of thousands more, than the improvements were worth. Apparently, there was even evidence that they cov-ered up where the contractor is saying: Look, Ted, you are paying more than we are charging you. Stevens would say: Look, I am con-stantly being watched. People don’t like my political positions, so I have got to be so far above and beyond eth-ical and moral that I have got to pay more. Just accept the checks for over-payment. The guy is overpaying, and yet they came after him knowing that this was an innocent man. They prosecuted him and convicted him. So after the whistleblower FBI agent comes forward under Director Mueller’s leadership, what happened? The informant was ordered to be kept from investigating any criminal cases, which meant he had no job at the FBI. He went ahead and did as he was being pushed to do. b1245 He went ahead and resigned. Thank God for a man with a conscience like that. His affidavit made clear that the lead agent had manufactured evidence and hid evidence from the defense counsel, because they had come in with war-rants and taken everything: computer drives, thumb drives, documentary evi-dence, and gone to the bank and gotten his documents. He did not have any evidence to show you how innocent he was, because the FBI had taken it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8265 October 26, 2017 
I know FBI agents who are the most honest people I have ever met. We have thousands of them in this country. Thank God for them. But what happened under Director Mueller’s leadership? Well, the whistleblower that exposed the fraudulent misconduct gets run out of the FBI, under Director Mueller. And what happened to the one who fabricated the evidence, fabricated the case, hid evidence that showed Ted Ste-vens’ innocence? When Mueller is Director, that FBI agent continued to get accolades and be moved on to investigate some of the most important cases the FBI had. That was Director Mueller. He also had a policy he created called the 5-year up-or-out policy, which an article in The Wall Street Journal pointed out years ago. It ended up de-stroying or running off thousands and thousands of years of experience from the FBI, weakening this incredible in-vestigative body that, until Mueller got there, was the best investigative body in all of America. But after running off thousands of thousands of years of experienced FBI agents so that he could have less expe-rienced agents—agents who would not have the experience to say: But, Mr. Director, that would be a mistake, which was done in 1985 or 1992, and it didn’t work out—no, he had people with no experience. I know from being a prosecutor that right out of law school you are ready to put the bad guys away. You are going to push the line to the limit. You are going to do your job, salute the flag, and it always helps to have expe-rienced people around to say: Look, I know you mean well. That is not a good idea. Mueller liked to run those people off. He spent millions of dollars that some agents pointed out was being wasted on programs that were wasteful and inef-fective. Now that we know what is coming out this week, I am surprised how naive I continue to be. I thought Mueller accepted the job of special counsel to investigate the Russia- Trump alleged relationship because it would be a great job and he could carry out vendettas that he might have. That was so naive. Now we know that he had an inves-tigation of Russia. He had an under-cover informant for years working on the case and that he covered up that investigation, along with Rod Rosen-stein, so that Hillary Clinton could make this deal, approve the deal. And yes, there were other people who approved the deal. I believe that Attor-ney General Eric Holder also approved the deal and also helped covered up the investigation to show the investigation would show, from all the indications, that Russia was committing crimes in America to get ahold of our uranium. Knowing that, if that investigation were made public, there is no way Hil-lary Clinton and Eric Holder could have approved the deal that was selling off 20, 25 percent of America’s uranium to Russia. She could never have done that. If she hadn’t done that, there is not any doubt in some of our minds that the investors, the stockholders, ulti-mately, of Uranium One certainly would not have contributed over $100 million to the Clinton Foundation, and Russia would not have been paying half a million dollars for one short speech— remarkably, it is hard to believe from the State of the Union Addresses he gave, but he actually could give a short speech and get half a million dollars for one short speech. He didn’t get paid that much for other speeches. What was so special? Could it be that Hillary Clinton was so critical in persuading others to sign onto allowing Uranium One to get so much of our uranium? Gee, perhaps that is why Russia was so emboldened? Then we find out there is more than that. The Democratic National Com-mittee, we are told, were helping pay for this dossier that just created the most lurid, ridiculous allegations against Donald Trump as a candidate, trying to destroy his Presidency. Not only that, the DNC was involved, and the Clinton campaign may have been involved, and the FBI gets in-volved with that, and it appears they may have used the DNC to pay for manufactured evidence that was abso-lutely false and that could be used to get the FBI, under Mueller’s control and the U.S. Attorney’s Office, under Rosenstein’s control, to go after the Trump campaign and possibly get wire-taps, based on the DNC Fusion GPS manufactured evidence. So going back to Mueller accepting the appointment as special counsel and Comey possibly committing a crime the way he went about leaking private information to The New York Times, it appears, if you look at his contacts and who reported what from The New York Times and what could have only been known by James Comey—it is possible he did it six other times—it is possible James Comey committed crimes in one or all of those six other leaking occa-sions, if he was the source, as it ap-pears he may very well have been. Now, it becomes more clear in my na-ivety in thinking Mueller had personal motivation, including getting paid for a job he would love to do to go after people he didn’t like in the Republican Party, including Donald Trump. But now it is becoming more clear. Comey needed Mueller to be a special counsel, and he admitted it in testimony here. He leaked information, which may have been a crime, in order to get a special counsel that he had to have known was going to be Robert Mueller, his friend joined at the hip, and that his other friend, Robert Rosenstein, would certainly appoint Mueller, be-cause Rosenstein and Mueller were in-volved in covering up the FBI’s inves-tigation of Russia and their efforts to get uranium. If Mueller and Rosenstein hadn’t cov-ered up that and helped seal that infor-mation and gotten the informant to agree to a nondisclosure agreement, then Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation would be short megamillions that they received as a result—it certainly appears—of the uranium transfer from the U.S. to Rus-sia. So, Mueller and Rosenstein and Comey all needed Mueller to be ap-pointed, and Mueller needed to accept appointment as special counsel, be-cause he had to cover up the cover-up that he and Rosenstein had been in-volved in years earlier in order to fa-cilitate the deal that was made to sell off our national security. President Trump had this great plank in his platform as he ran for President that we need to bring in money that Americans have earned overseas back into the United States. Well, it has never been here, but bring it into the United States. But these American citizens and American companies have had to leave it in foreign banks and in foreign busi-nesses in foreign countries because, in some countries, they pay 50, 60, 70 per-cent tax on it. If they bring it into the United States, they will be required to pay probably 40 percent, plus penalty and interest. So 35, 39 percent, plus penalty and interest. They can’t afford to do that or they would be paying more tax than the money they earned. So they had to leave it in foreign coun-tries and in foreign banks. Former FDIC Chairman Isaacs came to the Hill back when this doofus named Henry Paulson was telling us we had to give him $700 billion so he could buy mortgage-backed securities and save our economy. In our private conference call—I will never forget—he said: I have got to have $700 billion to buy these mort-gage-backed securities because nobody knows what they are worth and only the government has the wherewithal to buy those. Hold them until they get value back, and that will save all these banks and keep them from going under, which would destroy the United States economy and take us back to a day worse than September of 1929. So you have got to give me $700 billion to buy these mortgage-backed securities. When we were allowed to punch in and ask a question, somebody in my party beat me to the question, and it was this: Secretary Paulson, if nobody knows what these mortgage-backed se-curities are worth, how do you know you need $700 billion to buy them? I will never forget his answer: ‘‘We just needed a really big number.’’ When I heard that, I knew that this bozo did not need $700 billion. We shouldn’t have trusted him as Sec-retary of Treasury. But he got his $700 billion. Between him and Geithner, they bailed out their friends, they bailed out the big banks while the com-munity banks were being punished. They had to borrow money at regular

rate, and they made sure that their friends, the investment banks that brought us to the brink of ruin, got money for nothing. In fact, they got big bailouts. That was a bad day in American history. Isaacs had the idea that you don’t need to take taxpayer money. If you will just say the United States Con-gress should pass a bill that says any-thing we declare to be a troubled com-pany or a troubled asset, if that is in-vested in by American companies, American individuals who have earned money overseas, never brought it into the country, if they will bring that money from those foreign countries and invest it in what Congress labels as troubled, they will pay no tax on bring-ing that money into the country. Then we will probably have a trillion dollars come in. You won’t need the $700 bil-lion in taxpayer money or borrowed money from China to bail out the banks. You will have Americans who will invest in those with money they earned overseas. You don’t need TARP. It won’t be the government getting into bed with the big banks and the terrible precedent that will set. That was a great idea. But Paulson was so determined to let his enemies like Lehman Brothers go bankrupt without help and to allow his company Goldman Sachs to be the big dog, that he didn’t want to do Isaacs’ idea, and he convinced enough Mem-bers of the House, both Republican and Democrat, to give him $700 billion, be-cause he needed a really big number. Well, President Trump had that simi-lar idea: let’s allow American money to come into America that is earned over-seas, and that will get our economy going. Americans will bring this money in, and it will be great for the econ-omy. That is what we need to get the economy going. Well, little did we know that, years before, candidate Donald Trump had the idea of bringing in American- earned money from foreign countries to get our economy going. Yet Hillary Clinton had the idea of selling off our national security to get megamillions to go to the Clinton Foundation, her and her husband’s bank account, to get the economy going in America. b1300 Wow, that was a great idea, wasn’t it? We sell off some of our national secu-rity to bring in foreign money, specifi-cally, Russian money to get our econ-omy going. And if she had been elected President, then the cover up that Mueller and Rosenstein did of the original investigation into Russia’s ef-forts to corruptly buy American ura-nium and corner the market, that would continue to be covered up. Wow, what a great deal. Even though Hillary Clinton did not win the elec-tion, Donald Trump did. And they got Donald Trump’s Attorney General to recuse himself so that Rosenstein, a guy that participated in covering up the original FBI investigation, could appoint someone else who helped cover up that original uranium investigation with the Russians and make him spe-cial counsel so that not only would he make a lot of money and get to work with lots of people he liked that hated Trump and loved Hillary, but he could also cover up the prior coverup, even though Hillary didn’t get elected. Amazing the kind of stuff that is com-ing out now. The work that John Solomon and The Hill have done has been extraor-dinary. I have got an article from Octo-ber 25: ‘‘FBI informant in Obama-era Russian nuclear bribery was cleared to testify before Congress.’’ That is great news. Despite Mueller and Rosenstein’s efforts to keep their prior Russian investigation that they covered up so that the Russia uranium deal could go through, wow, we may actually get to find out about that now that the FBI informant has been cleared under the current Justice De-partment, under Jeff Sessions. We will get to find out more about that Russia effort to corner the market using U.S. uranium. An article from FOX News: ‘‘Gag order lifted: DOJ says informant can speak to Congress on Uranium One, Russia bribery case with Clinton links.’’ And then I was glad to see a friend down the hall, C
HUCK GRASSLEY , a sen-ator there from Iowa. He is calling for special counsel in the Uranium One scandal. Of course, that is appropriate. The FOX News article: ‘‘Clinton mum on Fusion GPS scandal as Dems’ dos-sier denials pile up.’’ That is from Oc-tober 26. So now there are indications the Democrat National Committee, a Mem-ber actually paid for this fictitious dos-sier that could be used to get warrants to investigate political opponents in a Presidential race. This is incredible. Absolutely incredible. Even going back to Tammany Hall, as far as I can recall, they didn’t have an FBI Director and an Attorney Gen-eral or Deputy Attorney General that had helped cover up a prior investiga-tion so that their friends could make millions of dollars. Let’s see. There is an article in The New York Times from Jo Becker and Don Van Natta, Jr. This goes back Jan-uary 31 of 2008. It indicates: ‘‘Late on September 6, 2005, a private plane car-rying the Canadian mining financier, Frank Giustra, touched down in Almaty, a ruggedly picturesque city in southeast Kazakhstan. Several hundred miles to the west, a fortune awaited: highly coveted deposits of uranium that could fuel nuclear reactors around the world. And Mr. Giustra was in hot pursuit of an exclusive deal to tap them. ‘‘Unlike more established competi-tors, Mr. Giustra’’—I will just say ‘‘Mr. G’’—‘‘was a newcomer to uranium min-ing in Kazakhstan, a former Soviet re-public. But what his fledgling company lacked in experience, it made up for in connections. Accompanying Mr. G on his luxuriously appointed MD–87 jet that day was a former President of the United States, Bill Clinton. ‘‘Upon landing on the first stop of the three-country philanthropic tour, the two men were whisked off to share a sumptuous midnight banquet with Kazakhstan’s President . . . whose 19- year stranglehold on the country had all but quashed political dissent.’’ Another man ‘‘walked away from the table with a propaganda coup after Mr. Clinton expressed enthusiastic support for the Kazakh leader’s bid to head an international organization that mon-itors elections and supports democ-racy. Mr. Clinton’s public declaration undercut both American foreign policy and sharp criticism of Kazakhstan’s poor human rights record by, among others, Mr. Clinton’s wife, Senator Hil-lary Rodham Clinton of New York. ‘‘Within 2 days, corporate records show that Mr. G also came up with a winner when his company signed pre-liminary agreements giving it the right to buy into three uranium projects controlled by Kazakhstan’s state- owned uranium agency. . . . ‘’ So it is just incredible. The deeper you get in this stuff, the more it smells. A Wall Street Journal article written by Holman Jenkins, Jr.: ‘‘The FBI’s Political Meddling.’’ Interesting story. I like the way it starts because it starts referencing a movie, I believe. ‘‘Let’s give plausible accounts of the known facts, then explain why de-mands that Robert Mueller recuse him-self from the Russia investigation may not be the fanciful partisan grandstanding you imagine. ‘‘Here’s a story consistent with what has been reported in the press—how re-liably reported is uncertain. Demo-cratic political opponents of Donald Trump financed a British former spook who spread money among contacts in Russia, who, in turn, over drinks, solic-ited stories from their supposedly ‘con-nected’ sources in Moscow. If these people were really connected in any meaningful sense, then they made sure the stories they spun were consistent with the interests of the regime, if not actually scripted by the regime. ‘‘The resulting Trump dossier then became a factor in Obama administra-tion decisions to launch an FBI coun-terintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign, and after the elec-tion to trumpet suspicions of Trump collusion with Russia. ‘‘We know of a second, possibly even more consequential way the FBI was effectively a vehicle for Russian med-dling in U.S. politics. Authoritative news reports say FBI Chief James Comey’s intervention in the Hillary Clinton email matter was prompted by a Russian intelligence document that his colleagues suspected was a Russian plant. ‘‘Okay, Mr. Mueller was a former close colleague and leader but no

longer part of the FBI when these events occurred. This may or may not make him a questionable person to lead a Russian-meddling investigation in which the FBI’s own actions are nec-essarily a concern. ‘‘But now we come to the Rosatom disclosures last week in The Hill. . . . ‘‘Here’s another story as plausible as we can make it based on credible re-porting. After the Cold War, in its own interest, the U.S. wanted to build bridges to the Russian nuclear estab-lishment. The Putin government, for national or commercial purposes, agreed and sought to expand its nu-clear business in the U.S. ‘‘The purchase and consolidation of certain assets were facilitated by Cana-dian entrepreneurs who gave large sums to’’—drum roll—‘‘the Clinton Foundation, and perhaps arranged a Bill Clinton speech in Moscow for $500,000. A key transaction had to be approved by Hillary Clinton’s State De-partment.’’ How about that? ‘‘Now we learn that, before and dur-ing these transactions, the FBI had un-covered a bribery and kickback scheme involving Russia’s nuclear business, and also received reports of Russian of-ficials seeking to curry favor through donations to the Clinton Foundation. ‘‘This criminal activity was appar-ently not disclosed to agencies vetting the 2010 transfer of U.S. commercial nuclear assets to Russia.’’ That is why, Mr. Speaker, I refer to the original FBI and DOJ coverup in-volving Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Mueller, which was going to be able to be covered up. That is, so we under-stand the plot here, Mueller as FBI Di-rector, and Rosenstein working as U.S. Attorney or deputy U.S. Attorney, whatever he was at the time. It is in-teresting, I hear a rumor that he may have even signed on part of this sealing documents to help cover up the origi-nal investigation. It would be inter-esting to see if he did that. Wow. If it turns out he signed off to get the FBI investigation document sealed, and Mueller, as FBI Director, was charting the course to get this thing sealed, cov-ered up, well, the guys that did the coverup are in charge of the investiga-tion, which would allow them to cover up their prior coverup, which would look bad since they covered it up to allow the Hillary Clinton approved deal selling United States security via our uranium to Russia. I didn’t realize how bad Russia was until my friends across the aisle and Secretary Clinton—candidate Clinton— defeated candidate Clinton kept talk-ing about how bad Russia was. Well, they about convinced me. But this article says: ‘‘The criminal activity was apparently not disclosed to agencies vetting the 2010 transfer of U.S. commercial nuclear assets to Rus-sia. The FBI made no move to break up the scheme until long after the trans-action closed. Only 5 years later, the Justice Department, in 2015, disclosed a plea deal with the Russian perpetrator so quietly that its significance was missed until The Hill reported on the FBI investigation last week.’’ They almost, if not for the good work of Mr. Solomon and I think somebody else at The Hill, might have been missed entirely. So good work. There are some potential Woodwards and Bernsteins out there, in addition to the hardworking news investigators with places like The Daily Caller and Judi-cial Watch, Conservative Review, and others. The article goes on to say: ‘‘The agency, when Mr. Mueller headed it, soft-pedaled an investigation highly embarrassing to Mrs. Clinton as well as the Obama Russia reset policy.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

b1315 BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. H
ILL) for 30 minutes. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Breast Cancer Awareness Month to call attention to this topic that is so important throughout our Nation. With one in eight U.S. women, or 12 percent, developing breast cancer over the course of their lives, too many of us know someone who has been diag-nosed with this tragic disease. I lost my mother as a result of breast cancer, and my friend and former dis-trict director, Jill Cox, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015. She at-tributes her strides in recovery to early detection and self-examinations. Many women with breast cancer have no symptoms, underscoring the impor-tance of how regular breast cancer screenings and self-examinations can save lives. No test is too early. We all must continue to work to-gether and move forward addressing breast cancer, and I urge my colleagues to continue their focus on this critical issue. 
CODY HILAND APPOINTMENT AS U .S. ATTORNEY  
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my good friend Cody Hiland’s appointment as the U.S. attor-ney for the Eastern District of Arkan-sas. A native of Conway, Arkansas, Cody graduated from the University of Cen-tral Arkansas and the William H. Bowen School of Law in Little Rock. He served as the prosecuting attorney for the 20th Judicial District of Arkan-sas since 2010. Before beginning his career in law en-forcement, Cody was a partner at his own firm, a staff attorney and rural communication liaison for the Arkan-sas Public Service Commission, and the program director for the Arkansas Transitional Employment Board. His experience and activism truly embody all that communities need in the fight against crime. I am proud of this leader and con-summate professional. He is devoted to law and order. He will be a great voice in reducing crime throughout central Arkansas. I congratulate my friend, Cody Hiland. ARKANSAS ADVOCATES FOR CHILDREN AND  
FAMILIES 40TH ANNIVERSARY  
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to con-gratulate Arkansas Advocates for Chil-dren and Families on the occasion of their 40th anniversary. AACF was established in 1977 by 10 Arkansans, including our former First Lady, Betty Bumpers, who were pas-sionate about the status of children in our State. Over the past four decades, AACF has helped families throughout Arkansas to ensure that they have the resources and opportunities to lead healthy and productive lives. Working to promote good public pol-icy that makes kids’ lives better, AACF played an integral role in the creation of ARKids First and the ex-pansion of quality pre-K for at-risk 3- and 4-year-olds. I would like to extend my congratu-lations to AACF and wish it much con-tinued success for generations to come. 
SPRINGFIELD -DES ARC BRIDGE DEDICATION  
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the joint efforts of the city of Conway, Faulkner County, the Faulkner County Historical Society, and Workin’ Bridges, a nonprofit orga-nization, that are collaborating to re-store a historic bridge in Faulkner County, Arkansas. The Springfield-Des Arc Bridge, an iron bowstring arc bridge, is the oldest bridge in Arkansas and one of the old-est of its type in the country. The bridge was placed on the National Reg-ister of Historic Places in 1988. This bridge was originally con-structed back in 1874 to facilitate trav-el between Faulkner and Conway Coun-ties in the Second Congressional Dis-trict. Over the years, the bridge faced con-tinued operational wear and tear, three major floods, and lost its flooring to a fire. The bridge was decommissioned when the road was rerouted to a new and better concrete bridge. Faulkner County Historical Society and the city of Conway worked to-gether to establish a restoration plan for the bridge and proposed to relocate it to Beaverfork Lake Park. The 146- foot structure was dismantled and transported to North Little Rock for cleaning and refinishing. The bridge now sits at Beaverfork Lake Park as a link between the swimming area and the fishing pier. Mr. Speaker, I thank all those who have worked so diligently over the years to preserve this historic bridge and give it a new use for a new genera-tion.

The National Park Service is also celebrating the birthday anniversary weekend with the 50th anniversary of the dedication of the Theodore Roo-sevelt Memorial on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac River across from Georgetown. That family-friendly program will be on October 29 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The event will include addresses at 2 p.m. by President Roosevelt’s great- grandson, Tweed Roosevelt, and other academics, who will talk about the amazing legacy of our 26th President, Theodore Roosevelt. I thank, also, the National Park Service for their outstanding work on Theodore Roosevelt Island, restoring the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial that is out on the island. It is one of the best places to visit when families come to Washington, D.C., on its very peace-ful and tranquil island location in the Potomac River. The National Park Service, on this restoration work, collaborated with the Friends of Theodore Roosevelt Is-land and the Theodore Roosevelt Asso-ciation.

The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was called to order by the Honorable L
U-
THER STRANGE , a Senator from the State of Alabama.

PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. O God, our King, we are grateful that righteousness and justice are the foun-dation of Your throne. Give our law-makers such a connection with You that they will hate evil. Let the light of Your wisdom shine upon them, pro-viding them with the joy of doing right. Save them from life’s pitfalls, providing them with the protection of the shield of Your favor. Lord, remind them of Your faithfulness so that they will trust the unfolding of Your loving providence. Help them to remember that You have sustained America throughout its history. Remembering how You have led us in the past, may our Senators feel confident that You will complete the work You have start-ed. We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The Presiding Officer led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please read a communication to the Senate from the President pro tempore (Mr. H
ATCH ). The bill clerk read the following let-ter: U.S. S ENATE , P
RESIDENT PRO TEMPORE , Washington, DC, October 26, 2017. To the Senate: Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby appoint the Honorable L
UTHER STRANGE , a Senator from the State of Alabama, to per-form the duties of the Chair. O
RRIN G. H ATCH , President pro tempore. 
Mr. STRANGE thereupon assumed the Chair as Acting President pro tem-pore. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The majority leader is recog-nized. 
f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate is continuing to move forward on President Trump’s outstanding judi-cial nominations. Many of the well- qualified men and women the President has nominated enjoy substantial bipar-tisan support. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats have decided to continue wasting the Senate’s time with the pointless ob-struction of these nominees. Time and again, they have erected partisan pro-cedural hurdles that are designed not to change the outcome—they don’t change the outcome—but simply to waste the Senate’s time. Often, Demo-crats do not even oppose the nominee in question. Let’s compare the number of times this days-long delay has been invoked for nominees of the last two Presidents during the first years of their Presi-dencies—during the first year of the Obama Presidency and the first year of the Trump Presidency. Republicans re-quired cloture on one of President Obama’s judicial nominees during his first year—cloture one time on a judi-cial nominee for President Obama in his first year. Democrats have invoked this delay for every single one of Presi-dent Trump’s judicial nominees, so far, except one. This week, they are at it again. Today, we will have a cloture vote on the nomination of Trevor McFadden to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Not a single Democrat on the Judiciary Committee registered an objection to the nomination; yet we still have to waste time in overcoming a procedural hurdle from our Demo-cratic colleagues before the Senate can take up the nomination and consider it. It came out of committee with no opposition. We are not going to let these mind-less attempts to slow progress stop us from confirming the President’s nomi-nees to the judiciary. If that means more cloture votes and more time fo-cused on this task, that is what we will do, but we will confirm these nominees. You can count on it. 
f 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, for families in Ken-tucky and across the Nation, the dev-astation of opioid abuse can be a con-stant and painful reality. Communities are forced to endure grief, worry, and loss. A recent report showed that my home State suffered more than 1,400 fa-talities as a result of drug overdoses last year alone. Despite the troubling statistics, how-ever, there are glimmers of hope. The Republican-led Senate has worked hard to pass important legislation like Jessie’s Law, the 21st Century Cures Act, and the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. These measures are important steps that should lead to real progress. There are many other important efforts across the country as well. From coast to coast, we hear sto-ries of men and women in recovery who are managing their addictions. We are heartened by these testimonies that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6826 October 26, 2017 
proper treatment offers real hope. They help remind everyone as to why we must continue to press forward. The task that remains is staggering, but we are committed. Later today, President Trump will help our country take another step for-ward. We expect that he will formally recognize the opioid epidemic for the public health emergency that it is. This announcement builds upon years of progress that Congress has made in responding to addiction with com-prehensive action, including preven-tion, enforcement, and treatment. I commend the President for his con-tinued commitment to this cause. When he visited us in the Senate ear-lier this week, he discussed the na-tional epidemic and his administra-tion’s efforts to fight back. Along with my colleagues, I stand ready to work with him on future proposals to pro-vide the necessary tools to protect our communities from this scourge. A single bill or program is never going to solve this crisis on its own. Only a sustained, committed effort can do that. I am proud of our efforts to combat opioid addiction already. I also know that we will continue to push for-ward with continued collaboration with many groups both in Washington and in States and communities all across our country so that, one day, we can finally say that our country has beaten this crisis once and for all. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Democratic leader is recog-nized. 
f 
HEALTHCARE Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-terday afternoon the nonpartisan Con-gressional Budget Office came out with a score for the bipartisan Alexander- Murray bill. The CBO report confirms that the Alexander-Murray bill is a great deal for the American people. It does precisely what it was intended to do. It stabilizes the marketplaces, helps to prevent premiums from sky-rocketing, and reduces the deficit, by CBO’s estimate, nearly $4 billion. As Senators A
LEXANDER and M URRAY  noted, the report shows that their bill ‘‘will benefit taxpayers and low-income Americans, not insurance companies.’’ Even the Wall Street Journal edi-torial board—no liberal cabal, that is for sure—said today: ‘‘The bipartisan compromise proposal crafted by Sens. LAMAR ALEXANDER (R-Tenn.) and P
ATTY MURRAY (D-Wash.) now offi-cially falls into the category of ‘so ob-vious it should pass immediately.’’’ That is not C
HUCK SCHUMER talking. That is not even M

ITCH MCCONNELL ’s fidelity. It is the beacon of the hard right, the Wall Street Journal editorial page. They say, again: Alexander-Murray ‘‘falls into the category of ‘so obvious it should pass immediately.’’’ So, my fellow Republicans, what are you waiting for? Everyone on your side wants the bill. Jump on it. Support it. Let’s get this done, and let’s help sta-bilize our markets, whatever our views are on healthcare. Above all, these reports should be all the evidence that President Trump needs to come off the sidelines and en-dorse the bill. It doesn’t bail out the insurance companies; that is what he said he was worried about. It doesn’t cost the government money, and, in fact, it reduces the deficit by $4 billion. So there is no good reason for Presi-dent Trump to continue to obscure his position. Leader M
CCONNELL has said he will put it on the floor if the President says he will sign it. By delaying, the Presi-dent is harming healthcare markets, causing significant uncertainty, and doing nothing but hurting Americans who are trying to afford healthcare. So, Mr. President—President Trump, not my dear friend, the Acting Presi-dent pro tempore, the Senator from Alabama—President Trump, if you don’t pursue this bill, the consequences will fall on your back. Make no mis-take about it.

THE BUDGET Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on taxes, later today, the House will like-ly vote on whether to pass the budget resolution that recently passed the Senate. My colleagues in the House should be aware that this budget will explode the deficit by $1.5 trillion. That is under the best of circumstances. That is under circumstances where they find $4 trillion of pay-fors. That is probably unlikely. It will slash Medi-care and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion, and it will set up the same awful partisan process that caused the Republican ef-fort on repeal and replace to fail, be-cause when you try to do it with one party, it is fraught with peril. If you do it in a bipartisan way, a few people on either side will try to pull the bill off course but they will not succeed be-cause they don’t have the votes. I remind my friends in the House who purport to be deficit hawks: You are voting for a budget that will increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Many of these House Members, particularly in the conservative wing of the caucus, particularly those in the Freedom Cau-cus, have spent their entire careers on the barricades, railing against the evils of deficits. What a stunning hypocrisy it would be to abandon those principles today and vote for this budget simply because it gives tax cuts to the wealthiest of Americans and the most powerful, largest of our corporations. Now I would also remind my Repub-lican friends in the House—particularly those in New York, New Jersey, Cali-fornia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Illinois, Washington, and Minnesota—that vot-ing for the budget today is tantamount to voting for the elimination of the State and local tax deduction, and that would sock it to the middle-class tax-payers in their States and districts. To most of our Republican friends from those States, they are blue States, but there are red districts that are subur-ban, well-off. They will get clobbered if they take away the State and local de-duction. Those are the constituents hurt the most—not the rich and not the poor—the middle class and the upper middle class. Not only will it raise their taxes dramatically, but most people would lose deductions be-tween $10,000 and $20,000. That ain’t chickenfeed. It would lower home prices. A recent study by the National Association of Realtors done by Pricewaterhouse Coo-pers, the esteemed accounting firm, showed that eliminating State and local would erode property values, the rock of the middle class, by 10 percent. To middle-class folks in New York and, I believe, around the country, their home is their piece of the rock. They struggle each month, paying the mort-gage, paying the taxes, paying for the upkeep, but they are hoping that by the time they reach later middle age they will own that home, and that gives their kids a place or gives their kids a nest egg when they pass it on. But this bill, by eliminating State and local, reduces across America, on aver-age, home values by 10 percent. So it is a double whammy to the middle class, raising their taxes and lowering their home values. Why would we do that? You don’t have to take it from me. I will tell this to my Republican col-leagues. P
ETER KINGis a hard, rock- ribbed Republican who has a lot of courage and who this morning was on TV talking about investigating Hillary Clinton, but here is what he said about repealing the State and local deduc-tion. He said that it ‘‘will devastate my district forever.’’ That is a solid mid-dle-class and upper middle-class Repub-lican district on Long Island. Here is what else P
ETER KINGsaid: ‘‘How anybody from New York and New Jersey can vote for this budget without knowing what is in the tax bill is be-yond me.’’ He was referring to the State and local tax deductions. I salute P

a decision to make. Will they protect the middle class and tens of thousands of homeowners in their districts or go along with the hard-right agenda that will cost their constituents hard- earned money for groceries, home re-pairs, and other needs, and do that all so that the very wealthy can get a huge tax break and all so that the biggest corporations which are flush with money can have even more money— wrong. I hear on the other side that we are talking about a tax bill for the middle class. To eliminate State and local de-ductibility hurts the majority of mid-dle-class people in this country. That is what will happen if they keep that in there. Now, some will say, in the House— and I have heard one of my colleagues from New York, a Republican: Oh, that S
CHUMER is a Democrat; he is beating up on Republicans. But I went through this in 1986, the last time we had tax reform. It was the Democrats who were pushing the bill—Senator Bradley, a legend in this Chamber, and Leader Gephardt, one of the Democratic lead-ers in the House. Despite their en-treaties, I told them not only would I not vote for any reform bill that had State and local deductibility in it, but I would lead the charge and round up others, and I did. I got a lot of flak from my fellow Democrats, but it was the right thing to do for my middle- class constituency in southern Brook-lyn. So when I ask our Republican col-leagues to buck their leadership to help their middle-class constituents, it is something I did with the Democratic leadership the last time tax reform was on the floor. Some are already rationalizing their vote to approve the budget by putting their hopes in the vague possibility of some kind of compromise on State and local deductibility. The harsh fact is, there is no good compromise to be had on State and local. If you want to make taxpayers choose between the mortgage deduction and the State and local, it is like asking taxpayers to de-cide whether they want to cut off their right arm or their left arm. Some are talking about a cap. Well, where are you going to cap it? More than 50 per-cent of the total value of the deduction goes to taxpayers with incomes below $200,000. Cap it too low, and almost all those middle-class taxpayers get whacked. Cap it too high, and it doesn’t raise enough money to offset all the cuts my Republican friends want to give the corporations and the top 1 percent. Republicans in the House shouldn’t stake the votes on the pros-pect of a good compromise on State and local because there is not one to be had. The bottom line is, any Republican plan that limits SALT is the equiva-lent of robbing middle-class families of tax benefits and handing it over to the wealthiest Americans and biggest cor-porations. There is no—no—compelling reason to do it. People aren’t clam-oring for it. We don’t need to take a trillion dollars from working families and give it to millionaire CEOs, period. If that weren’t enough reason to vote no, the Republican leadership is still debating capping pretax contributions to 401(k) plans. Do you hear that, retir-ees and potential retirees? In their craving thirst to give the wealthiest people in America a tax break, they are going to say: You can’t save money for retirement tax-free. What a gut punch to the middle class that would be. De-spite the President’s claims to the con-trary, Representative BRADY and Sen-ator P
ORTMAN have said that a 401(k) cap is still on the table. So do you know what this bill has be-come? Again, in its desperation to help the wealthiest, it is like a quiz show. Which way do we hurt the middle class to pay for it? Door one is State and local deductibility. Door two is cap re-tirement. Who knows what they will pick in door three? It could be the mortgage deduction. Asking middle- class people to choose which poison to take so they can help the wealthiest makes no sense. I would urge my colleagues in the House and here in the Senate: Stop doing this partisan bill that was dic-tated by the hard right, very wealthy individuals, very rich corporations, huge corporations. Work with us. We want to create a bipartisan bill that helps the middle class. We are for tax reform, and we can get something done. Please stop this train in its tracks early on before it is too late and you will regret it. There are large numbers of Democrats, including this minority leader, who want to sit down with Re-publicans and come up with a deficit- neutral, middle-class, small business- oriented, bipartisan tax relief bill, not a plan to benefit the richest 1 percent or the largest and most powerful cor-porations that are already flush with cash. We want to work with our Repub-lican colleagues on a real bipartisan deal. Defeat this budget, and we will. I yield the floor.

Palk, of Oklahoma, to be United States District Judge for the Western District of Oklahoma. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from West Virginia. TAX REFORM  
Ms. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise to again highlight the importance of en-acting tax reform. I listened to the Democratic leader’s speech. I have heard that speech a thousand times—a thousand times how only wealthy Americans are going to benefit from anything the Republicans can come up with. Well, do you know what? Ameri-cans are smarter than that. Americans are smarter than that. I represent a State, West Virginians who have struggling economic situa-tions. If I were to go out on the street in West Virginia, and as I talked to in-dividuals there, and asked them: Would you like more of your hard-earned money at the end of the day and have a tax cut and tax relief, I can guar-antee you 100 percent would say: Heck, yeah. I can spend my money better at home with my priorities than what you are doing in Washington, DC. So let’s not let that argument rule the day. As I said, we are smarter than that. Let’s talk about what this bill does. This is now my fourth, actually, in a series of something I believe in, which is tax reform for everybody in this country. My first speech described the benefits we will have in economic growth. Something that was not mentioned by the previous speaker is how we have been stagnated for so long. The eco-nomic growth will rise all boats. Every middle-class worker will benefit from this, and every small business will ben-efit from this. My second speech was about small businesses. Ninety-five percent of my State is small business. Last week, I highlighted the impor-tance of passing the budget resolution to allow Congress to move forward, and we did that. Today, I want to talk about the im-portance of tax reform for middle-class families and the impacts this bill will have on them, the very real impact. You know what, raising a family is very expensive today. A recent study from the Department of Agriculture found that middle-income households will spend over $230,000 raising a child. It is staggering—staggering. The Federal Reserve found that al-most half of American families are struggling right now to come up with $400 if they have an emergency ex-pense. In West Virginia, where the me-dian income is $41,000—hardly the wealthy—families are forced to make hard tradeoffs as they balance their checkbooks each month. Expenses are going up. Yet most Americans haven’t received a raise in years. So we need to help working fam-ilies, especially those living paycheck to paycheck, and this is one of the pri-mary goals of our tax reform. We want middle-class, middle-earned-income

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6828 October 26, 2017 
folks, hard-working folks to get more in their pocket to decide what they want to do with their money. I raised three children. I know just putting shoes on your children is an expensive proposition. Maybe you want to plan for a trip or save for college. Well, to pay for childcare and to save for col-lege at the same time is almost impos-sible for our young families today. The framework we have set forward, I think, will help our families in many ways. First, it calls for a significant in-crease in the child tax credit. Yester-day, a number of my colleagues from the House and the Senate, joined with Ivanka Trump to highlight what an im-proved child tax credit would mean for working families. The tax reform pro-posal would allow families to take a higher per child credit, saving money on their taxes—money they have earned, money the families deserve to spend on their own, and money that could have significant impact to our families. We will also create a $500 tax credit for families who are caring for a nonchild dependent. Many Americans find themselves in the sandwich gen-eration, where they are not only caring for their children, they are caring for their parents at the same time. This will help those families. Second, the proposal nearly doubles the standard deduction or the zero tax bracket. It raises it up to $24,000 for married taxpayers and up to $12,000 for single taxpayers. What kind of impact would this have on a State like mine? Well, 83 percent of the taxpayers in West Virginia take the standard deduction. They are going to get a doubling in their standard de-duction. That is more money for them to take home, to put the value of where they want to spend it with their own families. So four out of five West Vir-ginia working families will benefit from that. That is an enormous sav-ings, and even more taxpayers are like-ly to benefit, as the larger standard de-duction means fewer people will itemize. We expect that figure to go up—from 83 percent up. It makes filing taxes simpler, and it makes it so our taxpayers can file on a single form without all of the extra forms, time, and money it takes. Finally, and most importantly, fami-lies will benefit from the economic growth that tax reform will bring to our country. This is probably the big-gest impact that tax reform will have for working families. We will lower the corporate rate, yes, for companies, but we have to make our companies com-petitive across the globe. We are not. We are not competing. What kind of ef-fect does that have? Fewer jobs and lower wages. Companies know that if they invest in their workforce, if they invest in the wages of their workforce, they are going to have a more produc-tive workforce to produce products, to sell products, to enhance the quality of life of their communities. Many of these large corporations that are scattered around our country really do a lot of work in the commu-nity service parts of our country, whether it is helping with schools or whether it is helping with the baseball teams or sponsoring a robotics team. Why does that matter to working fami-lies? More than $2 trillion in profits earned by American companies is kept offshore because of the flaws in our current tax system—$2 trillion—and I think some of those estimates might be low. Shifting to a more fair and com-petitive system will bring those dollars back to the United States. Those com-panies want to invest in our country because they know we have the safest investments, we have the most techno-logically advanced and we have the best workforce, and this is great news for American families. The White House Council of Eco-nomic Advisers estimates that low-ering that tax rate—that corporate tax rate—from 35 to 20 could increase the pay for the average American by about $4,000. At my small business round-table, when I asked, what would you do with tax relief, the first thing she said was ‘‘raise the wages of my seven em-ployees.’’ So I think that this would be good news for working families, certainly good news for 50 percent of the West Virginia workers who work in small business. We need to make sure we work together, that we target our tax relief to middle-class families. I say to the Acting President pro tempore, you and I were at lunch the other day with the President. Priority No. 1, the President said that this tax cut must be targeted to the middle class, the working families in this country. That is what this bill has put forward: larger tax credit, larger stand-ard deduction, unlocking the wages by lowering the competitive tax rate. De-spite our hard work, too many middle- class families are falling behind, and we want to make sure that trend stops. So all of us, I think, can join to-gether. This is going to go through committee. Both parties will have lots of opportunity to weigh in, and I look forward to looking into the eyes of the working men and women in my State and saying: Not only is help on the way, but help is here. Thank you so much. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I think it is going to be a very robust conversation about taxes. When we look into the eyes of working Ameri-cans, I hope my Republican colleagues are ready to answer this question, and that is, Why do they, the Republican Party, want to send $3.5 trillion of tax benefits to the top 1 percent? Why not spend the tax benefits on the middle class? Well, my colleagues keep coming to the floor and saying this is all about the middle class, but they don’t men-tion that, in fact, every single major change is all about benefits for the richest 1 percent. Changing the dynasty tax to create a dynasty loophole, wow, that really doesn’t benefit anybody in the working class. Lowering the top bracket while raising the bottom bracket, well, that doesn’t help anybody in the working class. Providing a special passthrough for those who can put their business activities into limited liability cor-porations and have a special low rate, well, that certainly doesn’t help any-body in the middle class. One provision after another, after an-other is targeted at the richest Ameri-cans, while coming and preaching help for the middle class. Oh, the American people will see right through this scheme. They are going to ask: Why is it you do so little for those at the bot-tom? In fact, you do nothing for those in the bottom third. Why is it you do so little for those in the middle class? In fact, many of them will see a tax in-crease. Why do you send the vast bulk of the benefits to the richest Ameri-cans when the richest Americans are already so much richer than anyone else? The debate we are going to have is important. For my colleagues who think they can fool the American peo-ple by talking about the middle class and instead are targeting the richest to be richer, I have news: It is not going to work. 
CLIMATE DISRUPTION  
Now, Mr. President, I will turn to a different topic. Climate disruption is a seminal challenge of our generation. It affects everything from our forests to fisheries and farming. Rural America is the core target of the impacts of the changing climate, and we see the im-pacts worldwide. We see it in dis-appearing ice sheets and melting per-mafrost and the reduced number of gla-ciers around the world and dying coral reefs. We see it in migrating animals and insects. We certainly see it in the more powerful hurricanes hitting the United States in Texas and Puerto Rico and Florida. In response, communities around the world are transforming their energy economies. They are increasing the ef-ficiencies of their buildings, their vehi-cles, and their appliances. They are working to replace carbon-polluting fossil fuel energy with clean and renew-able energy. Well, how much do you know about the changes underway? Let’s find out. Welcome to episode 6 of the ‘‘Senate Climate Disruption Quiz.’’ Here we go. First question: In December of 2016, vehicle emissions and coal production in the United States of America were each at record lows since what year? Were they at record lows since 1970, 1974, 1980, or 1986? Lock in your an-swers. The answer is not 1970 or 1974 or 1980; the answer is 1986. We are now working on over three decades, despite a vast increase in the vehicle miles traveled. We have reduced the emissions, and we certainly reduced the emissions in coal production. We are experiencing quite

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6829 October 26, 2017 
a change. We see the transition through clean and renewable energy ir-revocably underway. Let’s go to the second question. How many Republican Representatives— Members of the House—asserted that climate change has the potential to ad-versely impact all Americans? How many Republican Members of the House? Was it 13 or 17 or 20 or 22? Ad-mittedly, it is a modest number. The number was 17. The answer is B. These 17 Republican lawmakers intro-duced a resolution warning that ‘‘if left unaddressed, the consequences of a changing climate have the potential to adversely impact all Americans.’’ So this is a very big deal, that 17 Repub-licans in the party financed by the coal and oil billionaires, who have really taken complete control of the U.S. Senate, stood up to them and said: We are going to speak on behalf of our re-sponsibility, as citizens of the United States of America, to protect our citi-zens from the assault on our farming and our forestry and our fishing from climate disruption. I praise those 17 for having done so. It is a powerful, bipar-tisan step in the right direction of championing the cause of all Ameri-cans—and for that matter, the entire planet. Question No. 3: In July of this year, California extended its cap-and-trade program to which year? Did it extend it for just a couple of years to 2020 or to the year 2025, 2030, or 2035? How long did California lay this vision into the future? Lock in your answers. The answer is 2030. The program would have otherwise expired in 2020, so they extended it another decade. It was basically a statement of con-fidence that the program that they laid out, that they have in place now, is working and deserves extension. It is the only program of its kind in the country, and it is the second largest in the world. Under this vision, this new and ex-panded program, California will cut its emissions of carbon dioxide 40 percent from its 1990 levels, despite having a vastly expanded economy. That is a powerful vision and a vision we need to extend through completely eliminating the burning of fossil fuels in the next three decades. Question No. 4: How many acres of our citizen-owned—that is, our Fed-eral—fossil fuels were leased to indus-try as of October 2016? Had we leased out 30 million acres of Federal land for the extraction of fossil fuels or 45 mil-lion or 53 million or 67 million? Any of these is really a vast amount of what we own as citizens. Lock in your an-swers. The answer is at the top end of the spectrum—67 million acres. What this means is that for years and even dec-ades into the future, we have already contracted for a vast amount of fossil fuels to be extracted from our citizen- owned lands. These extractions add to the problem facing rural America and the impact on our farmers and our fish-ermen and our forests. That area which has been leased out for the extraction of fossil fuels, which, as citizens, you and I own, is the size of Colorado—a vast sea of fossil fuel extraction leases on public lands. It shows the dire need to pass the Keep It in the Ground Act. The only responsible thing for us to do is to not do any more leases of our citizen-owned oil or coal or gas. The re-sponsible thing to do, the right thing to do, especially as we work in partner-ship with the world, is to say no new leases that expand this 67 million acre number. Now let’s turn to Question No. 5. Which U.S. community was the first to make a decision to divest all of its oil and gas stocks because of the impact of oil and gas on destroying our Nation? Was it Cooperstown, NY; Salem, OR; Lawrence, KS; or Walla Walla, WA? Lock in your answers. The answer is Cooperstown, NY. There is quite an interesting story be-hind this, a remarkable story. At the center of the story is a man named Louis Allstadt. Mr. Allstadt is a retired ExxonMobil executive. At one point, he managed all of Mobil Oil’s exploration in the United States, Canada, and Latin America, so he knew the oil in-dustry, the fossil fuel industry, inside- out from the very top level. After retiring, he ran for town trust-ee in Cooperstown. As a town trustee, he then spearheaded an effort for Coop-erstown to become the first town in the United States to divest its oil and gas stocks. Mr. Allstadt summed it up this way: ‘‘You don’t just keep driving your car when you see a cliff ahead.’’ Well said. Yet so many in this Chamber are determined to drive the car over the cliff. From the high reaches of the execu-tive suites of Exxon Mobil, Mr. Allstadt could see the damage being done to the planet by the continued burning of fossil fuels. He saw the abso-lute need to stop, and he took a prin-cipled, moral stand on behalf of us all. Thank you, Mr. Allstadt, for doing that and setting that example. It is one we should all pay attention to. Every city council and every mayor across the country should ask the question: Should we follow Mr. Allstadt’s exam-ple, the example of Cooperstown, NY? Because if we continue in the direction we are going, we will do fabulous amounts of damage from which we will not easily recover—if we can recover at all. So there you have it, folks—episode 6 of the ‘‘Senate Climate Disruption Quiz.’’ These questions were ripped from the headlines. Facts on the ground are changing fast as climate disruption increases and communities across the globe respond. We are racing the clock, and we have no time to spare. So stay engaged in the fight. In the near future, I will bring you episode 7 of the ‘‘Senate Climate Dis-ruption Quiz.’’ Thank you, Mr. President. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Florida. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. 
TAX REFORM  
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, over the next few weeks, the Senate, the House, Congress—everybody here in Wash-ington is going to be engaged in what I think is one of the most important and potentially impactful debates we have had here in a long time. For a place that has been so criticized for not doing anything, we have a chance to actually do something that is going to matter and help real people and help the country. It is called tax reform. I think the great thing about a tax reform debate is that it actually goes to the heart and soul of our identity as a nation and who we want to be and who we have been up to this point. We are a nation that has embraced free enterprise. There are people who don’t believe in free enterprise. There are people who believe in different variations of free enterprise. By and large, America has believed in free en-terprise. That basically means the gov-ernment doesn’t try to control too much of the economy. People have pri-vate property and private businesses. You have rules to make sure people don’t cheat and steal from one another or hurt people, but by and large, we be-lieve in a private economy. Why do we believe that? I think the answer to that is not just a purely economic one; you look back at our founding. One of the unique things about this country that we have taken for granted and do not do a good enough job of teaching young Americans is that America was not created as a nation to bring together a common race or a common ethnicity or a common reli-gion. There are a lot of nations around the world—in fact, I would argue that most of the nations that have ever ex-isted have been a homeland for the peo-ple who were born and have lived in that one place—not us. We were found-ed on the idea that you could bring dif-ferent kinds of people from different backgrounds and unite them as one people, despite their differences in background and ethnicity and religion. You could unite them behind a very powerful idea—the idea that all of us are created equal because we were born with a God-given right to life and to liberty and to pursue happiness. That is not just a revolutionary idea; it has changed the world. It has been the identity of our country. It is among everything else that makes us unique and special. In every genera-tion, it has been challenged economi-cally, socially, and culturally. We need to continue to fight for that. One of the core principles behind equal opportunity is the ability to ful-fill your economic potential—to grow up and be who you want to be, do what you want to do, open a company or work for a certain industry or career or

stay home and raise children. Whatever your choice is, they are all legitimate. We are a nation that believes we all have the God-given right to pursue that, and that is something which free enterprise makes possible. The difference between free enter-prise and people who want government to control everything is—the best anal-ogy I can think of is, imagine a pie. Let’s use a pie as an example. I can’t bring one on the floor to graphically detail it, but imagine one in your mind. Imagine if I said to you: This pie will never grow. It will always be the same size. Every single one of us gets a slice. Well, if the pie can’t grow and every-one gets a slice, then the bigger your slice, the smaller my slice. That is what people who don’t believe in free enterprise argue. They argue that the pie really can’t grow, and so you need government to make sure that pie is sliced equally or equal enough among everybody. The Tax Code is one of the ways they do it. There is another argument. It is the one I believe in. It is the one that I think has made this country the most prosperous in human history. It is the argument that that pie doesn’t have to stay that size. We can make it a pie that is a lot bigger and make sure it keeps growing. Therefore, it doesn’t matter how big the other person’s slice is, as long as your slice is big too. More for them doesn’t mean less for you. That is one of the unique attributes of free enterprise: Everyone can be better off without anyone being left worse off. That is the theory, but it doesn’t al-ways work in practice for a lot of dif-ferent reasons. That doesn’t mean an-archy. We do need government. I am not anti-regulation; I am anti-over-regulation. I fly on airplanes. Everybody here flies on a lot of airplanes. I am sure we are all glad that airplane is inspected and the person who is flying it is really a pilot and not just someone who stayed at Holiday Inn Express. I think all of us want to make sure that when you open a bottle of medi-cine prescribed to you, what is in that bottle is actually the medicine and not something fake or something different. When we eat food, we want to make sure it is not poisonous or going to spread disease. These are all products of regulation. The same is true in economics. That is why we have antitrust laws. That is why we take on anti-competitiveness, because it actually undermines free en-terprise. I am not talking about corporatism, because there are a lot of countries around the world that claim to be free enterprise, but they really aren’t. Four or five big companies con-trol everything, and everybody else ei-ther works for them or is unemployed. That is not what I am talking about. I am talking about free enterprise—a nation and a system in which someone can quit their job, open a business, compete with their former employer, and put them out of business—or at least take away some of their cus-tomers—because you are better than they are. That is free enterprise. That is what we believe in, and the Tax Code is a part of it. What has challenged free enterprise in this country in the 21st century and you sense it in people’s frustrations? There are two things. The first is there is a lot of overcom-petition. It wasn’t true in the sixties and seventies. We forget Germany and Japan. These countries were wiped out completely during World War II. It took them decades to rebuild. America was the only show in town for much of the fifties, sixties, up into the seven-ties. But all of these other countries watched us grow, and they started doing the things we did. They started deregulating, and they most certainly started cutting taxes. The result has been that over the last 20 or 25 years, most countries in the in-dustrialized world, the big economies, charge companies a lot less in taxes than we do. What that does over time is make us uncompetitive. That is why not a day goes by that you don’t read about some American company that was bought by a company in another country and moved over there. Do you know why? Because they pay less in taxes over there than they do here. Anyone who doesn’t realize that is missing a big part of it. We are not the only show in town anymore. We have to compete, and that is why our Tax Code is important. If it becomes uncompetitive, you are basically forcing and/or inviting com-panies to leave the United States for a more favorable tax treatment—and that has happened. Do you know who has paid the price? Not the rich people. If you are a wealthy investor, you can invest your money anywhere in the world. Even if you make your money here, I promise you, you have the best lawyers and the best accountants to find every creative loophole to save money. And if that loophole doesn’t exist, you will hire the best lobbyist to make one. In the end, the truly wealthy—the billionaires, the owners with these ex-traordinary amounts of wealth—they will figure it out. Do you know who gets hurt? The people who get paid every 2 weeks. That is who gets hurt because when those companies leave the United States, they take their jobs with them. The fewer of those there are and the more people we have com-peting for fewer jobs, the less people get paid at a time when everything costs more. There is another thing that is hurt-ing us, and it is not part of the tax re-form, but it is the way growth is now distributed. We can no longer just as-sume that if the economy grows, every-one will be better off automatically, because the truth is, in the 21st cen-tury, there are some careers, some in-dustries, and some jobs that pay sub-stantially more. Do you want to talk about the haves and have-nots in the 21st century? The haves and the have-nots are the people who have advanced education and the right skills and the people who do not. We have to close that gap. Vocational training—that is a separate topic that has to be dealt with and is critically important in the way growth is distrib-uted. But you have no growth to dis-tribute if you don’t have growth. So that is why this is so important. When you hear all this talk about wealthy corporations getting huge tax breaks, it is not necessarily true. It is really, really important for people to pay attention to the details and not just the talking points on this. For example, let’s say company X is a publicly traded company, so they sell stock on Wall Street and the like. Next year, because we lower taxes, that company makes $1 million more than they did this year. What can they do with that million dollars for a publicly traded company? There are really only four things they can do with that money, and all four of them help work-ing Americans. The first thing they can do is grow the business. They can say: We like our business a lot. We now have a million dollars more than we thought we were going to have, but we believe so much in our future that we are going to take that million dollars and we are going to invest it to grow the company. We are going to open a new factory. We are going to open more stores and hire more people as a result. We are going to invest in more equipment, which means the people who make that equip-ment have more work. That is the first thing you can do with the money you might save on taxes. The second thing you might have to do—maybe you don’t grow your busi-ness, but with that million dollars extra that you have from the tax cuts, you are going to have to pay your em-ployees more because, if not, they are going to quit and go to work for some-body else. So all of a sudden, you are now in a position to be able to hire good people and retain them by paying them more and by offering better bene-fits to keep them. That is the second thing you can do with the money. The third thing you can do with the million dollars from the tax cut that you didn’t plan on having is lower prices. You can say: I am in competi-tion with these five other businesses to sell the same thing. We are going to use our million dollars to lower our prices just a little bit, just enough so that people buy it from us instead of them. Do you know what that other company is going to have to do? They are going to have to lower prices, too, to compete with you. Do you know who benefits from the lowering of prices? The middle class. The people who are going to shop are going to be paying less because of the competition. That is the third thing that can happen. The fourth thing that can happen and the one that gets the most criticism is,

well, they will just pay it to the share-holders in dividends. OK. Who are the shareholders? The shareholders are wealthy people who trade in Wall Street and spend all day in front of a computer and have these brokerage ac-counts and people who handle their ac-counts. They are a part of it. You know who else are shareholders? Millions and millions of Americans. If you are a firefighter or a police officer with a union pension, you are a share-holder. You might not be aware of the companies you have shares in, but it is in your pension, and the future of your pension will depend on how those in-vestments go. If you are a 401(k) hold-er, you are a shareholder. Just because you are not in front of the computer every day, checking your TD Ameritrade account to see how much money you have in X stock and Y stock does not mean you are not a share-holder. You are a shareholder. Virtually every sort of investment mechanism for retirement in America is invested in what is called equities, is invested in the market, is invested in stocks and bonds. If, in fact, those things are doing better, it is helping you retire. That is why the business side of this is so important. It will help grow the economy, but it actually will also help people because there is nowhere else for that money to go. The other type of small business, which is actually the majority, has been called a passthrough, and that is what most businesses are organized as. That is where you pay on your personal rate. If you are a small business owner with three employees, you are an S corporation, and at the end of the year, you pay your taxes on your personal rate. Your rate is actually higher than the companies, the corporations, ex-cept you can’t hire the lawyers and the accountants and all the other exper-tise. You are actually, in many cases, paying more than the big companies. These small businesses need to be helped, too, and they would be with tax reform that lowers their rate and makes them competitive. Beyond ensuring that people are ei-ther going to have better retirement funds, lower prices, more pay, more jobs, and we are helping small busi-nesses, the vast majority of which are owned by people who are not multi-millionaires and billionaires, the other thing we can do to help working-class people in this country is an expansion of the child tax credit. It is an idea that Senator L
EEand I have been push-ing for the better part of 2 years. It wasn’t always universally popular, but I am going to explain three reasons why it is important. In fact, not only is it important, but it has to happen. If we don’t do this, then someone could argue that this is not a middle-class tax cut. If we do it, it will be, perhaps, the single largest middle-class tax cut in modern history. The child tax credit is a credit you get per child. Obviously, it phases out at some point—the more money you make. Why do we have it? We have it for two reasons: No. 1, we truly believe that the family is the most important institution in society and parenting is the most important job you will ever have. I don’t care who you are. If you are the President, if you are a Senator, if you are a Congressman—I don’t care what you do—the most important job you will ever have, the most influence you will ever have, the most impactful thing you will ever do is to raise a fam-ily, so our Tax Code accounts for that. It should. The second thing is that raising chil-dren is expensive. If you are raising children right now or have at any time in the near past, you know how expen-sive it is. I don’t know where they get these numbers, but they sound right to me. The Department of Agriculture es-timates that to raise children from the time they are born to the time they are 18 is about $235,000 per child. That is a staggering amount of money. That doesn’t even account for college, by the way. All you have to do is spend just 10 minutes; just go out one day this week-end and talk to the people you know who are working parents, and ask them. They are going to tell you one of the most expensive things they face, especially between the time their chil-dren are born and the time they turn 4 or 5, is childcare. In over two-thirds of the States in this country, this costs more than it does to go to college. Imagine that you make $800 a week that you take home, but you have to spend $400 a week on childcare for your two kids. That is half your paycheck. I am not saying a child tax credit fixes all of that. I am saying that is a cost that keeps going up. It is a reason why the tax credit has lost about $300 in value from the time it was last ex-panded in 2003. The other thing to add to it is, if you look at some of the changes being pro-posed on the personal deduction, that is another $500 off. In essence, at $800 per child, we are just breaking even. That is why we have to have a child tax credit that is at least $2,000 to real-ly have an impact. The other thing we have to do is make it refundable. What that means is it has to apply against payroll tax. Medicare, Social Security taxes—that comes from FICA; it comes imme-diately off your paycheck. Everybody pays that tax. Not everybody pays income tax. If you don’t make more than a certain amount of money, you don’t have an income tax liability, but you are pay-ing taxes. It is called the payroll tax. If we don’t deal with that, if we don’t make the child tax credit apply to that, then we are basically not cutting taxes or not helping the vast majority of people who need it. There has been some speculation that this would be too expensive and cost a lot of money. It is not true. No. 2, it is their money. You don’t get it unless you owe it, and you don’t owe it unless you are working. All we are saying is let people keep more of their money to pay for their cost of liv-ing. By the way, they are going to have to spend that money. We know that a large number of families in this coun-try are living beyond what they make. That is why credit card debt has risen over the last 20 years. They are going to take that money, and they are going to spend it. They are going to spend a lot of it on raising their children. They are going to spend a lot of it on the things that we talked about. I am not saying this alone will change it, but, hopefully, the child tax credit, combined with a growing econ-omy in which there are more jobs that pay more and prices are lower, is going to truly help people, and we have to help people in that regard. So this has to be a critical component of tax re-form. I wanted to set the stage for that, be-cause, unfortunately, it is a com-plicated thing. Unfortunately, taxes are very complicated, more than they really should be. There is going to be a lot of misin-formation out there about who this ac-tually helps and how the economy ac-tually works. So it is really important for us to be clear and upfront about why it is that we are doing the things we are doing. When I hear all this talk about help-ing millionaires and billionaires—they are probably the people who care the least about some of the tax reforms. They are going to be finding their way; they just want to know what the rules are. They just want to know what the rules are because they are going to fig-ure it out one way or the other. If their taxes are too high, they will take their money to another country. If they are low enough, they might invest it here. Either way, they are going to be fine. The people we really want to help are working people and small businesses, and the Tax Code is a part of that. It is not the only part of that, but it is a big part of it. That is why this has to hap-pen. It has to happen. It has been far too long. I want to take a step back and say that 50 years from now, when people read about this time in American his-tory, they are going to ask themselves: What was wrong with those people? Did they not realize that all these other countries were taking their jobs, and one of the ways those jobs were leaving is that they were giving them away. They were literally inviting people to leave by acting so arrogant about themselves that they thought they could charge them anything they want-ed in taxes, and they would stay. That is just not true anymore. I am not sure it ever was entirely true, but it is less true today than it ever was before. In the end, the people who are really being hurt by this are the people whose jobs don’t pay enough at a time when everything costs more. The people who are really being hurt by this are the people who wish they

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6832 October 26, 2017 
could start their own business, but they can’t because they don’t think they can make enough money to sur-vive. The people who are really being hurt by this are parents who are trying to raise their children at a time when ev-erything costs more, but their pay-checks aren’t keeping pace. The people who are really being hurt by this are the people who sit down every month, and they write down on a piece of paper: This is our budget for the month. And about 14 or 15 days into the month, something comes in the mail that they didn’t expect was on its way, and all of a sudden, that whole budget gets blown out, and now they have to use a credit card to pay for it. The people who are being hurt by this are the people whose kids are now 17 years old, and they say: I want them to go to college, but I have no idea whether they are going to be able to go. Even with financial aid, they are going to have to borrow money to go to school, and now they are in debt. Be-fore they even vote in their first elec-tion, they already owe $10,000. We have to help them if we are going to rebuild the country’s economy, and tax reform is a key part of it. Here is my last point. There has been a lot of talk about debt—that this is going to grow the debt. That actually doesn’t have to be true. If you lower the tax rate and businesses are hiring more people, creating more jobs, and growing, that is going to grow your economy. When you grow your econ-omy, you have more taxpayers. When you have more taxpayers, you have more revenue. Even though you didn’t raise the rate, you will still collect more money because even though you don’t have more taxes, you have more taxpayers. That is a big chunk of this. Just a normal, not unrealistic growth rate would more than pay for the money that people are saying we are not going to collect as a result of this. That is part one of it. The other thing that is interesting to me is if we stood here today and said ‘‘Let’s take $1.7 trillion and spend it to build stuff that the government does,’’ there would be no problem with that. That would be seen as stimulus. That is positive. That is good debt spending. But, somehow, if we say ‘‘Let’s take money and give it back to people so they can spend it themselves,’’ that is bad debt. That is ridiculous. The third thing I would say is that you are never going to tax your way out of debt anyway. Even if we tax ev-eryone in America next year—if, for ev-eryone in America who made $1 million next year, we confiscated every penny of it and said ‘‘Your tax rate this year is 100 percent,’’ it would not even make a dent on the debt. That is how big the debt is and how fast it is growing. So you can’t tax your way out of this, and you can’t just cut your way out of it, either, by the way. So the only solu-tion to our debt long term is that you have to do two separate things, and you have to do them both. No. 1, you have to grow your econ-omy. You have to. That pie has to grow. No. 2, the debt has to be held back so it doesn’t grow as big as the economy. If you grow the economy by 4 percent and you grow the debt by 4.5 percent, then you are not going to get there. You have to do both. This is part one—grow the economy. Part two is going to have to be to bring our spending on a sustainable path so that the growth and the bene-fits of the growth and the revenue from the growth aren’t being taken and used to pay for even more government. To use a best analogy, if you owe a lot of money and you only make $2,000, and next month you get paid $3,000 a month but you add $1,500 a month of expenditures, then you are still owing more money. So you have to do both. You have to generate more revenue through growth—not through more taxes—and you have to hold the long- term line on spending. This is step one of that two-step process. We have a chance to do it here before the year is out. We have to do it, and I believe we will. It will be hard. It should be hard. I always laugh when I read these ar-ticles that say: Oh, tax reform is divi-sive, and people are arguing about it. They should argue about it. They don’t have a lot of arguments about eco-nomic policy in China, by the way, be-cause there is not much of an opposi-tion, but in America, we are a republic. There are different ideas. There should be different ideas. Tax reform should be controversial. It is important. There should be debate, and there will be so we arrive at good public policy. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a good thing, not a bad thing, as long as that debate is geared toward reaching a re-sult. In the end, I will tell you this, if we don’t do it, I actually think it will hurt our economy, not keep it the way it is. It will actually hurt it because a lot of businesses, a lot of employers, and a lot of Americans assumed that this would happen, given who won the elec-tions in 2016. They have already made investment decisions on the assump-tion that some of this was going to happen. I am telling you, if it doesn’t happen, the collapse of confidence will hurt the economy badly. Failing to act will actually reverse whatever gains we have already made this year on the ex-pectation of growth and will actually shatter people’s confidence in Amer-ica’s future. If you are sitting there today think-ing: Where am I going to open this big plant and hire 1,000 people, and you see tax reform collapse in the United States, and the people in the House, in the Senate, and in the White House are all supportive of tax reform, and you still couldn’t get it done, you are going to say to yourself: Guess what; I am not going to invest in that place be-cause even when the people who are in favor of it are in charge, they still can’t get it done. Not doing tax reform will not lead to the status quo. It will actually leave us worse off. That is why we must do it. That is why the child tax credit has to happen, by the way, because not only can we not pass it without it, but we can’t justify it without it. I am optimistic that we are going to get there. It will be a lot of work, but it will be good work. It will be the rea-son why so many of us are here to begin with. We come here to make a difference. We come here because we want to contribute toward making things better—not perfect, but better. This will make things better. For all the people who complain that we spend years here and nothing ever happens, this is the chance to see something happen in our time here and be able to look back when our service here is done and say: We made a dif-ference while we were there. That is what we are endeavoring to do, and I am excited about the fact that I believe we are going to do it. It will be long, it will be hard, but it will be fun and it will be good for our coun-try and for our people. If we do it right, it will be one of the most rewarding things any of us will ever do in our time here in public service. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S

HEALTHCARE  
Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the urgent need for action on the Children’s Health Insur-ance Program and other vital safety net programs. On September 30 of this year, 3 weeks ago, funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, expired, and funding for community health cen-ters also expired, as did funding for the National Health Service Corps. These three cornerstone programs provide es-sential health services to hundreds of thousands of my constituents and to millions of people across the country. Although these programs have his-torically secured strong bipartisan sup-port and, ostensibly, still do today, the Republican majority has not moved these bills forward toward passage, and it is really time to act. My home State of Minnesota is one of the first States to exhaust its fund-ing for its Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, a program that cov-ers 125,000 low-income children and 1,700 pregnant women. While the Federal Government has provided some emergency stop-gap funding, that, too, is slated to run out by the end of November. Minnesota has a long tradition of insuring coverage to vulnerable populations. So coverage for low-income children will continue, no matter what. However, over the next few weeks, if CHIP funding is not reau-thorized, the State will have to decide whether it will take extraordinary measures and incur significant finan-cial losses to continue providing cov-erage for vital services, like prenatal and postnatal care for the pregnant women, whose coverage is currently funded by CHIP. This is a terrible

choice that States shouldn’t have to make, and it doesn’t have to be that way. Minnesota is not alone. Five other States and the District of Columbia will see their funding dry up by Decem-ber, and 25 more States will exhaust their funding by early next year. Pretty soon, thousands of families could receive notices informing them that their coverage will be terminated. Imagine for a second what that mo-ment would feel like. You have a son or a daughter with a serious medical con-dition, and, perhaps, they are even in the hospital. You find out that their health insurance is going to be cut off because the Republican-controlled Con-gress couldn’t get its act together to continue funding for a bipartisan pro-gram that has been in existence for decades. I would be livid. That is why we have to act now. For most of this year, the Republican majority has been consumed with de-structive and counterproductive de-bates focused on repealing ObamaCare. They have done little else. That meant that not only did we blow past the funding deadline for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, but we also blew through the funding deadlines for community health centers and the Na-tional Health Service Corps program. Now this critical reauthorization is on hold because Republicans can’t agree on how to pay for it. This comes just a week after Republicans in the Senate endorsed the budget to increase the debt by up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years for tax cuts that will largely benefit the wealthiest Americans. In fact, the Tax Policy Center estimates that 80 percent of benefits of the Republican tax plan would go to the top 1 percent of income earners in this country. This is truly a case of the absurd. When it comes to providing healthcare for needy children and keeping Ameri-cans healthy, Republicans are saying they can’t do it unless it is paid for, and, often, that means making cuts to other safety net programs in which vulnerable individuals rely. But when it comes to tax cuts for the wealthy, which costs many, many, many, many times more than the cost of providing children with health insurance, my Re-publican colleagues are perfectly happy to do that without demands for offsets and, instead, adding costs to the debt. This is not responsible budgeting, and it is not just kids that stand to lose under this type of budgeting approach. Let me tell you about the other pro-grams at risk in my State of Min-nesota. In Minnesota, there are more than 70 community health center clinics that receive a total of $27 million in funding to care for the uninsured and the underinsured in the State. If this fund-ing is not reauthorized soon, these community health centers and the pa-tients they serve are going to experi-ence serious losses and not just finan-cial losses. Take, for example, Sawtooth Moun-tain Clinic, which provides care to some of the most isolated and rural counties up in the northeastern corner of my State, in the Arrowhead. Saw-tooth reports that it would lose up to $1 million, which would force them to cut back on staff and services, having a drastic ripple effect across the entire community. The CEO of the clinic in Grand Marais explains: 
We are the only clinic and providers in all of Cook County— 
Parenthetically, that is a big coun-ty— 
and also one of the only providers serving the Grand Portage band. 
That is the band of the Chippewa or Ojibwe. 
Since 1965, Congress has provided this sta-ble and critically important funding that supports our isolated and rural communities. Congress needs to do its work and needs to act now. 
Similarly, without funding for the National Health Service Corps—this is what the program does. It provides fi-nancial support and loan repayment for clinicians who practice in underserved areas. I know the Presiding Officer must be interested in that, as Alaska has some underserved areas and needs providers to serve in those areas. Many providers, including those in greater Minnesota, will not be able to recruit or hire new staff. In a recent news article, the chief ex-ecutive of a Minneapolis-based network of clinics stated that the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program offered him a unique bar-gaining chip against the larger health systems. Without this program, he be-lieves he wouldn’t be able to success-fully compete for providers. Look, I recognize how we got here and where the time and energy has been spent over the last few months, and I am proud that we were able to abide by the will of the people and suc-cessfully stop the effort to repeal the ACA and strip healthcare from millions of people. I would hope that we would recognize that we have here histori-cally bipartisan legislation to reau-thorize funding for children’s health in-surance coverage and other safety net programs. It is incumbent upon us to act, and act now. We have to reauthor-ize these programs so that Minnesotans and millions of the families across the country are not unnecessarily and un-fairly harmed as a result of our inac-tion. In the same news story I referred to earlier, the CEO of NorthPoint Health & Wellness, another safety net clinic in Minnesota, stated: 
There is a high degree of anxiety for staff and for some of our patients. . . . I think Congress understands that we are vital to the safety net and they have to continue to support the community health centers. 
Let’s work together to pass this leg-islation so we don’t let these clinics and the patients they serve down. It is time to act, and time to act now. Thank you very much, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Colorado. WILDFIRE FUNDING  
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, in re-cent months, Americans have been hit by a string of natural disasters—from devastating hurricanes in Puerto Rico, Florida, and Texas, to catastrophic wildfires in Oregon, Montana, and Cali-fornia. Earlier this week, the Senate voted to provide urgent relief to our communities in need. Although Colorado was fortunate this year—we could have easily had fires, but we were very fortunate, un-like Montana, this year—we know the devastation of wildfires all too well. In 2012, the Waldo Canyon fire raged for 16 days, incinerating 18,000 acres, destroy-ing over 300 homes, and forcing the evacuation of more than 32,000 Colo-radans. Years later, our communities are still recovering from the damage. Out West, wildfires can be cata-strophic events. Yet Washington con-tinues to fund them differently than other major disasters, such as hurri-canes, tornadoes, or floods. When those disasters strike, we pay for emergency response from an entirely separate ac-count. When a wildfire catches, that cost falls entirely on the U.S. Forest Service. If it is a catastrophic fire, as we see now in Montana and Northern California, those costs can easily ex-ceed the Forest Service budget for fire suppression. That forces the Forest Service to borrow funds from other ac-counts to make up the difference. That is something no one has to do for any other disaster in America. This is often at the expense of efforts to prevent the next catastrophic fire. It stands to reason that if we spend less and less on fire prevention, which is what the Forest Service is doing every year because of the way the Con-gress has set this up, we are going to spend more and more on fire suppres-sion, fighting fires, and that is what is happening. That is exactly what has happened. In 1995, the Forest Service spent around 16 percent of its budget on fire suppression—16 percent. Last year, it spent over half of its budget. For the first time in the Forest Service’s his-tory, they spent over half their budget fighting fires. You might as well call it the fire-fighting agency, not the Forest Service agency. In fact, the number was closer to 60 percent. The Forest Service had to borrow over half a bil-lion dollars from other accounts in the agency—accounts that are important to Colorado, Wyoming, and Alaska. While we replenished those accounts in disaster aid packages earlier this year, we once again failed to address why they were depleted in the first place. Until we do, we are going to find ourselves in the same position every year. This is no way to run a govern-ment. It makes no sense from a fiscal perspective, and it makes no sense from a public welfare perspective. This is not how we should manage our tax-payer dollars. Undercutting fire pre-vention is the definition of being penny wise and pound foolish. Every dollar we

spend on disaster prevention leads to $5 of savings down the road. We need to reinvest in fire prevention and in forest mitigation. In Colorado, our forests are in terrible shape. And it is not just Colorado citizens who need to care about that; anybody who lives downstream of our rivers, which are States all across America, needs to care about the condition of those head-waters. Those headwaters that are owned by the public, entrusted in the Forest Service, are in terrible shape because of this Congress’s inability to deal with this. We have over 800 million dead stand-ing trees in the State of Colorado alone. Our communities, our water-sheds, and our infrastructure are at risk. The Forest Service knows how to do this. They know how to mitigate that—by thinning timber and man-aging prescribed burns. But right now, all of those projects are on hold be-cause the Forest Service anticipates having to fight more catastrophic fires next season. This is ridiculous. This is an affront to the people of Colorado and the people of the West. We have a solution. It is a simple so-lution. Let’s pay for fire suppression the same way we pay for other disas-ters. Our bill, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, would do just that. It is backed by seven Democrats and, I am very proud to say, by four Republicans. Unlike a lot of issues in Washington, both parties actually agree on the solu-tion. I know the administration is eager to fix this problem. Secretary Perdue knows that the current system makes no sense. He said as much at his con-firmation hearing and again when he invited—and I so much appreciated this; we didn’t ask—a bipartisan group of Senators to the Forest Service in September to discuss this. He knows that important wildfire mitigation projects are not getting done. He wants to fix the problem, and we should. It is far past time. This makes no sense from a fiscal point of view. I know some colleagues in this Cham-ber would prefer to couple our proposal with broader forest management re-forms. I have been part of forest man-agement discussions in the past, and I want to continue those discussions. In fact, in the last farm bill, we worked across the aisle to improve forest man-agement. Let’s be clear. For years now, efforts to link broad forest management re-form with a funding fix have failed. They will not pass the Senate. Each year we do nothing, we continue to shortchange fire prevention, the good people who work for the Forest Service all across the country in our States, and we needlessly expose our commu-nities to greater risks. We have to act—Colorado and the West cannot wait another year—and we will have a chance when Congress votes on another disaster package over the next few months. We should use that opportunity to finally fix this problem and put the Forest Service in a strong-er position to prevent the next cata-strophic fire. I thank my colleague from Wyoming for his patience and for his leadership on the Budget Committee. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, while I am disappointed that we didn’t continue the tradition of alternating speakers, I am glad that I got to hear both of the previous speakers. I used to work with the Senators from Colorado to make sure that there were pictures taken annually from the same spots to show the way the trees are dying. There was an infestation that was causing this. The only reason we don’t still take those pictures is all the trees are dead. You can’t show that it is spreading when they are all dead. They need to be cleaned up, and I am glad there is work being done on forest management. On healthcare, there is some effort being made between Senator A
LEX-
ANDER and Senator M URRAY to get a bi-partisan bill, but what we need to do around here is get some of the appoint-ments finished up so that the President can have the people in place to solve these problems. We are having to spend 30 hours on the cloture of a district judge. I have never heard of that. I have been here 21 years now, and I have never heard of that. We have to get the appointments through. That is one of our prime jobs—to provide advice and consent for the President—and it is not happening on a timely basis. We have had to do 44 cloture motions on different people for the administra-tion. At this point in President Obama’s first term, that had only hap-pened five times. With the previous President, it hadn’t happened at all, and the previous one, it had only hap-pened once. Already 44 times this year, it has taken us around 30 hours to get somebody through the process, and we have hundreds waiting to get through the process. That is one of our primary jobs. If we can’t get those through the process, it is pretty hard for us to do the legislation we need to do. 
VETERANS CHOICE PROGRAM  
Today, Mr. President, I rise to ex-press my serious concerns on behalf of our Nation’s veterans. This is a huge problem in Wyoming. Wyoming is the least populated State in the Nation. If it is a huge problem there, it has to be even greater in States across the coun-try, and I am sure it is a problem in all of them. In 2014, we learned that several vet-erans died in Arizona—a lot of veterans died in Arizona while staff at the Phoe-nix VA medical center entered false in-formation about their wait times and appointments. They kept getting de-layed. Later that year, we found that such scheduling manipulation was widespread, including in my home State of Wyoming. Congress responded by creating the Veterans Choice Pro-gram to help veterans get care in their communities and to get it promptly. Unfortunately, Wyoming veterans are continuing to experience delays and limited access to care. I have heard from many Wyoming veterans who have been unable to receive the care they need and many providers who have been unable to get reimbursed for medical services. Some doctors and fa-cilities have ended their participation in VA Choice because it is taking too long to get reimbursed or they are un-able to get reimbursed at all and they are having to do a tremendous amount of paperwork in order to even get to that final reimbursement. Sometimes when they finally get payment, the check is made out to the wrong pro-vider. Time and again, I hear reports of how difficult it is to get simple an-swers, let alone care or provider reim-bursement, from the VA and the con-tractor administering the program in Wyoming. The consequences of this poorly run program are ultimately borne by the veterans. In a frontier State like Wyo-ming, losing access to one specialist can mean losing access to the only spe-cialist in the area. Sadly, Wyoming veterans continue to tell me about these problems because the situation isn’t getting any better— that is in spite of my having the Sec-retary in my office and then having him bring his staff in, who had pro-vided the terrible statistics that they were working from. One such veteran was waiting for a surgery followup and cancer screening and can’t go to the same doctor now because VA Choice never paid them. Another veteran was not able to access vision care. Another could not access necessary neurological care because of reimbursement issues. I have even been contacted by veterans who are worried that they will go into collections be-cause of claims that have not been paid by the Choice Program—not by them but by the Choice Program. Without improvements to the pro-gram, our veterans will have to con-tinue to wait for needed care, and their quality of life will continue to be nega-tively impacted. I mentioned before that we are the least populated State in the country, and we have so many problems that I send a weekly list to the Secretary. I can’t imagine what it is like in a high- population State. We created VA Choice to better serve the healthcare needs of veterans, not to create a new source of uncertainty about whether they will be able to get the care they need. That is unaccept-able. It defeats the entire purpose of the program. Until Congress steps in to improve the program, more providers will drop out of the program and more veterans will be harmed. These men and women have given our country so much, and they deserve quality care in an efficient manner. Their providers need to be paid on time so our veterans can get the treatment they need.

the system fails those who never failed us, trust degrades. We can do better than this. We must do better than this. I know my colleagues on the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs are working hard to solve these issues. I am working with them to make sure that any new version of community care for our veterans takes into ac-count the unique challenges that rural and frontier healthcare networks face. We hold the highest debt to our vet-erans. Let’s repay that honor and honor their selfless service by pro-viding them with the care they de-serve. The veterans program was considered to be one of the best-run healthcare programs anywhere, and I heard noth-ing but compliments about it until the problem in Arizona, and then we found that the system had changed. That might be an indication of what could happen if we went to Federal healthcare for all, but this is one area that needs to be straightened out. It was a prime example of good care, and it isn’t. We have to get it restored for our veterans. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have a very significant couple of votes com-ing up. One is the nomination of Scott Palk to be a district judge for the Western District of Oklahoma. We have been working on this for about 2 years now. He is one of the highest qualified individuals. I thank the leader for moving for-ward on his nomination this week. I know judicial nominations are a pri-ority of the leader’s, and I share his be-lief in the importance of filling the many vacancies we have with judges who will uphold the rule of law, not predetermine outcomes and not legis-late from the bench. Scott Palk fulfills and embodies this philosophy, and I have full confidence that he will be a judge whom Oklahoma and the Nation will be proud of. This nomination is of great need to the Western District, located in Okla-homa City, which has a very heavy caseload. In fact, we have three vacan-cies on the bench there. One vacancy goes back over 4 years and another over 3 years, so this nomination is des-perately needed. Mr. Palk was nominated in the last Congress—so it was not this Congress— during the previous administration. He made it through the Judiciary Com-mittee by voice vote before we ran out of time at the end of the 114th Con-gress. We would have had this done, but we just flat ran out of time. He had bipartisan support in the last Congress and has in this Congress, with there having been a 17-to-3 vote in the Judi-ciary Committee. It is not very often that happens. He also has bipartisan support back home in Oklahoma. He comes highly recommended by David Boren. Every-one here knows who David Boren is. The Presiding Officer remembers David Boren. He was my predecessor in this seat. He was the president of the Uni-versity of Oklahoma but is retired now. He is a Democrat. Actually, he and I were elected to the House of Represent-atives in Oklahoma on the same day, so we go back a long way. David Boren knows Mr. Palk very well because Scott Palk has worked at the Univer-sity of Oklahoma College of Law for about 15 years now after his having left a successful career in both the U.S. at-torney’s office and as a county district attorney. David Boren said of Palk—now, this is a Democrat talking about Scott Palk—‘‘He would make an excellent judge,’’ would be ‘‘balanced and fair in his approach,’’ and has ‘‘an excellent reputation for complete honesty and integrity.’’ I don’t know what more you could want in a judge. That is David Boren talking, my predecessor in the Senate. Again, I thank the leader for his commitment to fulfilling our judicial vacancies, and I ask that my col-leagues support the nomination, as I am sure they will, with a ‘‘yes’’ vote for Mr. Palk. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LANKFORD. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, we are about to vote on a gentleman named Scott Palk, who was nominated by President Trump to serve as a U.S. district court judge for the Western District of Oklahoma on May 8. On June 15 of this year, he passed the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support. It has taken us this long, from June 15, going through the committee process, to finally getting this to the floor in the last days of October. This is the issue we face as a Senate right now. We have an opening with a judge who has already gone through the committee process, who has al-ready been approved—who will be con-firmed, I hope, with wide bipartisan support—but because of the ongoing delay of every nominee, of everything in the process, this is slowing down the wheels of our government across the country. Whether that be judges or whether that be individuals in the ex-ecutive branch working in the agen-cies, we are seeing a constant slowing. We have to be able to correct this. I would state that Americans will be very pleased when they get a chance to see Scott Palk on the bench. He will be a fair judge. He comes from a great family and has a great passion to serve people, both as he served in the U.S. at-torney’s office in the past and at the University of Oklahoma, working at the law school there. He will make the Nation proud. I am glad we have finally gone through this extremely long proc-ess to finally get him on and to get him seated on that bench. In the days ahead, I look forward to the other positions in government being filled as well with other well- qualified individuals. I look forward to seeing this done. I look forward to see-ing Scott Palk not as Scott Palk but as Judge Palk. With that, I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S
ASSE). All time has expired. The question is, Will the Senate ad-vise and consent to the Palk nomina-tion? Mr. COTTON. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec-ond. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination. The bill clerk read the nomination of Trevor N. McFadden, of Virginia, to be United States District Judge for the District of Columbia. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Nevada. Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I rise to discuss an issue that is ex-tremely important to me and to many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle—the issue of judicial vacancies. I came here to work and am honored to serve on behalf of the people of the State of Nevada who sent me to Wash-ington. One of the most pressing issues I have found since being here is, all too often Members of Congress go home be-fore their work is finished. Many of you here know the first piece of legislation I have introduced for the past two Congresses is my No Budget, No Pay Act. The concept is simple. If Congress can’t pass a budget and all of its spending bills on time, then Congress itself shouldn’t get paid. The Senate should apply the same concepts, in my opinion, to confirming judges. I commend our majority leader for bringing two more judges to the floor this week, but there is a lot more work to do. We need to work day and night to confirm those judges who are already on our calendar and have moved out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Senate has an incred-ible opportunity right now to confirm Federal judges who will uphold the Constitution. We should be here every day, for as long as we need, to ensure all judicial vacancies are filled. Our conference must be willing to work together in order to get the busi-ness of the Senate done. Right now, there are 149 judicial vacancies. Let me repeat that. There are 149 judicial va-cancies, and the Senate has only con-firmed 8 judges this session—149 vacan-cies, 8 judges confirmed. That means, in 9 months, with well over 100 vacan-cies and over 60 judicial emergencies, we have only managed to confirm 8 judges. The minority party has undercut the confirmation process of the adminis-tration’s nominees and judicial ap-pointments. When new Presidents are elected, they have always been given an opportunity to put their team in place in short order. Historically, this is not just common courtesy, it is an expectation of the American people to have a seamless transition of power, re-sulting in a functional Federal Govern-ment. One of the eight judges confirmed was Neil Gorsuch, who I am thankful now serves on the Supreme Court. Jus-tice Gorsuch is an example of the type of judge we have the chance to put in place. As with Justice Gorsuch’s con-firmation, we need to do all that is nec-essary to fill these vacancies with great judges like him. President Trump has nominated many judges and has more to nomi-nate. For those he has already nomi-nated, it is our duty to carefully review these nominations and ensure that these judges are confirmed in a timely manner. We must be willing to put in as much time as needed, whether that means working weekends, canceling State work periods, or working all through the night to get these Con-stitution-loving judges confirmed. I know this is important to all of us, but we need to do better. Last week, I was a proud partner with Senator P
ERDUE and several of my other col-leagues in calling on the Senate to work 24/7 until we get our work done. We have a substantial list of important work to complete, including con-firming the judicial nominees the President has sent us, passing tax re-form, fixing our broken healthcare sys-tem, and funding the government. The American people elected us to com-plete these critical tasks. They elected us to deliver a simpler, fairer tax code and to make sure our Federal judiciary is fully occupied with judges whose sole purpose is to uphold the Constitution as it was written. To my fellow Senators, I am calling on all of us to do what the people have sent us to do and not let a light sched-ule stop us from fulfilling our duties. The American people don’t go to work 4 days a week, and neither should we. This isn’t France. We need to work a full workweek. We must make it clear to our constituents that we are fight-ing for the hard-working Americans every single day. Americans do what it takes to get the job done, and we should do the same. I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oregon. 
REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN  
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I don’t often come to the floor of the Senate to give a speech like the one I am going to give now, but today I plan to start sounding the alarm, both from the standpoint of the process and the substance of what is known about the Republican tax plan as of this after-noon.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6837 October 26, 2017 
This morning, the House passed the budget so now it is on to tax. The de-bate, if the Republicans have their way, will happen at the speed of light. If they have their way, this all could be wrapped up before most Americans have even been able to put a dent in their holiday shopping. That is exactly what the majority of Republicans is counting on. The Repub-licans are rushing to drive the tax give-away to the superwealthy and the pow-erful corporations and to do it so quickly that most of America will real-ly have no idea what will be going on. Their hope is simple—to do it in a way so that nobody catches on. So this afternoon, as the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, I am going to look at this from a few different an-gles—first, as to the process and, then, as to the policy that is on offer from the Republicans as of right now. Right off the top, I am sure that Sen-ators have heard that, here in the Sen-ate and Congress, there is going to be a real debate that is going to play out in a careful and deliberate way and that there is going to be plenty of give and take. As of right now, my message to the American people is this: You have been fooled. Don’t buy that. Here is what is going to happen. Anybody who expects a repeat of the kind of bipar-tisan, deliberate process that took place in 1986, when the Democrats and Ronald Reagan got together, is in line for some very disappointing times. Our former colleague Senator Brad-ley, who served on the Finance Com-mittee with such distinction and was a key author of the 1986 reform bill, called a couple of days ago, and I ex-plained to him what was going on. He was just incredulous. He could not be-lieve that this was going to be the process—that it would all be over in a matter of weeks and that it would not even be like healthcare, with the de-bate moving in fits and starts and stretching out over months. If Republicans have their way, as my family used to say, this is going to be over lickety-split, and it is coming up quickly. The House plans to offer up a bill in about a week, and the Ways and Means Committee is going to jump into action. The Senate bill could come out in a matter of days later, and then it would be the Finance Committee’s turn. As most people in the Senate know, there is a normal process for these de-bates in committee. You usually put out draft legislation. You refine your ideas. You update your work. You share with both sides of the aisle the ideas that would make sense—those that get both sides to say: Hey, biparti-sanship is about taking each other’s good ideas, and politics is about taking each other’s bad ideas. In this case, it is not about trying to make any bipar-tisan efforts at all. The normal process involves exercising a little patience, giving the officials at the Joint Com-mittee on Taxation and in the Congres-sional Budget Office time to really make sense of what the numbers mean. This is not Washington lingo. What do the numbers mean for middle-class people—the folks who are really hurt-ing now, who are walking on an eco-nomic tightrope in trying to pay bills? We ought to make sure that people who are knowledgeable about this have the time to really look at the numbers and give us some general sense of what this means, particularly for America’s hard-working middle class. Yet for this partisan tax cut and a process that will be hyperpartisan—it is designed to be an off-ramp to partisanship only—the Republicans are just blowing right by those steps that constitute the normal process that I have described. The Congress is headed for a debate on legislation that has the potential to reshape our entire economy at a cru-cial time when we understand the chal-lenge from global competition and change, but the Republicans, as of now, are not going to wait to see the facts and figures, never mind that the bill is going to affect every taxpayer in the country in one way or another. The Re-publicans have said that we are going to do some leaping without looking. They may not even have legislative hearings to examine the Republican tax cut bill and what the impact of it could be, which was what Senator Bradley was just stunned about be-cause he and others worked for months with the Reagan administration in try-ing to do what was normal and, as of now, is not going the happen. What is even more ominous is that, if the bill clears the Finance Committee, the debate on the Senate floor will hap-pen in a flash. That is because, since day one of this administration, the Re-publicans have said—and Leader M
CCONNELL has said this repeatedly— that they want to use the most par-tisan process around to move the tax cut. It is another round of what is called budget reconciliation. What this comes down to is a rejec-tion of the kind of bipartisanship that has been proven to work on tax reform. Ronald Reagan worked hand in hand with Democrats on tax reform in 1986. The two sides brought forward their best ideas. They worked for months and months and, as Senator Bradley told me, for several years. There were dozens of hearings that dug into the specifics and carefully examined the issues. After the bill came out, the committee met over 18 days to debate and vote on the amendments. There was committee consideration—what is called a markup—that lasted a total of more than 45 hours. Then the bill came to the floor of the Senate, and, as is fit-ting for a piece of legislation that can reshape the whole American economy, the debate took almost a month. That is the textbook of how you successfully write bipartisan tax reform legislation. By the way, that is the model by which our former colleague Dan Coats—now a member of the Trump administration— worked with me to produce a bipar-tisan Federal income tax reform bill. Yet we are not going to see any of that kind of work this time around. The road that the majority is taking us down in 2017 makes a mockery out of the bipartisan process that brought Ronald Reagan and the Democrats to-gether. As of now, there will be 20 hours of debate—20 hours. That is it— on a bill that will transform the bot-tom line for every American family and will affect the hopes and aspira-tions of our middle class, which will drive 70 percent of the economic activ-ity in our country for years and years. Then the debate will be over, and it will be time to vote. What I am going to try to do here— and we will be talking often in the days ahead—is to lay out what this really means for hard-working middle-class people, because, so far, what we have seen is kind of one hand giveth and the other hand taketh away. The details for the top of the top, the megawealthy, are spelled out, but we do not see exactly how the middle class is not going to go into the hole. As of now, the numbers suggest, particularly if you have a couple of children and are in a place with high State and local taxes, that you really could fall behind. If we do not spell out what is actually at stake here and give the American people the opportunity to tune in and be heard, this process is just going to race by before anybody notices, and that is what the Republicans are counting on. The bottom line is that, when the middle class and the American people find out what is in the Republican tax plan as it is known today, the less they are going to like it. There have been sort of two versions of it. The first came out, I believe it was, late in the spring. It was a page long—shorter than the typical drug store receipt. We got a bit more information a few weeks ago, but in both instances, as I have de-scribed, it looks like the middle class is going to get hurt, and folks who are successful and those who are at the top of the top are, basically, going to get even more. We want all Americans to be success-ful. We want to give everybody the chance to get ahead, but we do not want tax breaks skewed to the very top. As of right now, the Republican tax plan is a feast for the very wealthy, and the middle class is on the menu. Even the President’s top campaign ad-viser on taxes said that the Repub-licans have made $4 trillion worth of promises in this tax proposal, perhaps even more, but because of budget rules, that pricetag has to come down to $1.5 trillion for the bill to get through the Senate. That means that somebody has to pay for a whole lot of that $4 trillion of corporate goodies and handouts to the wealthy. The Republicans seem almost aller-gic to raising revenue by asking those at the top to pay their fair share. Every proposal that the Republicans have put forward to pay for this tax giveaway to the top has reached right into the pockets of the middle class. Take the elimination of the State and

local deduction. It will cause pain for millions of Americans across the coun-try, not just in the West—in places like California and Oregon—and the North-east but for those in scarlet red areas who voted for the President on election day—places like North Carolina, Geor-gia, Wisconsin, and Texas. Then there is the plan to double the standard de-duction while simultaneously getting rid of personal and dependent exemp-tions. When you cut out all of the tax lingo—as I have said, one hand giveth and the other hand taketh away—what it means, based on the information that is out now, is that a family of six in Medford, OR, could see its taxes in-crease by thousands of dollars per year. That is a holiday surprise. My guess is that people are going to say that it is the nightmare before Christmas if this plan becomes law. Even more middle-class Americans who checked on the news over the last few days probably had the wind knocked out of them when they read that their 401(k)s may be on the ropes under the Republican plan. A few days ago, the President said: No, do not touch the 401(k). But it seems to me like Republicans just cannot help themselves. When the President was asked about it again, the new Trump position was that middle-class retire-ments are a bargaining chip to get this lopsided tax handout through the Con-gress. Let me repeat that last part. The President of the United States said that middle-class retirements are a bargaining chip in this crusade to cut taxes for the most fortunate. Nothing illustrates more clearly how this proc-ess has gone horribly wrong, and I want to make clear to the American people to watch the details. Watch the details because every time a new detail leaks out, the middle class loses. So my bottom line, colleagues, is real tax reform ought to be about putting more dollars back in middle-class pockets, but right now the majority is taking a different tack. It amounts to a hunt for ways to force the middle class to pay for the tax breaks for those at the top. This scheme will explode the deficit. It is a con job on the middle class. It is failed economic policy, but it could rocket in the Congress in the weeks ahead before the American people catch on. So my counsel is, everybody ought to strap in and get ready for what is com-ing. Every step of the way in the Fi-nance Committee and here on the floor, I will continue working with my Demo-cratic colleagues to fight for middle- class priorities and tax reform, and I hope we will have some from the other side of the aisle join us. We intend to keep sounding the alarm on a Repub-lican plan that as of now gives trillions of dollars of handouts to those at the top while hiking taxes on millions of middle-class families. Now that the House has passed its budget, this is kicking off the debate, and the idea that we would have a bunch of fake promises to the middle class, very specific gifts to folks at the top, and somehow unicorn theories of growth that will justify this, while really creating deficits that hurt Medi-care, Medicaid, Social Security, and our safety net—those are the issues the American people deserve to know more about. We are going to tell them a lot more about the details in the days ahead because we believe in tax reform that puts the middle-class first, doesn’t give gifts to the people in the very top 1 percent, doesn’t clobber Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, and, as Bill Bradley said earlier this week in a conversation with me, is based on the kind of bipartisanship that a hugely important issue like tax reform war-rants.

CCONNELL. Madam President, in my opening remarks today, I com-mended President Trump once again for the outstanding judicial nomina-tions he has made, and I reiterated the Senate’s determination once more to continue confirming them regardless of the often mindless partisan obstruction we have been seeing across the aisle. This pointless obstruction is designed simply to waste time, not to change an outcome, and it will not. It didn’t stop the Senate from confirming Scott Palk, it will not stop the Senate from confirming Trevor McFadden, and it will not stop the Senate from con-firming even more outstanding nomi-nees next week. You can count on it. I have filed cloture on four more well-qualified nominees for our Na-tion’s circuit courts: Notre Dame law professor Amy Barrett, a nominee for the Seventh Circuit; Michigan Su-preme Court Justice Joan Larsen, a nominee for the Sixth Circuit; Colo-rado Supreme Court Justice Allison Eid, a nominee for the Tenth Circuit; and University of Pennsylvania law professor Stephanos Bibas, a nominee for the Third Circuit. By confirming these nominees, we can take a big step toward restoring our Nation’s courts to their proper role, interpreting and applying the law based upon what it actually says, not what a judge might wish it to say. It is quite a departure from the last admin-istration’s philosophy when it came to selecting judicial nominees. For the last 8 years, we had a Presi-dent who said a criterion for lifetime positions was the ability to empathize with certain groups over others. It came to be known as the ‘‘empathy standard.’’ That is a great standard if you are the party in the case for whom the judge has empathy, not so great if you are the other person. It also is not in keeping with the longstanding American legal traditions of applying the law equally to all, giving every liti-gant a fair shake, and ruling based on the actual meaning of our Constitution and laws, not what a judge or some pre-ferred political constituency might wish they meant. That, I believe, is the view of the American people. President Trump has done a terrific job of nominating judges who are al-ready helping to restore the courts to their intended function in our system of government. The nominees we will consider next week are sure to do the same. We will continue our efforts with consideration of the Barrett nomina-tion on Monday. Amy Barrett is a pro-fessor of law at one of our Nation’s pre-mier law schools. Notre Dame happens to be a Catholic University. Amy Bar-rett happens to be a nominee who is a Catholic and who speaks freely and openly about her faith and its impor-tance to her. For some on the left, that seems to be a disqualifying factor for her nomination. I would remind colleagues that we do not have religious tests for office in this country. There is no religious test for office in the United States of Amer-ica. Amy Barrett’s nomination has re-ceived outstanding reviews. She is clearly well qualified for the office to which she has been nominated. As the president of Notre Dame recently wrote, ‘‘Her experience as a clerk for Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is of the high-est order. So, too, is her scholarship in the areas of federal courts, constitu-tional law, and statutory interpreta-tion.’’ Amy Barrett is going to make an outstanding Federal Circuit Court judge. So, too, will Ms. Larsen, Ms. Eid, and Mr. Bibas. I look forward to the Senate confirming all of them next week.

GUN VIOLENCE Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise to address the latest mass shooting in our country. This one took place last week in my own State of Mary-land, in the city of Edgewood, in Har-ford County, which is northeast of Bal-timore. In this case, the suspect gathered co-workers at his place of business, Ad-vanced Granite Solutions, and began shooting. He killed three coworkers

and critically wounded two others who remain in critical condition at the Maryland Shock Trauma Center. The suspect then fled to Delaware. According to an article in the Balti-more Sun, he shot an acquaintance in the head at a car dealership. The vic-tim was in stable condition and later identified his attacker to police. The suspect was finally arrested after a brief foot chase, and police said the suspect threw a gun at them after spot-ting law enforcement approaching. This terrible shooting in Maryland came a few weeks after the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, which occurred in Las Vegas, NV, on October 1. This mass shooting from a hotel room targeting concertgoers at an out-door music festival left 58 dead and more than 500 people wounded, with dozens of victims still in the hospital today, some of whom are in critical condition. These are just staggering numbers. But I want to put a human face on this for my colleagues and talk about one Marylander who was injured in the Las Vegas attack. The Baltimore Sun shared the story of Tina Frost. Tina is a native of Crofton in Anne Arundel County, MD. She is a 2008 graduate of Arundel High School in Gambrills. She was a star soccer player in school, and she now lives in California and works at the ac-counting firm of Ernst and Young. The story begins: 
Before a bullet from 32 stories above cut through her face, Crofton native Tina Frost drove from San Diego with her boyfriend to see one of her favorite country artists in Las Vegas. . . . Becky Frost said her 27-year-old sister had lost her right eye and was in a Las Vegas intensive care unit after a two-hour surgery. [She] said her bubbly and char-ismatic older sister was in a coma that the family expected to last about a week. An-other sister wrote on Facebook that the fam-ily was waiting to see the extent of the brain damage. ‘‘We’re sticking together and pray-ing,’’ Becky Frost said. 
Tina Frost did wake up from the coma and was recently transferred to Maryland for additional surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. According to family members, she un-derwent a second successful surgery last week. The family’s website update said: ‘‘We are thankful Tina is still being a true fighter and warrior!’’ Today, I want Tina and the entire Frost family to know that they are in our thoughts and prayers. I understand that their community has already been raising funds to help defray Tina’s medical expenses for her recovery. This is just one example of hundreds who were victimized in Las Vegas. I am just heartbroken by the terror in Las Vegas. With the entire country, I am grieving for the senseless loss of life and praying for the victims, their fami-lies, and all those who were injured like Tina Frost, whether by gunshots or the chaos that ensued. Much thanks also goes to the first re-sponders, including our police, fire, ambulance, and emergency medical workers, who saved countless lives by helping those around them and running toward danger instead of running away from it. Thoughts and prayers console vic-tims and their families, but actions speak much louder. We must be out-raged at this latest shooting, and we must act. Congress must act. States must act. Weapons of war should not be in the hands of civilians. We see the deadly results in Las Vegas just as we have seen before in Orlando, Blacksburg, San Bernardino, Aurora, Sandy Hook, the streets of Baltimore, and elsewhere across this great coun-try. We need to do everything in our power to stop the carnage of these shootings. How high does the death toll have to get before we enact real, bipar-tisan reforms that will make the Amer-ican public safer and reduce the risks that come from allowing such easy ac-cess to dangerous weapons primarily designed for the battlefield? Assault weapons are not needed to hunt deer or ducks; they are only meant to kill peo-ple, and they do far too often in this country. I urge my colleagues to be bold and fight to break the cycle of what could only be described as a callous disregard for the victims of gun violence. More talk will not save lives; only action and real change and Federal and State laws can. This attack and others like it in re-cent years tear at the heart and leave us angry, frustrated, and confused. We as a nation must resolve to stop those who wish to do harm to Americans from committing, encouraging, and abetting acts of terror. We as a nation, as a community, and as an American family must take action to change minds, hearts, and finally change poli-cies. We can stop others and save lives by taking immediate action. I was disappointed that Congress missed yet another opportunity to enact commonsense, reasonable gun safety measures after the June 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Or-lando, FL, which killed 49 people and injured 53 others. The mass shooting in Las Vegas has now sadly surpassed those numbers. In the Las Vegas massacre, Stephen Paddock used a bump fire stock device, which allowed a semiautomatic rifle to fire at a rate similar to that of a fully automatic weapon—a rate of about nine bullets a second. Fully automatic weapons are generally illegal under current law. Paddock also stockpiled a virtual arsenal in his hotel room, as police found 23 firearms in the room. Police also found a large quantity of ammunition, including numerous high- capacity magazines capable of holding up to 100 rounds apiece. The preliminary assessment—with the understanding that the investiga-tion is still ongoing—from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Ex-plosives is that the shooter legally pur-chased all these guns, bump stocks, and ammunition. It is outrageous that a mass shooter was legally able to pur-chase a device designed to convert his gun into a military-style weapon with no legitimate civilian use. It is out-rageous that a mass shooter was le-gally able to purchase high-capacity magazine clips with no legitimate ci-vilian use. These are weapons of war. You don’t need them for hunting, and you don’t need them for self-defense. Earlier this month, I convened a roundtable meeting with law enforce-ment officials at the First Baptist Church of Highland Park in Prince George’s County, MD. The group in-cluded officials from the local, State, and Federal levels, including the sher-iff, police chief of Prince George’s County, State delegates, the State at-torney general of Maryland, and rep-resentatives of the U.S. attorney’s of-fice. Maryland has progressive laws on gun safety and has taken steps to ban weapons of war and high-capacity mag-azines that have no legitimate civil purpose. The group echoed the concern to me that if Maryland has strict laws relating to gun safety that protect both the public and police officers, what is to stop someone from driving over the border to one of our neigh-boring States in order to procure guns? That is why we need a strong national law to protect all Americans, and Con-gress should act on commonsense gun safety measures. What can we do in Congress? I have cosponsored the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act, which Senator FEIN-
STEIN introduced. In the Las Vegas shooting, the gunman was able to un-leash hundreds of rounds of gunfire on the crowd, likely by using the bump stock device. Fully automatic guns or machine guns are already banned for civilian use under the National Firearms Act, but a loophole exists that allows for these bump stock devices, as well as similar accessories, to convert semi-automatic weapons to emulate auto-matic weapons. Senator F
EINSTEIN ’s legislation would close the loophole in current law that allows conversion de-vices and accessories to be available to the public. The bill bans the sale, transfer, importation, manufacturing, or possession of bump stocks, trigger cranks, or anything that accelerates a semiautomatic rifle’s rate of fire. Semiautomatic rifles typically have a rate of fire of 45 to 60 rounds per minute; a bump stock could increase the semiautomatic rifle rate of fire to 700 rounds per minute or 9 per second. I have also cosponsored the Large Ca-pacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act, also known as the Keeping Ameri-cans Safe Act, introduced by Senator M
ENENDEZ . It prohibits the possession or transfer of large-capacity ammuni-tion magazines—more than 10 rounds per magazine—with limited exceptions for law enforcement personnel. Senator M
ENENDEZ ’s bill authorizes a buyback program for high-capacity magazines using Byrne JAG grants. To me, these two bills represent a practical, commonsense approach to

promoting gun safety and reducing the threat of gun violence without imping-ing on the rights of legitimate owners. As NBC News recently reported, more Americans have died from gunshots in the last 50 years than in all the wars in America’s history. Since 1968, more than 1.5 million Americans have died in gun-related incidents, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I have also cosponsored the Back-ground Check Expansion Act, intro-duced by Senator M
URPHY . This bill would expand Federal background checks to cover the sale and transfer of all firearms by private sellers, just as licensed dealers are required to do so under the existing Brady law, with cer-tain limited exceptions. Under current law, unlicensed or pri-vate sellers are not required to conduct a background check prior to transfer-ring a firearm. This is outrageous, and Congress should act right now to close this dangerous loophole. It should not matter whether you buy a gun at a local gun store or a gun show or the internet—you should have to pass a basic background check to make sure the guns are kept out of the hands of people who should never have one. Congress has an obligation to act. As I have indicated before, we need to act. Inaction is not an option. Many of our States have acted as well, including my own State of Maryland, but we need a national law that applies to all 50 States to ban bump stocks, prohibit the sale or transfer of high-capacity magazine clips, eliminate the private ownership of assault-type weapons, and require universal background checks for all purchasers. The time for action is now. We can-not wait. Congress should come to-gether and address the real problem, which is lax gun safety laws, and should pass commonsense gun safety measures to protect all Americans. Let’s not wait for the next mass shoot-ing, when we send our thoughts and prayers to victims and then stand by and pretend we are helpless and power-less to prevent another tragedy. Let’s take action now. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. P

TAX REFORM Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise once again today to talk about how we are working to reform our outdated Tax Code and to provide much needed tax relief to our Nation’s small busi-nesses and to hard-working families and ranchers. We are working to not only provide hard-working taxpayers with tax relief but also to strengthen our economy and to stimulate job cre-ation. Along with the regulatory relief we have already provided and are working to continue to provide, this tax relief is all about a growing economy, more jobs, and higher wages for hard-work-ing Americans and then making sure that they not only keep more of their earnings after tax but that they see growing wages due to a stronger econ-omy that is so important after the last decade of stagnant wages and income. It is important to understand that this tax relief is both. It is absolutely about lowering the tax burden, but it is also about moving wages and incomes high-er. That is the rising tide that lifts all boats in our country. Today, the House of Representatives passed a budget resolution that the Senate sent them last week, so now we have completed the first step in terms of enacting pro-growth tax reform that, as I said, will provide tax relief to millions of middle-class families who have been struggling to get ahead over the past decade. Today, I want to focus on how our tax proposal will reduce the tax burden on small businesses. Small businesses make up 96 percent of all employers in my State and over 90 percent of the businesses in the country. Over 90 per-cent of the businesses in this country are small businesses. Earlier this week, we had a very pro-ductive meeting with the President to talk about our priorities for tax relief, and I specifically highlighted to him the importance of ensuring that tax re-form works for our small businesses. When you talk about small businesses, you are talking about farmers and ranchers. As I said, 90 percent of all the businesses in this country are small businesses. So we are working with the administration and with the House to enact tax reforms that will enable American families to keep more of their hard-earned money and, as I said, empower our small businesses to invest and grow. Our effort is about growing our econ-omy and regaining our economic com-petitiveness in a global economy. Our Tax Code needs to ensure that our small business owners and entre-preneurs can compete in that global economy. Small businesses, as I said, are the engine that drives our economy. They are the backbone of our economy. Small businesses create more jobs and employ more people than major cor-porations. They are the heart and soul of Main Streets across America. These businesses earn the majority of all business income in the United States and employ over half the private sector workforce in 49 out of 50 States. They employ over half of the private sector workforce in 49 of our 50 States. Over the past month, I have hosted tax reform roundtables across North Dakota to hear directly from our job creators—from our State’s small busi-nesses, from our ag leaders, from our farmers, and from our ranchers. What are their priorities when we talk about tax relief and tax reform? Our tax blueprint supports those small businesses throughout the coun-try by promoting job creation, eco-nomic growth, and, as I said earlier, global competitiveness. We propose to do this in a number of ways, but the biggest and most impactful thing is that we are lowering the tax burden. It needs to be tax relief. Right now, for our small businesses, the marginal tax rate can reach as high as 44.6 percent. Think about that. Al-most half of their income is going to Federal income tax. That is nearly twice the average rate of the rest of the industrialized world. So here we are trying to compete with that high tax rate—almost double compared to the average rate of the rest of the in-dustrialized world. By reducing the maximum tax rate for sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations to 25 percent, we are creating greater economic growth and opportunity as small businesses re-invest in their businesses, in their em-ployees, in their communities, and gen-erate job growth. Additionally, many small businesses, including farmers and ranchers, do not have access to the equity they need to operate, instead relying heavily on debt financing to fund their businesses. They go to the bank and borrow. This is particularly true for new and begin-ning enterprises, including new startups in technology—not just farm-ing and ranching and traditional busi-nesses but businesses across the board. Our Tax Code needs to incentivize our Nation’s entrepreneurs to start their business, and we need to make sure they can get access to capital. They need to be able to get access to that capital, but when they do, by and large, they are going to the bank and borrowing. That means they have to pay interest on that debt. So it is very important for small businesses that the interest on that debt be deductible. That is a huge cost, particularly for our farmers and ranchers. They don’t have opportunities to float equity. They don’t raise equity for their farm-ing operation when they need to buy a tractor or a combine or you name it. They have to go to the bank and bor-row. So the deductibility of that interest expense to them is absolutely vital in their interests. That is true with small businesses across the board. When you look at small businesses in your com-munity, they go to the bank and they borrow, and that interest cost is a big part of their business expense. They need to be able to continue to deduct it. In the framework that we have pro-posed, another very important issue is being able to expense investments. If you really want to trigger growth, you encourage that investment. So the tax reform framework or proposal that we have put forward allows, in the first 5 years, full expensing of new invest-ments. That is very stimulative to our economy. It is very pro-growth. The other piece that I think is very important here is that we keep the sec-tion 179 expensing longer term. I think,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6842 October 26, 2017 
as we proposed it now, we would have expensing in the first 5 years—full ex-pensing. That is great. That is, as I say, stimulative to the economy. But beyond that, then we need to make sure that section 179 expensing is there so that small businesses, farmers, ranchers, and others will know that they are going to continue to be able to expense their investment in new plants and new equipment. That is what keeps those small businesses growing. That is what keeps them hiring more people. That is what creates more jobs, and that is what pushes wages and income higher. Also, we need to simplify and stream-line the Tax Code. Right now, the Tax Code is nearly 70,000 pages long—talk about being difficult and complex. Americans, right now, currently spend 6 billion hours a year complying with that Tax Code. That is ridiculous. Can you imagine 6 billion hours a year just to figure out how to pay your taxes? So here is somebody who wants to pay their taxes. They spend all that time and all that effort just to figure out how much they have to pay. Obviously, we can do a lot better than that. Our goal through tax reform is to allow the vast majority of Americans to file their tax return on a single sim-ple page. I will mention that again. I think it is important. Our goal is for the vast majority of Americans, in es-sence, to file their tax return on one page and to make it easier to pay your taxes, to figure out what you owe, and to take away all that stress and all that difficulty in just trying to pay your taxes. Many economists agree that high business taxes reduce wages to work-ers, raise costs for consumers, and re-duces returns on retirement savings. Maintaining these high tax rates do nothing to improve the fairness of our system. They only punish everyday, hard-working, tax-paying citizens and reduce economic opportunity in Amer-ica. I will conclude on the same point that I started with, and that is by say-ing that there are two objectives here. It is not just to simplify and reduce the tax burden, so that people have more of their earnings in their pocket after paying taxes, but the other is to make sure they earn more and that we move wages and income higher. If you look at the growth rate in our economy over the last decade, it has struggled, in es-sence, to get to 2 percent. But compare that to the period from World War II to the present. Over that longer period, we averaged 3.3 percent. We want to get that growth rate back up. We started to get that growth rate back up by reducing the regulatory burden. Over the course of this year, the administration and this Congress have done a lot to reduce the regu-latory burden. Our growth rate has ticked up in the most recent month to 3.1 percent, the highest it has been in a long time. So what we want to do is to combine that regulatory relief and tax relief and get that higher growth rate. We also want to add an infrastructure package. When you put those things to-gether, what do you get? You get more jobs, higher wages, higher income, and a higher standard of living for hard- working American citizens across this great Nation. That is the objective. That is what we are trying to do. We all need to work together, and our goal is to get that done before the end of the year. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maryland.

ROHINGYA HUMANITARIAN CRISIS Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate Foreign Rela-tions Committee held a hearing on an issue that I consider one of the great-est moral tests of our time in the con-duct of U.S. foreign policy—the situa-tion in Burma, where the Burmese military is committing ethnic cleans-ing and is perpetrating atrocities. We have a humanitarian crisis. We have perpetrators who expect impunity and a situation, under the watch of the international community and the Trump administration, that is allowing for the perpetration of atrocities. Ethnic cleansing is defined by the United Nations Commission of Experts as ‘‘rendering an area ethnically ho-mogenous by using force or intimida-tion to remove persons of given groups from an area.’’ Half of the population of the Rohingya in Burma have left— 600,000 people out of 1.2 million. I might add that, of those who remain, many are dislocated. There has been a sys-tematic burning of their villages. This didn’t just start. It has been a cam-paign that has gone on for a long pe-riod of time, since a 1982 law that de-nies the Rohingya citizenship, even though they have been residents for generations. The Rohingya are denied freedom of movement. They are denied freedom of education. They are denied healthcare. This has been a systematic effort to de-stroy an ethnic community. We have seen this happen far too long in too many places around the world. Once again, we see this happening today in Burma. Once again, this is the expectation: Well, it is far away; we will just let it go along. The Senate should be outraged about what is happening. We need to see the international community come to-gether and say: No, we will not let this continue. We will hold accountable those who are responsible for these ac-tions, we will provide humanitarian need immediately, and we will stop this type of conduct in a civilized soci-ety. This just cannot occur. In fact, I think what is transpiring in the Rakhine State today is genocide. I know there will be some discussion about whether it is genocide or not based upon technical definitions. Yet what we see in Burma today clearly meets the definition of ‘‘deliberately inflicting on a group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.’’ That is what is happening in Burma, and that is genocide. The Burmese military is clearly try-ing to destroy the Rohingya popu-lation. For decades, the Burmese Gov-ernment has systemically repressed the Rohingya people. This is a fact, and they have deliberately failed to inte-grate the population into the general population. As the U.N. High Commis-sioner for Human Rights correctly stated, the ‘‘decades of persistent and systematic human rights violations . . . have almost certainly contribute[d] to the nurturing of vio-lent extremism, with everyone ulti-mately losing.’’ They complain about extremism. Yet they are creating it. In my opinion, we are witnessing a military-sponsored ethnic cleansing campaign on the Rohingya, and it will take significant engagement from the international community, at the high-est levels and in partnership with the Burmese civilian government, to ad-dress and to hold the perpetrators ac-countable for these horrific acts. Seventy-five years ago, the world and the United States could have claimed ignorance or lack of information as an excuse for inaction in the face of crimes against humanity, genocide, and barbarism. Today, we have no ex-cuse. Unfortunately, the Rohingya crisis is not the only vexing challenge Burma faces. The Burmese military continues to hold significant influence in politics and in the economy. The peace process, which sought to end a longstanding civil war in the country, has stalled. There are significant reports of human rights issues such as human traf-ficking, free speech infringement, and political repression. The military con-trol Burma today. That is unaccept-able, and that is why we imposed sanc-tions, because of military control. Sanction relief was given for what? So that people could be ethnically cleansed? I was pleased to hear State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi committed to imple-menting all of Kofi Annan’s Rakhine State recommendations and to ensure that the Rohingya, who have fled in the face of brutal military repression, have a right to return to their homes. However, she must continue to make this a top priority and work with the international community to provide both the safety of the Rohingya left in Burma and those who want to come home. It is going to be difficult since their villages have been destroyed. Are they going to live in camps? Will they have protection? Will they be safe? If the past is any indication, we have real challenges ahead of us. Although I would count myself among those who have been dis-appointed with the civilian authorities and think they should have been more vocal, I am keenly aware of the real limits of their power and ability to

govern under the current Burmese Con-stitution and the military’s control of a large portion of Burma’s economy. We have a challenge on our hands in Burma, and we need to be engaged. But the civilian leadership must take re-sponsibility and must speak out. Too often, the international community has done too little, waited too long, or been caught unprepared by events that should not have surprised us. We con-tinue to forget the lessons of the past and fail to live up to the post-Holo-caust pledge of ‘‘never again.’’ Ignoring the genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity that continue to rage around the world sends a message to the global community that atrocity crimes are tolerable. We must respond robustly to the crisis unfolding in Burma because it is the right thing to do and because it is in our national in-terest to do so. The United Nations is calling the military campaign ‘‘a textbook exam-ple of ethnic cleansing’’ against Rohingya Muslims. From credible human rights organizations and news-papers, there are consistent accounts of widespread extrajudicial killings, arson, rape, and other atrocities. At least 288 villages have been decimated, according to Human Rights Watch, which has used satellite imagery as evidence of the devastation caused by the so-called ‘‘clearance operations.’’ These current attacks on the Rohingya follow decades of state-led persecution and dehumanization. Gov-ernment efforts to deny Rohingya citi-zenship rights, to restrict their free-dom of movement and the practice of their faith, and to deny their basic human rights have all been identified as precursors to a genocide. The U.N. Office of the High Commis-sioner for Human Rights found that the attacks were executed in a well-orga-nized, coordinated, and systematic manner by the Myanmar Security Forces, often supported by the armed Rakhine Buddhists. They have de-scribed the attacks as a ‘‘cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return.’’ There were also appalling acts of sex-ual violence, which clearly amount to crimes against humanity and/or acts of genocide that must not be forgotten. Women and girls, some as young as 5, were raped by men in uniform in front of their families. U.N. and other health workers said that after this most re-cent August 2017 military crackdown, they treated dozens of Rohingya women and girls who escaped to Ban-gladesh for injuries consistent with violent sexual attacks. One woman told Human Rights Watch that she and four other women were taken to a hut, slashed with knives, and sexually assaulted. The sol-diers then set the hut on fire. She was the only one to escape alive. Another woman who was raped still has injuries from the machete attack and beatings that accompanied the rape and said she barely managed to escape from a burn-ing house. I also want to draw attention to the needs of the survivors, their families, and communities. There is an acute lack of healthcare available to the sur-vivors, including reproductive health, psychosocial, and other critical serv-ices. Seventy-five years ago, the world— and the United States—could have said they did not know what is happening. Today we do. Today we have no excuse. Instead, the international community must hold the perpetrators account-able. In addition, to date, no real progress has been made either holding perpetrators of serious violations ac-countable or in addressing the root causes underlying the situation in Burma. Therefore, there is an urgent need to act. The strong statements by Ambas-sador Haley and last month by the Vice President must be followed up with ac-tion. The administration should lead efforts for action in the Security Coun-cil. The Security Council should insist that persons responsible for grave abuses be held accountable for their crimes. It also should press the Bur-mese authority to cooperate with the U.N. factfinding mission established by the United Nations Human Rights Council and grant unfettered access to its staff to Burma, including the Rakhine State. We need to know what is happening on the ground. We need to know that in order to protect people and to get the evidence necessary to hold the per-petrators accountable. The Council should send a clear message that it stands ready to take additional steps to ensure justice, including through the International Criminal Court, and urge member states to pursue other mechanisms that might provide justice for recent abuses. I should also add that Bangladesh de-serves credit for keeping its borders open to the influx of refugees—600,000 have fled to Bangladesh, and they kept their borders open. Bangladesh has been one of the few bright spots in the current crisis and should continue to honor its promise to build shelters for new arrivals, accelerate humanitarian assistance, and provide the needed medical service for this traumatized group. I also believe the United States needs to reevaluate our policy and approach to Burma. We need to have a policy in regard to Burma that we understand, that addresses these human rights vio-lations, that reevaluates our approach for our relationship with the Burmese military, and that relooks at how to best use sanctions as a way to seek ad-ditional leverage with the Burmese Government and military. I am working with a number of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, on legislation to seek to clarify U.S. policy and to address some of these issues. As the President prepares for his up-coming trip to the ASEAN Summit in the region, Congress will be watching closely to see if he makes Burma and human rights a top priority during this trip and to see what he and his admin-istration choose to undertake in the coming days to address the tragedy un-folding in Rakhine State. With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FRANKEN.

SOMALIA TERRORIST ATTACK Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the recent terrorist at-tack in Somalia. On October 14, a truck filled with ex-plosives detonated in a crowded dis-trict in Mogadishu—Somalia’s capital. The blast was especially devastating because the truck blew up next to a fuel tanker, causing a massive fireball and leveling structures, including the nearby Safari Hotel, which collapsed and trapped many people under its rub-ble. According to Somali authorities, the target of the attack may have been the city’s international airport which also houses many Embassies. This is the worst terrorist attack in Somalia’s history. Three hundred fifty- eight people were killed, hundreds have been injured, and dozens are still miss-ing. As a Minnesota Senator, I represent the largest Somali-American popu-lation in the Nation. For Minnesota, this wasn’t just a massive attack over-seas. It affected every one of my esti-mated 74,000 Somali-American con-stituents. Among those killed is Ahmed Eyow. He was from Bloomington, MN. He had attended Normandale Community Col-lege and Metropolitan State Univer-sity. He left behind his wife and three children. Another Somali-American who was killed in the blast was Mohamoud Elmi. He had lived in Ohio and had moved back to Somalia about 2 years ago. He was a young man with a bright future, working at the Ministry of Hu-manitarian Affairs and Disaster Man-agement in Somalia. There was Abukar Mohamed. He lived in Virginia before moving back to Somalia, where he worked in the Min-istry of Commerce and Industry. He was killed along with his wife, Shadiye Hassan. They left behind seven chil-dren who are between the ages of 3 and 20. Hundreds of others perished in that heinous attack. They all have their own stories. They left behind their wives, their husbands, their children, their friends, their parents. Somalia is one of the most, if not the most, fragile nations on Earth. It has been an incredibly difficult country to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6844 October 26, 2017 
govern ever since the civil war tore the country apart in 1991. It suffers from the massive displacement of people, hundreds of thousands of refugees, lack of sufficient public services, and war-ring factions and clans. To make mat-ters worse, a severe drought has rav-aged Somalia, leaving 6 million peo-ple—half of the nation’s population— facing food shortages. The combination of instability, lack of security, and shortage of goods and services has en-abled terrorist groups like al- Shabaab—widely believed to be the cul-prit in this attack—to gain a foothold in Somalia. We have to have a comprehensive strategy to help the people of Somalia. One component of that strategy is to help Somalis root out terrorism. The Government of Somalia has announced its intent to step up the fight against al-Shabaab. The United States has and will continue to aid those efforts, as will the African Union Mission in So-malia—a multinational peacekeeping force that is supported by the United States. At the same time, we have to erode and eliminate the conditions that en-able terrorist groups to thrive. That means redoubling our efforts to help stabilize fragile nations. That means supporting good governance, reducing extreme inequality, and helping marginalized, disenfranchised individ-uals who are preyed upon time and again by terrorist recruiters. It is more important than ever that we fully fund our international pro-grams that support these efforts, for humanitarian and security reasons. Unfortunately, the administration’s 2018 budget proposal does the opposite. It includes a 30-percent cut to pro-grams that seek to bring stability, rule of law, and humanitarian assistance to places that need it the most. The ad-ministration’s budget is making the world, and us, less safe. And I want to urge the President to rethink his ap-proach to foreign aid. My colleagues, Senators J
OHN M
CCAINand T IMKAINE, put it this way in a recent op-ed they coauthored, say-ing: 
Today, 80 percent of our assistance pro-vides relief and promotes stability in con-flict zones and states on the verge of col-lapse. There are U.S. Agency for Inter-national Development programs in many of the countries most plagued by terrorism, in-cluding Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Mali, Yemen and Somalia. We’re saving lives and creating partners to help address the in-stability that produces the threats our mili-tary risks life and limb to fight. 
In conclusion, I urge my colleagues and the American people to not forget about the terrible tragedy in Somalia. I urge everyone to keep Somali victims and other victims of terror acts throughout the world in their thoughts and prayers. The world needs to know that the United States will continue to support Somalia and other nations that are fighting those who are wreaking havoc on their nations. But we have to re-member that we will all be more suc-cessful when we combine military ef-forts with diplomatic and humani-tarian ones. While we cannot bring back those who perished, if we focus on rooting out the conditions that give rise to terrorism, we can have a shot at averting the next one. Thank you.

HEALTHCARE Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-dent, I rise today to urge my col-leagues to reauthorize Federal funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Children’s health insurance is not a partisan issue in this country, and it never has been. In 1997, the bill to create the Chil-dren’s Health Insurance Program passed with bipartisan support. It was introduced by the late Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat from Massachu-setts, and our colleague, Senator O
RRIN H
ATCH , Republican from Utah. This program has been a resounding success. Tens of millions of kids from all over the country have received access to preventive care, doctors’ visits, pre-scriptions, dental and vision coverage as a result of this act of Congress. Children’s healthcare is not a par-tisan issue in Nevada—the great State that I represent—either. Over the past 20 years, more than 60,000 of Nevada’s kids have benefited from our State CHIP program, Nevada Check Up. To-gether with the gains we have made due to the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, our rate of uninsured children has fall-en by half, making our program one of the biggest successes in the country. Today, 9 million children from low- income families nationwide, including 27,000 from Nevada, get their health in-surance through CHIP. If Congress con-tinues to do nothing, those 9 million children will not be able to go to a doc-tor for their annual checkup; 9 million children will not be able to afford their prescriptions. The parents of those 9 million children will have to wait until their child’s headache or infection or sore throat becomes an emergency be-fore taking them to the hospital. In 2008, the last time funding for CHIP was on the chopping block, Sen-ator Ted Kennedy said that the test of a great nation is in the way it treats its children. We are a great nation. We know how to take care of our kids. Americans understand that children’s healthcare is the kind of thing that should be beyond the reach of partisan politics. Governors from both parties, medical professionals, care providers, and advo-cates from across this Nation have al-ready called on Congress to do its job and move as quickly as possible to re-authorize this funding. Nevada’s Re-publican Governor, Brian Sandoval, is one of those voices. Republicans and Democrats alike know that kids can’t go to school, they can’t go to soccer practice, they can’t learn their times tables or their fractions, they can’t do things that healthy, happy kids like to do if they do not feel well. But don’t ask me why funding for CHIP is important. Listen to the voices of parents who lie awake at night, wor-ried that the cough they are hearing down the hall in their child’s room will not go away on its own. It is scary enough to have a sick child. No parent should have to live with the additional fear that they will not be able to afford the care their child needs. No parent should have to choose between treating a cough that has been getting worse and worse for weeks and paying next month’s rent. People across the coun-try are working every single day just to make ends meet. CHIP is their life-line. Just ask Lisa, a self-employed mom. Her children are able to see the whiteboard in math class because CHIP allowed her family to afford glasses. Ask Glenna, whose daughter broke her arm on the monkey bars when she was 4. Without CHIP, Glenna would have had to take out loans to pay off that medical bill. Hear from Vanessa about the excel-lent healthcare her daughter received after she contracted meningitis at age 12, which was paid for with health in-surance Vanessa purchased through CHIP. Vanessa says that CHIP is the reason her daughter is alive today. These are just three of the countless stories I have heard from people who just don’t know what they would do if private health insurance were the only option available to their family. Illness, injury, these things happen. All of us get sick sometimes, but going bankrupt trying to pay for your son or daughter’s medical treatment, that is not normal. That should not be some-thing we accept as part of our everyday lives. Every time I go home to Nevada, I hear the same things over and over from people I meet. They say to me: My medical bills are out of control. Please do something to help. We should be working night and day around the clock to fix our healthcare system and relieve the burden of healthcare costs on working people. Allowing funding for CHIP to expire, allowing State governments to go bankrupt, allowing rural hospitals and our community medical centers to shut their doors and go out of business, this is not what the American people sent us here to do. We are the representa-tives of this great Nation, and it is time to act like it and stop playing pol-itics with children’s health. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TRIBUTE TO JIM M CCLOUGHAN Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, today I wish to reflect on Veterans Day and the debt of gratitude each of us owes those who are willing to serve our country in our Armed Forces. Each year I have the honor of attend-ing Veterans Day events across Michi-gan. At each parade, commemoration, and solemn ceremony, I am struck by the profound patriotism of our vet-erans, but also their deep humility and lasting dedication to serving others. One amazing example of this is Jim McCloughan of South Haven. In May of 1969, he was 23 years old and far from home, serving as a medic in Vietnam after being drafted into the Army. The orders were to attack Nui Yon Hill. However, Private First Class McCloughan and his company were sur-rounded by more than 2,000 enemy fighters. Over 2 days of battle, Private First Class McCloughan put himself in danger time and again in order to res-cue his fallen brothers. His head and arm were bloodied by shrapnel and small-arms fire; yet he re-fused to stop. When the battle was over, he had saved the lives of 10 mem-bers of his company. Private First Class McCloughan re-ceived the Combat Medical Badge, two Purple Hearts, two Bronze Stars with ‘‘V’’ device for valor, and the U.S. Army Valorous Unit Citation, among other awards. He was a hero in every sense of the word. However, he re-mained focused on only one thing: how he could best serve others. That is just what he did. Jim McCloughan returned home and taught and coached at South Haven High School until retiring in 2008. That might have been where his story ended had it not been for his one-time pla-toon leader, LT Randall J. Clark. Lieutenant Clark never forgot about Private First Class McCloughan’s her-oism and worked tirelessly to get him the recognition he had earned. In 2016, I passed a bill to make Private First Class McCloughan eligible for our Na-tion’s highest military honor. In July, I was honored to be at the White House as Private First Class McCloughan was finally awarded the Medal of Honor by President Donald Trump. Jim McCloughan’s story is extraor-dinary, but he is not alone. Across our Nation—and throughout our history— people of common backgrounds and un-common courage have put their lives on the line in defense of our Nation. Time and again, these brave men and women have come home only to con-tinue serving in our schools, churches, elected offices, and civic organizations. Veterans like Jim owe us nothing and keep giving us everything. It is our solemn duty to keep our promises to them. Like Lieutenant Clark, we must continue working to provide them all that they have earned, whether it is healthcare, education, the chance at a good job, or the Medal of Honor. ‘‘I’m humbled, very humbled,’’ Jim McCloughan said about receiving his award. ‘‘And, of course—as many indi-viduals who are blessed to receive something like this—I’m receiving it for all of my men.’’ The spirit of service lives on in Jim McCloughan, in Lieutenant Clark, and in our veterans in Michigan and across this Nation. On this Veterans Day, we remember them, we thank them, and we renew our commitment to serving them. Thank you.

HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES 
SERGEANT PHILIP J . IYOTTE  
Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President, today I wish to recognize the courage and bravery of a fallen soldier, SGT Philip J. Iyotte of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. After 66 long years of waiting, Sergeant Iyotte’s remains are finally being laid to rest this week in his hometown of White River, SD. Sergeant Iyotte was born in White River on December 22, 1929. At just 18 years of age, Iyotte enlisted in the U.S. Army and was assigned to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, during the Ko-rean war. Upon being deployed overseas to Korea, Sergeant Iyotte’s battalion was one of the first sent into battle in 1950. During combat, Sergeant Iyotte was wounded, but returned to the battle-field in just 3 weeks. Months later, Sergeant Iyotte was detailed to Operation Thunderbolt on February 9, 1951. During this assign-ment, Sergeant Iyotte was captured and ultimately held at a prisoner-of- war camp in Changsong, where he passed away in 1951. However, his re-mains never made it home. Due to his many heroic efforts, Ser-geant Iyotte was awarded the Purple Heart Medal, the Combat Infantry-man’s Badge, the Prisoner of War Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Korean War Service Medal. Through the combined effort of Ser-geant Iyotte’s family, the U.S. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency and the Department of Veterans Affairs, Ser-geant Iyotte’s remains were positively identified earlier this year. This week, they return to his family so he can fi-nally be laid to rest near his home in South Dakota. With this, I welcome the opportunity to recognize the life of a fallen hero, SGT Philip James Iyotte, and com-memorate his return to White River, SD. He is finally home. f 
REMEMBERING RICHARD DUDMAN Mr. KING. Madam President, today we remember Richard Dudman, who passed away this August in Blue Hill, ME, at the age of 99. Throughout his long and illustrious career as a jour-nalist, Richard was never one to turn away from a good story, even if chasing it meant putting himself in danger. After college, Richard served his country in the Merchant Marine and the Navy before becoming a reporter for the Denver Post. In 1954, he moved to Washington, DC, to work for the St. Louis Port-Dispatch’s Washington bu-reau. In this position, he would cover the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the Watergate Scandal, as well as war and revolution all over the world. Richard will perhaps be most remem-bered for the time he spent in Cam-bodia as a prisoner of the Viet Cong. He and his colleagues were mistaken for CIA operatives and were kept captive for 40 long days. Towards the end of their captivity, once it had become clear that the journalists were not, in fact, working for the CIA, their captors began to refer to them not as prisoners of war, but as ‘‘travelers who lost their

way.’’ It was this experience that in-spired Richard to write the well-re-ceived ‘‘Forty Days with the Enemy.’’ Even after retiring, Richard did not stop reporting. In fact, on his last day at the Post-Dispatch in 1981 Richard raced out of his own retirement party to cover the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan. From his home in Ells-worth, ME, Richard continued to con-tribute to the Post-Dispatch and wrote editorials for the Bangor Daily News until 2012. In retirement, Richard and Helen, his wife of 69 years, were active and con-structive members of the Maine com-munity. Ellsworth City councilor Gary Fortier, a friend of the couple, de-scribed them as ‘‘true givers,’’ saying that ‘‘Ellsworth is a much better place because they have been part of it.’’ Richard and Helen received the Golden Eagle Award from the Boy Scouts of America in 2014 in recognition of their outstanding community service. Richard’s dedication to covering the news, regardless of how far from home it occurred, won him the prestigious George Polk Award in Journalism in 1993. In 2014, in recognition of that same dedication, Richard was inducted into the Maine Press Association Hall of Fame. I am pleased to be just one of many to remember and praise the many achievements of Richard’s ca-reer. The State of Maine was incredibly lucky to have him for the time that we did. He will be deeply missed.

ESTER of Delaware, to recognize Allen Chorman & Son, Inc., a longstanding Delaware business that has provided exemplary service to the State and its surrounding areas for 30 years. Since 1987, Allen Chorman & Son, Inc., has played a vital role in the suc-cess of one of Delaware’s key economic resources: farming. With the largest aerial spraying business in the State, Allen Chorman & Son, Inc., has as-sisted farmers in increasing crop effi-ciency via pesticide spraying and fer-tilizer spraying—sometimes in in-stances when ground conditions are not conducive to tractor services. Allen Chorman & Son, Inc., also provides critical mosquito spraying for both rural and urban areas. We are honored to extend our sincere thanks for their commitment and unyielding efforts to support one of our Nation’s most valu-able industries: agriculture. In addition to aiding farmers within Delaware and the surrounding areas with critical crop services, Allen Chorman & Son, Inc., has assisted in environmental preservation efforts, monitoring artificial reefs off of the Delaware and Maryland coasts, as well as spraying invasive plants that, if un-controlled, can choke area wetlands. We are truly honored to extend our ap-preciation for everything the business has accomplished. We wholeheartedly congratulate the many staff members past and present of Allen Chorman & Son, Inc., on 30 years of service to the State of Dela-ware and surrounding areas. Your qual-ity of service and continued care for our farms and environment set an ex-emplary standard of service for many others to follow. We wish you contin-ued growth and success.∑ f

The values of hard work and giving back to their community have always been a part of the King family. Cath-erine, Jackie, Donna, and the entire family are known throughout the State of Delaware for their generosity and support of local agricultural programs, such as the 4–H. The Kings are visible examples of serving others, as well as sowing seeds of success for the future. We are truly grateful for all they have done to inspire business growth and de-velopment, as well as preparing future generations for success in farming. We wholeheartedly congratulate King Crop Insurance, Inc., on 50 years of service to the State of Delaware and surrounding areas. Your quality of service and continued care for our farming community serves as a won-derful example for many others. We wish everyone the best.∑

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL GARY L. SAYLER ∑Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, today, together with my colleague Sen-ator J
IMRISCH, I wish to recognize the service of MG Gary L. Sayler as he re-tires from leading the Idaho National Guard this month. With more than 40 years of his distin-guished 45-year military career dedi-cated to the Idaho National Guard, Major General Sayler has served Idaho in a variety of leadership capacities, including 7 years as Idaho’s adjutant general. Under Major General Sayler’s direction as commander, the 124th Fighter Wing played vital roles in nu-merous overseas missions, including Operation Provide Comfort in 1994, Op-eration Allied Force in 1999, and Oper-ation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 and 2004. He subsequently served as assistant ad-jutant general from 2004 to 2010 before being appointed as adjutant general for the Idaho National Guard in 2010, dur-ing the fighter wing’s ongoing missions in the Middle East in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Free-dom, Operation Inherent Resolve, and Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. The 124th Fighter Wing has received numer-ous accolades under his steady guid-ance. These include the prestigious Spaatz Trophy in 2016 and again in 2017; the Governor’s Outstanding Unit Award; and the U.S. Air Force Out-standing Unit Award. Major General Sayler has built on his extensive experience to lead with prac-tical knowledge. His educational back-ground includes a bachelor of science in history and education at North Da-kota State University in 1971 and later courses at the Air Command and Staff College, Weapons School, and Air War College. Major General Sayler began his first assignment in the U.S. Air Force in Thailand, flying combat mis-sions in Southeast Asia before joining the Idaho Air National Guard in 1977 as a weapons systems officer for the 124th Tactical Reconnaissance Group. With a master navigator rating, he has exten-sive experience flying multiple air-crafts and has logged more than 4,100 flight hours. These include 392 combat hours that also account for his combat missions flying the F4–G over Iraq dur-ing Operations Southern Watch and Provide Comfort. His promotions and list of major awards and decorations that he has earned for his outstanding service are extensive and include the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Serv-ice Medal, and the Air Medal with sil-ver oakleaf cluster. Based on these accomplishments, Major General Sayler has provided rea-soned and experienced council as we have worked together to address the needs of the Idaho National Guard, in-cluding protecting and advancing the flying mission at Gowen Field as an ex-emplary force within the National Guard for generations to come. While visionary in his goals for the Idaho Na-tional Guard, a hallmark of Major Gen-eral Sayler’s leadership has been his high regard for the servicemembers he leads and their families. In addition to the attention and support he has de-voted to Idaho guardsmen and their families, Major General Sayler has also been instrumental in forging enduring relationships with the local commu-nities and Native Tribes undergirding Gowen Field. These bonds will likely propel the Idaho National Guard and Idaho communities forward for years to come.

TRIBUTE TO NORM STEADMAN ∑Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, today I wish to honor Norm Steadman for his longtime, dedicated service as mayor of Weippe, ID. Weippe was incorporated in 1964, but its roots go much further back. The Weippe Prairie is known to have been inhabited by the Nez Perce Indians. The city notes that it was not far from the present townsite in 1805 that Lewis and Clark had their first encounter with the Nez Perce Indians. This beau-tiful and strong community is nestled among many recreation opportunities, including historic trails, fishing, hunt-ing, skiing, snowmobiling, and all-ter-rain vehicle resources. Over the years, the community has seen its share of booms and busts. It has been touched by the fur trade, gold rush, the Homestead Act, and the log-ging industry. The town’s current pop-ulation of approximately 400 faces many of the challenges experienced by rural western towns with an enduring commitment to their community. Serving as mayor for a remarkable nearly 50 years following his initial ap-pointment to the position in 1968, Mayor Steadman has led through con-siderable growing pains with a steady hand and commitment to his commu-nity that befit his name. A deep desire to help others and a sense of responsi-bility to lead his community are clear characteristics of Mayor Steadman’s. His decades of leadership and working to overcome challenges with limited resources are commendable. Thank you, Mayor Steadman, for your nearly 50 years of dedicated service. You are truly leading by example by continu-ously stepping up to assist.∑

TRIBUTE TO STEVE FOURNIER ∑Mr. DAINES. Madam President, I have the distinct honor of recognizing Steve Fournier of Butte, a tireless ad-vocate for the most vulnerable Mon-tanans. Steve is known by his peers for his dedication, compassion, and integ-rity working to help the homeless. For nearly 16 years, Steve has helped Montanans find housing stability through his work as a case manager and service advocate for locally admin-istered housing programs. When the rescue mission served as the emergency housing alternative for the Butte area after it closed earlier this year, Steve helped 22 households find a safe and warm place to stay. His efforts have helped many of his neighbors in south-west Montana overcome crisis situa-tions and transition to a more hopeful path. Steve’s demonstrated commitment to assisting others is a genuine reflec-tion of uncommon moral stamina. The Treasure State is humbled and blessed to have people like Mr. Fournier call Montana home. Thank you, Steve, for repeatedly finding a refuge in times of trouble.∑ f 
75th ANNIVERSARY OF THE SCHWAN’S COMPANY STILWELL FOOD PRODUCTION FACILITY ∑Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am pleased to recognize the Schwan’s Com-pany on the 75th anniversary of their Stilwell food production facility. This is a significant milestone for Schwan’s and its employees, but also for Adair County and the entire State of Okla-homa. Throughout their 75 years, Schwan’s has been a committed com-munity partner, hiring over 300 resi-dents and supporting hunger relief and youth activities. The food production facility in Stilwell, originally called the Stilwell Canning Company, first opened in 1942 when World War II drove up the de-mand for canned items. The company has demonstrated a strong commit-ment to excellence, first expanding in 1999, when it became the largest frozen dessert production plant in the coun-try. After being acquired by Schwan’s Company in 2003, they have continued to invest in the plant and its employ-ees, putting the facility on the leading edge of pie production in the country. Today the plant is a 610,000-square-foot state-of-of-the-art facility that em-ploys about 300 people. Congratulations on your 75th anni-versary, and I look forward to seeing Schwan’s continue to make a positive impact in Stilwell.∑

ENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 38 Whereas, Over the years, the Texas Legis-lature has approved resolutions officially ap-plying to the Congress of the United States to call a convention, under the terms of Arti-cle V of the Constitution of the United States, to offer various amendments to that Constitution; and Whereas, While no Article V amendatory convention has yet taken place thus far in American history, nevertheless, there is a very real possibility that one, or more than one, could be triggered at some point in the future; and Whereas, Regardless of their age, such past applications from Texas lawmakers remain alive and valid until such time as they are later formally rescinded; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the 85th Legislature of the State of Texas, Regular Session, 2017, hereby officially rescinds, repeals, revokes, cancels, voids, and nullifies any and all, applications from Texas legislators prior to the 85th Leg-islature, Regular Session, 2017, other than the application provided by H.C.R.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. D
URBIN , Ms. W ARREN , and Mr. M
URPHY ): S. 2028. A bill to provide for institu-tional risk-sharing in the Federal stu-dent loan programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions. Mr. REED. Mr. President, we all rec-ognize that a postsecondary education is required for most family-sustaining, middle-class jobs, and that an educated workforce is essential to a modern, productive economy. A report by the Georgetown University Center on Edu-cation and the Workforce found that college-level intensive business serv-ices have replaced manufacturing as the largest sector in the U.S. economy, and that while college-educated work-ers make up only 32 percent of the workforce, they now produce more than 50 percent of the Nation’s eco-nomic output, up from 13 percent in 1967. A college degree also pays off, as median annual earnings for bachelor’s degree holders were $23,000 higher com-pared to high school graduates in 2014. Yet just as there is growing recogni-tion that postsecondary education is indispensable in the modern economy, families are being required to shoulder growing debt burdens that threaten ac-cess to college. According to an analysis of student loan debt by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, between 2004 and 2014, there was an 89 percent increase in the number of student loan borrowers and a 77 percent increase in the average balance size. Today, over 40 million Americans have student loan debt. This is a growing drag on our econ-omy. As student loan debt has grown, young adults have put off buying homes or cars, starting a family, sav-ing for retirement, or launching new businesses. They have literally mort-gaged their economic future. We know that student loan borrowers are struggling. A recent Department of Education analysis of outcomes for student loan borrowers who began their studies in 1995–96 and 2003–04 found that only 38 percent of the 1995– 96 cohort had paid off their loans with-out default after 20 years, and only 24 percent after 12 years. For the 2003–04 cohort, only 20 percent had repaid their loans without defaulting after 12 years. Worse, 52 percent of students who at-tended for-profit institutions had de-faulted on a student loan within 12 years. Roughly, 8.5 million borrowers currently have a loan in default. We have seen the costs to students and taxpayers when institutions are not held accountable. Corthinian Col-leges and ITT are two examples of in-stitutions that failed their students while benefitting from Federal student aid. Their fraudulent business practices eventually led to their demise, but not before leaving their students and tax-payers on the hook for millions of dol-lars in student loan debt. We cannot wait until an institution is catastrophically failing its students before taking action. Institutions need greater financial incentives to act be-fore default rates rise. Simply put, we cannot tackle the student loan debt crisis without States and institutions stepping up and taking greater respon-sibility for college costs and student borrowing. That is why I am pleased to intro-duce the Protect Student Borrowers Act with Senators D
URBIN , W ARREN , and M
URPHY . Our legislation seeks to ensure there is more skin in the game when it comes to student loan debt by setting stronger market incentives for colleges and universities to provide better and more affordable education to students, which should in turn help put the brakes on rising student loan defaults. The Protect Student Borrowers Act would hold colleges and universities accountable for student loan defaults by requiring them to repay a percent-age of defaulted loans. Only institu-tions that have one-third or more of their students borrow would be in-cluded in the bill’s risk-sharing re-quirements based on their cohort de-fault rate. Risk-sharing requirements would kick in when the default rate ex-ceeds 15 percent. As the institution’s default rate rises, so too will the insti-tution’s risk-share payment. The Protect Student Borrowers Act also provides incentives for institu-tions to take proactive steps to ease student loan debt burdens and reduce default rates. Colleges and universities can reduce or eliminate their payments if they implement a comprehensive student loan management plan. The Secretary may waive or reduce the payments for institutions whose mis-sion is to serve low-income and minor-ity students, such as community col-leges, Historically Black Institutions, or Hispanic-Serving Institutions—pro-vided that they are making progress in their student loan management plans. The risk-sharing payments would be invested in helping struggling bor-rowers, preventing future default and delinquency, and increasing Pell Grants at institutions that enroll a high percentage of Pell Grant recipi-ents and have low default rates. With the stakes so high for students and taxpayers, it is only fair that insti-tutions bear some of the risk in the student loan program. We need to tackle student loan debt and college affordability from multiple angles. And we need all stakeholders in the system to do their part. With the Protect Student Borrowers Act, we are providing the incentives and resources for institutions to take more responsi-bility to address college affordability and student loan debt and improve stu-dent outcomes. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and look forward to working with them to include it and other key reforms in the upcoming re-authorization of the Higher Education Act. By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. COONS , and Mr. B LUMENTHAL ): S. 2029. A bill to establish a National and Community Service Administra-tion to carry out the national and vol-unteer service programs, to expand participation in such programs, and for other purposes, to the Committee on Finance. Mr. REED. Mr. President, as Ameri-cans, we take inspiration from those who have answered the call to serve, whether in defense of our Nation abroad or to strengthen our commu-nities at home. This willingness to make common cause with our fellow citizens and serve a purpose greater than ourselves is a hallmark of our Na-tion. We should ensure that every American who wants to serve has the opportunity to do so. To that end, I am introducing the America’s Call to Im-proving Opportunities Now (ACTION) for National Service Act with Senators C
OONS and B LUMENTHAL . Our legisla-tion calls for elevating the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) to a cabinet-level agency and supporting up to one million national service positions annually. Since 1994, over one million individ-uals have served through the AmeriCorps program. Additionally, roughly 245,000 seniors over the age of 55 volunteer annually through the Sen-ior Corps programs. These individuals have addressed critical community needs in education, economic develop-ment, health, and many other areas. They have come to their fellow citi-zens’ aid in times of national disaster, including thousands who have been de-ployed in the wake of Hurricanes Har-vey, Irma, and Maria. Unfortunately, we have not created the capacity to support all those who want to serve. Rhode Island has embraced service. Providence is one of the top AmeriCorps cities in the nation. Across our State, nearly 4,200 AmeriCorps and Senior Corps volunteers are helping students succeed in school, ensuring veterans get access to the services they need, supporting seniors in their com-munities, protecting the environment, and addressing other critical needs. With additional resources and support, Rhode Island volunteers could accom-plish so much more. We strive to honor those who serve. Even more importantly, we invest in the education and professional develop-ment of those who have sacrificed and given so much to our Nation. Devel-oping the talents of our most com-mitted citizens pays life-long divi-dends. Our investment in the GI Bill not only honors our service members, but also enriches our Nation. Simi-larly, the education awards for those who have served through CNCS pro-grams have economic impacts beyond the individuals who earn them. Just as we came together on a bipartisan basis to expand and enhance the GI Bill ben-efits, now is the time to increase the education award for those who serve at

home. The ACTION for National Serv-ice Act will ensure that national serv-ice volunteers who complete two full terms of service earn an education award equivalent to four years of in- State tuition at a public university. Those who are willing to serve should not have to carry a heavy burden of student loan debt to achieve their edu-cational goals. Today, as our communities face chal-lenges in a host of areas, we need more people to participate in national serv-ice, and we need more partners to sup-port them. As such, the ACTION for National Service Act will establish a National Service Foundation to en-courage private sector and philan-thropic investment in expanding na-tional service opportunities. All AmeriCorps members take a pledge to get things done for Ameri-cans, to make communities safer, smarter and healthier, and to bring us together. Today, I ask my colleagues to join us in pledging to ensure that all who want to answer the call to serve can do so by cosponsoring the ACTION for National Service Act.

TRIBUTE TO BIRMINGHAM’S CELEBRATION OF ALABAMA 200 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the City of Bir-mingham’s kick-off celebrations for ‘‘Alabama 200,’’ a three year campaign to commemorate the people and places of Alabama in recogni-tion of its 200 years of statehood. This week Birmingham launches its bicentennial theme, ‘‘I’m Coming Home’’, at the Alabama Theatre in downtown historic district. Alabama 200 offers the opportunity to look back at the state’s unique and diverse history. For the City of Birmingham, it’s a chance to highlight and remember contributions of the wonderful people from the City who have helped shape our great state and change this nation. I believe it is befitting that during the 2017 Magic City Classic football weekend that we pay special tribute to the outstanding contribu-tions of Birmingham’s musical luminaries. A few of Birmingham’s biggest musical gi-ants, include The Blind Boys of Alabama, Lio-nel Hampton and the amazing talent of The Temptations, comprised of Eddie Kendricks, Dennis Edwards, Paul Williams, and Melvin Franklin. Between these Birmingham men there are a total of eight Grammys, numerous White House performances and several Hall of Fame inductions. Through the course of their careers they became regarded as some of the best in their respective genres. Perhaps, the best known vocal group from Birmingham was The Temptations. Before The Temptations became one of Motown’s great-est singing groups they started out as a trio from the Magic City called The Cavaliers. They were led by childhood friends Eddie Kendrick and Paul Williams who grew up in the Birmingham neighborhood of Ensley. Today, The Temptations are world re-nowned and considered ambassadors of soul. During their career the group has sold 16 mil-lion LPs and scored 14 number one R&B sin-gles, including ‘My Girl’ and ‘Ain’t Too Proud to Beg’. They received three Grammys and were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Members of The Blind Boys of Alabama also had deep roots in the City of Birmingham. This talented group is a 5-time Grammy award-winning gospel group who first sang to-gether in 1939. In the seven decades since the Blind Boys of Alabama first performed, America has changed tremendously—wit-nessing everything from a world war to the civil rights movement. But through it all, the Blind Boys’ music has not only endured, but thrived, helping both to define the sound of the American south and to push it forward through the 20th century and well on into the 21st cen-tury. The Blind Boys of Alabama first sang to-gether in the school chorus at the Alabama In-stitute for the Negro Blind in Talladega, Ala-bama. The group was originally called the ‘‘Happyland Jubilee Singers’’ and its founding members were Clarence Fountain, Jimmy Car-ter, George Scott, Velma Bozman Traylor, Johnny Fields, Olice Thomas, and the only sighted member, J. T. Hutton. The Blind Boys first rose to fame in the seg-regated south, releasing their debut single, ‘‘I Can See Everybody’s Mother But Mine,’’ in 1948. Seventy years later the group continues to entertain crowds around the globe. Many do not know that great jazz musician Lionel Hampton also had his early beginnings in Birmingham, Alabama. Shortly after his birth in 1908 in Louisville, Kentucky, he and his mother moved to her hometown in Bir-mingham, AL. Lionel Hampton was a musical genius who mastered so many instruments and roles. He was a jazz vibraphonist, pianist, percussionist, bandleader and actor. Lionel Hampton’s rich mastery of the vibraphone made him one of the leading figures of the swing era. He was an extremely important figure in American music, not only as an entertainer and an im-provising musician in jazz, but also because his band helped usher in rock ’n’ roll. He performed on piano and drums and was one of the first musicians to play the vibra-phone in jazz. He also played on groundbreaking recordings with Louis Arm-strong, Benny Carter and Benny Goodman in the 1920’s and 30’s. The exceptional talent of Lionel Hampton, the Blind Boys of Alabama and the Tempta-tions has made the City of Birmingham proud. While these musical giants will be honored during Magic City Classic, the contributions of other Birmingham notables will also be cele-brated by the City during the three-year cam-paign leading up to Alabama’s 200 anniver-sary of statehood. Future Birmingham hon-orees will include: Dr. James Andrews, Dr. Richard Arrington, Jr., Charles Barkley, Wil-liam Bell, Sr., Bobby Bowden, Courtney Cox, Dr. Larry DeLucas, Fannie Flagg, Dr. Herschell Lee Hamilton, Emmylou Harris, Bo Jackson, Carl Lewis, Rebecca Luker, Dr. Charles McCallum, Patty McDonald, Dr. Mi-chael Saag, David Sea, Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, Dr. Selwyn Vickers, Dr. Michael McCracken and Odessa Woolfolk. Special rec-ognition to the illustrious Dr. Henry Panion III composer and professor of music at University of Alabama at Birmingham for his outstanding efforts in arranging, directing and performing the tributes to Birmingham’s musical giants during the Magic City Classic weekend. Alabama’s bicentennial celebration offers citizens and visitors of all ages the chance to share and explore our state’s history as we share our colorful past and imagine a more progressive future. I ask my colleagues to join me in recogni-tion of ‘‘Alabama 200’’—the three-year bicen-tennial campaign—and the very special role the people of Birmingham played in shaping this state and our nation. May the State of Alabama, the City of Birmingham and their rich traditions continue to grow and prosper for many more years to come. f 
CELEBRATING THE 150TH ANNI-VERSARY OF THE BIG SABLE LIGHTHOUSE 
HON. BILL HUIZENGA 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Big Sable Lighthouse. For a century and a half, the Big Sable Lighthouse has been lighting up the eastern shores of Lake Michigan. On No-vember 1, the people of Ludington will cele-brate this momentous occasion. In July 1866, Congress appropriated funds for a new lighthouse to be constructed along the shores of Lake Michigan’s Big Sable Point. Completed in 1867, the 112 foot yellow brick structure was later covered with steel plates to withstand the harsh elements of the lakeshore. After 100 years of service, the lighthouse was finally decommissioned in 1968—where-upon it fell into disrepair. Without upkeep, Big Sable was deemed unsalvageable by the U.S. Coast Guard in 1986. Thankfully, a few in-trepid businessmen positioned sandbags in front of the lighthouse and residence, shoring up the weathered seawall. These men would later found the Sable Points Lighthouse Keep-ers Association, whose efforts preserve and promote the now accessible tower. Today, the lighthouse has been completely restored and opens daily for visitors to climb. I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 150 years that Big Sable has been lighting the shores of Lake Michigan. I welcome them to make the two mile hike to Big Sable Point and see what West Michigan has to offer.

REMEMBERING ELIZABETH CHACE 
HON. DAVID N. CICILLINE 
OF RHODE ISLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Elizabeth Chace. Lilly, as most people knew her, travelled around the world, but her heart was never far from her friends and family in Rhode Island. Lilly is remembered for her cutting wit, her love of movies, and her fierce loyalty to those she loved. She was a devoted fan of the New England Patriots, the Boston Red Sox, and her puppy Mona. The loss of her distinctive laugh, contagious joy and incredible generosity of spirit has shaken our entire community. To honor her memory, her family is asking that anyone thinking of her practice a random act of kind-ness and sing at the top of your lungs, in your car, with the windows down. A moving testa-ment to a wonderful person.

COMMENDING THE PEOPLE OF DOUGLAS COUNTY AND THE DOUGLAS COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 
HON. DAVID SCOTT 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the people of Doug-las County and the Douglas County Board of Commissioners for designating October as Douglas County Behavioral Health Month. Millions of Americans have behavioral health challenges. Unfortunately, many go without needed behavioral health treatment. The goal of Behavioral Health Month is to ‘‘Stomp the Stigma’’, the negative attitudes and behaviors toward individuals with behav-ioral health challenges. Stigma can lead to lack of understanding by friends, family, and coworkers. It can also lead to bullying, harass-ment, or physical violence. As a result, many individuals are reluctant to seek behavioral health care, isolate themselves, or have feel-ings of shame and insecurity. This October, the Douglas County Board of Commissioners is uniting schools, religious or-ganizations, military and veterans’ organiza-tions, and healthcare and legal professionals. Together, Douglas County is working to in-crease awareness and understanding of chal-lenges, reduce stigma and discrimination, and promote accessible services for individuals with behavioral health challenges. Please join me in commending the people of Douglas County and the Douglas County Board of Commissioners for their efforts to in-crease awareness about behavioral health challenges and ‘‘Stomp the Stigma’’.

IN RECOGNITION OF PATRICIA AND PETER GORES 
HON. LOUISE McINTOSH SLAUGHTER 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Patricia and Peter Gores of Mumford, New York. They recently donated a more than 100-year-old clock which had been a center-piece in the Gores’ family home for more than 40 years. The clock was manufactured in New York State by the Self-Winding Clock Com-pany, built with casing made from Quarter Sawn Oak, and remains in good working con-dition to this day. This clock was formerly lo-cated in Rochester, New York, at the Claude Bragdon train station where it served as the New York Central Railroad’s Master Clock to ensure a consistent time among the clocks around the station. The donation of this clock will allow it to be proudly displayed in Roch-ester’s new train station. The Claude Bragdon station opened its doors in 1914 and was a paragon of design. This station was where our community bid farewell to local soldiers as they were sent to serve our nation. It was a gathering place for suffragettes organizing for the right to vote. It was also where our community welcomed dig-nitaries, including Presidents. This clock rep-resents that era and the importance rail travel has played in our nation’s history. While the Claude Bragdon station is no longer standing, Rochester opened the doors to its brand new train station this fall which borrows heavily from the design of the old sta-tion. The new state-of-the-art, ADA compliant station will dramatically improve service for the more than 130,000 passengers that utilize passenger rail in Upstate New York. Whether you’re a student traveling to Rochester to at-tend one of the great colleges or universities or an entrepreneur visiting the city for the first time, this Master Clock will stand as a re-minder of Rochester’s proud history. On behalf of the Rochester community, I want to thank Patricia and Peter Gores for their generous donation and commitment to returning the Master Clock to its former home. f 
HONORING CHASE KELSEN 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chase Kelsen for his attainment of the rank of Eagle Scout in Troop 614 of the Boy Scouts of America on the central coast of California. At the age of just 16, Chase represents a personification of our nation and its values. He has demonstrated this through his service as First Sergeant with the Civil Air Patrol’s Squadron 36 and his graduation from Non- Commissioned Officers School. These are dif-ficult tasks and are a testament to Chase’s fortitude and leadership capabilities. His sense of duty also goes beyond our nation’s borders. He has spent considerable time teaching sus-tainable farming techniques and building or-phanages abroad in places such as Mexico and Nicaragua. Chase’s tireless work and dedication to go far beyond what is expected of an Eagle Scout Service Project, the task required to be awarded the rank of Eagle Scout. His Eagle Project included building a crosstie and wash station for horses used in hippotherapy at the Pediatric Therapy Center in Aptos, California. During hippotherapy, the rider uses the move-ments of a horse as a type of physical ther-apy. With these new additions, the center will be better able to help children with disorders such as cerebral palsy develop greater pos-ture, coordination, and a stronger sense of control over their bodies. The crosstie and washroom took over eight hundred and sixty- five hours to construct and cost over $20,000. Chase was able to acquire the cost of the project solely through donations, an impres-sive feat at any age. Facilities like these are deeply needed in the central coast of Cali-fornia and each improvement or addition to existing facilities serves to make our commu-nity that much stronger. Through his efforts, Chase has produced a positive, tangible im-pact on the place he calls home. It is young women and men like Chase that will become leaders in our communities. His commitment to serving others and his sense of duty to our country and the world is some-thing that deserves the highest recognition and praise. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my col-leagues in the House join me in congratulating Chase Kelsen. f 
RECOGNIZING THE WEEK OF OCTO-BER 22ND, 2017 AS NATIONAL CHEMISTRY WEEK 
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Chemistry Week. As co-chair of the Congressional Chemistry Caucus, along with my friend Congressman Moolenaar, I am pleased to take this oppor-tunity to draw attention to the chemical sciences. This year marks the 30th anniver-sary of National Chemistry Week, an initiative of the American Chemical Society that high-lights the contributions that chemistry makes to science, education, and the economy. The theme of this year’s Chemistry Week is ‘‘Chemistry Rocks,’’ celebrating geochemistry, which is the study of the chemical makeup of rocks, gems, and minerals. Geochemists do the underlying science that drives our oil, gas, and mining industries, and they are active in diverse fields such as water quality, public health, space science, and materials research. I want to recognize the nation’s chemists for their service to the country and their critical role in the economy.

HONORING THE SAN BENITO COUN-TY LEAGUE OF UNITED LATIN AMERICAN CITIZENS 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the San Benito County League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) on the occasion of its thirty-year anniversary. For three decades, San Benito County LULAC has worked to advance civil and political rights and open economic opportunity to the Latino popu-lation of San Benito County. Founded in 1987, LULAC was the first organization whose pri-mary objective was the advancement of civil and political rights for the Latino community. Since its founding, San Benito County’s LULAC chapter has regularly mobilized its members to defend the rights of Latinos and to establish a forum for discussing community issues. They have made great progress in achieving these goals. At the core of LULAC’s mission is the belief that education is the foundation for the growth and success of the Latino community. San Be-nito County LULAC sponsors numerous edu-cational initiatives in support of its mission to advance the academic opportunities of the Latino community. One such initiative is the Young Adult Council. Since its formation in 1989, San Benito County LULAC’s Young

Adult Council has been instrumental in ad-vancing the achievements of Latino students across the county by providing scholarships to over 175 students. The Young Adult Council works to provide the same support to its stu-dent members enrolled in universities and higher learning institutions throughout the state of California. Similarly, San Benito Coun-ty LULAC’s Young Readers Program works to promote reading comprehension skills within the Latino community. San Benito County LULAC’s dedication to promoting educational success and opportunity helps make the American dream accessible to all. In addition to its educational initiatives, San Benito County LULAC also works to encour-age civic engagement among the Latino com-munity in the county. One example is their voter registration drive, which drives greater participation in local races and local politics. Encouraging political engagement also helps defend Latino voting rights. San Benito County LULAC provides the Latino community of San Benito County with a valuable platform to dis-cuss their needs and concerns. For three decades, San Benito County LULAC has stood as a beacon for a large por-tion of the Latino community in my district. The organization’s 30 years of work have been indispensable in making the American dream a reality for many people in my district. I would like to commend them for setting an example of community service in our district for 30 years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my col-leagues in the House to join me in congratu-lating the San Benito County League of United Latin American Citizens for 30 years of excel-lence and service.

REMEMBERING LILLY CHACE 
HON. MARK SANFORD 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Elizabeth ‘‘Lilly’’ Chace. She was a remarkable young woman from Providence, Rhode Island who I had the pleasure of know-ing over the whole of her life. She died on Oc-tober 12th of this year at the tender age of 28 and was buried today. I pause not only to re-member her life, but out of love and respect for her parents, Buff and Johnnie Chace. I also rise because it’s in these moments that we think about life and how we might live it more abundantly. How we might make each of our lives count. How we might be a bless-ing to others and make the most of our time here on earth. I think that the short life that Lilly lived offers insights into each of those areas and, for that reason, believe that a mo-ment of reflection is worthwhile. She did two things I want to do more of in my life. One, she did not idly watch it pass by. She lived it. She seized it. I remember years ago, upon the death of Malcolm Forbes, the front page read that ‘‘while alive, he lived.’’ I think that this would be a pretty good description of the way that Lilly seized life and the way that I’m inspired to do the same with an example like hers. In fact, Eleanor Roosevelt said ‘‘the purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience.’’ Indeed, Lilly walked across the glaciers of Patagonia, rode camels through the Moroccan deserts, and ventured into the Alaskan wilder-ness. I had not seen her much since she was a child, but by all accounts, she had more than an adventurer’s spirit and the merit badges to go with it. It has made me think about how I might add in living more richly the years I have before me. Two, she was all heart. I have on more than a few occasions tied myself in knots over-ana-lyzing some situation before me; but again by all accounts, this was not her nature. She lis-tened to that voice that we all have inside and ran with it. I think the old saying is ‘‘people don’t care about how much you know, until they know about how much you care.’’ As hu-mans, we ultimately respond to the heart in each other much more than the technicalities of debate talking points. In thinking about her death, I have considered more than a few times about how I might live with a bit more heart and passion the task that’s now before me in this chamber. And I think this idea would be worth a bit of focus and collective soul-searching, given the enormity of the issues that face this body. I point these things out not only because I believe they’re worth our shared examination and thought but because I wish so much I could be with the Chace family today in Provi-dence. That’s not possible due to this vote we’re taking on the budget, but I rise to honor Buff and Johnnie and to say farewell and God-speed to their daughter Lilly. f 
IN HONOR OF DENNY ZANE’S 70TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. JULIA BROWNLEY 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a true visionary leader and my dear friend, Denny Zane, on the momen-tous occasion of his 70th birthday. Over his career which spans more than four decades, Denny has been a tremendously effective and tireless advocate for the critical investments necessary to meet our region’s infrastructure and transportation needs that indispensably keep our communities and its residents mov-ing and thriving. Denny has been a true public servant with an unwavering commitment to serving others. He has served as a city councilmember and well-regarded mayor of the City of Santa Monica, as the director of the Coalition for Clean Air, as a local teacher, and perhaps his most profound impact has been made as the founder and executive director of Move LA. In conjunction with his 70th birthday, this year also marks the 10th anniversary of Move LA. The organization was founded to provide adequate funding sources to develop a clean, efficient, and robust transportation system for Los Angeles County. The formation and estab-lishment of Move LA was no easy task, but Denny provided the right vision and leadership to coalesce a cohort of influential and adept stakeholders from the business, labor, envi-ronmental, and political leadership from throughout Los Angeles. There are very few individuals in this world that could bring this movement together, but Denny did and did so successfully. Most recently, with extraordinary foresight and initiative, Denny led the campaign and was instrumental in the passage of Measure M, which will generate billions of dollars and one day erect the world’s most modern trans-portation system for Los Angeles. This ‘‘smart growth’’ will enhance the city’s global competi-tiveness, significantly increase the region’s economy, and improve air quality and traffic congestion as well as promote environmental sustainability. Additionally, through Denny’s unwavering passion and the powerful advocacy of his or-ganization, Los Angeles’ voters passed local measures that will raise $350 million per year to fund essential services and resources and housing opportunities for the county’s most vulnerable and homeless populations. Denny’s notable leadership and unfailing hard work has strengthened our community as a whole, and for that we owe him our ardent gratitude. For these reasons, it is with great enthu-siasm that I offer Denny my heartfelt apprecia-tion for his many years of remarkable service. I would also like to express my most sincere congratulations on the occasion of his 70th birthday. I am so happy to join his family, friends, and colleagues in celebrating this milestone with him. I wish him many more happy years to come. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF EMILY BUCKMAN’S SERVICE TO KEN-TUCKY’S SECOND DISTRICT 
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give my sincere thanks to Emily Buckman, who will be moving on from my office at the end of this week to serve at the United States Department of Agriculture. What is a loss for my office is a major gain for the administra-tion, and I wish her all the best. Emily grew up in Marion County, Kentucky, where her parents still operate their family’s farm. Emily began her Washington, D.C., ca-reer during a summer internship with my pred-ecessor. She came back to D.C. after grad-uating from Campbellsville University to intern for my office. She came on as staff in 2010 and has been promoted several times. Emily has been dedicated to the Second District of Kentucky ever since then, and her commit-ment to serving her fellow Kentuckians will be missed.

State owe a tremendous debt to Commis-sioner Merrill. She has been an excellent steward of the Agriculture Department, guiding our state through the economic recession of 2008 and a devastating drought in 2016—two of the greatest challenges our agriculture com-munity has faced. She has been a tireless supporter and advocate for farmers, pro-ducers, and foresters in New Hampshire. From dairy and produce to ornamental horti-culture and maple syrup, ours is an incredibly diverse state for agriculture and she has rep-resented everyone so well. Lorraine’s service as commissioner was only the latest in a remarkable career of serv-ice both to agriculture and her community. She has been a teacher, author, founding member of the New Hampshire Coalition for Sustaining Agriculture, director of the New England Dairy and Food Council, and chair of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Serv-ice Agency State Committee. She continues to own and run a dairy farm with her family in Stratham, New Hampshire, where they have been honored by the American Farmland Trust for their leadership in conservation and environmental management best practices.

HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Valley Screen of Mishawaka on receiving the Indiana Governor’s Half-Cen-tury Business Award. The Half-Century Business Award is a spe-cial recognition of a local company’s service to its employees, our community, and the State of Indiana. Fifty years of growth and success is an incredible accomplishment, and I ap-plaud the entire Valley Screen team for stay-ing at the cutting edge of innovation in a high-ly competitive world. Valley Screen employs more than 60 people in our community and provides quality serv-ices to some of northern Indiana’s key indus-tries. This local business is an exceptional ex-ample of the high-quality customer service, business ingenuity, and potential for growth that American entrepreneurs and workers strive to achieve. I am grateful for the good jobs Valley Screen continues to provide the hardworking Hoosiers in our community. I also want to thank Karen Barnett, Valley Screen’s president and CEO, for her excep-tional leadership and for providing so much of the vision, perseverance, and innovation that has contributed to the success of this busi-ness in Indiana and beyond. For the past 20 years, she has played a crucial role in building our state’s positive business climate. I am confident that with leaders like Karen, Indi-ana’s economy can continue to flourish. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Indiana’s 2nd Dis-trict, I want to thank Valley Screen and all its hardworking employees, past and present, for their commitment to innovation and service to the Hoosier community for 50 years. Con-gratulations to Valley Screen on a half-century of excellence. I am excited to see what the fu-ture holds for you and your customers. f

IN HONOR OF DANIEL CURRY 
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Daniel T. Curry, a con-stituent of mine who tragically passed away on September 6, 2017. Daniel was born in Green County in my district and later moved to my hometown of Bowling Green, where he was the director of the Kentucky Legal Aid Benefits Counseling Program. Daniel was a friend to everyone. As director of the Benefits Counseling Program, he helped countless Kentuckians receive their federal and state benefits. He worked with my office on several occasions, assisting with many casework inquiries that my office re-ceived. There was no constituent he would not try to help. In addition to his work at the Ken-tucky Legal Aid Benefits Counseling Program, he served as an adjunct professor at Western Kentucky University, served as a docent for Riverview at Hobson Grove, presented at the Bowling Green-Warren County Bar Associa-tion, was an advocate for elder abuse preven-tion, and participated in community theater. Daniel touched many lives in Bowling Green and the surrounding counties. I send my pray-ers to Daniel’s family and community during this time.

HIZBALLAH INTERNATIONAL FI-NANCING PREVENTION AMEND-MENTS ACT OF 2017 
SPEECH OF  
HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 25, 2017 Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3329, the Hizballah Inter-national Financing Prevention Amendments Act of2017. This is an important piece of legis-lation strengthening economic and financial sanctions on Hizballah and its enablers, and I am pleased to support it. Hizballah is an organization based in Leb-anon that plays a major role in regional ten-sions in the Middle East. Based on existing in-telligence, it is believed that Hizballah is sim-ply being used as a proxy by foreign govern-ments to fight against Israel and other western influences in the area. In order to prevent the situation from escalating, the first step is to prevent the group from being able to fund fur-ther military actions. H.R. 3329 would direct the President to apply sanctions that would freeze Hizballah’s assets, prevent fundraising, and prevent financial institutions from working with the group. Furthermore, this legislation would extend financial sanctions to any foreign entity that provides funding to the group. The bill would also authorize the proper congres-sional committees to create reports on Hizballah’s racketeering and international nar-cotics trafficking. This legislation requires the President to re-port valuable information to Congress regard-ing the relationships among Iran, other foreign countries, and the Hizballah organization. Opening up this line of communication will help Congress better decide how to apply fu-ture sanctions against these state sponsors of terrorism. With as many military bases as Georgia ac-commodates, I understand how conflict affects not only our nation, but also the young men and women who will be thrust into a needless international conflict. It is important that we take the necessary steps to prevent an esca-lation to prevent losing American lives in any conflict, which is why I support H.R. 3329. f 
HONORING MR. DAVID HARDT 
HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Deputy Fire Chief David Hardt upon his retirement from the Watertown Fire Department in Watertown, Connecticut after 32 years of service. Deputy Chief Hardt has been an instrumental leader in our state’s firefighting community, and his legacy will con-tribute to the work of future generations of fire-fighters. Deputy Chief Hardt first volunteered for the department in 1985, and in 1997, he became the Deputy Chief. Throughout his long tenure, his leadership skills and experience have been tremendous assets to the town. Deputy Chief Hardt has been willing to take on additional duties when necessary and to step up to over-see the department’s work in the Chief’s ab-sence. The Watertown Fire Department and sur-rounding communities have benefitted greatly from Deputy Chief Hardt’s work over the past decades. His work was critical to the opening of the Cheshire Fire School to train future gen-erations of firefighters. Never one to shy away from helping out his neighbors, Deputy Chief Hardt also served as a dispatcher for Naugatuck firefighters and as a fire marshal in Bethlehem and Morris. His dedication to help-ing others is an inspiration to all of us and

HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. L
AHOOD Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to recognize a critical organization that supports residents of Illinois’ 18th Congres-sional District, Prevent Child Abuse America, as they celebrate their 45th anniversary. In 1972, Donna J. Stone founded Prevent Child Abuse America in Chicago, Illinois. Over the years, Prevent Child Abuse America has been a leader in promoting healthy develop-ment of children through prevention of child abuse. While the organization has expanded to chapters in all 50 states, the mission of Pre-vent Child Abuse America has continued to re-main the same. Prevent Child Abuse America is committed to preventing the neglect and abuse of chil-dren across our nation. Their Healthy Families America program makes services easily ac-cessible to children across our country and al-lows Prevent Child Abuse America to reach nearly 100,000 families each year. With their state headquarters located in Springfield, Illi-nois, I am grateful for the services they pro-vide to families in the 18th District and across Illinois. I extend my sincere congratulations to Pre-vent Child Abuse America on their 45th Anni-versary, and I wish them much success as they continue to provide essential services to families, in Illinois and across our country, for years to come. IRAN BALLISTIC MISSILES AND INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS EN-FORCEMENT ACT SPEECH OF  
HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 25, 2017 Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1698, the Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforce-ment Act. This legislation confirms the United States’s mission to prevent Iran its developing their nuclear-capable ballistic missile program. H.R. 1698 requires the President to impose sanctions on the Iranian government, foreign actors or people who supply technology and material to contribute to the Iranian ballistic missile program, and any party who contrib-utes weapons or related material to Iran. This legislation also directs the President to inves-tigate violations of these sanctions either by Iran or foreign entities and report all violations to Congress. In taking these actions, H.R. 1698 recognizes the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 from 2015 and com-mits to enforcing it by authorizing investiga-tions of all ballistic missile tests to see if they are in violation of the resolution. The investigations that this bill authorizes will help us better understand and identify the banks, companies, governments and other for-eign entities that contribute in some way to the development of the Iranian ballistic missile program. It is crucially important that we take steps to recognize these key actors and pun-ish them with sanctions. It is for these reasons that I am pleased to support this legislation.

HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 25, 2017 Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 359, legisla-tion urging the European Union to designate Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist organiza-tion and increase international pressure on the organization. Hizballah has demonstrated its commitment as an organization to promoting fear, violence, and terror worldwide for decades through the murder of global citizens. Its 1983 attack on the U.S. Marine Compound in Beirut was the most deadly single-day attack on the United States Marine Corps since the battle of Iwo Jima in World War II. Our nation has con-demned Hizballah as a terrorist organization and leveraged significant financial sanctions against it, but we believe more can be accom-plished through international cooperation with our friends at the European Union. With this resolution, we urge the European Union to condemn Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist organization, rather than con-demning its military wing alone, and ask them to stand with us to fight terrorism internation-ally. With increased financial pressure and more active international policing, together we can end Hizballah’s terrorist activities and cre-ate a more peaceful and safer world. Co-operation between the European Union and the United States is crucial in the fight against transnational terrorism, and it is for this reason that I support this resolution.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Patricia Clark as she retires after more than five decades of service to the Federal Aviation Administration at the Patricia Clark Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center in Nashua. The people of the Granite State and throughout New England owe a debt of gratitude to Patty for ensuring the safety of pilots and fliers, as well as con-tinuing the efficiency of our transportation sys-tem. Further, it should be noted that Patty has maintained perfect attendance throughout her decades of service, never using vacation leave or a sick day. In 2013, during my first term in the U.S. House of Representatives, I was honored to have introduced legislation, H.R. 1092, that became law renaming the Nashua facility the ‘‘Patricia Clark Boston Air Route Traffic Con-trol Center.’’ Renaming this facility after Patty was the very least that could be done to honor her accomplishments to the air traffic control industry here in New England. I am honored to be able to recognize Patty once again on the occasion of her retirement from federal service.

CONGRATULATING COLLEGE WOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, A BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an outstanding school in my district that is being honored as a 2017 National Blue Ribbon School. It is a pleasure to congratulate College Wood Ele-mentary School in Carmel, Indiana in celebra-tion of this special occasion. The National Blue Ribbon designation, given by the United States Department of Education, is awarded to both public and private schools across our great nation. Started by President Reagan and given annually since 1982, the award celebrates great American schools that achieve very high learning standards or are making significant improvements in the aca-demic achievements of their students. In my district and across the country, the award rec-ognizes the great educators, students, and parents who have worked so hard to ensure our children reach their full potential and achieve academic success. For all of these reasons and many more, I am so proud that College Wood Elementary School is receiving this prestigious designa-tion. It is a wonderful acknowledgement of the school’s commitment to providing young Hoo-siers an exceptional education. While hun-dreds of schools nationwide were nominated, only 342 schools were designated as 2017 National Blue Ribbon Schools. Of the 342 schools, College Wood Elementary School was one of seven Indiana schools to receive recognition, making this recognition all the more impressive. All College Wood Elementary students are supported by a host of staff members in addi-tion to the classroom teacher. Because of this, students are able to received personalized in-struction in several subjects. College Wood El-ementary strives to challenge each and every student to reach their fullest potential. With the help of this dedicated staff, academic teams representing College Wood have consistently scored in the top twenty-five percent of partici-pating schools. Their hard work is deservedly rewarded with this Blue Ribbon Award. As an advocate for education and youth, I also want to acknowledge how important it is to our nation’s future to encourage and raise a new generation of Americans who have the skills and knowledge to succeed both in and out of the classroom. Students like those at College Wood Elementary School give me hope that we will accomplish this vital mission. Their outstanding work is an inspiration to stu-dents, educators, and parents across the na-tion. Once again, congratulations to College Wood Elementary School. I am very proud of you. COMMENDING DANIA E. RODRI-GUEZ FOR 20 YEARS OF SERVICE WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF STATE AND TERRITORIAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS HON. MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO 
OF GUAM  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Dania E. Rodriguez for her 20 years of service with the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Offi-cials (ASTSWMO). Dania has been serving in the capacity of Executive Director of the Association of State and Territorial Waste Management Officials in Washington, D.C. since July 2013. She pre-viously served as the Deputy Executive Direc-tor of ASTSWMO for six years. During her time at ASTSWMO, she served as the liaison between the states and numerous federal agencies to work on policy issues. Dania keeps the ASTSWMO running smoothly by providing support to the ASTSWMO staff and Board of Directors. She manages the day-to-day operations to include the association’s budget, cooperative agree-ments. Dania graduated from Hood College in Frederick, Maryland where she received a B.A. in Political Science. She also holds an Executive Certificate in Nonprofit Management from the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. She worked for the American Petroleum Institute before starting her career at ASTSWMO. Dania has an impressive record of experi-ence and expertise in technical, financial and policy development in environmental work. She holds comprehensive knowledge of state and territorial environmental programs. Dania has been a true friend and advocate of Guam and the region. She was the first Executive Director of ASTSWMO to directly collaborate with Guam and assist with the development of the first Zero Waste Conference held in Micronesia. She also played a vital role in making the first EPA Pacific Islands Environment Conference come to life for Guam, the CNMI and America Samoa. On behalf of the people of Guam, I com-mend Dania for her outstanding service to our community throughout her career.

OTTO WARMBIER NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR SANCTIONS ACT 
SPEECH OF  
HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 24, 2017 Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3898, the Otto Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions Act of 2017. This legislation imposes heavy eco-nomic sanctions on North Korea. These sanctions will signal to North Korea and its enablers that the United States con-demns North Korea’s current nuclear and long-range missile programs. Specifically, the bill would impose conditions and oversight of foreign banks that seek to open American ac-counts for any North Korean or any agent of North Korea. As United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley stated, ‘‘[c]ountless innocent men and women have died at the hands of North Korea, but the singular case of Otto Warmbier touches the American heart like no other.’’ In remem-brance of Otto Warmbier, this bill dem-onstrates to North Korea that its human rights violations and military actions are unaccept-able. North Korea’s nuclear and long-range missile programs have been a noted threat to our security for many years and its frequent missile testing in the past year demonstrates the even greater risk they now pose. By sup-porting H.R. 3898, we are showing North Korea that there are consequences to its pur-suit of nuclear warfare and we intend to in-crease economic pressure on it each time they show willingness to use force against us or our allies. We have a responsibility to do all that we can to protect American citizens. H.R. 3898 will discourage North Korea from further devel-oping their nuclear weapons program and take a much-needed step towards the goal of inter-national peace, and this is why I support this legislation. f

STRENGTHENING CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING AND CO-ORDINATION IN OUR PORTS ACT OF 2017 
SPEECH OF  
HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 24, 2017 Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3101, the Strengthening Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordi-nation in Our Ports Act of 2017. This legisla-tion would increase cybersecurity measures at ports. As we have seen in the last couple months, all sectors of our government are in danger of being compromised due to our outdated cy-bersecurity standards. This past June, the Port of Los Angeles and businesses were com-promised by hackers, shutting down essential structures of our economy. The security firm, Symantec, warned that hackers may have even gained access to parts of our energy grid. H.R. 3101 authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to more freely share information regarding the cybersecurity threats to our naval interests. As a part of this bill, the DHS would continuously assess current and future cybersecurity risks, seek input from the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, create guidelines to en-courage the reporting of cybersecurity risks, and implement recommendations from other agencies to enhance the security for emer-gency response agencies, law enforcement, ports, and our maritime border. The bill would also direct the Coast Guard to share informa-tion regarding port-specific vulnerabilities and enact security plans to prevent and respond to cyber threats. Because of today’s constant cy-bersecurity risks, it is imperative that we have proper contingency plans in place to respond to any threats that may appear. We must ac-tively take steps to ensure the safety and se-curity of our maritime infrastructure to better prepare ourselves for the threats of the 21st century. As a Representative of Atlanta, I was shocked to see how hackers were able to infil-trate Equifax and so easily compromise the privacy of millions of Americans. By being proactive, this body has the chance to prevent other similar cybersecurity attacks that would target our government and infrastructure. I have previously supported other cybersecurity- related legislation that would secure the integ-rity of our elections and now I believe that we should extend this security to other vital infra-structure, which is why I am pleased to sup-port H.R. 3101.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Quad Cities Student Hunger Drive for its long-time commitment to col-lecting food for those in need. This annual fundraising event promotes volunteerism, raises awareness for hunger, and collects food and monetary donations for River Bend Foodbank. The Quad Cities Student Hunger Drive is a local branch of the national Student Hunger Drive, and has been dedicated to collecting and donating food for the hungry for over 3 decades. In 2016 alone, a total of 378,461 pounds of food was collected through the combined efforts of 16 high schools from the Quad Cities and surrounding areas. Since 1986, the Student Hunger Drive has collected over 17 million pounds of food, and its efforts have provided 14 million meals for residents of the Quad Cities and surrounding communities in need. The 32nd annual Student Hunger Drive kicked off on October 2nd, with 17 schools in the area participating. I am proud there are such caring, determined youth in our community, and that our community schools’ staff and administrators have continued to stay committed to this important effort year after year. The generous and ambitious participants of the Student Hunger Drive make me especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-trict. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again for-mally recognize all who organize and con-tribute to the Quad Cities Student Hunger Drive for their outstanding efforts and accom-plishments.

This legislation works to ensure sta-bility in our nation’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) by requiring the Secretary to submit organizational changes for congres-sional approvaL Our government is built upon a balance of power; arrangement has helped sustain our country for hundreds of years and is one of the most fundamental properties of our nation. H.R. 4038 ensures oversight of the DHS to guarantee that an appropriate balance of power is maintained. The DHS, the third larg-est department in the federal government, has already absorbed the Immigration and Natu-ralization Service and reorganized three new agencies since its creation in 2002. If the Sec-retary of DHS has the power to make exten-sive changes, he/she should be held account-able for them and should be required to obtain approval from Congress. Furthermore, the current administration has been defined by unprecedented instability in the White House, with an extremely large turn-over rate in President Trump’s cabinet and ad-ministration.

HONORING RAUL QUEZADA 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor a public servant in my community, Raul Quezada. Mr. Quezada is the first Latino to be named the Chief of Police in the city of Ana-heim. Prior to transferring to Anaheim in 1996, Mr. Quezada worked at the Los Angeles Po-lice Department for three years. Mr. Quezada, took over as the Acting Police Chief in May of 2013 and was then named Police Chief in De-cember 2013. His appointment took place after a time of civil unrest and riots following a series of fatal police shootings in 2012. He served as the Police Chief of Anaheim for nearly four years. While actively participating in community en-gagement, he prioritized maintaining safety standards and keeping law and order. He worked relentlessly to improve the way of life in Anaheim and to have a positive influence in the community of Anaheim. Mr. Quezada cre-ated a youth program named the Public Safety Career Pipeline. This was an elective class held at Sycamore Junior High, that encour-aged youth to consider a career in law en-forcement. Mr. Quezada met with different community members regularly. Working to as-sure all residents and communities that hate crimes would not be tolerated, Mr. Quezada encouraged residents to take a more active role in the community. Mr. Quezada introduced new and innovative methods and the use of technology in the po-lice department. In 2015, he made Anaheim one of the first cities anywhere to equip its en-tire police force with body cameras. He also took the initiative to establish a neighborhood advisory council. Mr. Quezada has recently retired as the Anaheim Police Chief. The Mayor of Anaheim, Tom Tait, who strongly supports Mr. Quezada, said in a statement that Quezada had ‘‘over-seen critical cultural and operational changes that have brought the department closer to those it serves.’’ As a community leader, he helped rebuild community trust and is com-mitted to implementing positive approaches to the law for the betterment of the community.

IN RECOGNITION OF EASTSIDE BABY CORNER 
HON. DAVID G. REICHERT 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, for over two decades, Eastside Baby Corner (EBC) in Issaquah, Washington has provided invaluable services to families in need throughout the surrounding community. EBC founder, Karen Ridlon, first saw the need for a nonprofit com-mitted to providing families with resources for babies through her work as a local nurse prac-titioner. Countless newborn babies in her prac-tice left the hospital to go to homes that did not have adequate food, clothing, sanitary care products, and safety equipment. What began as a small collection of re-sources collected in Ms. Ridlon’s dining room has grown into an organization that serves over 800 children each week and has filled over 500,000 orders of baby essentials. Non-profits similar to EBC have filled important needs within communities across America. In 2016 alone, more than 300 nonprofit diaper banks and diaper pantries that are members of the National Diaper Bank Network across 46 States distributed over 52,000,000 donated diapers, helping ensure that more than 278,000 children had the diapers they needed. In light of Diaper Awareness Week last month, I visited EBC, toured the warehouse, and met with some of its committed volun-teers. I applaud EBC and other members of the National Diaper Bank Network for the crit-ical work they do to provide families with the infant essentials they need and better ensure that babies have a healthy start to life. f 
HONORING THE FIFTIETH ANNI-VERSARY OF THE WOODBERRY FOREST SCHOOL SPORTS CAMP 
HON. THOMAS A. GARRETT, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, invested in de-veloping young men of sterling character who played by the rules and exhibited good sports-manship, the Woodberry Forest School’s Head Football Coach and Athletics Director Red Caughron and his wife Cathy founded the Woodberry Forest School Sports Camp, in 1967, on the philosophy, ‘‘that a man must build himself mentally, physically, and socially each day to be well-rounded . . . by one phi-losophy, the conviction that the primary value of sports is their contribution to a boy’s moral and physical growth.’’ Under the direction of Mr. and Mrs. Caughron and eight counselors, the first ses-sion of the Woodberry Forest School Sports Camp had forty-two campers who practiced and competed in a wide range of team sports. In the twenty-five years successive years, Mr. and Mrs. Caughron and the camp’s staff developed a series of programs that instilled the value of teamwork in young men age elev-en to fourteen, and provided specialized in-struction in the sports in which each camper excelled at individually. Following Mr. and Mrs. Caughron’s retire-ment from the day-to-day operations of the Woodberry Forest School Sports Camp, each of the succeeding camp directors; Richard ‘‘Dick’’ Glover; Bill and Debbie Davis; Richard Wright; Clint and Elaine Alexander; Amy Blundin, Matt Blundin, and Frazier Stowers; have worked with hundreds of camp coun-selors; nearly all of whom have been students, alumni, or faculty members of Woodberry For-est School to grow the program while main-taining the camp’s core values. During the Woodberry Forest School Sports Camp’s fifty-year history, hundreds of campers have gone on to become students and then graduates of the Woodberry Forest School, and today, I would like to pay tribute to, and show my gratitude for Red and Cathy Caughron, the Woodberry Forest School Sports Camp’s directors, counselors and the thousands of campers whose lives have been enriched by the selfless dedication that Mr. and Mrs. Caughron exhibited by founding Woodberry Forest School Sports Camp, fifty years ago, this year. f 
CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA COM-PLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2017 
SPEECH OF  
HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 23, 2017 Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4010, the Congres-sional Subpoena Compliance and Enforce-ment Act. This legislation allows the House of Representatives to enforce congressional sub-poenas in federal court. Too often, congres-sional subpoenas are flouted because they lack enforcement mechanisms. Under current law, Congress must refer subpoenas to the appropriate United States attorney for enforce-ment. Typically, this United States attorney is appointed by the same administration over which Congress seeks to exert its oversight authority. H.R. 4010 creates a clear set of enforce-ment mechanisms surrounding the congres-sional subpoena power. Although congres-sional subpoenas have been used by Con-gress and its committees for many years, there is currently no law requiring compliance. This legislation requires that recipients of con-gressional subpoenas either comply or provide the committee with an explanation of the legal privilege that allows them to resist. This bill would also provide enforcement cases with an expedited review at the federal court leveL Al-ternatively, committees can request that the enforcement case be heard by a district court panel of three judges with the option to appeal to the Supreme Court. Codifying these en-forcement measures will provide Congress and its committees with a clear set of expecta-tions for how to present and enforce sub-poenas. In these especially political times, checks and balances have never been more impor-tant. Congress must fully utilize its constitu-tional right to hold hearings and investigate members of the federal government, and we need tools to enforce these investigations if people refuse to comply. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I stand for transparency and honesty in our government, and as a Congress we have the duty to seek out both for our constituents. H.R. 4010 gives Con-gress the tools it needs to demand that people attempting to shroud and hide the truth reveal it, and I urge my fellow members to stand with me and support the Congressional Subpoena Compliance and Enforcement Act.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF MRS. DIXIE BIGGER 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Mrs. Dixie Bigger, who left us on October 20th of this year. She will be greatly missed by all of her family and friends, her community, and her union, United Auto Workers Local 1237. Mrs. Bigger was born on August 22, 1940 in Oquawka, Illinois, to Harold Wilson and Velma Mea Henshaw. She grew up in Oquawka and attended G&O High School. In 1956, she mar-ried Richard ‘‘Dick’’ Bigger, who sadly passed away in July of 2009. Mrs. Bigger worked at Champion Spark Plug in Burlington, Iowa for 33 years, and was a dedicated member of U.A.W. Local 1237 and the Champion Council. Mrs. Bigger was also civically engaged as a Henderson County Precinct Committeewoman. After retiring, she became the recording sec-retary for the U.A.W. Local 1237 Retiree Chapter, a position she maintained until May of 2016. Mrs. Bigger was blessed with three children, five grandchildren, and eight great- grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for Mrs. Bigger’s contributions to our community, and my con-dolences are with her loved ones at this dif-ficult time.

HONORING CHERYL SEIDNER 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Cheryl Seidner, who will be hon-ored as Humboldt County Citizen of the Year on October 27, 2017, an award she richly de-serves. Cheryl Seidner’s contributions to the Wiyot Tribe and advocacy for American Indian rights are exemplary. As Chairwoman of the Wiyot Tribe from 1996–2008, Ms. Seidner was es-sential to the establishment of the Table Bluff Reservation, now home to permanent housing for tribal members and a community center. She was instrumental to the repatriation of In-dian Island in Humboldt Bay, the site of a ter-rible massacre in 1860 that nearly exterminated the Wiyot Tribe. And, as an au-thor and poet, Ms. Seidner also organized an annual vigil commemorating this massacre and brought back the Wiyot young women’s coming-of-age ceremony. Cheryl Seidner has served on the executive committee of the National Congress of Amer-ican Indians and the Northern California Indian Development Council. She worked as a men-tor for students during her 28 years in the Humboldt State University Educational Oppor-tunity Program and was an advisor to the American Indian Alliance, which supports American Indian students’ academic efforts. In 2008, Ms. Seidner was granted an Honorary Doctorate of Human Letters from Humboldt State University for her activism on behalf of American Indians at the local, state and na-tional levels. Mr. Speaker, please join me in expressing deep appreciation for Cheryl Seidner’s extraor-dinary leadership and devotion to American In-dian activism and achievement and congratu-lating her on decades of service to the North Coast’s Indian communities. f 
C–TPAT REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017 
SPEECH OF  
HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 23, 2017 Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3551, the C–TPAT Re-authorization Act of 2017. This legislation re-authorizes the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism Program (C–TPAT). The C–TPAT program works to improve United States border security and the security of our international supply partners by pro-viding a voluntary public-private sector part-nership focused on bolstering trade while keeping Americans safe. Since its creation in 2001, this program has allowed trade partners and American businesses to opt into in-creased security measures and make correc-tive actions in order to streamline their entry into our country. The program simplifies the process of suppliers bringing products into our country and allows our country to broaden se-curity trade measures without discouraging trade with those who do not opt in. In the United States, more than 41 million jobs depend on international trade, and my home state of Georgia boasts the largest sin-gle-terminal container facility of its kind in North America, based in Savannah. This in-dustry supports over 360,000 jobs statewide and is vitally important in our local and na-tional economy. The C–TPAT program is good for trade and promotes the safety of our citizens, and I urge my fellow members to support H.R. 3551 to reauthorize funding for this program.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Sergeant First Class Jeremiah ‘‘JW’’ Wayne Johnson, who gave his life while serving our nation on Octo-ber 4, 2017, in Ouallam, Niger. SFC Johnson was one of four servicemen killed in the hos-tile attack in southwest Niger. A Member of the 3rd Special Forces Group, SFC Johnson proudly served our Nation for ten years as a Chemical, Biological, Radio-logical and Nuclear Specialist (74D). At home, he enjoyed fixing and riding motorcycles, forg-ing and customizing knives, and most impor-tantly, spending time with his family. During his tenure in the Army, SFC Johnson received numerous awards and commenda-tions, including the Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Armed Forces Service Medal. Posthumously, SFC Johnson was awarded the Purple Heart Medal, Meritorious Service Medal and the Combat Action Badge. SFC Johnson was laid to rest in North Caro-lina on October 16, 2017. His motorcade was met by hundreds of community members, in-cluding many uniformed veterans and active duty soldiers, who gathered to honor his life and pay their respects. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in com-memorating the life of SFC Jeremiah ‘‘JW’’ Wayne Johnson and also in offering our con-dolences and prayers to his wife Crystal, their two daughters, Addie and Elisa, and to his many family members, friends and comrades as they mourn the loss of this brave hero. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF DR. NEIL CAPRETTO 
HON. KEITH J. ROTHFUS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Neil Capretto, Medical Director of Gateway Rehabilitation, for his 30 years of service to the Beaver County community. Dr. Capretto graduated from the Philadel-phia College of Osteopathic Medicine and went on to serve as chief resident in psychi-atry at St. Francis General Hospital before set-tling in Western Pennsylvania. As an expert in the study of addiction, he has written scholarly articles and served as a medical commentator and consultant to both local and national media networks. Today, he serves as an innovator in the field of pain management and a leader in the fight against the opioid epidemic. Not only is Dr. Capretto incredibly knowl-edgeable, but he continues to display exem-plary patience and kindness, even amidst his battle with cancer. I’d like to thank him for his 30 years of serv-ice and let him and his family know that we are praying for speedy recovery in this difficult time. God bless.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1444 October 26, 2017 
Department of Public Health found that the number of deaths due to opioid overdoses is now nearly equal to the deaths from motor ve-hicle crashes. In the 4th District alone, over 200 lives were tragically lost due to this hor-rible epidemic. As a country, we can no longer afford inaction on an issue that has turned into an epidemic under our watch. H.R. 2142 requires the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to increase the amount of chemical screenings to prevent the smuggling of fentanyl, opioids, and other nar-cotics into the country, either through mailing services or through a carrier. The bill also mandates that sufficient funds and employees, including scientists, are available to ensure thorough screenings and resources available at all operational hours. By giving our CBP of-ficers a better chance of detecting these illicit drugs at the border, we may be able to save the lives of hundreds, if not thousands of Americans. Only with our action can we, as members of Congress, start to make a mean-ingful difference in this fight that is ravaging our country. This is why I have strongly favored more funding to prevent the spread of the opioid cri-sis in the past, and will continue to fight for more resources that will end the opioid addic-tion crisis. For this reason, I am pleased to support H.R. 2142.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PHILLIP V. SANCHEZ 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to the life of U.S. Am-bassador Phillip V. Sanchez. Mr. Sanchez, who served under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford in Honduras and Colombia, was a distinguished and influential leader serving the San Joaquin Valley. He was one of the first Latinos to hold public office and was known for his charitable nature, diplo-matic character, and perseverance. The San Joaquin Valley will be forever indebted to Am-bassador Sanchez for his tireless efforts on behalf of the community. Phillip V. Sanchez was born on July 28, 1929. He was raised in Pinedale, California. At just six years old he would join his mother in the fields to pick fruit and cotton. His mother heavily influenced him to pursue an education. Mr. Sanchez graduated from Clovis High School in 1946 and continued his education at Fresno State in political science. While in col-lege, Mr. Sanchez joined the Army National Guard and advanced to the rank of colonel in the Army Reserve. He had over 40 years of military service. In the 1960s, he began his career in public service as the Chief Administrative Officer of Fresno County. Ambassador Sanchez became a board member for Clovis Unified School Dis-trict before being appointed by Governor Ron-ald Reagan to the California Community Col-leges Board of Governors and the California State University and Colleges Board of Trust-ees. He was also a trustee of the National Hispanic University. In the 1970s, Mr. San-chez was appointed by President Nixon as the Assistant Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity. After the Office of Economic Opportunity was dismantled in 1973, Mr. Sanchez was ap-pointed Ambassador to Honduras. While in Honduras, he and wife Juanita adopted a child and began to help Americans adopt orphans. They had a love of children and later founded an orphanage in Mexico that they oversaw for 25 years. Under President Ford, Mr. Sanchez was transferred to Ambassador of Colombia. Later in his life, Ambassador Sanchez worked as publisher of the New York Tribune and Noticias del Mundo, and was president of CAUSA USA, a faith-based anti-communist or-ganization. After 9/11, Mr. Sanchez decided to return to the Fresno area to retire. He was honored at the 2008 Top Dog Alumni Awards Gala and in 2010 was named Chicano Alumni Legacy Builder by Fresno State. Mr. Sanchez made a positive difference in many lives and inspired people to follow their dreams. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of U.S. Ambassador Phillip V. Sanchez, whose generosity and unending dedication to the community will be greatly missed. Mr. Sanchez’s memory will live on through the contributions he made to our Val-ley and throughout the world. It is my honor to join his family and many friends in celebrating his impactful life, which will never be forgotten. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Senator Dennis ‘‘Denny’’ J. Jacobs of East Moline, Illinois on the occasion of his 80th birthday. Denny was born in Rock Island County, Illi-nois on November 8, 1937 to parents Oral ‘‘Jake’’ and Shirley Jacobs. Denny graduated from United Township High School in 1955 and married his high school sweetheart, Mary Ellen DuffY, shortly after. He is a graduate of Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois. Denny and Mary Ellen raised six children. Following in his father’s footsteps, Denny dedicated nearly 30 years of his life to public service. He was elected Mayor of East Moline in 1973, a position he held for 14 years. In 1986 Denny was appointed to serve as Sen-ator for Illinois’ 36th District. He served his community in this capacity until his retirement in 2004. Denny not only made a deep impact on his district, but also on the State of Illinois. One of his biggest legislative accomplishments was expanding 9–1–1 service statewide. Denny worked tirelessly to advocate for his community and to bring investment to this re-gion. I join with his family and friends in congratu-lating him on this special occasion and wish-ing him a very happy 80th birthday.

IN MEMORY OF ATTORNEY THEODORE ROOSEVELT BOWERS 
HON. AL LAWSON, JR. 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a veteran, educator, civic leader, dedicated citizen and a great American, Attorney Theodore Roosevelt Bow-ers, who served his community, state and country well. Attorney Bowers was raised in Bascom, Florida. After graduating from Rosenwald High School, he attended Florida A&M University (FAMU) in 1950. He was drafted into the United States Army but volunteered to serve in the U.S. Air Force instead from 1951 to 1954. After being honorably discharged in 1955, Attorney Bowers returned to FAMU and completed his Bachelor’s Degree in Political Science in 1958. He later obtained a Bachelor of Laws in 1961 from Howard University Law School. Attorney Bowers started his legal career clerking at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. In 1962, he was admitted to the Florida Bar and remained a member for more than fifty years. He became the first Afri-can American to practice law in Bay County. Since that time, he has engaged in the private practice of law in the 1st, 2nd, and 14th Judi-cial Circuits of Florida. From 1962 to 1964, Bowers was an instructor of Political Science at FAMU. He served as a cooperating attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund for five years (1965–1970). In standing tall for equal-ity, he worked to integrate the schools so Black children in Bay County and surrounding counties would have access to equal edu-cation opportunities. His legal work was also instrumental in integrating the Bay Medical Maternity Ward and several local businesses in Bay County, His goal was always to ‘‘change the system and try to make America what it should be.’’ Attorney Bowers received many opportunities to practice law in Wash-ington, DC however, he was committed to the cause of Civil Rights and felt his services were better served at home in Northwest Florida. With this decision, he paid a high price both financially and personally including several at-tempts at bombing his car after leaving civil rights meetings in Marianna, Florida in the 1960’s. He served on numerous boards and com-missions including the Board of Trustees for Gulf Coast Community College (1973–77) and the Governor’s Commission on the Status of Women (1979–1982). He was also elected and served as the first Black member of the Bay County School Board, In June 2009, he was honored by the Flor-ida Chapter of the National Bar Association as one of Florida’s First Black Lawyers. In June 2012, the Florida Bar honored him for fifty years of practicing law in Florida. Attorney Bowers was recommended to be-come a U.S. Attorney by President Jimmy Carter but his recommendation was blocked by the power structure in Florida. And he was instrumental in President Nixon withdrawing the name of Federal Judge G. Harrold Carswell, a southern, strict constructionist con-servative as a nominee to the Supreme Court. Throughout the ensuing decades of his life and career he fashioned a powerful place in the public discourse on race and influenced the thinking of generations of young attorneys. Driven by an enormous heart and keen intel-lect, Attorney Bowers worked his entire life to ‘‘level the playing field’’ for all Americans. Mr. Speaker, with an unwavering dedication, strong values, and an avid pursuit of civil and human rights, Attorney Bowers made a tre-mendous impact in his community, the state of

ASIA-PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERA-TION BUSINESS TRAVEL CARDS ACT OF 2017 
SPEECH OF  
HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 23, 2017 Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support S. 504, the Asia-Pacific Eco-nomic Cooperation Business Travel Cards Act of 2017. S. 504 would permanently authorize the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Busi-ness Travel Card program, an initiative that provides expedited airport processing to those who are eligible. The program, originally created for business travelers from Asia-Pacific Economic Coopera-tion (APEC) countries, expanded to include United States citizens after the passage of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Travel Cards Act of 2011. Without reauthoriza-tion, the program is set to expire on Sep-tember 30, 2018. Georgia is home to one of the world’s busi-est airports, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Inter-national Airport. Atlanta residents witness first-hand the chaos of international travel and the need for streamlined processing in inter-national airports. S. 504 would permanently authorize designated lanes at airports in par-ticipating countries, encouraging companies to continue international trade operations and business transactions. Ensuring smooth and efficient modes of transportation is critical for Americans to expand our economy overseas. As a member of the Transportation & Infra-structure Committee and member of the Avia-tion Subcommittee, I look for legislation that will streamline aviation safety, innovation, con-sumer service, and airport infrastructure. S. 504 achieves many of these goals, and that is why I support this legislation.
