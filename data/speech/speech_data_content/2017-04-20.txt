Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Women’s History Month. Each year, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our nation’s women. It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my congressional district. I would like to recognize a remarkable woman, Netty Carr of Atwater Village, a unique neighborhood in Los Ange-les, California. Netty Carr was born in the Echo Park neigh-borhood of Los Angeles, and has been a resi-dent of Atwater Village for many years. A suc-cessful small business owner, Ms. Carr found-ed Netty’s Restaurant in 1987 in Silver Lake, serving comfort food to customers until 2007. Over the years, Ms. Carr has dedicated her time and efforts to better her community. She is an avid supporter of green space, the envi-ronment, and historic preservation. Most nota-bly, in 1999, Netty spearheaded the Coalition to Save the Van de Kamp’s bakery building on Fletcher Drive, because a developer had plans to demolish the building to build a ‘‘big box’’ store. Through the hard work and commitment of Ms. Carr and the Coalition, which was com-prised of 23 community groups, they suc-ceeded in saving this historical building. Ms. Carr co-founded Friends of Atwater Vil-lage, a non-profit organization, where volun-teers work together with the common goal of improving Atwater Village, and promoting and preserving the local history. From neighbor-hood clean-ups to mural projects, two of which Netty personally funded, Netty’s dedication to improve the community through beautification projects is nothing short of extraordinary. I ask all Members to join me in honoring an exceptional woman of California’s 28th Con-gressional District, Netty Carr.

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF ROBERT F. GLOCKNER 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of Robert F. Glockner by including in the R
ECORD the Me- morial Tribute prepared by his loving family. Bob Glockner died peacefully on March 26, 2017, surrounded by his family. A vibrant man, Bob will be remembered for his warmth and generosity, commitment to his family and com-munity, and his boundless energy. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the summer of 1938, he was the third child of Paul and Stephanie Glockner. He moved with his family to Oakland, California, in 1947. In 1956 Bob graduated from St. Elizabeth High School, where he enjoyed drama and sports. He served in the U.S. Army and later in the Army reserves. He attended San Francisco State, grad-uating in 1961 with a bachelor’s degree in Legal Studies. San Francisco is also where he met his wife of 54 years, Ginger Alfs. To-gether, they had four daughters. Bob began his career as a salesman for Modernfold of Northern California. In 1970 he became a partner in Partition Specialties, Inc., serving as president before striking out on his own to found WestFour Construction and Whitney Investment Company in 1983. He did not retire but more transitioned to the role of ‘‘Volunteer Project Manager,’’ helping his family as well as organizations that were close to his heart. Bob always had a project, and many knew him as the person you would turn to when you needed to get something done. A dedicated and active member of his com-munity, he was a member of the Board of Trustees for Sacred Heart Schools in Ath-erton, as well as a member of Sharon Heights Country Club, the Vineyard Club, and the Pe-ninsula Investors Club. He was quick to offer his time or his counsel to assist a worthy cause. Bob loved travel, art and music. He was an avid sports fan, skier, golfer, and lover of the outdoors. Later in life, he tried his hand at growing grapes and winemaking, and enjoyed producing wine under his own ‘‘Four Sisters Vineyard’’ label. Above all, Bob loved and was loved by his family. He will be remembered by his wife, Ginger; his daughters and sons-in-law Jennifer and John Whitcomb, Ellen and Fred Eder, Julie Morris, and Whitney and Peter Glockner Black; his 10 grandchildren, Stan, Mackenzie and Brooke Whitcomb, Elizabeth and Fred Eder, Kyle and Hannah Morris, and Axel, Jas-per, and Hugo Black; as well as his sisters, Audrey Glockner and Mary Akey; his sister-in- law, Diane Orsellini, and their families. I had the privilege of knowing Bob Glockner for decades. He was a gentleman and a man of great faith. He loved his family and was de-voted to his church, his community and his country. It was an honor to have known him and call him my friend. Because of all he did in living a worthy life, our country has been bettered immeasurably. Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in expressing our collective sympathy to the great love of his life, Ginger, their children, grandchildren, and entire family on the loss of a great and good man. IN RECOGNITION OF JOSHUA CHU HON. PATRICK MEEHAN 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Joshua Chu of Wissahickon High School, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on receiving the Congressional Award’s Bronze Medal. The Congressional Award is Congress’ award for young Americans who dedicate themselves to public service, personal devel-opment, physical fitness and exploration. It motivates young people to improve them-selves, try new things and learn new skills. Joshua served his community through vol-unteering in a soup kitchen, packing food, sorting donated items and aiding the kitchen’s staff. He also broadened his knowledge by traveling to Boston and Hawaii to learn more about their culture and history. I congratulate Joshua on earning this honor and I congratulate his parents on raising such a fine young man.

IN RECOGNITION OF SPECIALIST JAMES C. M
CCLOUGHAN FOR HIS EXEMPLARY SERVICE DURING THE VIETNAM WAR 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Specialist James C. McCloughan for his service as a combat medic during the Viet-nam War. SPC McCloughan demonstrated ex-traordinary heroism during the Battle of Nui Yon Hill, and his actions as a combat medic saved the lives of his fellow service members during this encounter. In 1969, then-Private First Class James McCloughan was serving as one of two med-ics between the 89-man Charlie Company when the group came under fire from an esti-mated 2,000 enemy soldiers. During the sub-sequent two-day Battle of Nui Yon Hill, then- PFC McCloughan braved heavy enemy gun-fire to rescue and provide medical care to his fellow service members. Then-PFC McCloughan refused to leave the battle, fight-ing through shrapnel and gunfire wounds and continued to serve Charlie Company for the remainder of the battle. For his efforts during his service, he received multiple awards, in-cluding the Combat Medical Badge, two Pur-ple Hearts, the U.S. Army Valorous Unit Cita-tion and the National Defense Medal. Addition-ally, SPC McCloughan was authorized to re-ceive the Medal of Honor for his actions dur-ing the Vietnam War on December 27, 2016. SPC McCloughan’s remarkable record of valor during his service in the Vietnam War is worthy of special recognition. He went above and beyond the call of duty throughout his

military service to aid his comrades, and the fellow service members’ lives he saved at great personal risk are a testament to his bravery. His tenacity and willingness to sac-rifice on behalf of others is extraordinary and demonstrates his character. It is my hope that SPC McCloughan continues to receive the ac-claim that his military record merits while serv-ing as an inspiration for current service mem-bers. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring SPC James C. McCloughan for his courage under fire as a combat medic dur-ing the Vietnam War. SPC McCloughan saved countless lives through his actions.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE GRAND OPENING OF THE NEW STERLING LIBRARY 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Grand Opening of the new Ster-ling Library. This new branch, located in the heart of Sterling, Virginia is nearly three times the size of the former library and includes state-of-the-art facilities, increased access to computers, and the most up to date tech-nology and resources, such as 3D printers, re-cording studios, and books offered in multiple languages. I take great pride knowing this state-of-the-art facility is opening in Virginia’s Tenth District, and I am very thankful for the broad range of learning opportunities it will af-ford my constituents. Since the mid-1970s the Sterling Library has been a vital part of the community’s steady development, but the old building could no longer support the everyday needs of the community. According to the Director of Loudoun County Public Library, Chang Liu, community input played a crucial role in the plans for this library. Residents were very en-gaged during the planning and design proc-esses, and the new elements, such as the high-tech workspaces and the unique teen area, coupled with the tremendous amount of space offered in the new library, better suit the current needs of the growing Sterling commu-nity. This project is part of the broader Sterling Public Facilities Master Plan, which was ap-proved in a referendum in 2014. In addition to the library, the plan calls for the expansion of the Sterling Volunteer Fire and Rescue Station and the renovation and expansion of the Ster-ling Community Center into the former library space. The opening of the new library marks the first step in what will be an exciting period of innovation in Sterling. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that my colleagues join me in applauding the Grand Opening of the new Sterling Library. I look forward to the impact it will have on the children, teenagers, and adults of Sterling and our Commonwealth as a whole. ROGER THOMAS PROMOTED TO BISHOP, CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN THIRD ECCLESIASTICAL JURIS-DICTION CHURCH OF GOD IN CHRIST HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize the exemplary service and promotion of Bishop Roger Thomas to his current posi-tion. As a result of his keen awareness, under-standing of humankind, his unquestionable de-votion to serve God is boundless. It is his effective stewardship that leads men and women to successful conclusions within the church and in their private lives. The sin-cerity of his voice moves individuals to be at their best regardless of the challenges they face. He inspires youth and adults to further their education in higher institutions of learning. In-dividuals in search of counseling, guidance, advice, employment and legal matters are aided directly and/or indirectly by his influence. Bishop Roger Thomas proves regularly that the service of God’s children is more than an obligation but rather to care for the needs of all humankind is an honor.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF JAMES ‘‘JIMMY’’ LANZA 
HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life and service of James ‘‘Jimmy’’ Lanza. Jimmy passed on April 6 of this year, surrounded by his family, friends, and beloved brothers from the Fire Depart-ment of New York City, after a noble battle with brain cancer. An esteemed member of the Woodside community, Jimmy’s life was characterized by a tireless dedication to others in keeping with the highest tradition of service to our country. Jimmy gave perennially of him-self, serving in the U.S. Navy during the Viet-nam War, where he was a member of a crew of flying airborne early warning and control systems. After his tenure in the Navy, Jimmy went on to serve as a firefighter, devoting three decades to the FDNY with Engine 53, Ladder 43, in East Harlem as part of ‘‘El Barrio’s Bravest.’’ During his time with the FDNY, Jimmy de-voted countless hours to the search and re-covery mission at the World Trade Center in the aftermath of September 11. After Hurri-cane Katrina, he traveled to New Orleans with his FDNY comrades to assist in their rescue, search, and recovery mission. As a volunteer with the Red Cross, he stood ever-ready to lend a hand to suffering communities in the aftermath of devastation. Jimmy also served on the executive board of the FDNY Fire Fam-ily Transport Foundation, an organization de-voted to providing care and comfort to the families of firefighters during times of great need or bereavement. Jimmy was also deeply involved with charitable work on behalf of wounded veterans and their families. He made numerous trips to Washington, D.C. to visit veterans in military hospitals, and assisted in many sponsored events for vets and their fam-ilies. A lifetime member of the American Le-gion, Jimmy served as the Commander of Post 1836, at the Boulevard Gardens in Woodside, Queens. In that role, he helped to educate the community on the profound sac-rifices made by those who choose to serve our country in the armed forces. A lifelong Woodside resident, Jimmy de-voted his time after retirement from the FDNY to improving his local community. He served as the President of the Boulevard Gardens Co-op Board for 15 years, the longest anyone had ever held the position. During his tenure, he worked to improve communication between the local precinct, the community board, and the Co-op board in order to assure that issues were dealt with in a timely manner. Jimmy was also instrumental in the fight to bring fair assessment to property values for co-ops across New York City. Over his tenure as President, the Boulevard Gardens community saw a marked increase in the quality of life and overall safety, as well as the financial standing of the co-op. Jimmy Lanza lived his entire life in service of others. His was the highest ideal of a life devoted to one’s community and country, and should serve as an example for us all to as-pire to. He was a truly great man, and also a dear friend of mine. He was a devoted family man, and is survived by his beloved sister Marian, his nephews Keith and Michael, niece Stephanie, grand-nieces Emily and Eva, grand-nephews Brandon and Andrew, count-less friends, and all of the lives he touched over the years. Mr. Speaker, Jimmy’s commit-ment to both community and country was, and will continue to be, an inspiration to all of us. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life and legacy of James J. Lanza. May he rest in peace.

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE RIGHT TO DEMAND THE PRESI-DENT RELEASE HIS TAX RE-TURNS 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, every year at this time tens of millions of Americans are completing their tax returns and rushing to the nearest post office to mail them before the deadline. No one likes to pay taxes but the vast ma-jority of Americans voluntarily comply out of their respect for law and because paying taxes is one of the responsibilities of citizenship. That responsibility is placed upon and as-sumed by struggling wage earners to the wealthiest individuals in America. And that even includes the President of the United States. Americans have the right to expect and to know that the leader of their country, and the most powerful person on Earth, is paying his fair share of taxes that fund the government he heads, the Armed Forces he commands, the nuclear arsenal he controls, the Secret Service protection he receives, and the White House he lives in.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE515 April 20, 2017 
And that is why thousands of persons took to the streets last Saturday in peaceful protest to demand that the President of the United States do what every President since Gerald Ford in 1976 has done. And that is to release his tax returns while in office. Trump is the first President since Watergate to refuse to release his tax information to the public. Full release of Trump’s tax returns will pro-vide the public with clear information as to his potential conflicts of interest and entangle-ments with foreign governments and busi-nesses. A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 74 percent of Americans, including 53 percent of Republicans, believe Trump should release his tax returns. All roads lead back to the President’s tax re-turns, and the light they can shine on his ac-tions. As chief steward of America’s extensive do-mestic, global, and national security interests, the fidelity of the President of the United States to the national interest must never be subject to question or doubt. Trump’s extensive financial interests in more than 100 companies operating in more than 18 countries and on five continents potentially represent major conflicts of interest between his personal financial interests and the na-tional interests of the American people. A preliminary analysis of Trump’s extensive financial arrangements reveals dozens of po-tential conflicts of interest. For example, Trump has received more than $10 million from his interest in the Trump Towers Istanbul in Turkey, a country with which the United States has extensive, com-plicated, and politically sensitive military and diplomatic relations. Since August 2015, Trump’s business orga-nizations have registered eight separate com-panies connected to hotel deals in Saudi Ara-bia, which is located in one of the world’s most critical geopolitical regions. Based on the limited and inadequate finan-cial disclosures he has made to date, it ap-pears that Trump’s business organization is fi-nancially dependent upon, and obligated to, Deutsche Bank, its biggest lender, which hap-pens to be negotiating a multibillion-dollar set-tlement over housing-crisis-era abuses with the Justice Department, a deal that will be fi-nalized with Justice Department officials ap-pointed by Trump. Companies owned or controlled by Trump’s organization also owe hundreds of millions of dollars to the state-owned Bank of China and to Wall Street interests. The American people are entitled to assume without hesitation or doubt that when the President of the United States meets with for-eign leaders and dignitaries that he is moti-vated only by what is in the national interest and not the private, pecuniary interests of him-self, his family members, or his business en-terprises. That assurance cannot be provided when the President of the United States has enor-mous financial stakes in the enterprises oper-ating in those same foreign countries and re-fuses to release his tax returns for examina-tion by the public. It is for this reason—to ensure that the President’s loyalty will always be to the nation he leads—that the Framers included the Emoluments Clause in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution, which provides that: ‘no Per-son holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Con-gress, accept of any present, Emolument, Of-fice, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.’ According to leading experts in ethics, a prohibited emolument would include, for exam-ple, anything from a foreign government that benefits Trump, such as providing favorable tax, zoning, licensing treatment for his real es-tate holdings or enhanced security to protect his business operations. The financial interests of Trump are exten-sive, complex, and inter-connected with the in-terests of foreign leaders and countries. They are all-encompassing and time-con-suming. But they pale in comparison to the global, diplomatic, economic, and national security in-terests of the United States, which supersede the interests of any one person or corporation. As the Scriptures teach, you cannot serve two masters. And that is why, Mr. Speaker, I believe the President must make a choice, either he should: 1. release his tax returns and divest all of his financial interests; or 2. relinquish the office he holds due to his inability to ‘take care that the Laws be faith-fully executed’ and ‘to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.’

IN RECOGNITION OF RICHARD BERNSTEIN FOR RECEIVING THE JOHN DINGELL OUTSTANDING PUBLIC OFFICIAL AWARD 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Richard Bernstein for receiving the John Dingell Outstanding Public Official Award at the 2017 Governor’s Fitness Awards Ban-quet. Mr. Bernstein has had an outstanding legal career and served as a justice on the Michigan Supreme Court with distinction. After earning a law degree from North-western University in 1999, Mr. Bernstein joined the Law Offices of Sam Bernstein, where his work focused on defending the rights of the disabled. In addition to his work in ensuring that public facilities in Michigan are accessible by disabled individuals in accord-ance with federal law, Mr. Bernstein has also served as an advocate for disabled rights internationally through visits and lectures in various countries, including Australia, Ecuador and Israel. Mr. Bernstein has also compiled a distinguished career in public service. In addi-tion to currently serving an 8-year term on the Michigan Supreme Court, Bernstein has pre-viously been elected to the Wayne State Uni-versity Board of Governors in 2002 and serv-ing as its chair from 2009 to 2010. Mr. Bernstein has fought tirelessly on behalf of Michigan residents and those with disabil-ities. During his time in private practice, Mr. Bernstein helped represent the Paralyzed Vet-erans of America in a case that resulted in im-proved accessibility to the University of Michi-gan’s athletic facilities. In addition, his advo-cacy and effort have resulted in improved ac-cessibility for disabled fliers at Detroit Metro Airport. For these accomplishments, Mr. Bern-stein has received numerous awards, includ-ing the University of Michigan’s James T. Neubacher Award for his work to ensure equal rights for individuals with disabilities. Mr. Bern-stein’s record of outstanding public service and advocacy on behalf of Michigan residents is more than deserving of this prestigious award. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Richard Bernstein and his record of achievement. Mr. Bernstein’s professional record and public service have benefited Michigan and are worthy of commendation. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF MR. BILL GASKIN 
HON. DAVID P. JOYCE 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Mr. Bill Gaskin of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, who for the past forty years has committed his life to growing manufacturing in Northeast Ohio and around the country. Hav-ing worked at the Precision Metalforming As-sociation, based in Independence, Ohio, since 1977, Bill has spent the past seventeen years as its President, and helped guide the metal-working industry through some perilous times and lately, through significant growth. Manu-facturing is the backbone of our economy, not just in Ohio but throughout the country. Busi-nesses like those in my district are providing family-sustaining careers to more than 12 mil-lion Americans now working in manufacturing. Upon his retirement this year, Bill will leave the metalworking industry in much stronger shape than when he first became involved forty years ago. The industry is more vibrant than ever, in part due to the efforts of Bill and others who have committed themselves to strengthening manufacturing in America. I hope that Bill’s dedication will serve as an ex-ample to future generations of manufacturing leaders.

Mr. Speaker, I am hon-ored to use this time to recognize the 10th an-niversary of the Dominion Woman’s Club (DWC) in Virginia’s 10th District. The DWC is a member and volunteer organization that fo-cuses on enhancing our community and advo-cating for important issues—such as per-forming arts, education, leadership, hospitality, and conservation—through volunteer service in both Prince William and Fauquier Counties. The DWC was founded in 2007 under the guidance of the General Federation of Wom-en’s Clubs of Virginia (GFWC–VA).

DWC’s first President was Nanette McKeel Petrella, and many current members credit the club’s early success to her leadership and vi-sion. Today the DWC supports a wide variety of organizations and groups across Prince Wil-liam and Fauquier Counties, including Bull Run Mountain Conservancy, the Haymarket Regional Food Pantry, Haymarket Elementary School, and more. The members of the club come from many different backgrounds, in-cluding teachers, counselors, professional moms, and women involved in various other volunteer organizations in their community, and while their levels of participation and inter-ests may vary, they each share the common goal of serving their community and empow-ering one another. The club’s current co-Presidents, Susan Sivori and Celeste Corrigan, have been mem-bers of the DWC for a combined 16 years— a true testament to their dedication to our community and helping others. Under their leadership in 2016, the club participated in 49 volunteer programs, contributed 2,746 volun-teer hours, and donated over $7,000 to local groups and organizations and over $24,000 in in-kind donations. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding the Dominion Woman’s Club for its dedication to serving our community for the past 10 years. I wish Ms. Sivori, Ms. Corrigan, and the entire organization the best in their fu-ture endeavors.

COMMEMORATING CALVARY TEMPLE’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. CHARLES W. DENT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of recognizing Calvary Temple in Allentown, Pennsylvania on the occasion of its 100th an-niversary. During the last century, Calvary Temple has served as a place of spiritual en-lightenment and refuge to the City of Allen-town and the surrounding Lehigh Valley. Calvary Temple began in 1917 as an infor-mal gathering of 12 believers who met in one another’s houses to pray for the salvation of close friends and family members. Led by lay-man Edwin C. Conrad from the 12th Street Baptist Church of Allentown, the group de-voted itself to building a new meeting space that could accommodate their growing attend-ance numbers. By 1922, a ground-breaking was held for the new building, and the group officially deemed their organization the Pente-costal Prayer Band—Assembly of God. The church wasted no time in establishing ministries, both locally and internationally. Sis-ter Mary Lindberg became the church’s rep-resentative in India, establishing missionary outreach, which continues to this day. In Allen-town, the church began to work with the elder-ly and inmates at the Lehigh County Prison. Additionally, baptismal services for new mem-bers were held at Jordan Park in the nearby river. In the following decades, despite initial hardships, the church continued to devise cre-ative ways of ministering to the surrounding community, including radio and television broadcasts, an annual summer camp, and eventually, Allentown Christian School. Finally, after a number of name changes, the church adopted the name Calvary Temple, and ulti-mately decided to withdraw from the Assem-blies of God in order to become a self-gov-erning, non-denominational body of believers. Today, Calvary Temple remains a beacon of innovation and community service in its cur-rent location. In addition to its four Sunday services, the church hosts small group min-istries across the Lehigh Valley throughout the week, and they remain a dedicated and hos-pitable presence in Allentown. It is with the utmost respect and apprecia-tion that I ask the House to join me in offering well wishes and congratulations to the men and women of Calvary Temple. May the next century bring about continued congregational growth and meaningful outreach to the Lehigh Valley. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF MIKE ILITCH FOR RECEIVING THE 2017 VERN SEEFELDT LIFETIME ACHIEVE-MENT AWARD 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mike Ilitch for receiving the 2017 Vern Seefeldt Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2017 Governor’s Fitness Awards Banquet. Mr. Ilitch was a Detroit icon whose business and philanthropy have shaped Detroit and the surrounding communities. A lifelong Detroiter, Mr. Ilitch joined the Ma-rines after graduating from Cooley High School and then played professional baseball in the Detroit Tigers organization. He then began a pizza operation that, along with his success as a door-to-door salesman, earned enough money to open a dedicated restaurant called Little Caesar’s. The chain became a massive success, and Mr. Ilitch used the pro-ceeds to purchase the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Tigers sports franchises. Additionally, Mr. Ilitch was a strong supporter of the city of Detroit, refurbishing the Fox Theatre and mov-ing his business headquarters downtown in the 1980s, and continued to support edu-cation, nonprofit and civic initiatives in the city throughout his life. Mr. Ilitch is a Detroit icon whose life and work impacted countless individuals and was crucial to the City of Detroit’s revival. His pas-sion and hard work created a world-class or-ganization in Ilitch Holdings, and he was com-mitted to helping Detroit and its citizens throughout his life. Additionally, Mr. Ilitch re-vived two of America’s great sports teams in the Detroit Tigers and Red Wings, bringing Detroit four Stanley Cups and two American League pennants while helping revitalize downtown. In addition, Mr. Ilitch was a com-mitted philanthropist whose nonprofit organiza-tion, Ilitch Charities, invested in the community and future of southeast Michigan through its contributions to Detroit area civil groups. He was also a committed father and authentic in-dividual with a kind heart, and he is missed. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mike Ilitch for receiving the 2017 Vern Seefeldt Lifetime Achievement Award. Mr. Ilitch was a once in a generation entre-preneur and philanthropist whose work im-pacted countless lives. IN RECOGNITION OF SEAN ENGLISH HON. DAVID A. TROTT 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in rec-ognition of the heroic actions of Sean English of Northville, Michigan. As he and his family drove down I–96 in Detroit, they witnessed a rolled over SUV and selflessly pulled over to help a fellow Michi-gander. However, at the scene of the acci-dent, Sean and another Good Samaritan, Cyn-thia Ray, were struck by another vehicle. Tragically, Cynthia Ray, a doctor at Henry Ford Hospital, passed. However, thanks to the actions of Michigan State Police Trooper Pat-rick Arena, we are blessed to have Sean still with us. As a junior at University of Detroit Jesuit High School, Sean is admired by his class-mates and teachers alike. His dedication to service and kind and uplifting spirit make him the true embodiment of his high school’s motto—‘‘men for others.’’ A shining star on his school’s cross country and track teams, he is a talented runner who challenges not only himself, but his team-mates and his friends to give it their all and be the best they can at everything they do. I am so thankful that Sean will continue to be a vibrant presence in our community, sur-rounded by his family, friends, and fellow Michiganders who will continue to recognize his selflessness on that day and as he con-tinues to serve others. Sean’s a fighter with an unbreakable spirit— a spirit that will sustain him as he experiences life’s peaks and triumphs over its hurdles. My thoughts and prayers are with Sean and his family—John, Peggy, and Megan—as he makes a speedy recovery.

Godfather of the Toledo-area German-Amer-ican Festival. Fritz was born on July 4, 1931, and grew up in war-torn Germany. He lost his father and other members of his family during the con-flict. These tragedies and the difficulty that his mother and his sister and he lived through taught him many things. One such lesson was one that he passed down to his children and grandchildren: ‘‘Tough times don’t last but tough people do.’’ As his wife Ann says, ‘‘That was his mantra with the kids, and even for himself. He went through a lot.’’ After the war, Fritz learned to be a barber and cut hair at the U.S. 7th Army head-quarters in Heidelberg. It was appropriate that Fritz was born on the Fourth of July because his time spent working on the base inspired him to move to the United States. He first im-migrated to Canada where he worked as a barber and then earned enough to be granted a U.S. visa. In 1958, Fritz moved to Toledo, Ohio and began his new life by purchasing a barber business. He later went into sales at Ottawa Hills Memorial Park and was a co-owner of Fritz and Alfredo’s, where the German and Mexican dishes on the menu were very pop-ular. Fritz thrived in Toledo, meeting his loving wife Ann, whom he married on September 9, 1961. He and Ann had 2 daughters, Susan Molloy and Tina Zientarski, and were blessed with six grandchildren: Mitchell, Michael, Mat-thew, Katherine, Zachary and Grace. He dedicated himself to his family and to sharing his pride of his German heritage. He was an active member of the American Turn-ers Club, Bavarian Sports Club and the To-ledo Schwaben Verein. At one point there were seven separate German societies in To-ledo, and Fritz, along with his friends, was in-strumental in bringing the seven societies to-gether to organize one major event, the an-nual German-American Festival which attracts over 35,000 people annually. The first Ger-man-American festival was held in 1966. Fritz was passionate about music as well, where he led one of the area’s most popular German bands, The Tirolers. The band played German music at festival and functions in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Pennsylvania. In 1977, he received the Bundesverdienstkreuz, or, the Federal Cross of Merit from the Federal Republic of Ger-many, an honor given to citizens of other countries who work to promote German cul-tural activities in the United States. Upon his retirement from the restaurant business in Toledo in 2005, Fritz and Ann moved to Delray Beach, Florida, where he im-mediately joined the Lantana German-Amer-ican Club and led as the Director of the Club Choir. Fritz Gerhard Hetzel had never-ending en-ergy and gave his all to his family, community, businesses, and cultural activities. We should all aspire to be a selfless leader as he was. Goodbye (Auf Wiedersehen), Fritz. IN RECOGNITION OF LTC CHARLES KETTLES FOR HIS BRAVERY AND SERVICE TO THE UNITED STATES 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Charles Kettles for his outstanding service to the United States during the Vietnam War. LTC Kettles’ quick thinking and actions during a firefight with the enemy singlehandedly saved the lives of 44 fellow service members. LTC Kettles began his military career in 1951 when he was drafted into the Army. He was then commissioned as an armor officer in the Army Reserve in 1953 and subsequently graduated from Army Aviation School, after which time he served active duty tours in Japan, Korea and Thailand. Kettles returned to serve in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, where he demonstrated outstanding her-oism and service on behalf of the country. On May 15, 1967, after an airborne infantry unit was ambushed in the Song Tra Cau riv-erbed in Vietnam by the North Vietnamese Army, then-Major Kettles led three helicopter flights into extremely hostile territory to deliver supplies, reinforcements, and evacuate the wounded and trapped. During the final flight, shortly after leaving the landing zone, then- Major Kettles was informed that eight soldiers remained on the ground. Without hesitating, he returned on his own, without regard for his own safety and with no other support, to res-cue the remaining men. For his actions, LTC Kettles was awarded the Medal of Honor on June 18, 2016, following a large grassroots ef-fort as well as a special Act of Congress to waive the time limit for the award. LTC Kettles is a true American hero whose bravery and courage under fire are extraor-dinary and worthy of special commendation. With the efforts of the Veterans History Project, his friends and family, as well as a bi-partisan effort from Congress, LTC Kettles was finally able to receive the recognition he deserved. It is a privilege to honor LTC Kettles for his selfless actions that saved so many lives. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring LTC Charles Kettles for record of bravery during the Vietnam War. His actions will stand the test of time as an example of true valor and courage.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE GRAND OPENING OF MOPAR’S WIN-CHESTER PARTS DISTRIBUTION CENTER 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with you and our colleagues the news of an infusion of economic vitality in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District. On Tuesday, April 18th, Mopar, the service, parts and customer- care brand of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, will have celebrated the Grand Opening of a 400,000-plus square foot parts distribution center outside of Winchester, in the northern Shenandoah Valley. When fully operational this November, Mopar will have hired 70 work-ers who, each year, will be shipping 9.2 million auto parts to a couple hundred dealerships in the mid-Atlantic region. Mopar has signed a 15-year lease with Equus Capital Partners and will invest $12.2 million into equipment for the facility. First introduced as the name of a line of antifreeze products in 1937, the Mopar brand, which comes from a contraction of the words ‘‘motor parts,’’ celebrates 80 years of a signifi-cant transformation that today encompasses total service, parts and customer care for Fiat Chrysler Automobile owners around the globe. The choice of Frederick County, Virginia is an ideal location for Mopar in fulfilling its goal of better and more efficiently servicing Mid-At-lantic regional dealers. Located at the mid- point of the East Coast, Mopar will be able to move product in and out of Frederick County with ease via multiple highways, including Interstates 81 and 66. Frederick County’s pro- business tax structure and important workforce development initiatives have led to the county being recognized as among the top 10 percent of all Virginia localities for new job creation and top 15 percent for capital investment over the past decade. In fact, Forbes lists Frederick County and the greater Winchester region as among the top 20 ‘‘best small places for busi-ness and careers’’ in the nation. The quality of the workforce is a critically important consideration of companies as they make decisions about where to locate their operations and I am proud of my constituents in the northern Shenandoah Valley for being the hard working, well-educated workforce that attracts employers to the area. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our col-leagues join me in congratulating Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ Mopar, for 80 years of success and for hiring American workers to distribute automobile parts to customers around the na-tion, including an additional 70 workers who will be hired at the newly established distribu-tion center in Frederick County, Virginia. f

EARTH FRIENDLY PRODUCTS 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize a family-owned and oper-ated company celebrating its 50th anniversary on April 21, 2017. When it comes to trends that will keep America competitive in the global economy for generations to come, we think of innovation, entrepreneurship, environmentally friendly businesses, and manufacturing. I was sent to Congress by my constituents to look for inno-vative ways to bring these trends together, and today I am reminded that a shining exam-ple resides right here in my district in Addison, Illinois. The founding of Earth Friendly Products (ECOS) is a story that rivals any other. The founder, Van Vlahakis, immigrated from Greece to the United States with $22 in his pocket in 1953 to escape poverty after World War II. First living in homeless shelters and speaking little English, he went on to study chemistry at Roosevelt University while work-ing the night shift at a cleaning products com-pany. During his work, he was exposed to harsh chemicals that gave him headaches and caused co-workers to suffer from rashes and other irritations. Remembering that his mother in Greece used natural substances such as water, vinegar and olive oil for cleaning, Vlahakis decided to start his own business to make better cleaning products. In 1967, he created in his home’s garage what would be-come Earth Friendly Products. ECOS now sells more than 200 environmentally friendly cleaning products in more than 60 countries and has been recognized with safety awards by the Environmental Protection Agency. We all know we need to make more things in America again. ECOS is a great example of using clean technology to do that while still creating jobs for Illinois working families. Transforming Illinois into a center for science, technology, and innovation is the kind of op-portunity that many of us envision for our state. This 50th anniversary for ECOS is an opportunity to remind the country that we can continue to use clean products that protect the environment while creating good-paying jobs at the same time. For ECOS, that means a $17 per hour companywide minimum wage started by the company in 2014. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have Earth Friendly Products in my district, and I look for-ward to the company continuing to create jobs for my constituents for the next 50 years. I cel-ebrate the 50th anniversary of ECOS and the impact the company has had throughout the country. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF DICK THELEN FOR HIS OUTSTANDING SERVICE DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dick Thelen for being named a fi-nalist for the Wins for Warriors Veteran of the Year Award at the 2017 Governor’s Fitness Awards Banquet. Mr. Thelen served his coun-try with distinction and demonstrated extraor-dinary courage during the sinking of the USS Indianapolis during World War II. Mr. Thelen, born and raised in Lansing, Michigan, joined the United States Navy in 1944 at the age of 17. The following year, he was posted on the USS Indianapolis in the Pacific as it was tasked with delivering the first atomic bomb to the Mariana Islands. After completing this task, the ship moved toward the Philippines to meet up with the 7th Fleet in preparation for a possible invasion of the Japanese mainland. However, during its voy-age, the USS Indianapolis was attacked and sunk by a Japanese submarine. In the after-math, Thelen and hundreds of other sailors were forced to float in the water for days while awaiting rescue. Of the crew of 1,197, only 317, including Thelen, made it home. Thelen is a true hero who endured unspeak-able hardship during his service to the United States. His actions and cool head during the aftermath of the USS Indianapolis sinking saved lives, and perseverance and character during these difficult circumstances speaks to his resourcefulness and tenacity. It is heart-ening to see Mr. Thelen continue to be recog-nized for his heroism, and events like these provide an important opportunity to reflect on the sacrifices our veterans make for our coun-try and the values that it represents. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dick Thelen for being named a fi-nalist for the 2017 Wins for Warriors Veteran of the Year Award. Mr. Thelen is a true hero who has made tremendous sacrifices on be-half of our country.

TRIBUTE TO CINDY COOKE, DNP, FNP–C, FAANP, AMERICAN ASSO-CIATION OF NURSE PRACTI-TIONERS 
HON. MO BROOKS 
OF ALABAMA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I recognize a constituent of mine, Cindy Cooke, DNP, FNP–C, FAANP, of Huntsville, Alabama, for her service over the last two years as President of the Amer-ican Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP). Dr. Cooke has an exemplary career of serv-ice with 42 years as an experienced nurse and nurse practitioner. As a nationally board certified family nurse practitioner, Dr. Cooke has provided care to patients for 18 years and for over 12 years exclusively to active duty and retired military members and their families Dr. Cooke has been involved in local, state, and national nurse practitioner organizations. Prior to her term as AANP President, Dr. Cooke was past President of North Alabama Nurse Practitioner Association (NANPA), the founding President of the Nurse Practitioner Alliance of Alabama (NPAA), past American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) State Representative for Alabama, and past AANP Regional Director. Dr. Cooke has been active in speaking locally and nationally on various clinical and health policy topics. She was elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners in 2009. The American Association of Nurse Practi-tioners is a national professional membership organization representing over 225,000 nurse practitioners nationally. Under Dr. Cooke’s ten-ure, AANP membership has grown to more than 75,000 members, making AANP the larg-est nurse practitioner organization in the world. Dr. Cooke has helped lead nurse practi-tioners in transforming patient-centered health care and has made tremendous strides in en-suring that policy makers and the public un-derstand the care that nurse practitioners pro-vide to millions of Americans each year. I urge my colleagues to join me in congratu-lating Dr. Cooke on a successful term as President of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners and in thanking her for the excellent care she has provided to her pa-tients, the nurse practitioner profession, and the constituents in the Fifth District of Ala-bama. f

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 60TH AN-NIVERSARY OF THE MANASSAS BASEBALL LEAGUE 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 60th anniversary of the Greater Manassas Baseball League and express grati-tude to all those that have contributed both to the success of this volunteer organization and to the development of the youth of Manassas and Prince William County. In spring of 1957, the league was estab-lished with only 4 teams—Manassas Lumber, Mifco (Manassas Ice and Fuel Company), Merchant’s Firestone, and Martin Chevrolet— also known as ‘‘The Four M’s.’’ Each team was fully sponsored by local businesses, which contributed greatly to the community feel of this small-town little league. In fact, Mifco, after 60 years, remains a proud spon-sor of the league. In 1978, the late Harry J. Parrish, who was then mayor of Manassas, and Caton Merchant spearheaded the efforts to expand the league, renaming it The Greater Manassas Baseball League. Then in 1981, IBM donated land to the City of Manassas for the construction of a baseball complex. The league today, under the leadership of Presi-dent Kevin Jennings, consists of nearly 75 teams across all age groups, hosts a variety of fundraisers and events, and still uses the original baseball complex constructed in 1981. I owe a great debt of gratitude to the Ma-nassas community, local businesses, parents, and coaches for supporting the league throughout the course of its 60-year existence. Today, the league affords many of my young constituents the opportunity to learn the values of confidence and positive character through the various lessons taught in baseball and softball. Sports not only promote healthy living and foster personal growth, but they also are an excellent way to engage with our youth. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that my colleagues join me in thanking the Greater Manassas Baseball League and its current President, Kevin Jennings, for their commitment to the youth of Manassas. I wish Mr. Jennings, the rest of the Board of Directors, parents, coach-es, and all of the little-leaguers the best in their collaborative efforts and future endeav-ors.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE STOUT THEATRE COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTION OF ALADDIN JR. 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 20, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Stout Theatre Company on the opening date of its production of Aladdin Jr. For the past three years, the Stout Theatre has provided entertainment and enrichment activities for Dearborn youth through its pro-duction and showcasing of musical theatre. Founded in 2014, the Stout Theatre Com-pany is a student-led enterprise that provides opportunities for personal expression, growth and creativity through its production of plays and community events. STC began at Stout Middle School in Dearborn, Michigan, but has since expanded and now works with youth in surrounding elementary and middle schools to stage musical and dramatic productions. In addition to performing the musical Aladdin Jr., past STC productions have included Hairspray and a musical adaptation of the film Stand and Deliver. The success of these productions has established STC as an important pillar of the community. STC has not only provided entertainment to the greater Dearborn community, but its pro-ductions help provide opportunities for leader-ship, growth and personal development for Dearborn area students. The months of re-hearsals in preparation for the production are a testament to the hard work and dedication of the students and staff involved, and the cre-ativity and dedication of all involved in this un-dertaking have been key to making the play a success. The STC continues to distinguish itself through its elaborate production and strong performances of the featured students, and it is my hope that the STC will continue to build on the success of previous produc-tions while providing students with the oppor-tunity to gain teamwork and valuable life skills in the years ahead. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Stout Theatre Company for its record of success on the date of its premiere of Aladdin Jr. The students and staff involved in these and other productions have continued to demonstrate their talent and commitment.
