Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor George ‘‘Boogie’’ Cochran, Jr., who passed away peacefully at the age of 89 on March 1. Mr. Speaker, Chief Cochran lived a life in full, one of family and of service. As a 17yearold Leon High School student, he enlisted in the Navy in 1944. He served bravely aboard Navy destroyers in the Pacific campaigns. He participated in America’s nuclear weapons testing after the war, and in the action surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1963, in recognition of his dedicated and courageous service in the Navy, Chief Cochran was awarded the first annual Commander Ernest Evans Memorial Award aboard the USS Johnston. He loved his family, his country, and his community. He represents the best of America. Boogie, you will be missed by many, and may you rest in peace. f 
OPPOSING THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, my constituents have been calling all weekend. They do not support the Republican health care bill, TrumpCare. Over the weekend, we received 750 calls or emails. Ninetythree percent of those have contacted me to say that they are against TrumpCare, and here is why: Higher costs for less care; $2,400 annually for an average American family. Millions kicked off health care. The Congressional Budget Office says 24 million. Some might say they are way off. So maybe it is 20 million. Maybe it is 30 million. Lots of Americans lose health care as a result of this plan. An age tax. If you are age 50 to 65, fasten your seat belts; $6,971 in increased costs for lesser health care. And huge, huge tax breaks for millionaires. The 400 richest Americans would get an average $7 million tax break. This is not the right direction for this country. It is not the right direction for health care. We should reject it. 
RECOGNIZING SHELBY TOWNSHIP, MICHIGAN, POLICE OFFICERS (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight an act of bravery from police officers in an incident occurring just miles from my district office in Shelby Township, Michigan. 
In midFebruary, Sergeant Troy Titchenell and Officer Paul Fox responded to a call that a boy had fallen through the ice on Iroquois Lake. Sergeant Titchenell, without concern for himself, first on the scene, immediately got a life ring from a local resident and walked onto the ice. Officer Fox then arrived and walked onto the ice to take the rope attached to the life ring. While towing the young man to safety, the ice broke and Sergeant Titchenell was submerged in the water up to his chest. With Officer Fox pulling on the rope and Sergeant Titchenell supporting the boy in the water, both were able to rescue the young man. I believe they saved a life that day. This incident exemplifies the risks police officers will take to protect all of us. Their daily acts of bravery must be recognized. I am proud to highlight the actions of these courageous officers, and I am grateful to recognize their service to our community. 
IN SUPPORT OF THE GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of one of our most magnificent natural wonders: the Great Lakes. They contain a fifth of the world’s freshwater and are vitally important to the economy and the quality of life in my district. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which has received strong support from both sides of the aisle, works to clean up the Great Lakes, control invasive species, restore habitats, and reduce runoff. Yet we have heard that President Trump may virtually eliminate this critical program with an eye popping irresponsible 97 percent cut to the budget; $300 million in funding would be reduced to just $10 million. At the same time, his administration may gut EPA funds for climate science, clean air, and safe water. Let me be clear. I am adamantly opposed to these cuts and will do everything in my power to stop them. Tomorrow, on Great Lakes Day, the President is expected to release a budget proposal. I urge him to include robust funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and the EPA programs and ensure we pass on a sustainable, healthy planet to our children. 
IMPROVE THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Original Pizza in Broomfield, Colorado, has been in business since the 1990s. Now they are being sued. The plaintiff claims they do not have ADAaccessible parking signage or proper insulation wrapped around the pipes under the restroom sink. The claims waged against Original Pizza are mostly false. The sink is compliant, and the parking issue could be fixed with a better sign and a bit of paint. Not to mention, Original Pizza was never notified of the alleged violations by the plaintiff. Now the plaintiff is demanding money to pay or a lawsuit will be filed. The same plaintiff has filed over 70 other lawsuits against businesses for alleged ADA violations. Plaintiffs and attorneys hope companies will decide to settle rather than face an expensive court trial. The ADA Education and Reform Act will require giving businesses notice and time to fix the alleged infraction before the lawsuit is filed. Notice and cure are a fair way to handle ADA violations. And that is just the way it is. f 
CELEBRATING ADMIRAL LLOYD ‘‘JOE’’ VASEY’S 100TH BIRTHDAY (Ms. HANABUSA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to send my warmest aloha to Admiral Lloyd ‘‘Joe’’ Vasey on his belated 100th birthday celebration tonight in Honolulu. After graduating from the United States Naval Academy in 1939, Admiral Vasey joined the submarine service and served under John S. McCain, Jr., father of United States Senator JOHN MCCAIN. After the war and a long and distinguished service to our Nation, Admiral Vasey formed the CSIS Pacific Forum, with the goal of promoting peace in Asia Pacific. He is why we call the men and women of his time the Greatest Generation. I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring the admiral by working to help make his dream of a Pacific War Memorial at Pearl Harbor a reality. In his words: ‘‘There is no recognition for well over 150,000 brave Americans who were lost in the Pacific War. We need to honor them, and their families need a place to mourn.’’ Admiral Vasey’s patriotism, devotion to duty, and desire for peace should be an example for us all. Happy birthday, Admiral Vasey, and may you continue to have fair winds and following seas. 
DENNIS COUNIHAN SELECTED AS SAVANNAH’S ST. PATRICK’S DAY PARADE GRAND MARSHAL (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Dennis Counihan for being named grand marshal of Savannah’s 2017 St. Patrick’s Day Parade. The annual St. Patrick’s Day Parade in Savannah has been a beloved local tradition and an important family affair since its beginning in 1824. Welcoming visitors from all over the world to celebrate its Irish heritage, Savannah astonishingly hosts the third largest St. Patrick’s Day Parade in the world and the second largest in the United States. As such, the position of grand marshal is not to be taken lightly. This year there were a recordsetting six nominees vying for the position, but Mr. Counihan rose above the rest due to his experience and dedication to Savannah. Mr. Counihan’s love for his community is emphasized through his work with the Hollander Senior Living company, where he purchases old real estate to be redesigned as nursing homes. It seems as if Mr. Counihan was destined to be grand marshal, considering his family’s role in the parade over the years. His brother Brian is currently the parade chairman, and his father, Michael, served as the parade’s grand marshal in 1988. Mr. Counihan has been on the parade committee since 1980. He certainly knows the dedicated effort that goes into making this event special and successful. Congratulations, Mr. Counihan, on this great honor. I look forward to seeing the new additions you will bring to the parade. f 
INVESTING IN AMERICA’S INFRASTRUCTURE (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate for a national infrastructure plan. I represent the central coast of California, and this winter we got rain. We got a lot of rain. So much so that it caused millions in damage to the area, including the closure of the famous Highway 1 in Big Sur, with major mudslides in the south and the loss of the 315foot Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge in Big Sur. That damage has left 450 people isolated: kids can’t get to school; families are separated; and employers and employees are suffering, including the loss of $8 million in 1 month in the offseason. But the effects of that damage extend beyond Big Sur to the surrounding towns, counties, and, actually, the entire State of California. People from all over the world come to Big Sur. They drive down from San Francisco. They drive up from Los Angeles. They patronize towns all along their way to Big Sur. We understand why. It is the most beautiful place in the world. It is my home. And we want it to be open to all of you. 
It is time that the Congress and our President help Americans by investing in our American infrastructure. 
b1645 THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING DACA (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to stress the importance of maintaining Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, commonly known as DACA. DACA recipients were brought here to the United States as children, and in most cases America is the only home they have ever known. They want to contribute to our economy, to our society, and our country; and they will, unless we are foolish enough to stop them. Taking any step against DACA would not only hurt DACA recipients, it would hurt the United States. Let’s protect these promising youth and keep this program intact while we work out a humane path to citizenship. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 132, sponsored by Congressman TOM COLEof Oklahoma, conveys two buildings and two acres of land of the federal Arbuckle Project to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District in Oklahoma. The district has operated and maintained the project for decades, and completed repayment of its capital costs for the project in 2012. While noncontroversial, legislation is necessary in order to facilitate this and other Bureau of Reclamation title transfers. Under current law, these buildings and land remain in federal ownership until legislation is enacted to transfer the title to the District. Mr. COLE’s bill achieves this objective. This title transfer is a winwin for the District and the federal government. The District will no longer be subject to certain federal paperwork requirements and the federal government will be relieved of all future liability and financial responsibilities associated with these facilities and land. I urge adoption of the measure, which overwhelmingly passed the House on a bipartisan basis in the last Congress. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 132 would allow a title transfer of two Federal buildings to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District in south central Oklahoma. These buildings are part of the Arbuckle Project, which is a water project authorized by Congress in 1962 to provide flood control, recreational opportunities, and municipal water supply. Nearly all of the facilities within the Arbuckle Project were already transferred to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District in 2012 after the district finished repaying what it owed the Federal Government for construction. However, due to some overly narrow language in the legislation authorizing the Arbuckle Project, two buildings within the project have yet to be transferred. Transferring the two remaining buildings will save taxpayer money that would otherwise be needed to operate and maintain the buildings and will also relieve the Federal Government of any potential future liability associated with the buildings. This is straightforward legislation that should be quickly passed. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WEBSTER of Florida). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 132. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. f 
APPROVING THE LOCATION OF A MEMORIAL TO COMMEMORATE AND HONOR THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES WHO SERVED ON ACTIVE DUTY IN SUPPORT OF OPERATION DESERT STORM OR OPERATION DESERT SHIELD Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker’s table the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 1) approving the location of a memorial to commemorate and honor the members of the Armed Forces who served on active duty in support of Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: 
S.J. R ES. 1 Whereas section 8908(b)(1) of title 40, United States Code, provides that the location of a commemorative work in Area I, as depicted on the map entitled ‘‘Commemorative Areas Washington, DC and Environs’’, numbered 869/86501 B, and dated June 24, 2003, shall be deemed to be authorized only if a recommendation for the location is approved by law not later than 150 calendar days after the date on which Congress is notified of the recommendation; Whereas section 3093 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. ‘‘Buck’’ McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note; Public Law 113–291) authorized the National Desert Storm Memorial Association to establish a memorial on Federal land in the District of Columbia, to honor the members of the Armed Forces who served on active duty in support of Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield; and Whereas the Secretary of the Interior has notified Congress of the determination of the Secretary of the Interior that the memorial should be located in Area I: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the location of a commemorative work to commemorate and honor the members of the Armed Forces who served on active duty in support of Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield authorized by section 3093 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. ‘‘Buck’’ McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (40 U.S.C. 8903 note; Public Law 113–291), within Area I, as depicted on the map entitled ‘‘Commemorative Areas Washington, DC and Environs’’, numbered 869/86501 B, and dated June 24, 2003, is approved. 
The joint resolution was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
AUTHORIZING THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR TO AMEND THE DEFINITE PLAN REPORT FOR THE SEEDSKADEE PROJECT Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 648) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to amend the Definite Plan Report for the Seedskadee Project to enable the use of the active capacity of the Fontenelle Reservoir. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 648 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO MAKE ENTIRE ACTIVE CAPACITY OF FONTENELLE RESERVOIR AVAILABLE FOR USE. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with the State of Wyoming, may amend the Definite Plan Report for the Seedskadee Project authorized under the first section of the Act of April 11, 1956 (commonly known as the ‘‘Colorado River Storage Project Act’’ (43 U.S.C. 620)) to provide for the study, design, planning, and construction activities that will enable the use of all active storage capacity (as may be defined or limited by legal, hydrologic, structural, engineering, economic, and environmental considerations) of Fontenelle Dam and Reservoir, including the placement of sufficient riprap on the upstream face of Fontenelle Dam to allow the active storage capacity of Fontenelle Reservoir to be used for those purposes for which the Seedskadee Project was authorized.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 648, sponsored by the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ), allows the State of Wyoming to increase the active storage capacity for the Fontenelle Dam and Reservoir located in southwest Wyoming. The bill allows the State to enter into agreements with the Federal Government to study, design, plan, and perform construction activities to accomplish this goal. Wyoming will pay for any and all costs associated with these activities. This bill, which passed the House without objection in the last Congress when it was sponsored by our former colleague Cynthia Lummis, simply empowers Wyoming to better utilize its Colorado River water allocation through improved water storage at no cost to the Federal Government. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 648 would increase the amount of water that can be stored in the Fontenelle Reservoir in Lincoln County, Wyoming, by allowing the active storage capacity of the reservoir to be used. This bill has been written in a balanced manner that respects existing laws, compacts, and treaties, and does not attempt to expand Wyoming’s entitlement to Colorado River supplies at the expense of other Colorado River Basin States. H.R. 648 is a straightforward, noncontroversial piece of legislation that is identical to a bill that was unanimously passed by the Committee on Natural Resources last Congress. I support H.R. 648 and urge its adoption. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY). Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Colorado and my colleague from Maryland for their support of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 648 so that we could begin the work necessary to increase the active storage capacity of the Fontenelle Reservoir. As a headwater State, Wyoming takes care of its water, and we know that water is our most important natural resource. Water uses currently at this dam span the gamut from irrigation, domestic, industrial, municipal, fish and wildlife, and recreation. Power generation is a secondary purpose at the dam, and current uses also include industrial capacity for our trona miners, fertilizer producers, and fulfillment of a range of energy needs. Mr. Speaker, this bill would simply authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to enter into a cooperative agreement with the State of Wyoming so that we could begin the process to study, design, and construct increased capacity for the reservoir. This is a process, Mr. Speaker, that has been held up previously by onerous NEPA requirements, and we need to move quickly so that we can begin to increase this capacity. Currently the reservoir has 265,000 acrefeet to accommodate water as active capacity. This legislation would potentially add an additional 80,000 acrefeet of existing reservoir space. This bill would provide an affordable and efficient way to add more usable storage in the Colorado River Basin 
and would accomplish these goals without contemplating the construction of a new dam. The bill has the support of the Wyoming Water Development Office and the Wyoming Water Development Commission, which develops our State’s water resources for conservation, storage, distribution, recreation, and other public interests. Our Governor Matt Mead included this concept in the 2015 Wyoming water strategy. Mr. Speaker, this bill will empower Wyoming to better utilize our water allocation and improve our water storage, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 648. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK ACT OF 2017 Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 267) to redesignate the Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site in the State of Georgia, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 267 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 2. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK. 
The Act entitled ‘‘An Act to establish the Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site in the State of Georgia, and for other purposes’’ (Public Law 96–428) is amended— (1) in subsection (a) of the first section, by striking ‘‘the map entitled ‘Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site Boundary Map’, number 489/80,013B, and dated September 1992’’ and inserting ‘‘the map entitled ‘Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park Proposed Boundary Revision’, numbered 489/128,786 and dated June 2015’’; (2) by striking ‘‘Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site’’ each place it appears and inserting ‘‘Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park’’; (3) by striking ‘‘national historic site’’ each place it appears and inserting ‘‘national historical park’’; and (4) by striking ‘‘historic site’’ each place it appears and inserting ‘‘historical park’’. SEC. 3. REFERENCES. 
Any reference in a law (other than this Act), map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to ‘‘Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site’’ shall be deemed to be a reference to ‘‘Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 267, introduced by Congressman JOHNLEWIS, redesignates the Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site in the State of Georgia as the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park. It also authorizes the National Park Service to include the Prince Hall Masonic Temple in the historical park’s boundaries. The Prince Hall Masonic Temple long served as the headquarters of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. This wellknown civil rights organization was cofounded by Dr. King, who also served as its first president. Including the Prince Hall Masonic Temple within the unit’s boundaries will allow the National Park Service to provide technical assistance to the building’s owners with regard to repairs, renovations, and maintenance that will preserve its historic integrity. Our Nation’s historic sites and historical parks provide us with the unique opportunity to share the very spaces in which the generations before us lived and worked. At these sites, Americans are able to metaphorically walk in the footsteps of our Nation’s Founders and of those who followed them and perfected their vision for our country. At this time of division in our country, it is important to be able to look back at leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr., who promoted unity and the dignity of the human person. Congressman LEWIS’ bill before the House today will expand opportunities for Americans to learn about the legacy of Dr. King and other icons of the civil rights movement. I urge adoption of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 267 is an important and historically significant piece of legislation that has broad bipartisan support. In fact, it passed the House on a voice vote just over a year ago. The bill accomplishes two primary goals: to designate the Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site in Atlanta, Georgia, as a national historical park; and to adjust the boundary of the park to include the Prince Hall Masonic Temple, the first headquarters of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Taken together, these actions will enhance the National Park Service’s ability to tell and elevate the story of Dr. King. The site, which is the final resting place of the great civil rights leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., continues to connect visitors with the historical and contemporary struggles for civil rights in this country. b1700 These stories are as relevant today as they were half a century ago. By officially designating the area as a national historical park, this legislation will provide the site with the acknowledgement it so justly deserves. Lastly, I want to thank Congressman LEWIS, who remains an important and iconic civil rights leader, for bringing this important bill forward. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS), my esteemed colleague. Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado and the gentleman from Maryland for supporting this legislation. I am a proud sponsor of the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park Act. First, let me thank each and every member and the staff from the Natural Resources Committee for their hard work and support of this act. Mr. Speaker, this nonpartisan bill will simply change these historic Atlanta places from being a site to a park. At no additional cost to taxpayers, this bill will create the first national historic park in the State of Georgia. This small change will significantly improve the way the National Park Service preserves, shares, and presents the history of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., site or park. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was our moral compass. He represented the best of America. His mission was to create the beloved community, a community at peace with itself and our neighbors. Throughout his life, Dr. King urged each and every one of us to recognize the dignity and worth of every human being. Passing this simple piece of legislation will improve how this important history and legacy is shared with visitors from across our country and from around the world. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chair and ranking member for their support of this legislation. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ). Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in proud support, and I join my colleague, Congressman LEWIS, in supporting H.R. 267 and its efforts to redesignate the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site as the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park. For decades, large numbers of people have descended on this site to see the birthplace where the dreamer was moved by destiny into leadership of the modern civil rights movement. The site as it stands now, which also contains the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, has faced hardships over the years leading to budget cutbacks and a decrease in staff. H.R. 267 would increase funding that would help preserve this American landmark and increase the size of the park so that future generations can continue to visit and enjoy. Just like Dr. King never led a march without a plan, we shouldn’t leave this critical piece of the civil rights movement without a plan for its future. We should continue to work to preserve the place where Dr. King was born, lived, worked, worshipped, and where he is buried. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of H.R. 267, the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park Act of 2017. The time has come to update the historic sites and monuments at the Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site. This common sense legislation seeks to end the current restrictions that prevent the site from adopting the proposed ‘‘Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park Proposed Boundary Revision’’ and reclassifying the landmark more appropriately as a ‘‘National Park.’’ Originally, this site established in 1980, encompassed the portions of Auburn Avenue in Atlanta, Georgia, the house in which Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was born, and the Ebenezer Baptist Church where Dr. King’s family prayed. Public Law 96–428 memorialized these buildings with the intent to ‘‘protect and interpret for the benefit, inspiration and education of present and future generations the places where Martin Luther King, Jr. was born, where he lived, worked, and worshipped, and where he is buried.’’ Unfortunately, the MLK National Historic Site remains classified as a ‘‘National Site.’’ The National Park Service defines areas with similar geography and size as national parks. The title ‘‘National Site’’ no longer fits with the current structure of this historic landmark. The current boundaries of site limit the National Park Service’s ability to conserve important landmarks in Atlanta. The provisions outlined in this bill will allow the site to expand and in turn preserve the history of Dr. King’s life for thousands of Americans to personally experience and ensure our nation never forgets his dream. An extension of the current boundaries of the site would help greater serve the mission of the site. Dr. King altered the course of American history. Our nation’s citizens owe a debt to the sacrifices and tireless crusade led by this great man. Dr. King encouraged love and empathy for in the hearts of countless Americans. His contribution to humanity has been priceless. We must never forget the sacrifices made by the heroes of the Civil Rights Movement. I stand with my esteemed colleague and civil rights champion, Congressman J OHN LEWIS, who proposed this legislation. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I again urge adoption of this important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I take great pleasure that we may come to the floor today to celebrate and recognize the remarkable legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. King is characterized by modeling his life after Jesus Christ in order to live a life dedicated to the service of others, whether that be preaching the Gospel to his congregation at Ebenezer Baptist Church, or to the pursuit of justice and equality. Mr. Speaker, my home state of Georgia has the great honor of preserving King’s legacy at the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site. And today we have the opportunity under the leadership of my friend and fellow Georgian, JOHN LEWIS, to pass H.R. 267, the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park Act, to redesignate the site as a National Historic Park. I strongly believe that this site meets and exceeds the requirements for redesignation as a National Historic Park and fully support my friend in his effort. Mr. Speaker, I’d like to thank Congressman LEWIS for leading this legislation. As a cosponsor of this bill, a member of the Committee on Natural Resources, and as a fellow Georgian, I offer my strongest support and encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 267. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 267, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 6:30 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 5 o’clock and 5 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. f 
b1830 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. SIMPSON ) at 6 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, March 15, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER : Pursuant to the permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Clerk received the following message from the Secretary of the Senate on March 15, 2017, at 5:42 p.m.: That the Senate passed without amendment H.R. 1362. With best wishes, I am, Sincerely, KAREN L. H AAS. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, the form of the remainder of the resolution is as follows: Whereas, in the United States’ system of checks and balances, Congress has a responsibility to hold the executive branch of government to the highest standard of transparency to ensure the public interest is placed first; Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President after Richard Nixon has disclosed their tax return information to the public; Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline disclosure because they contain highly instructive information including whether the candidate paid taxes, what they own, what they have borrowed and from whom, whether they have made any charitable donations, and whether they have taken advantage of tax loopholes; Whereas, disclosure of the President’s tax returns could help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election understand the President’s financial ties to the Russian Federation and Russian citizens, including debts owed, and whether he shares any partnership interests, equity interests, joint ventures, or licensing agreements with Russia or Russians; Whereas, it has been reported that President Trump’s close senior advisers, including Carter Page, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and General Michael Flynn, have been under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their ties to the Russian Federation; Whereas, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Interfax, a Russian media outlet, on November 10, 2016, that ‘‘there were contacts’’ with Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, and it has been reported that members of President Trump’s inner circle were in contact with senior Russian officials throughout the 2016 campaign; Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in companies located in the United States and around the world; Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses; Whereas, the Director of the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics said that the President’s plan to transfer his business holdings to a trust managed by family members is ‘‘meaningless’’ and ‘‘does not meet the standards that . . . every President in the past four decades has met’’; Whereas, the the Emoluments Clause was included in the U.S. Constitution for the express purpose of preventing federal officials from accepting any ‘‘present, Emolument, Office, or Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state’’; Whereas, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., has hired a ‘‘director of diplomatic sales’’ to generate highpriced business among foreign leaders and diplomatic delegations; Whereas, the Trump International Hotel could receive up to $60,000 from the Kuwaiti government for a party it held at the hotel on February 22, 2017; Whereas, the President used a legally dubious tax maneuver in 1995 that could have allowed him to avoid paying federal taxes for 18 years; Whereas, the public still does not have a thorough understanding of the influences and conflicts President Trump has due to his various foreign and domestic business interests; Whereas, on January 30, 2017, President Trump publicly issued an executive order announcing that pipeline makers in the U.S. must use American made steel in their projects; Whereas, on March 3, 2017, President Trump quietly reversed himself, issuing an order allowing the steel for the Keystone pipeline to be imported from foreign countries; Whereas, without direct knowledge on the conflicts this President has due to his business interests, he could be advancing policies that create an uneven playing field for working Americans; Whereas, the public should be able to examine his business interests, relationships, and conflicts to ensure that all policies put forward by the Trump administration solely benefit the American public and not his corporate business partners; Whereas, the most signed petition on the White House website calls for the release of the President’s tax return information to verify compliance with the Emoluments Clause, with 1,082,000 signatures as of the date of this resolution; Whereas, the Chairmen of the Ways and Means Committee, Joint Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee have the authority to request the President’s tax returns under Section 6103 of the tax code; Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the information public; Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103 authority in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers; Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to international affairs, tax reform, government contracts, or otherwise: Now, therefore, be it resolved, that the House of Representatives shall: 
One, immediately request the tax return information of Donald J. Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as provided under Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and vote to report the information therein to the full House of Representatives; Two, support transparency in government and the longstanding tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates disclosing their tax returns. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will now recognize the gentleman from New York to offer the resolution just noticed. Does the gentleman offer the resolution? Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I offer my resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution. The Clerk read as follows: 
RESOLUTION  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President shall immediately disclose his tax return information to Congress and the American people. Whereas, in the United States’ system of checks and balances, Congress has a responsibility to hold the Executive Branch of government to the highest standard of transparency to ensure the public interest is placed first; Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President after Richard Nixon has disclosed their tax return information to the public; Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline disclosure because they contain highly instructive information including whether the candidate paid taxes, what they own, what they have borrowed and from whom, whether they have made any charitable donations, and whether they have taken advantage of tax loopholes; Whereas, disclosure of the President’s tax returns could help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election, understand the President’s financial ties to the Russian Federation and Russian citizens, including debts owed, and whether he shares any partnership interests, equity interests, joint ventures or licensing agreements with Russia or Russians; Whereas, it has been reported that President Trump’s close senior advisers, including Carter Page, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and General Michael Flynn, have been under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their ties to the Russian Federation; Whereas, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Intertfax, a Russian media outlet, on November 10, 2016 that ‘‘there were contacts’’ with Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, and it has been reported that members of President Trump’s inner circle were in contact with senior Russian officials throughout the 2016 campaign; Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in companies located in the United States and around the world; Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses; Whereas, the director of the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics said that the President’s plan to transfer his business holdings to a trust managed by family members is ‘‘meaningless’’ and ‘‘does not meet the standards that . . . every president in the past four decades has met’’; Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the U.S. Constitution for the express purpose of preventing federal officials from accepting any ‘‘present, Emolument, Office, or Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state’’; Whereas, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. has hired a ‘‘director of diplomatic sales’’ to generate highpriced business among foreign leaders and diplomatic delegations; Whereas, the Trump International Hotel could receive up to $60,000 from the Kuwaiti government for a party it held at the hotel on February 22, 2017; Whereas, the President used a legally dubious tax maneuver in 1995 that could have allowed him to avoid paying federal taxes for 18 years; Whereas the public still does not have a thorough understanding of the influences and conflicts President Trump has due to his various foreign and domestic business interests; Whereas on January 30, 2017 President Trump publicly issued an executive order announcing that pipeline makers in the US must use Americanmade steel in their projects; Whereas on March 3, 2017 President Trump quietly reversed himself, issuing an order allowing the steel for the Keystone Pipeline to be imported from foreign countries; Whereas without direct knowledge on the conflicts this President has due to his business interests, he could be advancing policies that create an uneven playing field for working Americans; Whereas the public should be able to examine his business interests, relationships, and conflicts to ensure that all policies put forward by the Trump Administration solely benefit the American public and not his corporate business partners; Whereas, the most signed petition on the White House website calls for the release of the President’s tax return information to verify compliance with the Emoluments Clause, with 1 million, 82 thousand signatures as of the date of this resolution; Whereas, the Chairmen of the Ways and Means Committee, Joint Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee have the authority to request the President’s tax returns under Section 6103 of the tax code; Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the information public; Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103 authority in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers; Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to international affairs, tax reform, government contracts, or otherwise: Now, therefore, be it: Resolved, That the House of Representatives shall— 1. Immediately request the tax return information of Donald J. Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as provided under Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and vote to report the information therein to the full House of Representatives 2. Support transparency in government and the longstanding tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates disclosing their tax returns. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from New York wish to present argument on the parliamentary question whether the resolution presents a question of the privileges of the House? Mr. CROWLEY. Yes, Mr. Speaker, I do. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York is recognized. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, under rule IX, clause 1, questions of the privileges of the House are ‘‘those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.’’ I would argue there is nothing more of a threat to the integrity of the House of Representatives than ignoring our duty to provide a check and balance, as our Founders expected of us, of the executive branch. To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to request President Trump’s tax returns and give the American people the transparency that they deserve. The American people know full well the scope of the President’s financial background, as related by television and the media; but they don’t know the details. Article I, section 9 of the Constitution includes a clause prohibiting foreign emoluments to the President. The Office of Government Ethics has warned us about the President’s decision not to divest or set up a blind trust, and there is a need to fully understand the President’s ties to Russia. Mr. Speaker, we are seeing the President saying one thing, such as mandating the use of Americanmade steel on American pipelines, then quietly reversing himself to allow the use of foreignmade steel on the Keystone Pipeline, which is being built by a Canadian company. The resolution I am offering can provide the transparency to help ease the concerns of Americans in every corner of our country. The Internal Revenue Code includes language laying out a path for the Ways and Means Committee to obtain the tax returns and review them in a respectful way. There is the precedent that I have stated earlier that provides for this to be used. A growing number of Members and Senators from both parties have been saying we should have the President’s tax returns. One of those is Congressman STEVE KNIGHT of California who announced to his constituents that the President’s tax returns should be made public, so I look forward to his support of this resolution. The House must demonstrate that its Members are listening to our constituents’ concerns. The House must demonstrate that it cares about protecting the integrity of the House, of our government, of our Constitution, of our system of checks and balances. Let’s shine a bright light on the President’s conflicts together. We, as the elected Representatives of our constituents and the broader American public, can judge whether his decisions are being made for himself, 
his business, or for the greater good of the American people. At the end of the day, if President Trump has nothing to hide, then he should be willing to do what every President since Richard Nixon has done, and that is, release his tax returns. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind the gentleman from New York that the question is on, and his remarks must be confined to, the question of privilege. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I think I have been toeing that line very closely. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A little bit over it. Mr. CROWLEY. At the very least, even if he continues to hide behind the phony excuse of being under audit, he should release tax returns for 2016 as those are not under audit. Mr. Speaker, this resolution is not about partisanship. It is about America. No, you are not listening to your constituents, my colleagues. It is about America, my colleagues. They want to see these tax returns. The American people expect more from the promise than heckling back and forth. They expect their Representatives from both sides of the aisles to demand these tax returns. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend. The gentleman from New York must keep his remarks confined to the question of the privileges of the House. Mr. CROWLEY. I appreciate that, Mr. Speaker. It is about America, Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. For what purpose does the gentleman from New Jersey seek recognition? Does the gentleman wish to be heard on the question of privilege and on the question of privilege only? Mr. PASCRELL. Yes, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. That is the question before the House. Mr. PASCRELL. I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY). Mr. Speaker, Mr. CROWLEY cited the very source of what our proposal is, and that is, section 6103, and, particularly section 6103(f), of the Tax Code of the United States of America, which has been part of the Tax Code since 1924. Mr. Speaker, this is a wonderful part of the Tax Code. Take my word for it. And it has been a wonderful part of the Tax Code since 1924. It is very clear the main argument against this proposal, this resolution, has been over the last several weeks that this is an administrative part of the Tax Code. I would submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that this is not simply arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. This has to do with all of us. This has to do with what we put in to our tax files when we submit them to the IRS. There is real authority when you read this section, Mr. Speaker. I can assure you I will not read it. That will be for another time. But I can assure you it is very specific and goes beyond administrative authority. We are talking about apparitional authority. We are talking about that three different committees in the House and the Senate can call on anybody with due cause to have them submit their tax returns. By the way, when you look at why section 6103 was put into the Tax Code in 1924, as a result of one of the greatest scandals in the 20th century, then you understand it was not just meant as an administrative situation. Now, Mr. Speaker, we believe that it is imperative for the public to know and understand how such tax reform that we are about to go into pretty soon will benefit the President of the United States. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman’s remarks must be confined to the question of privilege. Mr. PASCRELL. I am talking right to the resolution, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman’s remarks must be confined to the question of whether the resolution presents a privilege of the House. Mr. PASCRELL. Well, we are talking about the present President, our President of the United States. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is whether the resolution presents a question of privilege, and the gentleman must confine his remarks to that debate. Mr. PASCRELL. We are talking about, as I said—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has not been recognized to discuss the value or merit of the resolution. The gentleman has been recognized only to argue whether it presents a privileged question to the House. Mr. PASCRELL. I believe it is a privileged question and resolution that has been offered because it goes to the very integrity of the House of Representatives, and I am a part of the House of Representatives. Now, our President had an infamous response—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman’s remarks must be confined to the question of privilege. Mr. PASCRELL. He said, when an allegation that he had paid no taxes, he said—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is prepared to rule. The gentleman from New York seeks to offer a resolution as a question of the privileges of the House under rule IX. As the Chair ruled on February 27, 2017, and March 7, 2017, the resolution directs the Committee on Ways and Means to meet and consider an item of business under the procedures set forth in 26 U.S.C. 6103, and, therefore, does not qualify as a question of the privileges of the House. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the House? MOTION TO TABLE  
Mr. M CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. McCarthy moves that the appeal be laid on the table. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15 minute vote on the motion to table will be followed by a 5minute vote on suspending the rules and passing H.R. 267, if ordered.

Res. 198) providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 1259) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for the removal or demotion of employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs based on performance or misconduct, and for other purposes; providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 1367) to improve the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to hire and retain physicians and other employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes; and providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 1181) to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the conditions under which certain persons may be treated as adjudicated mentally incompetent for certain purposes, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. 
NATIONAL K9 VETERANS DAY (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, this week, we recognized National K9 Veterans Day. It was on March 13, 1942, that the U.S. Army K9 Corps was officially formed, although dogs have had a role in our military ever since our country’s founding. We not only honor military dogs, but also police dogs, customs dogs, border patrol dogs, and other working dogs that work to protect our communities. These dogs provide an incredible service to our brave men and women overseas. They are responsible for saving lives and preventing injuries, sometimes at their own expense. Many of our servicemembers form very strong bonds with these loyal companions. That is why I authored the Military Working Dog Military Retirement Act and was proud to see it pass with overwhelming bipartisan support last Congress. This new law guarantees that service dogs are returned and retired to the United States after serving overseas. Previously, military members were often forced to spend their own money to bring these animals home. Mr. Speaker, let us remember and honor these fourlegged heroes. They are a valuable component of protecting Americans through their courage and their loyalty. NOAA FUNDING (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the mission of NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, now under attack by the Trump administration. An assault on NOAA, Mr. Speaker, is an assault on science. NOAA is a data driven organization with proven research in the public interest. NOAA defends our coasts from the surges we have seen from Sandy, Irene, and other storms. NOAA’s satellites keep watch day and night, providing uptothesecond data to farmers, forecasters, and fishermen. Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge the Trump administration’s denial of climate damage, but I do not understand it. Defunding NOAA, as the President’s budget purportedly does, does not make our climate problems simply go away. The mission of NOAA isn’t just about our environment. American businesses rely on its data every day to give them an economic advantage. After all, there is a reason NOAA is in the Department of Commerce to begin with. f 
TRIBUTE TO FORMER CONGRESSMAN JOHN WOLD (Ms. CHENEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend and former Member of this House, John Wold, of Casper, Wyoming, who passed away on February 19. Congressman Wold was a member of the Greatest Generation serving as a naval engineer during World War II. He also served Wyoming in our State legislature and as our Member of Congress. He was a leader and pioneer in the energy field, and he made numerous contributions, along with his incomparable wife, Jane, to our civic life and as a philanthropist. I knew John my whole life. The friendship between our families goes back even farther. John was the oldest living former Member of Congress, and I was honored to receive his advice and counsel over the years. I will never forget attending his 100th birthday this past summer in Casper and seeing the joy it brought him to be surrounded by so many of his wonderful children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. We will miss him, but the impact Congressman Wold had on our State and our Nation and the legacy of leadership and honor he leaves behind will continue to be an inspiration for generations to come. SOUTH SUDAN (Ms. BASS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, last month, the U.N. declared a famine in parts of South Sudan. As I rise today, more than 100,000 men, women, and children there are facing immediate starvation. Arguably, this was an avoidable crisis. Internal conflicts have worsened the dire living conditions for the people of South Sudan, and the government of the Republic of South Sudan must live up to its promise and ensure access to the most vulnerable communities by humanitarian organizations. According to recent estimates, without immediate action, an additional 5.5 million people living in South Sudan will experience famine. Although we haven’t yet seen the President’s budget, it is reported that there is a 37 percent decrease in foreign aid. This could include severe cuts to humanitarian funding. In this regard, I introduced H. Res. 187 in support of the efforts by USAID and other providers of humanitarian assistance in the international community. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bipartisan resolution, and, by doing so, begin an end to this crisis. f 
CONGRATULATING THERESA BRYANT (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Theresa Bryant, who is West Forsyth High School’s 2016–2017 Teacher of the Year. This firstgeneration college graduate, Kiwanis member, and Key Club adviser has worked at West Forsyth in Clemmons since 2000, where she teaches sophomore English and Shakespeare as an elective. Theresa’s proudest moment in the field of education is her role in the creation of the Shakespeare elective class. After an educational opportunity at the Globe Theatre in London, she worked with a colleague to create an intensive curriculum covering eight plays. The class has brought the words of the Bard to more than 4,000 students at West Forsyth, as well as four other schools in the district. Theresa is known for her dedication to her students and making her lessons relevant to their different learning styles so everyone can understand the material. We are lucky to have a teacher of her caliber serving students in North Carolina’s Fifth District. 
b2000 SOMEBODY ELSE’S BABIES (Mr. SWALWELL of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, in every chapter from the story of America’s success, we find countless examples of the contributions made by immigrants. In fact, it begins in our prologue: we are a nation founded by immigrants. Yet, over the weekend, a Member of this House, Mr. KINGof Iowa, said: ‘‘We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.’’ There is nothing to restore. We are the greatest country in the world. But, worse, by disparaging the value of somebody else’s babies, Mr. KINGargues for an America void of people of color or who worship differently than he does. That is not who we are. Behind me are a few small examples of somebody else’s babies: people who immigrated to America or whose families immigrated to America, practicing many different faiths, coming from many different countries. They include the daughter of Chinese immigrants who became one of America’s most celebrated and bestselling authors, Amy Tan; the son of a Syrian migrant, Steve Jobs, who founded Apple; and the son of a Kenyan student, who recently finished two terms as the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama. These are not somebody else’s babies. These are immigrants and the children of immigrants, and they are our babies. I was born and baptized in Sac City, Iowa, located in Mr. KING’s district. It is where I learned from Exodus 22:21, ‘‘You must not mistreat or oppress foreigners in any way. Remember, you yourselves were once foreigners.’’ And from the Iowans I know, they were raised to accept and love the same way. I hope my colleagues join me in denouncing bigoted, hateful, and divisive rhetoric, and let’s celebrate the beautiful diversity that has always made our Nation shine: these beautiful ‘‘somebody else’s babies’’ who are America’s babies. 
FREEING UP RESTRICTIVE FUEL MILEAGE STANDARDS (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the President’s decision to halt new EPA fuel mileage restrictions on the auto industry, also known as CAFE standards. Speaking to auto industry workers in Detroit today, President Trump promised to reexamine stringent fuel efficiency rules that were hurried into place in the final days of the previous administration. After committing to a review in 2018, the Obama administration changed course just before leaving office and decided to keep the requirements in place for model year vehicles 2022–2025. According to reviews by independent economists and engineers, these requirements would add at least an average of $3,800 in costs per vehicle, even after supposed fuel savings were considered. Even more, this vastly limits consumer choice, whether someone wants to buy a minivan to move their family or soccer team around, a farmer or contractor that needs a threequarterton pickup to do his or her job, or maybe somebody that would just like to buy a sporty car. Even worse, it is entirely unclear whether existing technology even allows the 60 percent jump from the 2016 requirement of 34.1 miles per gallon to reach the almost 55milepergallon requirement in only seven model years to 2025 without sacrificing safety and, yet again, eviscerating consumer choice. The President’s decision to fully review these requirements will result in lower vehicle costs, allow safer vehicles, and boost our U.S. economy by supporting domestic manufacturing. f 
THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me join my colleagues, first of all, and say that this country is made up of somebody else’s babies; and I am very proud to be an American who sees the great talent of these babies who have become great leaders, such as teachers, scientists, doctors, lawyers, and members who do public service. Thank you to somebody else’s babies. Let me also congratulate the district court in Hawaii, which has just rendered a decision to block the President’s Muslim ban again. Thank you for that wise and deliberative decision. I rise today in particular to really ask and wonder where we are in this country that a President of the United States can, first, tweet out that a former President committed a criminal felony: wiretapping. In the last 48 hours, there is mish mash of information coming from the press secretary or the director of communications and the President: Oh, maybe it was not wiretapping by the President of the United States formally, but it is generally wiretapping. Mr. President, let me be very clear: the words of the Commander in Chief are known to carry great weight. It is the American people that have to trust and believe and be commanded and led. I am saddened by the state that we are in right now. I am saddened that there is one position one day and another position another day. As a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, we cannot tolerate that kind of mismatched conversation. The truth must be told. The American people must know it, Members of Congress must know it. I believe committees should be investigating if there was a wiretap or not and if there was an action by the former President. If not, tell the truth. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). The Chair would remind Members to direct their remarks to the Chair. f 
HONORING TRINITY UNITED METHODIST ON ITS 200TH YEAR (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this year, the Trinity United Methodist Church in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, marks its 200th year as a house of worship. Founded in April of 1817, the church congregation began with just seven people. Schoolmaster and Methodist layman James McGee led the first meeting. Over the years, Trinity’s congregation has steadily grown, and today it boasts 200 members. The current church was built in 1875, and in 1962, an educational building was added on. The church plays an important role in the Bellefonte community and it organizes several programs throughout the year, including a free community lunch, a New Year’s Day dinner, free public concerts, and a toy drive before Christmas for children in need. Mr. Speaker, for the last 200 years, Trinity United Methodist Church has opened its doors for people to hear the Word of the Lord, but a church is much more than a building. It brings a love of God into the community and into the hearts of those who fill the seats each Sunday. God bless Trinity United Methodist Church on the momentous occasion of its bicentennial. 
BULLY BUSTERS (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of a group of 11 and 12 yearold girls from my district who have noticed an unsettling trend in modern politics and who are absolutely determined to do something about it. They see bullying from leaders who are supposed to be their role models. They witness fear, intimidation, and vitriol being thrown at religious minorities, LGBTQ people, women, immigrants, communities of color. And, yes, I am also somebody else’s baby. In the face of this hate, these girls have decided to take action by forming the D.C. Bully Busters. These change making girls, not even old enough to vote yet, but certainly old enough to make their voices heard, have vowed to stand up against the bullying they are seeing in American politics. Mr. Speaker, if gradeschoolers can say that bullying, intimidation, and silently standing by are cowardly tactics that have no place in politics, then the adults who represent them must be courageous enough to do the same thing. 
On Friday, I will be proudly signing the D.C. Bully Busters pledge, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me so that we can let everyone know at every level that bullying is never acceptable. 
COMMONSENSE VA REFORM (Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor of H.R. 1259, the VA Accountability First Act. This important piece of legislation targets vulnerabilities within the VA employment structure that prevent bad actors from being fired or demoted. This commonsense reform gives the Secretary of the VA the flexibility to dismiss or demote employees who are guilty of onthejob inebriation, drug diversion, and sexual assault, just to name a few. Our veterans deserve quality care. They have earned quality care. As chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, it is my highest priority in making sure that our Department of Veterans Affairs is working for the men and women who have worn the cloth of our Nation and made the sacrifices that keep us free: our veterans. This bill moves the needle in the right direction, and I commend Chairman ROEfor introducing it. 
HEALTHCARE REFORM The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by saying that, for the last 25 years, I practiced dentistry in Georgia’s Third District and I experienced a healthcare system that was broken and in desperate need of repair to reduce costs and increase access to care. After the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, I saw my patients, my friends, my neighbors forced away from doctors who had treated them for their entire lives. Instead of decreasing costs, patients saw their costs skyrocket and their access to care limited. As a medical practitioner, I want what is best for my patients. Those are the people that I am fighting for: my neighbors and constituents who saw their premiums skyrocket, their quality and access to care limited or determined by a government bureaucrat. I committed to them that I would repeal ObamaCare and undo the damage that it has done to our healthcare system. The legislation we are currently considering in the House, the American Health Care Act, is just the beginning of keeping that promise. This is not a choice between a broken healthcare system that existed before ObamaCare. It is a new direction that reflects an understanding of what works and what does not work. The legislation will enact many reforms that directly impact Americans by lowering costs and improving access to care. Tonight, my colleagues and I are going to share with you in great detail what that legislation does. We have all been very open in our opposition to the Affordable Care Act, but it is also important that we share with our constituents what we stand for and what we are working to do to reform this broken system. We stand for patientcentered health care that meets the needs of our constituents in an affordable way. We stand for marketdriven healthcare solutions and an industry that prioritizes personal freedom over government mandates. We stand for the biggest entitlement reform in a generation to ensure that we protect our most vulnerable populations. This is just a short list of the goals we are working towards, and I am excited to be joined by a number of my colleagues tonight to help me explain more to the American people what is happening with our healthcare system. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ). He served in the George W. Bush administration. He has worked with the FDIC, and he has been a public servant in Lubbock, Texas, at Texas Tech University. He serves on the House Agriculture Committee, the Budget Committee, and the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, the facts are indisputable: President Obama’s attempt to plan our healthcare economy from Washington, D.C., has failed. I have spent nearly 2 years criss crossing 29 counties in west Texas, and I can report from the many stories from my constituents that no single law or policy has been more reviled, more destructive, or more intrusive than ObamaCare. It is absolutely crushing our small businesses and Main Street Americans everywhere. The American Health Care Act repeals ObamaCare and is a step in the right direction to freeing the American people from the scourge of governmentcontrolled health care. For the first time since the passage of ObamaCare, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s report recently, the American Health Care Act will lower premiums over time by 10 percent, a far cry from the skyrocketing premiums we have seen over the last several years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The report goes on to say that the American Health Care Act will reduce the deficit by $337 billion and make the biggest entitlement reform in generations, saving taxpayers well over $800 billion. This bill strikes at the heart of ObamaCare by repealing its mandates, eliminating its taxes, and gutting its regulations. Make no mistake, this legislation is not perfect. I will continue to fight for more conservative and more fiscally responsible policy outcomes like work requirements for ablebodied adults. But when the dust settles and the debate is over, we cannot allow perfect policy aspirations to be the enemy of good, conservative results. The alternative, Mr. Speaker, is simply unacceptable. b2015 My constituents sent me to Washington to tackle the tough issues and solve the big problems. Well, we have got one, and it is called ObamaCare. I committed a long time ago that if I ever had the chance, I would repeal ObamaCare, and I plan on keeping my promise, Mr. Speaker. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas touched on some very important issues. One that he talked about was the process here, that this is just the beginning of a long journey that we must take to rebuild our American healthcare system. This has been an open legislative process. More than 8 months ago, even before I was a Member of this great House, the Republican caucus here released A Better Way agenda, which detailed a consensus vision for patient centered healthcare reform. Our bill, the American Health Care Act, is built on that framework. These ideas are not new. They are not unvetted. They are a product of many conversations, debates, and work. Unlike the drafting of ObamaCare, we want our constituents to know what is in this legislation before we pass it. That is why every American can go to readthebill.gop and look at this legislation for themselves. In fact, I encourage anyone who hasn’t taken time to look at this legislation yet to go to readthebill.gop and read more about the American Health Care Act. At no point in this process have I felt closed out of it. As a matter of fact, as a freshman, I can tell you that I have had my voice heard, I have been asked for input, and I have seen many of the ideas that I have spoken about be included in this bill. This bill has not been crafted behind closed doors. It has not been kept in the shadows. As a matter of fact, it has been just the opposite. As a freshman Member sitting in conference, leadership has been very straightforward about the intentions of the bill, the basic framework of the bill, and I am excited to see that, as this process has gone through regular order, we have seen many amendments added to it, and we are continuing that process. Regular order means that we have done something very unique here. We haven’t just taken a bill and passed it and then get to read what is in it. We have taken a bill, and we have taken it through the committee process. Our colleagues on the Committee on Energy and Commerce and Committee on 
Ways and Means have worked through some many long nights debating amendments in an open process. Tomorrow the House Committee on the Budget will take up this business. I am a member on that committee, and I am looking forward to the process of going through the debate tomorrow. I am sure that it will be long, and I am sure many amendments will be debated; but I am excited about the opportunity that we have to move a piece of legislation forward, make it better, make it more conservative, but, most importantly, make sure that Americans have great health care, access to that health care at an affordable price. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ). Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the American Health Care Act. ObamaCare has failed, and we need to replace it. It has made health care inaccessible for many of the Americans it was created to help. Our premiums have skyrocketed, small business growth has been stunted as it can’t expand due to health care regulations, and employees have seen their hours cut. Individuals are forced to purchase healthcare coverage they do not want. Over the past 2 years, I have met with many Nebraskans in my district. I keep hearing about the broken promises of ObamaCare and the tight stranglehold this law has created for the American people. I have heard from a young mother who had to pay for the whole bill of the delivery of her child. The ACA plan she was on had a $12,000 deductible, and that plan didn’t help her one cent. Another citizen from Omaha, Jeanine, was happy with her healthcare insurance for decades. Five years ago, she was paying $323 a month and was satisfied with the coverage she had. Four years ago, she was told by her insurance company that she would have to pay more because she would need additional coverage, like maternity coverage, even though she was past that stage in her life. Two years ago, that insurance plan of Jeanine’s jumped to $690 a month—double. However, her health insurance company had another policy under ACA which she could switch to. She did so for $150 a month with a $550 credit. At least, she had that plan until her insurance company dropped that ACA policy and sent Jeanine searching for another policy. Now Jeanine is on an ACA policy that covers her primary doctor but not her dentist or her pharmacy. All Jeanine wants is a healthcare plan that fits her needs. She does not want the Federal Government telling her what coverage she must purchase. Imagine for just a second that you have been happy for decades with a product you use, and one day the government comes in and tells you that you don’t know what is best for you. They force you to pay more, and in return you get something that doesn’t work. ACA is like the government telling you that you need to buy an expensive, fast, shiny sports car with all the bells and whistles, when all you wanted was a less expensive economy car to get you around town. But later you find out that that fancy sports car is actually a lemon. That is exactly what happened to Jeanine and countless other Americans when ObamaCare forced them to coverage they did not want or need. This is more than a failed system. It is wrong to the core, and this is what the American Health Care Act is designed to fix. The American Health Care Act is a step in the right direction, and we are fulfilling our promises to repair the problems that ACA has left us. This legislation repeals major flaws of ObamaCare, such as employer and individual mandates, letting individuals choose what coverage is best for them. Under this bill, health savings accounts will be expanded and will give tax credits for those who buy their own insurance to give them parity with those who get employerprovided coverage tax free. These are things that I campaigned on and promised to fight for, and they are in the bill. The bill also gives States more control over their healthcare policies, allowing for patientcentered health care and getting the Federal bureaucrats out of the discussion. The American Health Care Act, instead, allows for individuals to choose the health insurance plans based on their needs and budget, allowing for Americans to have greater access and to find a health plan that is right for them. The CBO shows that it is going to lower those premiums by 10 percent. Now, Nebraska had a 51 percent increase last year, Mr. Speaker. This plan is going to lower premiums by 10 percent. The American Health Care Act will reduce the deficit and cut taxes. According to Monday’s CBO score, this bill will reduce the Federal deficit by $337 billion and lower taxes by $883 billion. That is good for America. Finally, the American Health Care Act does this and yet preserves affordable insurance for those with preexisting conditions and maintains a safety net for those who cannot pay premiums. These are things that I also promised to fight for, and they are in the bill. I look forward to working with my fellow House Members on both sides of the aisle to deliver the best law for the American people. We are going to be debating this bill for the next few weeks, and we are going to make it better. I am proud that this Congress and the Republican leadership have made a commitment to passing this legislation in an open and transparent process. This is a good first step toward fixing the mess of the ACA. Before we vote on this, I encourage my colleagues and the American people to carefully read the bill so they can find out what is in it. Unlike ObamaCare, we don’t have to pass this to find out what is in it. We know now. This is a great step forward, a patientcentered, doctorsupported healthcare system that gives power back to the States and gets the bureaucrat out of our healthcare decisions. Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ) for his remarks. He touched on something that is very important, and that is the driving down of cost and how this is accomplished. Truly, when the patient is in control of their health care, they are also in control of the cost. We are fighting for consumer choice in a patientdriven healthcare system. We understand, and I certainly understand, that patients and doctors need to be at the center of the healthcare conversation, not bureaucrats and not insurance clerks. Our plan includes provisions to expand choice and give consumers more control over their healthcare dollars. The American Health Care Act significantly increases the amount individuals and families can contribute to their personal health savings accounts each year, allowing them to save more to pay for future healthcare expenses and the flexibility to use their healthcare dollars as they choose. It also allows them to spend those healthcare dollars where they think that it will best benefit their families. It allows them to have the most intimate conversations with their healthcare providers and make sure that they are making the right decisions and using their dollars wisely. If the first question always is ‘‘does my insurance company pay for it?’’ you are always going to get the most expensive answer. However, if the patient has contributed to this process, the patient then will be able to make some informed decisions through good conversations with their doctors, and they can better manage their own health care. We are fighting for a system that puts patients first and allows Georgians in the Third District and all across this Nation to make their own healthcare decisions. That starts with a conversation between the doctor and the patient. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ). He is a former threeterm sheriff from Florida, representing the greater Jacksonville area. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to speak of fairness, to speak of equity, to speak of parity for America’s hardworking taxpayers. I want to talk about bringing parity between Americans who get their insurance coverage through their employer and those who are forced to purchase theirs on the individual market. Currently, over 150 million Americans who have employersponsored health insurance enjoy a tax benefit to 
purchase that health insurance. However, Americans who purchase their insurance in the individual marketplace, like farmers, smallbusiness owners, plumbers, and mechanics, do not have a similar kind of benefit. Mr. Speaker, simply put, this is just unfair. However, the American Health Care Plan helps fix this inequity by offering a portable tax credit to help these Americans purchase the health insurance they choose. These credits are also ageadjusted so older Americans who have higher healthcare costs will also see a larger credit to assist them in purchasing that insurance. Mr. Speaker, I can tell you, many individuals and families in Florida’s Fourth Congressional District will benefit from this reform and for the first time will be on a more level playing field in purchasing their health insurance. We are fighting for basic fairness. No American, no smallbusiness man or woman, no farmer, plumber, or mechanic should be disadvantaged because of where they work or where they are forced to purchase their insurance. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Florida touched on something that is very important, and that is fairness in the marketplace. I can tell you, as a smallbusiness owner, I did not receive the same favorable tax treatment as the major corporations did under the Affordable Care Act. Once this bill took effect, I had to move into the individual market. I had to begin buying health insurance with posttax dollars, and I was unable to afford the coverage not only for my family, but for the people that I had the pleasure of working with every single day in my business. What Mr. RUTHERFORD talked about is leveling the playing field, and that is something that we need to do. It will increase innovation. It increases jobs. It increases success. It is so frustrating for Americans as they begin to build their small businesses and they begin to grow, and every single time that they take a step forward, the government takes more and more out of their pocket. Now we have a healthcare system that continues to rob them of their success. Make no mistake; the healthcare system that we had prior to the Affordable Care Act was certainly not successful and not headed in the right way, but we have made it worse with this. What we have done is we have not only disenfranchised many small businesses and people who are growing their businesses and finding success, but we have also, quite candidly, done a poor job of maintaining our safety net. What we are fighting for is to increase affordable health care for all Americans, and this has meant listening to a lot of the feedback from our families and our constituents back home. What we need to recognize is that, under our plan, dependents can continue to stay on their parents’ insurance until age 26 and they are fully on their feet, if that is the right thing for their families to do. Americans told us that they like this flexibility, and we have listened to them. Our plan will also ensure that those who have preexisting conditions can’t be charged more for the health coverage they need. It also includes incentives, not mandates, to encourage Americans to have continuous coverage. This is good for the marketplace, and it will keep costs down for all Americans. Our portable tax credits will also increase access to coverage by assisting lower income individuals to purchase the health insurance that they need. What is more, the American Health Care Act includes a Patient and State Stability Fund to help States expand the number of vulnerable patients who have access to health care. We know that States know how to best meet the unique needs of their citizens, and this is going to give them the flexibility to do that. Therefore, as these funds are flexible, they allow things like cutting outofpocket expenses for patients, promoting access to preventive services, or increasing available options in the marketplace—all things that are needed. b2030 These reforms will help drive down costs and increase access to care. This is good news for patients who are worried about affordable coverage. Unlike ObamaCare, though, it means that their coverage provides them with meaningful access to care. It does you no good to have an insurance plan that you cannot afford to use. Time and time again, I have patients, I have smallbusiness owners, I have constituents from all over Georgia’s Third District that come to me and say: Just because I have this new insurance plan doesn’t mean that my family is getting better care. One such example was a gentleman that came into my district office just this past week. Three years ago, his health insurance for his family with four children was about $900, and he had a $3,000 family deductible. Last year, his premium had risen to $1,700 a month. And this year, he laid in front of me on my desk in the district office a bill for his health insurance that was $2,400 a month, and a $7,000 deductible. He is a smallbusiness owner with nine employees. It is absolutely crushing his family expenses, and that is not fair. What we have done is we have created an environment where we have tried unsuccessfully to expand access; and in doing so, we have risen costs on men and women across this Nation that are trying to do their best to move into the middle class. We have seen it destroy family finances. We have seen it create a situation where many families now pay more for their health insurance than they do for their own homes. Mr. Speaker, in my case, that is the exact same thing. My insurance payment is more than my house payment, and that simply doesn’t seem right. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ). She has proven to be a great Member of Congress. I have enjoyed working with her thoroughly. Ms. TENNEY has some very revealing remarks going forward. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ), my esteemed colleague. I rise today to recognize the New Yorkers who have been hit especially hard by the policies of the previous administration and ObamaCare’s so called reforms to our healthcare system. Patients have been hurt, doctors have been burdened, and families and taxpayers are being crushed by this terrible law, and its thousands of pages of onerous regulations. Our most vulnerable citizens—seniors, the hardworking middle class, and veterans—are in worse shape now in upstate New York than they were before. In New York State and across the 22nd District, patients are being denied highquality care that they deserve and need. With higher costs, less accessible and affordable care, and mountains of red tape, this law has proven to be everything but a Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Now, some deductibles are higher than a house payment, and premiums across the Nation have increased on average by 25 percent. Our families didn’t sign up for this. Patients have had their plans canceled and their doctors are deemed out of network. They have fewer and worse choices than before. All the while, costs have skyrocketed with premiums and deductibles jumping by double digits and triple digits in some cases. This failed law has hurt our economy, smallbusiness owners, and family farms while driving hundreds of thousands of jobs out of our communities. Small businesses are being crushed by ObamaCare and have either stopped hiring or dropped insurance coverage for their employees. The CBO estimated that ObamaCare will result in the loss of at least 2 million jobs. In fact, the number one complaint of smallbusiness owners in my district throughout the last 6 years has been ObamaCare, and 70 percent of the new jobs are created by the small businesses in our community. One smallbusiness owner, in fact, told me that she had to lay off nearly a dozen employees just to keep up with the cost of ObamaCare. Just think of looking at 12 families and saying: You have now lost the primary caregiver in your family just to keep up with ObamaCare mandates. Another family that I met with told me they had their insurance lost after being canceled three times, and now their options are either limited or unaffordable. Another independent, selfinsured man with three children told me that he had an insurance plan, but he had no 
health care, with a $12,000 annual deductible. This is unfair and it is unsustainable for smallbusiness owners, particularly those in the independent market. Hardworking middle class families in New York are being burdened with nearly the highest taxes in the Nation. New York is one of only four States that passes the State 50 percent share Medicaid burden onto the local taxpayers. Twentyfive percent of the State’s obligation to cover Medicaid costs are forced onto struggling local governments already suffocating under unfunded mandates from the State. This has caused property and sales taxes to increase year after year, crushing the pocketbooks of even the most vulnerable taxpayers. In New York State, local taxpayers throughout our 63 counties will be forced to pay over $7.5 billion annually in this local share to support New York’s Medicaid program. New York’s Medicaid program is the largest in the Nation. In fiscal year 2018, the cost will be over $65 billion—over 42 percent of New York’s $152 billion proposed State budget. That is nearly the cost of the entire State of Florida’s State budget. Already, taxpayers in upstate and central New York are burdened with some of the highest combined property and sales tax in the country. Every penny that goes for this failing scheme is a penny less for our schools, our roads, care for our seniors, care for people with special needs, and actually the truly needy in our communities. There is a better way that won’t leave anyone behind. It is vitally important that we begin to repeal ObamaCare so we can provide relief for people across the country and the State. I am currently reviewing the American Health Care Act, a reform initiative proposed to alleviate the pressures ObamaCare has put on patients, providers, and taxpayers. The proposals in the American Health Care Act will lower premiums by 10 percent, reduce taxes by $883 billion, and reduce the Federal deficit dollars by $337 billion. All are a significant step in the right direction. However, I will continue to listen to constituents in the 22nd District as the House carefully considers this legislation before we vote on it and any future bills to improve and restore our healthcare system for all. Current and future taxpayers must not be saddled with further debt and taxes to pay for lower quality and less access to care. Any new initiative must enshrine the freedom to choose a plan tailored to each person and each family. Any new initiative must include a competitive marketplace which provides better and broader options for families across all economic sectors. Any new initiative must protect seniors and the truly needy in our society, because we do have an obligation and a desire to help them. But the status quo is unacceptable. ObamaCare is inefficient, ineffective, and tramples our precious liberties. We, as their duly elected representatives, should do all in our power to patientcentered, costconscious, high quality system of health care in this country. I will continue to fight for everyone in our communities. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York for her very candid remarks. As you can see, she touched on many important issues—the unfairness of the system that we have now, but also the importance of protecting our Medicaid safety net. What we have seen under the Affordable Care Act is that we have seen our safety nets eroded. We are diverting resources away from the people that need them the most—the poor, the elderly, the blind, the disabled, children, and pregnant women—and we are pushing those resources to ablebodied men and women who do have the ability to work. It is important to recognize that our legislation is probably the largest entitlement reform program in a generation. Our legislation puts Medicaid back on a budget for the first time in history. It provides enhanced flexibility to the States to allow them to design effective and financially sound programs to meet their population’s unique needs. Our plan also ensures that Medicaid prioritizes care for the most vulnerable, who it was originally intended for. We must do this because there are so many Americans, unfortunately, that have to depend on this safety net for their health care. I understand this. In my hometown, in my dental practice, I treated patients who relied on Medicaid for their healthcare coverage. It was an honor to take care of them and to have very real discussions about their healthcare needs. I understand this vulnerable population because they were a vital part of my practice, and it was truly my pleasure to take care of them. I understand the unique circumstances that cause many of these individuals to be on Medicaid and to need this valuable safety net. But we have to have an honest conversation about that. We have to be able to provide that safety net. And as we put more and more ablebodied men and women without children on that safety net, it is diverting resources away from those that need it the most. That is not right and that is not the American way. We are fighting to protect and strengthen this Nation’s healthcare safety net. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ). Dr. Marshall knows firsthand about health care. He was a practicing OB/GYN, a board chairman of a hospital, and he has served our Nation in the United States Army. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with people like my colleague, Dr. DREWFERGUSON , from Georgia. I am so proud to stand tonight with the President of the United States. I know that tonight Mr. Trump is speaking loudly on behalf of our healthcare bill. Mr. Trump is ready to take the fight on with us who feel like we need to move this health care forward. I am not sure how many of you grew up without power steering in your vehicles, but if you know anything about the lack of power steering—and I think back to the tractors I drove growing up, and that tractor, you could not turn that wheel until you started the tractor moving—or if you had a Ford truck or a Dodge truck or a Chevy truck and it didn’t have power steering, you couldn’t turn that truck until it started moving. Mr. Speaker, it is time to get this bill moving. We have to move health care forward. I am so tired of the rhetoric of repeal and replace. I am telling you, my constituents sent me here to fix health care. Forget the political rhetoric. I am ready to fix health care. I am ready to stand shoulder to shoulder with Republicans, with Democrats, with people down the aisle, across the aisle, and with our President to get this healthcare bill passed. Unfortunately, ObamaCare has failed. When this first came about, I was so excited. I was hoping that this would be a healthcare bill that would work. But, unfortunately, it is true that this healthcare bill is dying very quickly. Onethird of counties across this country no longer have a provider to take care of the exchange. My own State of Kansas is down to one provider. Today, even more insurance companies are bailing. This bill is dying. Doing nothing is simply not an option, Mr. Speaker. b2045 As I visited with thousands of patients over the last several years and thousands of my constituents, they said there are several things that they thought were important that we save from this healthcare bill, the Affordable Care Act, and I think we have done just that: Number one, we have protected the preexisting issue conditions; Number two, we are letting children stay on their parents’ health insurance until age 26; Number three, we are ensuring that women are not charged more for health insurance just because they are a woman; and Number four, we protected the doughnut hole and kept it closed for Medicare. So I think we have saved the best things of the Affordable Care Act. So what have we removed? Mr. Speaker, we removed almost $1 trillion of taxes. This is the most significant entitlement reform in our generation, the most significant entitlement reform since the 1960s started Medicaid. What can we expect out of this bill? We expect premiums to decrease by 10 percent. 
We expect to start reprioritizing Medicaid moneys. I want to make sure, Mr. Speaker, that we prioritize Medicaid moneys for those who need it the most: those with disabilities, children, and the elderly. And I want to make sure these people are at the front of the Medicaid line rather than at the end of the line. This country cannot afford to give Medicaid to ablebodied Americans. We need to prioritize the dollars that we have for those that need it the most. Mr. Speaker, we spent $580 billion last year on Medicaid. We are on our way to spending $1 trillion on Medicaid if we don’t do something soon. This country cannot afford to spend $1 trillion on Medicaid. Mr. Speaker, these are only the first steps of bending the cost curve downward for health care. We have to do more than just this bill. There are going to be more steps. I have complete faith in Dr. Tom Price, our new HHS Secretary, that he will be deregulating health care, which is the most regulated business in the country right now. Give Dr. Price 60, 90 days to deregulate medicine and start encouraging competition, and we will start bending this cost curve downward. We need to empower free markets. We need to empower States to have more local control. We are expanding healthcare savings accounts, but there are many more things we need to do. This is just the start of healthcare reform. This is the first chapter of a new book on healthcare reform. There are many more chapters to go. I cannot wait to improve health care, to improve quality and start driving the cost curve downward. Mr. Speaker, thank you so much for allowing me the time to stand shoulder to shoulder with our President, as well as with Dr. DREW FERGUSON , who is representing the State of Georgia so proudly. I am so proud to be called his freshman colleague. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Dr. MARSHALL for his strong remarks and pointing out and highlighting several important things. You know, one of the biggest things that we are fighting for as part of repealing ObamaCare is that we are fighting for our personal freedom. Right now, Americans have the ‘‘choice’’ of purchasing a government mandated, onesizefitsall product or paying a governmentmandated penalty. In almost a third of all U.S. counties, and many in my home State of Georgia, consumers don’t even have the choice between insurances to purchase. This is not a choice. With the passage of the American Health Care Act, no longer will the Federal Government mandate that Americans purchase a product that they don’t want, because we believe that individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices. We understand the unique dignity of every human being. This dignity calls for selfdetermination and personal freedom, and we are fighting for that freedom. It is important. I want to thank all of my colleagues who have joined me tonight to share with our constituents more about what we are fighting for. First off, our legislation promotes personal freedom by eliminating the individual and employer mandates. Purchasing decisions should be left up to the consumer, not the Federal Government. Under our plan, no American is mandated to purchase a product that he or she does not want and cannot afford. As I have shared, I have personal experience with how important the conversation between the patient and their doctor is. By almost doubling the cap on how much individuals can contribute to their personal health savings accounts each year and expanding where those dollars can be used, our plan puts patients back at the center of the conversation with their doctor, and they remove all of the government bureaucrats from the middle of that conversation. Health care is personal. It should belong to the patient and their healthcare provider—and no one else. That is where the most important decisions are made. We are also working to strengthen our safety net to ensure that our vulnerable populations have continued access to health care. Our plan returns power to the States with the biggest entitlement reform in a generation. Our legislation also protects Americans with preexisting conditions, ensuring that no one is unable to purchase insurance because of an illness. ObamaCare is a complex tangle of regulations and Federal overreach. With every day that passes, Americans and businesses feel the growing weight of a healthcare system that is failing. But it is also irresponsible to return to a broken healthcare system that brought us ObamaCare. Tomorrow, we will take the next step in the open legislative process as my colleagues and I on the Budget Committee do our part to send the American Health Care Act to the floor of the House for a vote. I am excited to take this step, but I want to be clear that this is only one part of repeal and reform. We are doing all that we can, and we are going to continue to push for conservative solutions with this bill. But it is not the final vote that we will take. There are many steps to go. While it will take time and patience, I made a promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and improve our healthcare system for all Americans. I am committed to this difficult road of building this healthcare system that puts patients first. The American people deserve the hard work and political will it will take to do this the right way. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have been joined by my colleagues tonight and glad to hear their comments, and I know that you have been as well. I want to point out that my colleagues have done an outstanding job tonight, and I believe that they have made some very, very salient points, and articulated reasons why we must step forward and do all that we can to reform our American healthcare system. We have to control the cost. We have to do the things necessary to put patients back in control. And, Mr. Speaker, I have confidence that this body, along with our President and our colleagues in the Senate, can do that. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f 
ROAD TRIP CAMARADERIE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ARRINGTON ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, it is great to be here tonight. I just traveled with my good friend, close colleague, and fellow Texan—and your fellow Texan—WILLHURD, who started with me in San Antonio, Texas, yesterday at 7 a.m., San Antonio time, where we, because of the inclement weather on the East Coast and because of his canceled flight and the possibility that mine might also be canceled, decided to rent a car in San Antonio and drive it here to Washington, D.C., in time for votes this evening that started at 6:30 eastern standard time. That road trip in a Chevy Impala, rented in San Antonio, took us from San Antonio to Austin, to San Marcos, to Dallas, to Waco, to Texarkana, and then into Little Rock in Arkansas, over into Tennessee—cities including Memphis, Nashville, and Johnson City—and then through Virginia, 36 hours total, 31 of them either driving or at a pit stop fueling up on gas or grabbing a sandwich. Mr. Speaker, there were really two reasons to do this. One was to make sure that we could get to work and not allow the weather delays or flight cancellations to stop us from doing the jobs that we were elected to do on behalf of the people that we represent, but the other reason was for a Democrat and a Republican to get together, get to know each other, understand the issues before this Congress from each other’s perspective, and see if we couldn’t find some common ground. In addition, because each of us so deeply believes in transparency and accountability, we allowed the people that we represent to join us on that trip. We livestreamed the entire journey on Facebook Live, with thousands of people from all over this country submitting their questions, their comments, their suggestions, their advice, their guidance, including where to get the best doughnut at midnight in Memphis, Tennessee—which turns out to be Gibson’s Donuts—where Mr. HURDfrom Texas and I had a chance to meet some 
of the folks who make those doughnuts and some of the folks who eat them. It was one of the best parts of the trip. Mr. Speaker, I am just so grateful that there is an opportunity, despite the deep divisions between our two parties at times and despite the imperative to raise money, to campaign, to spend time away from each other, understandably, with our families or listening to our constituents back in our home districts. Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful that we had a chance to spend some time together getting to know each other, getting to talk about the issues that are important to the people we represent and to this country at large. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield to my friend from Texas (Mr. HURD), the gentleman who represents the 23rd Congressional District. Mr. HURD. I would like to thank the Speaker, and I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. One of my favorite quotes is from Teddy Roosevelt. He says: ‘‘Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat.’’ The gentleman from Texas and I had a great 31 hours—I guess, 36 hours, 31 of it being in a vehicle. It was fun, and it was like going on a road trip with my buddy having a good time, but it was more impactful for that. Actually, I think I am going through separation anxiety. I want to know what Sarah is doing right now, or Carol. They were with us late last night in those last 3 hours of our trip when we were tired and hungry and ready to go to sleep. But these are folks that we didn’t know—and I didn’t even know what part of the country they were in—that kept us going, and it was because of their excitement about what we were doing that kept us going. b2100 We talked many times about how this was an opportunity. In the press, in the media, we focus on the things that divide us, not the things that unite us; and it was a great opportunity to show that there is a lot between Republicans and Democrats that brings us together. It was great. We didn’t always agree, and we show that we could disagree without being disagreeable. My heart was warmed. At the beginning of the trip, some of the responses to our trip were meanspirited. By the end of it, I think people understood and recognized what we were trying to do, and they valued that. I hope that this trip—and the response that the American people across these great States—showed, as an example to our colleagues, that bipartisanship is a real thing; that people care and want to see folks working together and to stop retreating to their tired corners and instead try to talk about what we need to do to do the work of the American people. I got to learn a lot about the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ), a person I would like to be able to call my friend, a battle buddy now, having spent so much time in a Chevy Impala with him. I still question why he positions himself so close to the steering wheel when he drives, but I think that is one of the things that another trip may have to help figure out. Really, to all of those who watched, listened, shared, enjoyed, and made comments, thank you. Thank you because this was a truly wonderful experience and it made the entire trip worth it. We made it on time. We actually got here early, which we weren’t expecting, and that is because of my good friend from the great State of Texas’ (Mr. O’ROURKE ) discipline and tenacity going from point A to point B. We were able to do our job today, and we just want to say thank you to those who helped us do that. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, our journey began after picking up the car at the rental lot at 5:00 a.m. with a breakfast at Mi Tierra cafe in San Antonio where we were presented by the staff there with this pinata, which became our mascot along the way. So, Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure that you and our colleagues tonight have a chance to see this. Perhaps, on the more whimsical side, there was some discussion amongst my friend from Texas (Mr. HURD) and those who joined us on the journey virtually through the Livestream about trying to encourage more Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle in a way that would allow them to take time with each other, to get to know each other, to listen to each other and, yes, to talk about serious policy issues, but also to find out a little bit about who they are, where they came from, what excites them about their service, their families, the communities that they represent. And that allows for what I hope will be a more close, productive, and effective working relationship on behalf of the people we serve. Despite the obvious talent, Mr. Speaker, in this Chamber, Members that I have had the pleasure to get to know over the last 4 years that I have been here who hail from all parts of the country, from all backgrounds, who are among the best and brightest in their communities, who are here to do the right thing, to deliver for their constituents and to put this country first. It is interesting that, despite that, we haven’t been able to get many of the big things accomplished for this country. We can think about things like comprehensive immigration reform or comprehensive tax reform, for that matter, or educational and healthcare reforms that are going to impact every single family and every single one of the communities that we represent. I think part of the reason is that we need to reform the institution itself. And those reforms could take the form of comprehensive campaign finance reform or ending gerrymandering of districts and having a national congressional redistricting committee that is nonpartisan that draws those lines on rational, logical bases. Or we could have term limits for Members of Congress so that you can’t serve in what turns out to be perpetuity for the political life of a community and have some faith in the talent and the leadership that is produced in that community that we all represent. Those are things that are going to be tough to do, let’s admit it. Some of them require amendments to our Constitution. Where we could start, Mr. Speaker, is just spending some time with each other, taking a road trip, playing a game of basketball, going out on a run, having a cup of coffee, having lunch together. As my friend from Texas (Mr. HURD) says that too often we are in our own corners. And on our side, maybe that is in meetings about how to message those good things that we want to do for the American public or outside of this Chamber and away from our official responsibilities raising the resources in order to get reelected or to get our colleagues from the same party reelected. Those are understandable and, yes, I think, necessary things to do, but sometimes we do them to the exclusion of what is even more important and necessary and, that is, getting to know each other, being able to work with each other, and solving the problems and capitalizing on the opportunities that face this country. For whatever it is worth, 36 hours later, I feel like I have the opportunity to do that with my friend from Texas. What I would like him to do, if he would, is to share with us and with you, Mr. Speaker, some of those issues that we talked about and some of the takeaways or the conclusions or the things that we shared and learned. I am going to tell you, at the outset, to set your expectations, we didn’t solve all of these problems. And we didn’t even come necessarily to common agreement on all of the big issues, but we definitely heard each other’s perspective. In some cases, we definitely moved a little bit in the positions that we started with. And I will say that I learned a lot. I learned a lot about Mr. HURD, his background, his perspective, getting to talk to his dad, his sister, and his brother who all called in while we were traveling across the country. But I learned about those things that shape his views on the issues that he and I both care about and why, in some cases, he sees a different means to getting to the same goal that I want to get to and that the people I represent want to get to. There were a number of issues that we tackled and discussed. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HURD) to share some of those 
issues we discussed with you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ) and I have spent the last 2 years working on a number of projects together. We have worked on the bilateral relationship between the United States and Mexico. We have worked on border security together. We have worked on trade. We have worked on support to veterans and those in our military. In the last 36 hours, I learned that there is a broader set of issues that we can work together. He got me to a point where I recognize that something like a hiring freeze may not be the most efficient way. I think one of the folks that were watching the live feeds over the last 36 hours said: Let’s use a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer. I think that is pretty good advice. He recognized that having the ability to get someone out of the government who is not performing to the level that we need them to perform needs to be done in an efficient and quick manner. This is one example of how, in our positions, we realized we agreed on more than we probably thought from the outset. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ) prides himself and has been really a champion of veterans in the great State of Texas as well as the rest of the country. The only time I saw him get a more passionate look or a bigger smile on his face was when he was talking about doughnuts or his wife, actually. Seeing him talk to his lovely wife and his children and see his face light up was really amazing and heartwarming. So I hope that our colleagues learn that what we found out in the last 36 hours is that working together is not a dirty phrase. Bipartisanship is not a dirty word; that people are going to actually reward you for thinking and reaching beyond your perceived limits. That is one of my takeaways from the last 36 hours. So if you all live in the State of New York, instead of taking a plane back, rent a car—Dollar Rent A Car has some pretty good Chevy Impalas—and drive back to New York City together and talk about these conversations. If you take a train, sit next to each other and have that conversation. Include the folks that are sitting in the chairs around you, if you feel so inclined. These are the first steps we can do in order to take on these big issues and these big challenges. When the 435 people in the House of Representatives raised their hand and got sworn in and the 100 Members of the Senate raised their hands and got sworn in, they took on this task of coming to this august body in order to do big things to help this country. I don’t doubt that the 535 people who make up this Congress believe that this is truly the greatest Nation in the world, and they want to do everything they can to advance its cause. So we have to, if we are going to solve these big problems, we have to do it together, plain and simple. The American people want us to do it together. And I think we got a taste of that over the last 36 hours, and it is something that will stick with me, and it is something that I am looking forward to working with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ) from the great city of El Paso in the next days and weeks. One of the things that I learned from the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ) was he is very good at thanking people. He is very good at thanking his team. He is very good at thanking people that have helped us, and I want to thank our teams. The folks that make up the gentleman’s staff and my team, they stayed up longer than we did. They had to deal probably with more pressures than we did. Rachel Holland in my office, Nancy Pack, Stoney Burke, Matthew Haskins, these are some members of my team. Callie Strock, I know, in her new position, worked really hard to get things done. Chris Malen is one of the new members of my team. Austin Agrella did so much. They were excited to be a part of this. Eliezer Flores is someone who was so excited, and I think the first person who we saw when we got back. These were the people who enabled us to take away these lessons over the last 36 hours. To those who watched, shared, asked a question, who responded or answered a question for us because the feed was going too fast, thank you. Thank you for an amazing experience. I am looking forward to the next trip. Hopefully there is one before the Congress Cannonball Run of 2018. I think that it is incumbent upon the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ) and I to be a team again and see if there are others who can beat us in a race from San Antonio, Texas, to Washington, D.C. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to hold this Special Order session. This is my first time participating in a Special Order session, but I think it was justified for such a special occasion that means so much to me. I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ) for his firm grasp on the steering wheel, his willingness to go and do things that hadn’t been done before, and for his friendship. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I will conclude by joining the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HURD) in thanking the teams that made this possible in our office, led by David Wysong, my chief of staff; John Meza, who manned the communications; Samantha Stiles, chief of logistics, also known as our scheduler; Cynthia Cano, our district director back in El Paso; and everyone who works with them. As my friend says, I also want to thank the tens of thousands of people who participated in this over the course of the last 36 hours. Some folks tuned in and they had to tune out because they had to go to work, take care of a kid, get some sleep, or they were just bored by what we were doing. But they understood the premise was that we were not able or, in the gentleman from Texas’ (Mr. HURD) case, his flight was canceled into Washington, D.C., because of the weather—I feared that mine might as well be—and that we rented a car and that we had to be in Washington, D.C., after leaving San Antonio at 7:00 a.m., by 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday in order to be there and vote and represent the interest of our constituency. If we are to be honest with each other, it was touch and go for a little while. We ran into a two hour pileup just south of Waco when we were still in Texas. My friend from Texas (Mr. HURD) has a penchant for getting to know a town and wanting to spend some time in a coffee shop talking to the owner about the art of making coffee and the philosophy that accompanies that. It is a fascinating conversation to be sure, but it added precious minutes that I and many of our viewers felt we could not spare. b2015 Yet, working together, balancing my friend’s natural curiosity and interests in the communities in which we were traveling, and my desperation to get to Washington, D.C., in time to cast our votes, we were able to arrive in 36 hours. Thirtysix hours total travel time we were able to arrive with almost 30 minutes to spare, which if you consider the context, the amount of hours, the 1,600plus miles traveled, that is a remarkable feat. Look, I don’t want to take too much from this, but I think we might be able to find some encouragement that two Members working their way across the largest State in the lower 48, and then through Arkansas, Tennessee, and Virginia, were able together to make decisions necessary to ensure that we were able to get to our destination in time, get our job done, and represent those people that we serve. That, for some reason, Mr. Speaker, was interesting to people. We had thousands watching us, newspapers following, broadcast stations carrying the feed from our car. Why? Because—and it shouldn’t be this way—this is such an unusual event for a Republican and Democrat, not to file a bill together—that happens fairly often and I am grateful for that—but to sit down and enjoy each other’s company, learn from each other, and take on the challenge of driving these 1,600 miles together. I did not know my friend from Texas as well as I do now, 36 hours later, and I didn’t know how this was going to turn out. Were we going to be able to stand each other’s company? Were we going to be able to take each other’s driving? Were we going to be able to make the 
compromises necessary to decide where to eat, when to stop, when to sleep, and how to get there? Imperfectly, yet satisfactorily, we were able to do that, ultimately get here on time. We both thought as we finished votes this evening—because we got here in time to cast those votes and went back to our office to thank our staffs. As we were doing that, we thought that we owe it to each other, to our colleagues with whom we work, all 435 of us, to say that both of us want to do everything we can to build on this experience, to share it with you, to thank those from the constituencies that we represent and from across the United States who shared that journey with us, who ensured that we had our seatbelts on, that my eyes were on the road, that we were able to get some sleep in Nashville. I want to thank everyone who had a part in this, and I just want to thank this Chamber and those who sent me here for this very high honor of being able to serve. It was really an amazing experience, and I am going to use it to the best of my ability to serve my constituents to the best of my ability, and make common cause with as many of my colleagues that are here in this Chamber. Mr. Speaker, I yield again to my friend from Texas. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I want to just thank a couple more people. I would like to thank my girlfriend, Lynlie Wallace, for being supportive of many of my shenanigans. She supports me in these efforts, and I am grateful for that. I would like to thank Tyler Lowe, Jon Arnold, and my district staff. If it wasn’t for them, we never would have kicked off at 0700 from Mi Tierra Restaurant. They got us on the right path. So it truly has been a good time. I think the gentleman from Texas and I are ready for some shuteye. I do not know how many times a Special Order has been done between a Republican and a Democrat. We will have to ask the Parliamentarian after this, but hopefully this is the first of many. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank my friend from Texas for joining me tonight on the floor of the House for his words, and for taking the chance in driving across much of the country with me to get here and making sure that we could fulfill our responsibilities; and not just the immediate responsibility of getting here in time to vote, which we were able to do, but our responsibility to find a way to work with each other across party lines and address the important issues before this country that are going to be critical for this country’s future success and the wellbeing of those that we represent. Mr. Speaker, I don’t think it is any accident that the Speaker pro tempore tonight is also from Texas. I think this is a good moment for our State. I think this is a good moment for this Congress. I think this is a chance to strengthen the institution, and I am grateful for the opportunity to serve here. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
