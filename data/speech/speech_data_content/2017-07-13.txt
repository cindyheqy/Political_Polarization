Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Monroe County, Michigan’s bicentennial celebration. Founded on July 14, 1817, Monroe County is the second oldest county in Michigan and is named in honor of our Nation’s fifth President, James Monroe. Home to the River Raisin National Battlefield Park, Monroe County takes great pride in preserving local history and telling the story of the War of 1812 and those who fought to secure our freedoms. b1015 Monroe County is blessed with many precious natural resources, wildlife, and outdoor areas for the community to enjoy. Whether it is fishing for walleye on Lake Erie or watching waterfowl in the unique coastal marshes, the outdoor opportunities are the finest in the Nation. Serving as an important transportation hub, Monroe County features the largest highway gateway into Michigan and the State’s only international port on Lake Erie. Monroe County is also known for its rich agricultural heritage, as well as its strong manufacturing presence, including the headquarters of furniture manufacturer LaZBoy. Mr. Speaker, I wish to extend my gratitude to the many citizens and organizations that comprise the Monroe County Bicentennial Alliance. They generously gave of their time to coordinate a number of special programs and events throughout the year. It is an honor to join with them to commemorate this exciting milestone for Monroe County, a place where the community proudly comes together to make it a special place to visit and call home. Congratulations, Monroe County, on 200 years. I look forward to celebrating it with you. f 
HONORING MIKE M CGARVIN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Mr. Mike McGarvin, a role model for one and all, and a gentleman who truly made a difference in his lifetime. Mike was the beloved founder of the Poverello House, a homeless shelter in Fresno, California, which provides three meals a day, 365 days a year, to those in need, as well as clothing, medical services, and temporary shelter for those who are most vulnerable and have challenges in their life. For decades, Mike served countless people in the Fresno area using one simple message: ‘‘Listen with compassion; give with a warm heart and a smile.’’ Think about that: Listen with compassion and give with a warm heart and a smile. The lives of hundreds and thousands of individuals were made better because of Mike’s helping hand. He will be remembered by all for his deep compassion and boundless kindness. Mike was a role model for me and for all who knew him. He leaves a legacy of service and selflessness, both through the Poverello House and in the hearts of those people he touched throughout the years. I join Mike’s family and the supporters of the Poverello House over the years in honoring his life. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Valley Children’s Hospital for their recent recognition as one of the Nation’s top 50 children’s hospitals in the country, which I represent. I have been there and know of the work they do. In their annual Best Children’s Hospitals report, U.S. News & World Report ranked the hospital in a host of key critical areas as among the top in pediatric orthopedics, pediatric diabetes and endocrinology, and pediatric gastroenterology and GI surgery. To see these preemies in their beds and these young, little lives being saved as a result of the overall effort of the children’s hospital is truly heartwarming. We in the Valley have known for decades how highly skilled and dedicated the nurses, doctors, and staff are at Valley Children’s Hospital. It was founded more than 60 years ago with the mission to provide highquality, comprehensive medical care to children, regardless of their ability to pay, and to continuously improve upon the health and wellbeing of these children. That is why, in part, the cuts that are being proposed to Medicaid are so devastating all around the country, but especially among our children who are not in a position to afford this kind of care. Valley Children’s Hospital has grown and is now the second largest children’s hospital in California. It has many more patients than any other pediatric hospital north of San Diego. The hospital’s emergency room is the only dedicated pediatric emergency room between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Valley Children’s Hospital has been designated as a magnet nursing hospital by the American Nurses Credentialing Center, which is a recognition of true excellence in nursing care. Less than 3 percent of all hospitals in the United States earn this designation. Once again, I am a regular visitor to this hospital. When you see the staff, who have an incredible heart, and all the loving care they provide, and you see the parents and families with their young babies and young children, you know that something special is going on here. On behalf of my constituents in the Valley community, I would like to congratulate Valley Children’s Hospital for their recent recognition as one of the Nation’s top 50 children’s hospitals. I would also like to thank all of the dedicated staff, once again, who are committed to improving the health and wellbeing of not only the children of our Valley and in California, but across the Nation. We know that all of the nurses and physicians make a difference throughout our country. f 
MILITARY ORDER OF THE PURPLE HEART The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) for 5 minutes. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the work of the Military Order of the Purple Heart and, specifically, chapter 717. My friends and neighbors there who serve in this chapter are working to erect a monument on the Treasure Coast of Florida to those who were injured in battle while defending our great Nation. They may have been targeted by a sniper, a victim of an improvised explosive device, or they may have been charging a hill somewhere in Vietnam. The marker that they have worked to erect at Indian Riverside Park in Martin County will bring awareness and recognition to the true cost of freedom, which is the blood that is shed by selfless men and women who have served across the world in defense of 
others because of their sense of duty to America. I thank all members of the Military Order of the Purple Heart for never forgetting and never for one second taking for granted the price paid by our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsman. May God bless the work they are doing. 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today so that we think about the over 5 million Americans, including thousands of Floridians and nearly half a million American veterans, who are living with Alzheimer’s and dementia. Alzheimer’s is the only one of the top 10 causes of death that cannot be prevented, cannot be cured, and cannot be slowed. As the sixth leading cause of death in Florida, and with so many affected by this incurable disease, we have to continue to stress the importance of early diagnosis and the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and related illnesses. But awareness is never enough. As a member of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer’s Disease, I am determined to make progress for all those affected. We must act proactively to achieve breakthroughs in prevention and treatment. We also have to act to ensure that those who currently have Alzheimer’s have the tools that are needed to manage their symptoms, reduce pain, and increase comfort. Nearly half of all people with Alzheimer’s and other dementias are in hospice care at the time of their passing, but less than half of nursing homes have some sort of palliative care program. For people with advanced dementia, palliative care improves their quality of life, controls costs, and enhances both patient and family satisfaction. As the demand for this kind of care grows with the aging population, more has to be done to ensure that there is a workforce equipped to provide that care. That is why I recently signed onto the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act, a bipartisan bill that will help our Nation’s seniors who are struggling with the effects of Alzheimer’s. I have spoken to a few Members in this House who have not been touched by this serious illness in one way or another. Whether they have been impacted personally, supported a loved one during a tough time, or prayed for a friend who needed help, we all know how difficult that situation is. This is a great bill. I urge my fellow colleagues to think back to that person that they have known and how much this could have benefited them. Mr. Speaker, let us take some decisive action to help patients with Alzheimer’s and their families. Let’s pass this bill. DON’T REPEAL ACA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend who just spoke, if he wants to do something for Alzheimer’s, don’t pass the Senate Republican healthcare bill. It would devastate Medicaid and Alzheimer’s victims who rely on Medicaid service. Ensuring that every American has access to highquality and affordable healthcare is the most important and enduring challenge, arguably, facing our Nation today. Ironically, we are closer than ever before to achieving that goal. Since the Affordable Care Act was adopted, more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans have gained quality coverage. In fact, we have reduced the uninsured rate to the lowest level ever recorded. Americans no longer face punitive annual and lifetime limits, and they no longer have the fear of having their inadequate health insurance cut off if they dare get sick. Insurance companies can no longer refuse to cover Americans who suffer preexisting conditions, which is the case for tens of millions of Americans. The Affordable Care Act has been the difference between life and death for adults who have been locked out of the system for years, for sick children who have reached their lifetime limits before they can even leave the hospital where they were born, for families bankrupted by a cancer diagnosis, and for everyday Americans that will require expensive treatments for the rest of their lives due to a chronic illness or accident. The Republican effort to repeal this bill is a unilateral retreat from the progress made under the Affordable Care Act and from President Trump’s own promise that there would be ‘‘insurance for everybody.’’ I guess there was a footnote: except for 23 million. This promise made by the President is not the only falsehood perpetrated by many of my friends on the other side of the aisle about the Affordable Care Act. Here are three more: Falsehood number one: Republicans say costs are out of control. The truth is, since the Affordable Care Act became law, healthcare costs have grown at the slowest rate in 50 years. That is right, the slowest rate in 50 years, and considerably below the decade preceding the adoption of the act. Republicans conveniently ignore the fact that, under their own repeal plan, their premiums would go up an average of 64 percent. Falsehood number two: Republicans claim the Affordable Care Act is in a death spiral. Well, this would come as news to the Congressional Budget Office, Standard & Poor’s, and the American Academy of Actuaries, all of whom have concluded that the Affordable Care Act’s individual markets are stable and could continue to improve, except, of course, for Republicans talking it down. Falsehood number three: Republicans say that insurers are fleeing the markets and consumers will have no choice. The truth is the Affordable Care Act is not imploding, but Republicans have certainly tried to sow dysfunction and destroy the individual markets. In some places, they have succeeded. They have resorted to sabotaging the individual markets to fulfill their own false narrative. They killed the risk corridors that stabilized those markets and have used riders and mustpass spending bills to undermine premium stabilization programs. This has resulted in huge losses to some insurers, causing them to pull out of markets, understandably, and to increase premiums when they otherwise would not have. Ironically, the same premium stabilization programs that the Republicans have attacked since 2014 are actually in their own repeal bill. The Trump administration has refused to commit to making the cost sharing reduction payments that lower outofpocket costs for consumers. That has caused premiums to go up. Without those payments, Americans will see premiums increase by an average of 19 percent. b1030 One Blue Cross Blue Shield executive noted the premium increases would be 8 percent if the costsharing reduction payments were guaranteed. Other insurers have explicitly stated that their participation is contingent on those payments. Threatening not to make those payments, of course, undermines the system. Those payments are not the only aspect of ObamaCare the Trump administration has sabotaged. They have also disrupted enrollment in individual markets by refusing to enforce the individual mandate, by cutting the open enrollment period in half, and by refusing to promote the enrollment itself on television. Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration have chosen sabotage and repeal over bipartisan cooperation to fix that which is not working. I would propose we work in a bipartisan fashion, and I have three ideas. First, introduce a public option to increase competition in marketplaces; second, we can implement premium stabilization programs in order to keep premiums affordable for everybody; and third, we can increase premium tax credits and costsharing subsidies to lower costs and boost enrollment for middle class Americans. That is the bipartisan solution to healthcare, not a reckless repeal effort that will deny 23 million of our fellow Americans access to healthcare. 
BRUCE HERSCHENSOHN BIRTHDAY WISHES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of our Nation’s greatest conservative minds and most eloquent voices, Bruce Herschensohn of California, on the occasion of his upcoming birthday. I am told he is opposed to keeping an exact count of birthdays, either that or he has simply lost track, but it is a significant milestone and one for which his friends are grateful and his country is fortunate. He served our Nation and the free peoples of the world in the U.S. Information Agency during the Cold War. Anyone who saw and was inspired by the classic tribute, ‘‘John F. Kennedy: Years of Lightning, Day of Drums,’’ has Bruce Herschensohn to thank. He went on to serve President Nixon as both speechwriter and adviser. Anyone who lived in southern California in the late 1970s or the 1980s will remember Bruce’s incisive nightly commentaries on KABCTV and his decisive debates with John Tunney. I can tell you that they fundamentally shaped my thinking and animated my career, and I often encounter others throughout the country who trace their political roots back to his nightly conservative homilies. Through the darkest days of the Carter malaise, Herschensohn became a beacon of hope, helping to pave the way for the Reagan Revolution. He marshaled the selfevident truths of the American founding and introduced them to a new generation that was losing its memory of them. He connected the dots between freedom and its importance to the prosperity and happiness of our society and the stability of our world. He helped lay the foundation for the Reagan administration on the Presidential transition team. If he had had any knack or inclination for raising money, he would have served many years in the United States Senate, and both California and the Nation would have been infinitely better for it. He was one of the earliest voices to raise the alarm over Islamist terrorism and has been one of the strongest defenders of the State of Israel through all its travails and challenges of the past halfcentury. But I believe his greatest influence is through the thousands of students who have had the good fortune to study under his tutelage at the Pepperdine University School of Public Policy for more than a decade. The full measure of his contributions to our Nation will be measured over the many years to come as his students take their place in shaping our Nation’s policies over the next generation. On behalf of so many who have been influenced, inspired, and ultimately motivated by the elegance of his reasoning and the eloquence of his words, I am honored to offer happy birthday wishes to Bruce Herschensohn today. f 
HONORING SENATOR KEVIN O’TOOLE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the retirement of New Jersey Senator Kevin O’Toole. Like me, Senator O’Toole is a proud son of New Jersey. He was born to an IrishAmerican GI and Korean war refugee in Cedar Grove, New Jersey, where he still lives today with his wife, Beth. They are proud parents of two children, Kevin, Jr., and Ryan Marie. Kevin’s parents instilled in him a strong commitment to service that shaped his entire career. At age 25, Kevin was elected to the Cedar Grove Township Council and then mayor. As assemblyman and State senator, Kevin has been a tireless advocate for small businesses, for law enforcement, first responders, our seniors, and our families. Like me, Kevin has been a strong advocate and force for lowering property taxes, supporting our veterans and first responders, cutting bureaucratic red tape, and strengthening domestic violence statutes. Kevin will soon continue his service at the New Jersey Port Authority, advocating for the critical infrastructure needed to drive economic growth. He has been a true leader on business growth and streamlining regulations to attract companies to our State and encourage the ones in New Jersey to stay in New Jersey. I applaud the high value Kevin has importantly placed on constituent service throughout his career as a legislator, a key and essential priority for any public servant. And Kevin has worked across the aisle with Republicans and Democrats alike, a practice that is essential in this time of gridlock. As Kevin departs the Senate, we wish him all the best. I hope he enjoys more time with his family, many more rounds of golf, and I applaud and thank Kevin O’Toole, a true public servant. 
HONORING FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL MASTER SERGEANT WILLIAM BISHOP The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) for 5 minutes. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart in honor of Florida’s Highway Patrol Master Sergeant William Bishop, who lost his life in the line of duty on June 17 in Alachua, Florida. Throughout three decades of public service, Master Sergeant Bishop demonstrated a clear and noble commitment to others. His tragic passing reminds us all of the real dangers that law enforcement officers face on a daily basis. So many are quick to criticize the police, yet they are the first ones they call when they need help. I join my colleagues and friends in thanking all law enforcement personnel around the Nation standing ready to risk their lives to safeguard our communities. Master Sergeant Bishop’s memory will live on through his fellow officers, family, and members of the public whose lives were positively impacted through a selfless dedication. I ask that you keep his wife and son in your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. RECOGNIZING DR . MARTHA ROBERTS  
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Dr. Martha Roberts, a championed member of the Florida agricultural community and the latest recipient of the Florida’s Woman of the Year in Agriculture award. Dr. Roberts’ esteemed career includes 35 years at the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. She is also a member of many Federal advisory groups, committees, and associations where her expertise has not only benefited the State of Florida but also the Nation. More specifically, Dr. Roberts served as the director of the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Science program, a Federal Statecounty partnership dedicated to developing knowledge in agriculture and natural resources located in my home district. Through her work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Dr. Roberts has helped shape policy that will advance Florida’s agricultural industry and trades for years to come. I would like to congratulate Dr. Roberts on her accomplishment and thank her for her dedication to agriculture and food safety. Her positive, meaningful contributions to Florida’s Third Congressional District and the Nation will not be overlooked. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Florida Gators for winning their first ever College Baseball World Series. Florida coach Kevin O’Sullivan never doubted that his Gators would win a national championship. It was just a matter of time. He has done a tremendous job coaching a talented roster of student athletes. With this victory, UF becomes the first university in the SEC and only the fourth in the Nation to win a national championship in football, men’s basketball, and now baseball. No one can ever take that away from this team or the Gator nation. I stand with all UF alumni, the Rowdy Reptiles, and the entire Gator nation when I say I could not be more proud of this team and the finest academic and athletic institution in the State of Florida. Go Gators. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Secretary Purdue and the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service for implementing a suspension of all imports of fresh beef from Brazil. I would also like to thank my colleagues from across the aisle for joining together to back this crucial step to ensure the health and safety of American families. Since March, the USDA has blocked 11 percent of fresh beef from Brazil due to safety concerns. As one of the world’s leaders in beef production, the United States has the responsibility to set the highest possible standards for what we allow in our Nation’s kitchens, grocery stores, and restaurants. Brazil is an important trading partner, and we value our mutually beneficial relationships, but we cannot allow this substandard with potential health hazards of beef to enter our food supply. I am encouraged by the Brazilian Government’s commitment to fixing these issues, and I look forward to reestablishing relationships with the Brazilian beef market as soon as we can be assured that its qualities meet the high standards of the USDA. 
REPUBLICAN PARTY FEVER HAS NOT BROKEN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, in 2012, President Obama was speaking to some of his supporters in Minneapolis. They were eager to know how he was planning to make progress on key issues in his second term, given the uncompromising rabid opposition of the majority in this House. Here is what President Obama said: ‘‘I believe that if we’re successful in this election, when we’re successful in this election, that the fever may break, because there’s a tradition in the Republican Party of more common sense than that.’’ Five years later, I can say—we can all say—that the fever has not broken. The fever is running as hot as ever. The fever drove this House majority to threaten default on our Nation’s debt, to shut down the Federal Government, to indulge racist birther conspiracies, to elevate the very champion of those conspiracies to the Presidency of the United States. Ten years ago, I know Republican leaders could not imagine that kind of conspiracy would spread throughout the Republican Party rank and file, but it did and it has. Five years ago, GOP leaders could not have imagined that their party would nominate Donald Trump and elect him to the Presidency, but they did. One year ago, I know Republican leaders could not imagine that they would cover for the Trump campaign and Trump administration’s collusion with the Russian Government, but they have, and they are. For far too long, Democrats have wanted to believe that the GOP would come to its senses. We wanted to believe that it was really just a fringe minority within the GOP that was the problem, that sober, sensible leaders like John Boehner and MITCH MCCONNELL wanted to do the right thing, but they couldn’t because of the Tea Party. They couldn’t unless we helped them. And that is why Democrats bailed out Boehner time after time, jam after jam. Democrats have to stop deluding themselves. There is only one Republican Party, and it is the party of Trump. It is the party whose Senate leader, MITCH MCCONNELL , blocked efforts by the Obama administration to stop Russian interference in the 2016 election. It is the party that every day looks the other way in the face of Trump’s appeasement of Russia and fails to hold Trump accountable. Last week, Congressman TEDLIEU and I introduced two amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act that the House is debating currently on the floor. The first would endorse the intelligence community’s assessment regarding the Russian’s meddling in our 2016 election. This is critical because Donald Trump has repeatedly cast doubt, as recently as yesterday, on the report that despite unanimous agreement from all of our intelligence agencies, that indeed there was collusion, that indeed there was interference by Russians. The second amendment would block an outrageous Trump administration initiative to create a new cybersecurity partnership with the Russian Government. Trump’s plan would let the fox into the henhouse and pave the way for more election interference in our upcoming elections and others, all at the invitation of Donald Trump. These would have been two sensible steps that the House of Representatives could have taken this week to counter interference in our elections, but last night, the GOP leadership, under Chairman SESSIONS and the House Rules Committee, blocked these amendments. They refused to give these amendments a chance to be debated and voted on the floor. As more and more information comes out about Russia, Americans all over the country keep hoping that the GOP will do the right thing, that they will put country before party and hold Trump accountable, but they have not, and they will not. Just this past week, Donald Trump, Jr., himself released emails that show unequivocally the Trump campaign’s eagerness to collude with the Russian Government, but that hasn’t changed a thing. It hasn’t stopped Speaker RYANfrom blocking a Russian sanctions bill at the Trump administration’s request. It hasn’t stopped Chairman SESSIONS and the Rules Committee from blocking my amendment to set the record straight on Russian interference and help prevent it in the future. The truth is, they are all complicit. It is time to recognize the GOP majority is not the victim here. They aren’t suffering from a fever that Democrats have to help fight. It is the United States Congress, as a whole, that has a fever, and it is the GOP’s grip on the majority that is the cause. It is time for us to face reality. The problem isn’t the Tea Party, it is the Republican Party. 
b1045 RECOGNIZING FULBRIGHT SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, for more than 70 years, the Fulbright program, established by Congress, has forged connections between Americans and emerging leaders around the world. The Fulbright program has provided more than 370,000 participants, chosen for their academic merit and leadership potential, with the opportunity to exchange ideas and contribute to finding solutions to shared international concerns. Each year the Fulbright program grants students with the opportunity to study, research, or teach English abroad in an effort to internationalize communities and campuses around the world. I rise today to recognize the prestigious accomplishment of students from my district who received Fulbright scholarships for the 2016–2017 grant year. Our proud congratulations to: Kimberly Algeo of Newtown, a scholar in anthropology from Rider University, for her work in Japan; Elizabeth Beavers of Yardley, a student from the University of Maryland, College Park, on an English teaching assistantship in South Korea; Hunter Gabbard of Doylestown, a student in physics from the University of Mississippi, for his work in Germany; Michael Galperin of Warminster, a student from Lafayette College, on an English teaching assistantship in South Korea; William Lescas of Churchville, a student in political science from the University of Delaware, for his work in Denmark; Ivan SimpsonKent of Levittown, a student in biology from the University of Scranton, for his work in Germany; And Dr. Paul Swann of Doylestown, a scholar in communications from Temple University, for his work in South Korea. On behalf of the Eighth Congressional District of Pennsylvania, to all 
of our scholars, we congratulate them for their prestigious accomplishment. And just to let all of you know, you continue to make all of us proud. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the mothers, daughters, and wives of my district. I stand here in solemn support for women not only in our community, but across our Nation and throughout the world who experience domestic violence each day. This unacceptable treatment cannot go unnoticed. We must continue to push for better opportunities for those abused in our community. By providing these women with more options, they can begin to find safety, support, and empowerment for a better way of life. Whether this be supporting a child or finding a better job and employment, it is important that their voices be heard. I am proud to work with community based organizations committed to empowering women and ending domestic violence for all. I commend A Woman’s Place in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, for their steadfast commitment to a society where all individuals are safe and can flourish. Mr. Speaker, I thank the leadership staff at A Woman’s Place, Mae O’Brien, Lauren Bucksner, Danielle Ferri, and Heather Giampapa, as well as other staff and volunteers committed to promoting peace, quality, and respect in our districts and beyond. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Perkasie Park on its 135th anniversary and celebrate its new status as a National Historic District. Founded in 1882, Perkasie Park is one of just a handful of intact camp meeting facilities that continue to operate in Pennsylvania. Home to dozens of Victorianera cottages and buildings, at its height, Perkasie Park was Bucks County’s biggest attraction, drawing worshippers and vacationers from Philadelphia and the surrounding region to the quaint, quiet countryside of the Borough of Perkasie. Last year, thanks to the tireless efforts of volunteers, residents, and community leaders, Perkasie Park was named to the National Register of Historic Places for its role in the American camp meeting movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Through their dedication, the park joined over 150 Bucks County properties on the National Register, including the 1832 South Perkasie Covered Bridge on the other side of town. I am proud to represent a district that understands and honors its deep rooted history, and I join with the people in Perkasie in celebrating this momentous anniversary and accomplishment. MAINTAINING A STRONG DEFENSE IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, before it was cool to quote Ronald Reagan’s national security philosophy of peace through strength, there was our first Commander in Chief, George Washington, who, in his first State of the Union address, said, ‘‘. . . to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.’’ See, maintaining a strong national defense is not a new concept. While more war has been diverted, more peace has been kept, and more freedom has been defended by our Nation’s armed services, today we risk not only our Nation’s security, but the lives of those who serve if we fail to adequately fund our military. The policies and posture of the past 8 years under the previous administration have left our defense arsenal dilapidated, our position in the world diminished, our allies doubtful, and, unfortunately, our enemies even more determined. Our military men and women have faced years of cuts, almost a quarter of our entire military budget, with defense spending at historic lows, over $170 billion, since 2010. So as the world becomes increasingly dangerous and unstable, the government has forced our armed services to do more with less. One of the United States’ greatest assets in our national security arsenal and one of the crown jewels of west Texas is Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Texas. Dyess plays a key role in protecting our democracy against the rising global threats, and our airmen from Dyess have been deployed all over the world in countless military and humanitarian operations. Additionally, Dyess hosts the largest B–1 bomber base in the Nation; and the city of Abilene has won the Air Force’s award for most supportive communities so many times, they actually changed the name of the award to the Abilene award. Now, that may sound like I am bragging, but in Texas, that is just telling the truth. But while we put the lives of these men and women on the line daily and ask them to defend our Nation, they are crippled by this discouraging reality. The Air Force is now the smallest and the oldest it has been in our Nation’s history. Altogether, given the current demand, our Nation’s Air Force is short 1,500 pilots, 4,000 mechanics. Before the House Armed Services Committee, General Stephen Wilson testified: ‘‘Today we find ourselves less than 50 percent ready across our Air Force, and we have pockets that are even below that.’’ In fact, just to get by, the Air Force has been utilizing bombers that were designed and constructed for World War II. This is a national security crisis, Mr. Speaker. This is a great American travesty. Why? Because I believe our former President, for political reasons, in my opinion, arbitrarily withdrew troops from critical battlefronts and dangerously drew down our overall military resources. Today, on behalf of Dyess Air Force Base and all the brave men and women who keep our great country safe, I urge my colleagues to pass the National Defense Authorization Act, which will rebuild our national security, repair our national defense, and restore America’s leadership position in the world. The NDAA will provide our military with the resources they need to address our current threats. We have increased funding 10 percent over the previous administration. The NDAA will fund Dyess Air Force Base and other military installations at appropriate levels, increase the size of our armed services, enhance and modernize our defense arsenal, give our troops a pay raise. If anybody in the Federal Government has performed with excellence and with courage and distinction, it is our men and women in uniform, and they deserve a pay raise. This NDAA will also build on the reforms that we have enacted over the last 2 years to update, improve, and streamline services to our armed services. By passing the NDAA, we send a message to the world that America will continue to be the greatest force for good in the history of mankind; a message to our allies who promote liberty and democracy that you can count on us to defend you, we have got your back; a message to our brave military men and women that we are standing firmly behind you, we are going to put our money where our mouth is, we are going to protect you as you protect us; and a message to our enemies that America is no longer in the business of making idle threats. Mr. Speaker, before I close, I want to thank Chairman THORNBERRY for his hard work on this bill and for being a tireless advocate for our military. I am proud to call him a fellow west Texan, and I am even more proud to call him my friend. One must wonder, on the heels of our 241st birthday, how did this oldest continuous democracy persist for two centuries against all odds? Don’t you wonder? Mr. Speaker, vote for NDAA, vote for our military. God bless America. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Bishop Joshua K. Lynn, Mastin Lake Church of God of Prophecy, Huntsville, Alabama, offered the following prayer: Holy Father, You are the almighty, allknowing creator. We submit to Your infinite wisdom. On behalf of our Nation and these leaders, we seek Your forgiveness for placing other ways higher than Yours. Grant us Your amazing grace from our sin as we turn to You. Open the ears of this body, this Nation’s leaders, and all who call this great land home to hear Your voice. Tenderize the soil of our hearts so we may receive Your guidance. Heal our land of bitterness, hate, and evil against You and one another. Grant our Nation a spiritual renewal and awakening. Give this Nation and its leaders wisdom today and the days that follow. As we follow You, let Your favor be with us. Let Your name ring higher than any other name. For it is in Your holy, loving, merciful, and gracious name we pray. In Jesus’ name, amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from California (Mr. MCNERNEY ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. MCNERNEY led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING BISHOP JOSHUA K. LYNN The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BROOKS ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to welcome Bishop Joshua K. Lynn to the House of Representatives. I thank him for serving as today’s guest chaplain. Joshua is the senior pastor serving Mastin Lake Church of God of Prophecy in Huntsville, Alabama. He also serves as the area presbyter, regional overseer, of north Alabama. Bishop Lynn earned his bachelor’s degree and his master of arts in biblical studies from Clarks Summit University. He serves Huntsville not only as a pastor, but as a volunteer with the Covenant Christian Academy Athletic Committee. Bishop Lynn and his wife, Chrissy, also direct a summer youth program at Camp Boothe in West Blocton, Alabama. Bishop Lynn and Chrissy have been married for almost 18 years, and they have four children: Camille, Ava, Heidi, and Elias. I understand they are here with Joshua today. We welcome them to Washington. I appreciate the work Bishop Lynn has done and the positive impact he has had on north Alabama by providing care and support not only for the spiritual needs, but also the social and physical needs of our community. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act. With the hard work of the Armed Services Committee, this year’s NDAA will begin to rebuild our military after years of spending cuts. Our troops have been facing a readiness crisis due to consistent underfunding. This important legislation will begin to address the crisis with key investments in military readiness, and it fully funds a 2.4 percent, welldeserved pay raise for our troops. In the 12th District of Georgia, we are at the forefront of cyber innovation, with the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence located at Fort Gordon. I am happy to say that the NDAA will fully fund cyber operations with an increase of $1.7 billion from fiscal year ‘17 and provides over $85 billion in military construction and Army Family Housing funds. It is our constitutional obligation as Members of Congress to provide for the common defense of the Nation. I believe that, with the passage of the fiscal year ‘18 NDAA, we are meeting our obligation to keep America safe, close the critical readiness gap, and rebuild the 21st century military. 
SAVE AMERICAN JOBS (Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today regarding an issue that Congress 
often decries but neglects: too many Americans are out of work because companies ship their jobs overseas without a thought for the workers and communities they leave behind. According to the group Public Citizen, the offshoring of American jobs has contributed to the loss of 4.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs. But we have an opportunity to change that. I am proud to introduce the Stop Outsourcing and Create American Jobs Act and the Outsourcing Accountability Act. These two bills are designed to save American jobs by curbing outsourcing. By cracking down on tax loopholes that give corporations a break on the backs of American taxpayers, we can grow our economy and increase economic opportunities for the middle class. I hope my colleagues will join me in a serious discussion about how we can help our economy grow and help American workers. I welcome their support for these bills. 
TWO YEARS OF THE FAILED IRAN DEAL (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks 2 years since the previous administration capitulated to the dangerous Iran deal, a onesided agreement that rewarded the regime in Tehran with a $1.7 billion ransom of pallets of unmarked currency for four hostages and put our allies, including Israel, at risk. The Iran deal emboldened the authoritarian regime. Just last month, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley correctly pointed out that Tehran has engaged in destructive and destabilizing actions, both testing ballistic missiles and engaging in arms smuggling. This week, Senators TOMCOTTON , MARCO RUBIO, TEDCRUZ, and D AVID PERDUE , sent a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urging him not to certify Iran’s compliance with the Iran deal as the deadline approaches. Refusing to certify Iran’s compliance with the Iran deal would send a clear message that President Donald Trump is committed to peace through strength and refuses to comply with a ridiculous deal that puts American families at risk. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
REQUIRE A SCORE BEFORE THE FLOOR (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, yesterday Congressman BRIAN HIGGINS and I introduced H. Res. 441, legislation that would require a Congressional Budget Office score before a floor vote. This resolution clearly enshrines in House rules a fundamental and very simple principle of good governance: namely, we should know the budgetary and practical impact of legislation before we vote on it. Frankly, Mr. Speaker, it should not be necessary for us to introduce this legislation. For years, the CBO has been an important nonpartisan player in crafting legislation and giving an independent assessment of what a bill costs and whom it will benefit or whom it will hurt. Unfortunately, we have seen House leadership rush major legislation to the floor without a CBO score, preventing Members from knowing the impact on their constituents and the budget before voting. The most egregious example, of course, was the May 4 vote on the TrumpCare bill that barely passed this Chamber and would strip 23 million Americans of healthcare. That bill was rushed to the House floor before it had a CBO score, and Members voted blindly on it without knowing the impact on their constituents. Our resolution simply says transparency, accountability, and know what is in the bill. No score, no floor; it’s that simple. f 
HONORING LAURINBURGMAXTON ARMY AIR BASE (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the Laurinburg Maxton Army Air Base in Scotland County, North Carolina, which played a vital but littleknown role in World War II. From 1942 to 1945, Scotland County helped prepare glider pilots for the invasions of North Africa, Sicily, and Italy. Generals Dwight Eisenhower and George Marshall visited the base during the war to observe glider training. On June 6, 1944, when more than 160,000 Allied troops landed during the Invasion of Normandy, glider pilots trained in Scotland County were among the vanguard as American soldiers silently soared down the French coastline through the thick fog powered only by the prevailing winds. The brave glider pilots who trained at LaurinburgMaxton Air Base helped secure Allied victory on Dday. Today I ask you to join me in honoring those soldiers as well as the Scotland County community, which supported these efforts. 
TRUMPCARE (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, the Republican House bill is a disaster for the American people. The process by which the bill was voted on, Members had very little time to review the text. As a result, we were forced to vote on legislation without the benefit of facts, on a bill that affects a $3 trillion annual industry. That is why I have joined Congresswoman JAYAPAL in introducing H. Res. 441, to require a review by the Congressional Budget Office before a bill comes to the floor. Members of Congress should have as much information as possible to make a smart decision on major legislation affecting 18 percent of the American economy. This resolution would simply affirm the timehonored principle that facts do matter and that a fair, honest, and transparent policymaking process is essential to a healthy and thriving democracy. 
CELEBRATING NICKLAUS CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL IN MIAMI (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami, which has just been named amongst the best children’s hospitals in the Nation by U.S. News & World Report. Since 1950, Nicklaus, located in my congressional district, has been a shining light for our community and one of the leading pediatric healthcare centers in the world. Its doctors, nurses, and staff work tirelessly to provide the highest quality of care to children and teens in south Florida every day. Nicklaus also includes the Miami Children’s Research Institute, one of the largest providers of clinical research services for children in the Nation. From cardiology to neuroscience, our institute is at the forefront of the development of treatments and medicines which are improving the lives of kids not just in south Florida, but around the world. So, once again, congratulations to Nicklaus on being selected as one of the best children’s hospitals in the United States. Thanks to everyone at Nicklaus for continuing to inspire hope and promote lifelong health by providing the best care to every child in our community. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would ask Members to heed the gavel. 
b1215 TRUMPCARE PROMISES (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, The Senate is introducing yet another version of TrumpCare today. I rise to express my grave concern with the most harmful aspects of this mean and merciless bill. 
TrumpCare still includes billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, a critical source of healthcare for 1.75 million of America’s veterans, twothirds of U.S. nursing home residents, and one in five Americans. The latest Senate TrumpCare bill cuts Medicaid by as much as a third. Every version of TrumpCare we have seen would result in more than 20 million fewer Americans covered over the next 10 years. There is still no sign of a TrumpCare bill that would not break President’s Trump’s healthcare promises to the American people. The President promised ‘‘insurance for everybody.’’ He said: ‘‘Everybody’s going to be taken care of.’’ Every version of TrumpCare would break that promise, big league. The President promised that Medicaid would not be cut under his healthcare plan. No version of TrumpCare has been proposed that even comes close to keeping that promise. President Trump promised the American people a healthcare plan that would ‘‘lower premiums’’ with ‘‘much lower deductibles.’’ It is time for Americans to get a real plan and not be left with broken promises. 
VIOLENCE IS NEVER THE ANSWER (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge a tragic incident that occurred today in the Second District. Early this morning, a man drove his truck into the side of the Bay County Government Center and caused a fire that resulted in his death. My district office has an office in that building. Thankfully, no workers or visitors were injured in the incident, and all of the district staff are safe. It is a sad day to witness someone so troubled take such an action and, ultimately, their own life. While there is still much to learn about this person’s motivations and the reasons behind this attack on a public building, we should all remember that, no matter how inflamed our passions, violence is never the answer. Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking the first responders and the law enforcement officers who are addressing this incident, and please join me in a prayer for the Bay County community as they come together to respond to this tragedy. 
TRUMPCARE BILL (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as we wait for a vote on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to remind my colleagues that 51 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That is more than the support for Congress or the President. More importantly, a recent study from Kaiser found that the ACA markets are stabilizing and insurers are regaining profitability. Yet we continue to hear false arguments saying that markets are collapsing or in a death spiral. That is not true. If the majority Republican is serious about fixing our healthcare system and cutting costs to healthcare, they should give up plans to repeal and start putting solutions over politics. I have said for years that the ACA is not perfect. No bill this Congress ever passed is. But in order to fix it, we need to work together on a bipartisan basis. The bill that the Senate and House GOP has proposed will undermine protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. Now we are hearing there is an amendment on the Senate side that will essentially allow for the sale of policies with skimpier benefits, so long as insurers offer an option that covers all ACAmandated benefits. We know where that goes. We will not be able to afford those benefits. f 
WATERS OF THE U.S. RULE (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, in 2015, President Obama’s EPA implemented the waters of the U.S., or the WOTUS rule, which arbitrarily and unilaterally expanded which kinds of waterways could be regulated under the Clean Water Act. This rule turned every irrigation ditch, pond, and puddle on a farm into a new target for Washington regulators. In addition, this rule circumvented the Congress and the investigative process. As a Representative for one of the largest agricultural districts in the country, I have heard time and again from farmers about the costs of these renewed regulations, not to mention the headaches caused by trying to comply. By the EPA’s own estimates, the rule would cost farmers and small businesses up to $460 million a year. It is not only bad policy, but also a bad idea to arbitrarily make it more difficult for farmers to do their jobs and provide our food and fuel for our economy. That is why I was relieved to see that President Trump rescinded this rule last month. By rescinding this rule, the President sent a strong message that Washington must put farmers ahead of bureaucrats. 
WILSON AMENDMENT TO THE 2018 NDAA (Ms. WILSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on the night of April 14, 2014, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls from the Chibok Government Girls Secondary School in Nigeria, a night we all remember. Although some girls fled or have been released, more than 100 Chibok girls remain in captivity today with Boko Haram, the deadliest terrorist organization in the world. Last year, Congress unanimously passed bipartisan legislation sponsored by U.S. Senator SUSAN COLLINS and myself to require a 5year strategy to conquer Boko Haram. Last night, an amendment to solidify the bill and add a sense of Congress that expresses our support for the kidnapped schoolgirls and the United States strategy for countering Boko Haram was passed in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act. I thank Armed Services Committee Chairman THORNBERRY , Ranking Member SMITH, Rules Committee Chairman SESSIONS , Ranking Member S LAUGH TER, and Congressman A LCEE HASTINGS . We will continue to fight against Boko Haram and their vicious and cruel tactics against the Nigerian people. We will continue to wear red every Wednesday until all of our girls are released. Remember to tweet, tweet, tweet, #bringbackourgirls. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would ask Members to heed the gavel. 
CHANGE OF COMMAND (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of a timehonored U.S. Navy tradition: the change of command at NSWC Crane, a vital military command in my district in southern Indiana, located on the Navy’s third largest base in the world. Today, as we welcome our new commanding officer, Captain Mark Oesterreich, and family, to southwest Indiana, we say goodbye to Captain J.T. Elder, who has steered this premier center of excellence for the past 3 years. Captain Elder empowered his team to manage NSWC Crane by focusing on people, connecting with its workforce, and being a champion for leadership development. As a community leader, he realized that fostering relationships with neighboring cities, towns, and counties was essential to attracting and retaining Crane’s outstanding workforce, and nurturing its workforce for the years ahead. As Hoosiers everywhere join in salute, we are deeply indebted to Captain Elder for his remarkable 28year contribution to our Nation’s defense. I wish Captain Elder and Cynthia fair 
winds and following seas in the next chapter of their lives. 
WORK TOGETHER TO FIX HEALTHCARE (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Senate Republicans continue to push a flawed and harmful healthcare bill, TrumpCare. It fails to address the basic healthcare needs of Americans. Republicans themselves are deeply divided on the subject. You have Republicans negotiating with Republicans and they can’t come to consensus. Democrats, meanwhile, have been willing to work to come to consensus to work together to fix those real issues that we know we have to address in the Affordable Care Act. We have not been given the opportunity. There has been no transparency in any of this discussion, no hearings, and no public input. The entire process is behind closed doors. Of course, we know why. This is a bill that kicks millions of Americans off of healthcare. Twentytwo million people would lose health insurance. For those lucky enough to get healthcare, they will pay more for less. Their outof pocket expenses will go up. If you are 50 to 64, there will be an age tax. This is a terrible piece of legislation. It ought to be rejected and we ought to work together to fix the problems we have. 
TAMPA BAY AREA COMBATS HUMAN TRAFFICKING (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, in light of the important antihuman trafficking legislation passed by the House, I want to recognize efforts in the Tampa Bay area to combat human trafficking. I am especially proud of the joint task force formed by Pasco County Sheriff’s Office Corporal Alan Wilkett, BayCare’s Liana Dean, and many others. Their work brings us closer to a community that is safer for our most vulnerable citizens. Human trafficking is not a distant problem for other countries. It is a human rights crisis happening right here at home. Last year, Florida reported 550 human trafficking cases. That is the third largest number of cases in the country. It is unacceptable. We passed three bipartisan bills to strengthen detection systems, improve education efforts, and protect victims. We have got to pass them in the Senate as well and have it become law. The fight against human trafficking is a fight for the safety and security of our communities. TACKLING THE CAUSE OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, in my home State of Hawaii, hospitalizations and emergency room visits from opioidrelated conditions have more than doubled in the last decade. More people are now dying from overdoses than motor vehicle accidents. This opioid epidemic is killing 91 Americans all across this country every single day. For years, companies like Purdue Pharma, the maker of the commonly known drug OxyContin, have profited off of the suffering of millions of Americans who are dealing and struggling with opioid addiction. Now Purdue and others are going overseas, targeting foreign populations, using the very same shady marketing tactics, lies, and false advertising that helped them get rich at the expense of the American people. This is absolutely unacceptable. We can’t just keep wringing our hands about the opioid crisis without actually tackling the cause of it. Purdue and those responsible should be prosecuted for the deaths and lives that have been ruined as a result of their lies. f 
LET’S GET ON WITH BUSINESS (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I don’t believe I have ever seen a bigger mountain made out of a tinier molehill in my 29 years in Congress than what is being made out of Donald Trump, Jr.’s, meeting with the Russian lawyer. It reminds me of the Wendy’s ad several years ago that asked: ‘‘Where’s the beef?’’ I know that hindsight is 20–20 and holier than thou, but this is ridiculous. Do you really believe that Chelsea Clinton would have refused to meet with a Russian lawyer who she was told had evidence that would incriminate Donald Trump? Donald Trump, Jr., met with this woman for a few minutes, saw she had nothing, and nothing came out of it. No action was taken. Even Director Comey testified he had seen no evidence that even one vote was altered by anything the Russians did. They have been investigating this for months, and this is the best they can come up with? It is time to stop crying over the election and do something about some real problems. 
AMENDMENTS TO NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleagues for passage of my three amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act last night. Two of my amendments would address our Nation’s opioid crisis as it impacts or Nation’s servicemembers and veterans. They would direct the Defense Department to study the effectiveness of their opioid prescriber education policies and require Department providers to counsel or give referrals to the VA for transitioning veterans that suffer from addiction or chronic pain. My third amendment would direct the Department of Defense to analyze sexual coercion in the military as part of its annual report on sexual assault. While I commend the Department for their progress in reducing the occurrence of sexual assault in the military, more work needs to be done. Understanding sexual coercion is important to the safety of our brave men and women, and important for our national security. f 
b1230 RECOGNIZING MISS MOLLY MATNEY (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Miss Molly Matney, an outstanding resident of Metcalfe County in the First Congressional District of Kentucky. Ms. Matney was crowned Miss Kentucky 2017 on July 1. She is an agriculture major at Western Kentucky University and hopes to pursue a career as an agricultural lending executive. Her talents and accomplishments distinguish her as a valuable asset to the Miss Kentucky organization, as well as the First District of Kentucky. The ‘‘Farm Fit’’ platform she has developed encourages consumption of products found in local farmers’ markets to help individuals maintain a healthy lifestyle. This concept complements and reemphasizes fundamental aspects of the Kentucky Department of Agriculture’s ‘‘Kentucky Proud’’ campaign. Her yearlong travels will allow her to promote both of these initiatives throughout the Commonwealth. I am confident she will utilize her knowledge of Kentucky’s agriculture industry for the betterment of her platform and will continue to be a deserving advocate for Kentucky farmers. I wish her the best of luck as she prepares to compete at the Miss America pageant in Atlanta City, New Jersey, on September 10, and I look forward to her continued contributions to the First District of Kentucky. 
MILITARY HUNGER PREVENTION ACT (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, as the House considers the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act this week, I would like to draw attention to one provision that was left out of the bill: the Military Hunger Prevention Act. It is shameful that military families like lower ranking enlisted servicemembers with larger households are among the 42 million Americans suffering from food insecurity. While up to 22,000 military households rely on SNAP, many military families are unable to receive modest benefits due to an unintended provision that counts certain housing allowances as income when determining eligibility for SNAP. To address this issue, I have joined with my friend, Representative SUSAN  DAVIS, on the bipartisan Military Hunger Prevention Act. I am disappointed that this commonsense technical fix was left out of this year’s NDAA, and I plan to continue working with my colleagues and our advocacy partners like MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger to move this legislation forward. We owe it to the families who have sacrificed so much for our country to do all that we can to end hunger now. 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO HABITAT FOR HUMANITY OF LIVINGSTON COUNTY, MICHIGAN (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an inspirational organization in my district, Habitat for Humanity of Livingston County, located in the Eighth District of Michigan. This July, Livingston County’s Habitat for Humanity is celebrating its 25th year of transforming lives by building quality homes. Habitat for Humanity was incorporated within Livingston County in 1992, and since then, the organization is dedicated to many community and international service projects. Over the past 25 years, Habitat for Humanity has made a positive impact on Livingston County, constructing and rehabilitating 18 homes for families in need within the community. Livingston County’s Habitat for Humanity also supports the services of Habitat International in its fight against homelessness across the world, providing monetary donations which funded and constructed an additional 15 homes worldwide. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to congratulate Livingston County’s Habitat for Humanity for its 25 years of service. Thank you, Habitat for Humanity, for your commitment to the people you serve and to our entire Livingston County community. REMARKS ON NORTH KOREA (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, last week, as we celebrated our Nation’s birthday, news broke that North Korea successfully launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile. The missile’s estimated range would put Alaska within reach. Like all Americans, I am deeply concerned by this development. North Korea’s possession of an estimated 20 nuclear warheads and chemical and biological weapons makes it an urgent and imminent threat to the United States. While there are no easy options, our country must do more to deter the Kim regime. I strongly support building our missile defense programs, which is a priority in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act, which the House is considering this week. I also support increasing sanctions against China and Chinese companies that support the Kim regime. At this critical time, all options, including military action, must be on the table. The threat of a nucleararmed North Korea is too serious to simply maintain the status quo. f 
PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2810, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 440 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alabama? There was no objection. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 440 provides for a complete consideration of H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. The rule allows for consideration of 122 amendments in addition to the amendments made in order by yesterday’s rule. This brings the total number of amendments made in order for full consideration to 210. When you add in the 275 amendments offered during the Armed Services Committee markup, we will, in total, have considered 485 amendments to this year’s NDAA. Just as important, there is a clear bipartisan split between the number of majority and the number of minority amendments made in order. Mr. Speaker, this has been an incredibly open process that allowed Members of this body from both sides to have their input on this critical national security legislation. Like other years, the NDAA is a great example of the House working through regular order in the authorizing process and getting the job done. Thanks to this rule and the one we passed yesterday, the House will debate a number of issues where Members of this body have diverse views. From the future of GTMO to the future of the New START, the two NDAA rules provide for a robust debate on many important topics. That is a good thing, and I look forward to the debate. 
Before I continue, I want to briefly thank the staff in both the Armed Services Committee and the Rules Committee for their hard work on this rule. Dealing with this large number of amendments takes a considerable amount of time, and I know I speak for the entire body, both the majority and minority, in expressing our gratitude for their time and work in helping the members of the Rules Committee come to this product. Yesterday, I outlined my strong support for this year’s NDAA, which will help keep the American people safe and secure, so I won’t rehash all those points. But I want to share some numbers that highlight the readiness crisis facing our military. This crisis has been caused by cuts to defense spending. This bill authorizes funding for the military at $688.3 billion, which is 16.8 percent of total Federal outlays and 3.4 percent of projected gross domestic product. As a guiding point, 30 years ago, the fiscal year 1988 NDAA represented 27.3 percent of total Federal outlays. This year, 16 percent; back then, 27 percent. And 5.2 percent of projected GDP. This year, 3.4 percent; back then, 5.2 percent. We are spending less proportionately today on our military, despite the fact that we face a wider range of threats across the globe. That should be troubling to every American. Let’s think about the threat environment we faced 30 years ago: the Soviet Union. That was about it. There was no ISIS or alQaida or other radical Islamic terrorist organizations threatening the United States 30 years ago. Iran was not an existential threat to the American people 30 years ago. North Korea wasn’t developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles 30 years ago. China was not on the radar as it relates to a military power 30 years ago. We weren’t worried about cyber attacks or cyber espionage 30 years ago. It is safe to say the world was a lot different 30 years ago, yet we were devoting a greater portion of our Federal budget to the military. We must make that same or an even greater commitment today. For too long, we, in Congress, have allowed our military to steadily atrophy, bringing us to a readiness crisis. Providing for our national defense is the most important job of this Congress, and this bill helps rebuild, repair, and reform our military. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 440 and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama for the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last night, the majority on the House Rules Committee once again decided to exclude from debate 230 amendments to H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act. That means that half of the amendments submitted were rejected. I can never understand why these amendments are denied the chance to be debated by the full House. When I first came to Capitol Hill as an aide to our former friend and colleague, Congressman Joe Moakley, the Defense Authorization bill would often take up to a week for debate. But even back then, it was one of the largest and most complex bills debated, and certainly one of the most important from a national security point of view. The NDAA rule was also structured back then, but more in terms of the amount of time permitted for debate. And many amendments receive 1 hour, half an hour, 20 minutes, even 2 hours of debate. Why? Because they were about the important decisions and priorities facing our national defense policy at the time. But that is not the case today. Amendments are lucky to get 10 minutes of debate equally divided if they are lucky enough to be debated at all. And the Defense bill takes up a total of maybe 2 days’ worth of debate, if that. No wonder, no wonder Members are frustrated by this process. This year, like every year for the past several years, important issues, especially on war and peace, were left on the chopping block by the Republicans. They decided that the House should not debate two bipartisan amendments that would make sure that nothing in the NDAA could be construed as authorization to use force against the governments of North Korea or Syria. The Republican majority decided it is okay to debate a bigoted amendment that prohibits medical treatment for transgender servicemembers who are in transition, but they will not let the House debate an amendment that just calls for a study, Mr. Speaker, on blood donations from gay men. b1245 Mr. Speaker, did you know that there is a provision in the NDAA that sets up an entire new military service branch, the Space Corps? The Pentagon doesn’t want it; the Air Force doesn’t want it; they say it is premature, but an amendment by Mr. TURNER , a Republican, to require the Pentagon to report on the need to establish a Space Corps is not included in this rule. I guess the Republican leadership doesn’t want the House to have a say and a debate on such a major change. Mr. AMASH led a bipartisan amendment to block the sale of cluster munitions to Saudi Arabia. Last year, this amendment failed by just a handful of votes. I guess that is why the Republicans on the Rules Committee aren’t about to let it come up for a debate and a vote this year. When it comes to sending our uniformed women and men into war, into danger, where their very lives are at risk, the Rules Committee decided that such amendments were not worth the House’s time to debate. Last night, Republicans on the Rules Committee denied the opportunity for debate on a bipartisan amendment offered by myself and Representatives WALTER JONES , B ARBARA LEE, T OM MASSIE , JOHNGARAMENDI , DANKILDEE , and PETER WELCH . The amendment is very straightforward. If the President decides to increase the level of U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan in fiscal year 2018, then he would report to Congress on the purpose and mission of those troops, how many were required, and how long they would be there, and then Congress would vote to approve or disapprove that escalation. This would give the American people the voice they deserve when it comes to sending our men and women in uniform into battle. Mr. Speaker, the President and General Mattis just decided to send an additional 4,000 troops to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban, on top of the 8,400 U.S. troops already there. That will bring the total number of American troops there to more than 12,000. Now, if they should decide that they want even more troops in Afghanistan in fiscal year 2018, Congress should know why, and vote on it. We can’t keep giving the administration a blank check and allow America once again to go down the slippery slope of incremental escalation over the next year or two. Congress needs to step up to the plate and either approve or disapprove any renewed escalation in Afghanistan. Isn’t that amendment worth debating? We are in year 16 of the war in Afghanistan. It is the longest war in American history. Let me repeat that, Mr. Speaker. Afghanistan is the longest war in U.S. history. The costs are already in the hundreds of billions of dollars, and the human cost to our troops, our veterans, and their families have been enormous, yet Congress has not taken a single vote, has not taken a single stand on this war for 16 years. Most of the Members of this House weren’t even here when that one and only vote was taken. So in the absence of debating an updated AUMF for Afghanistan, the very least we can do is debate whether we will once again escalate our military footprint in Afghanistan, but the Republican leadership of this House doesn’t agree. Each year, the Republican leadership does everything it can to stop any debate on these wars, and this year is no different. They will allow some amendments on reports and a sense of Congress here and there, but any amendment of substance that requires Congress to act is denied. Mr. Speaker, I want to advise my colleagues of one thing, and that is, we are not an advisory commission. We are a legislative body. We need to start doing our job. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no problem with a report, but it won’t be the first time we have seen a report, whether on Afghanistan or Iraq or Syria. Even the underlying bill calls for a strategy report on Afghanistan and other conflicts, but Congress avoiding taking any responsibility for continuing to send our servicemen and women into harm’s way is absolutely shameful. Mr. Speaker, it is cowardice. Every day, military families say goodbye to their loved ones as they go into battle, placing themselves in harm’s way to keep our country safe, and Congress does nothing. All we do is kick the can down the road and call for another report and then another report. Mr. Speaker, we don’t even act when the President actually does send us an AUMF, the way President Obama did on Iraq and Syria and the war against ISIS. We did nothing. We said we didn’t like it, but we did nothing. The Republican leadership complained that they didn’t like it, but then they never even tried to act on it or to write their own AUMF. They would rather just stand on the sidelines, complain and criticize, but do nothing, absolutely nothing, except stop other Members from taking any action that might require the House to debate these wars. Shame on all of us for allowing this to continue over and over and over and over again. Now, I am guessing that whenever the House takes up the Defense appropriations bill, the Republican leaders will find a way to make sure that the bipartisansupported provision in that bill to sunset the 2001 AUMF on Afghanistan and vote on a new one within 8 months will somehow disappear without a single Member of the House at large having a chance to vote on it. Maybe we will get another report. And so it goes on and on. Mr. Speaker, there is nearly $700 billion authorized in this bill for wars, for weapons systems, for military equipment, and for personnel, all because Congress refuses to make hard choices. We can never seem to find the money to take care of our own neighborhoods and schools. We can’t find the money to provide our citizens with better, more affordable healthcare, or make sure that all our families can put food on the table. We don’t invest nearly enough in our roads and our bridges, railways and transit systems. There is never enough money to invest in a 21st century manufacturing base, provide training to support the jobs of the future, or raise the Federal minimum wage to a livable wage. We are told we don’t have the money to take care of our parks or to make sure that our air and water are drinkable and breathable. We can’t even seem to find the money to take care of our senior citizens and our children, but when it comes to spending on war or building more nuclear weapons, then magically we find trillions of dollars to operate and spend. We need to pay more attention, Mr. Speaker, to the choices we make each year on how much spending our Nation really requires for its national defense. I believe, at a minimum, Mr. Speaker, that Congress needs to debate and vote on whether to keep sending more and more of our military men and women to fight in endless wars. And I have to say, Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues, what the Rules Committee did last night by shutting out debate was shameful. 
MOTION TO ADJOURN Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to adjourn offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ). The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the noes appeared to have it.

PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2810, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ) has 25
1⁄2minutes remaining, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) has 20
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, now that the gentleman’s motion to adjourn has been defeated by a wide, bipartisan majority, the House can get back to work and do the people’s business. I want to go back over some statistics we talked about earlier. This rule makes in order for floor consideration 210 amendments which are on top of the 275 amendments that were offered in the Armed Services Committee. Now, let’s go back to the days when the NDAA was considered on this floor and this floor was under the majority’s control on the other side of the aisle. Let’s start with 2007. 135 amendments were offered; only 50 were made in order. In 2009, 129 amendments were offered; only 58 were made in order. In 2010, 129 were offered; only 69 were made in order. In 2011, 193 were offered; only 82 were made in order. And we are making in order in this rule, and yesterday’s rule, 210. This has been an open process by any measure. The gentleman also referred to the fact that there are other needs in America that are not being met because we are spending money on defending the United States of America. Let me go back and remind what I said earlier. Only 16.8 percent of next year’s Federal outlay will go to defending America if we adopt the National Defense Authorization Act as passed by the committee, less than 20 percent. That means almost 85 percent of Federal outlays are going to go to every other thing that we do in government. If there is a problem with something not being paid for, it is not because of the money we are spending on national defense. Then finally, the gentleman’s comments about the need for us to make sure that we are properly authorized as we engage in military activities abroad; I do agree with him. We have had some mission creep over the last several years. We have gone from Iraq and Afghanistan, under President Obama, to Syria, to Libya, to Yemen, and many of us on both sides of the aisles decried the fact that we did that. It is, indeed, our responsibility, not the President’s responsibility, to declare war, to authorize the use of military force. That is why this rule makes in order an amendment by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) that will set in place a process that will lead to the consideration on this floor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force. So I believe this rule does exactly what the people of America expect us to do, and that is to stay in this room, stay on this floor, and act on the National Defense Authorization Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my amendment to H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, to prohibit Federal funds from being used to implement the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty unless the Senate first ratifies the treaty. This language is identical to the version of my amendment that was enacted into law in last year’s NDAA and reflects the consistent will of the American people and the unified position of Congress in opposition to this misguided and dangerous treaty. The U.N. ATT is a deeply flawed agreement signed by the Obama administration in 2013. It would undermine our national sovereignty, harm our most vulnerable allies, and threaten the Second Amendment rights of every single American. Turning over our arms trade policy to the United Nations is just wrongheaded. The U.N. ATT would force the United States, the world’s most important defender of liberty and democracy, onto equal footing with the world’s worst dictatorships and terror sponsors. It would be readily politicized by bad actors around the world to try to stop America from providing arms to our friends and allies, including Israel, South Korea, and others. In short, just like gun control, it would stop the good from doing good without stopping the bad from doing bad. Congress has stood strong for the past 6 years on this issue. Together, we were successful at stopping the Obama administration from ever implementing this treaty or using hardworking American taxpayer dollars to promote it. Nevertheless, our work is not over. One of former President Obama’s parting shots as he left office was to submit the U.N. ATT to our colleagues in the Senate for ratification, even though he knew it was dead on arrival. Regardless of who is seated in the Oval Office, renewing this ban is important because no Presidency is permanent. A future administration may well try even harder to put this treaty into effect. Fortunately, in Donald Trump, we now have a President who believes in protecting our sovereignty in every possible way. America should never cede its sovereignty to the United Nations to determine its arms trade policies. Therefore, in addition to supporting this amendment, I strongly urge President Trump and Secretary Tillerson to take the final step and officially withdraw the United States from the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty once and for all. It is time to tear it up. I urge my colleagues to stand with me in support of the Second Amendment and our Nation’s sovereignty and vote in support of my amendment. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. When asked about this process that we are now dealing with this morning, with respect to the Hartzler amendment, Speaker RYAN said: ‘‘It’s a free process. It’s open process. She can bring an amendment to the floor if she wants to.’’ Really? This is an open process? She should be able to bring an amendment that we all think is discriminatory and, quite frankly, bigoted, to the floor; yet amendments that we have tried to bring to the floor that deal with the issue of war and whether or not we should be in these endless wars are denied. What kind of free process is that? Maybe it is a free process in Russia, but it is not a free process in the United States of America. This process is a sham. Fiftytwo percent of the amendments that were brought before the Rules Committee were rejected. You might want to defend that process, but I don’t. The gentleman says that mission creep has occurred, and that we have a responsibility here in this House. You are absolutely right we have a responsibility. When are we going to live up to it? And the Cole amendment, which I am happy to support, is a report. We have had reports up to here that have been brought before the NDAA process over the years. Enough. Time to do our job. This is why people are cynical about Washington when they hear this kind of doubletalk. Yeah, we get it. We are worried about mission creep. Congress ought to do its job. And so what are we going to do? Not do our job, but we will issue a report. Come on, enough. Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question, and I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative POCAN ’s Leveraging Effective Apprenticeships to Rebuild National Skills Act, H.R. 2933, which will promote effective apprenticeships that will give 
students and workers the skills they need to find wellpaying jobs. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous materials, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. JODYB. H ICEof Georgia). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, to discuss that proposal, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN ). Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a vital tool for ensuring workers are able to secure good paying, familysupporting jobs, and that is apprenticeships. I grew up in Kenosha, Wisconsin, a working class town with a very large skilled trade presence. I understand what good, middle class jobs look like, and the impact they can have on a community. A good middle class paycheck ensures people can afford a mortgage, have healthcare for their families, take a family vacation, and send their kids to college if they want to; and that is what we need right now are more higherpaying jobs. But not everyone goes to a traditional 4year college or university, nor does every job require this type of degree. That is why, for many, apprenticeships are the key to familysupporting wages. Apprenticeship programs have proven very effective at helping prepare workers for careers in highly skilled professions. This bill would increase the number of highly skilled workers in the United States and strengthen apprenticeship programs as an effective earnandlearn model for students, workers, and employers. b1330 It is a winwin for workers and businesses. The LEARNS Act supports closer connections between registered apprenticeship programs, employers, and others offering goodpaying jobs. But there is a problem. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to talk about their support of apprenticeships. I hear the Secretary of Labor talk about them. I even hear the President talk about them. But that is all it is: talk. As a new member of the Appropriations Committee, I was shocked to see that Republicans’ newly released LaborHHS funding proposal entirely eliminates Department of Labor apprenticeship grants. Again, that appropriations proposal cuts $95 million from apprenticeship funding, every singer dollar in the program. There is not a penny left to connect workers and businesses with apprenticeships. You can’t have it both ways. If you support apprenticeships and job training for workers, then you should support funding for job training and apprenticeship programs. It is pretty simple. If Republicans are serious about job creation, about training workers for a 21st century economy, and they actually want to do more than talk about jobs and apprenticeships, then we should move forward to defeat the previous question in order the bring forward the LEARNS Act. Walk the walk, Mr. Speaker. Talk is cheap. The American people deserve action. I urge all of my colleagues to defeat the previous question. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is right. Workforce training is very important, and that is why we passed on this floor a few weeks ago the reauthorization of the Perkins Act—not by a bipartisan majority, by a 100 percent vote. We have other bills that we are considering in the Education and the Workforce Committee that will deal with that because it is important that we build the workforce in America. But you don’t do that in the National Defense Authorization Act. That is what we are here today about. I am afraid my colleagues on the other side have forgotten what this bill is about. It is about making the people of America safe and secure. We will deal with those other issues, as important as they are, in other legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ). Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on an important piece of legislation, the National Defense Authorization Act. This funding is vital to our national security and the readiness of our military. As our Nation continues to face threats around the globe, our soldiers must have the necessary equipment to complete missions and return home safely. Just 2 weeks ago, 4,000 of our troops returned home from South Korea to loved ones at Fort Riley, Kansas. In a short number of weeks ahead of us this fall, the Dagger Brigade, also from Fort Riley, will travel to Europe for a 9month deployment. This legislation helps ensure readiness for brigade combat teams, such as the Dagger Brigade, and gives our troops a muchdeserved 2.4 percent military pay raise. It also allows for over 17,000 more soldiers, and allocates $2.3 billion over the administration’s request for maintenance and repair, which is so necessary. Mr. Speaker, I refuse to send our troops to a gunfight with knives. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation to give our men and women in uniform the tools and support they deserve. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying that I agree with the gentleman from Alabama. This bill is about our national security and about protecting our country, which makes it all the more puzzling that the Republicans think this is an appropriate place to be debating amendments on transgender issues. But anyway, they are in charge, so they can do whatever they want to do. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. THOMPSON ). Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I am glad to hear all these great amendments that have been made in order, and I was glad to hear my friend from Alabama reference the fact that this is a bill to make the people of America safe. I rise in opposition to this rule because there was one amendment that makes the people of America safe that was omitted from the list that was approved. It was a bipartisan amendment by myself, Mr. YOUNG from Alaska, and Mr. JONES from North Carolina that would declassify a 50yearold DOD project that sprayed biological and chemical weapons on our servicemembers and some civilians, and that amendment was not made in order. Convulsions, paralysis, respiratory failure, and death—those are just a few of the most severe side effects of sarin gas, a chemical weapon so deadly and debilitating that it was outlawed as a weapon of mass destruction. When Syria’s military used it, we retaliated. But in the 1960s and 1970s, the United States Department of Defense sprayed biological and chemical weapons like sarin, VX nerve gas, and e. coli on our own servicemembers. In the years since, many of those exposed have suffered debilitating health effects. For 40 years, the Department of Defense has not provided a comprehensive public accounting of these tests nor have they notified all the veterans and all the civilians who were potentially exposed. We can’t allow this information to continue to be released piecemeal. These veterans can’t wait any longer. Their health continues to decline, and some have already passed away. To sweep this under the rug is shameful. These veterans served honorably for the security of our Nation. These tests are an ugly part of our history. They put veterans’ lives at risk, and our veterans have every right to know what it was they were exposed to and how much they were exposed to. We need to think about their safety and their security. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MESSER ). Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership. Congress’ most important job is to provide for the national defense of this country. Yet, during the past 6 years, America’s military resources have been downsized and slashed. Today, Congress is taking corrective action to rebuild our military, support our troops, and provide for a strong national defense. This Defense Authorization Act fulfills our promise to prioritize America’s safety and protect our citizens from ongoing global threats, including radical Islamic terror. 
This bipartisan bill increases resources for every branch of the U.S. military and ensures that our troops receive the compensation they deserve, with the largest pay increase in 5 years. It also supports a robust missile defense program, and it strengthens America’s cyber warfare capabilities. Simply put, this bill makes America safer, and I urge your support. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. KHANNA ), and I also congratulate him on becoming a new dad. Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I thank his wife, Lisa McGovern, for being a great support to my wife. I rise today in opposition to this rule. It is not just because I am opposed to our policy of refueling planes into Yemen, refueling Saudiled planes. It is because of our view, a bipartisan view, of the place of Congress, Congress’ Article I of the Constitution. It is Congress’ responsibility and duty to have a public debate about our foreign policy, about who we ought to be arming, who we ought to be intervening in overseas. We are abdicating that responsibility. My amendments would have been very simple. They would have said that this body should debate whether we should be refueling Saudiled airplanes that are leading to civilian deaths in Yemen, that are causing civil war in Yemen, a Saudi coalition that is aligned with alQaida in Yemen, and al Qaida has hurt the United States. Why wouldn’t we debate this on the floor of the United States Congress? Why wouldn’t we have transparency and let the American public weigh in on whether this policy is making us more safe and is upholding human rights? It is with great disappointment that we are not having this debate in the United States Congress. I believe it is an abdication of our responsibility to the oath we take to uphold the Constitution. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s comments. I think that his issue comes within the broader question about the authorization of military force in various parts of the Middle East. I think he raises an important point. There is an amendment made in order under this rule that will put in place a process to get us to that debate. I appreciate what he just said. I hope that he will hold that idea, and when we have that debate on the floor, will bring it back so we can consider it among those other items we will consider at that time. I appreciate what he just said. This is not the place or the time to take that up. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to just take 1 minute to address something the gentleman from Alabama raised a while ago, and that is: Why would we be raising the issue of apprenticeships and workforce training as part of the Defense Authorization bill. There are a couple of reasons why. One is because we are routinely blocked from bringing any meaningful legislation to the floor, and we are routinely blocked from bringing amendments to the floor that I think can help with this issue. The gentleman mentioned the action we took in a bipartisan, unanimous way on the issue of Perkins loans and a few other programs. Those are important. But it is the beginning. We need to do much, much more in this country. We need to be able to prepare a workforce that can meet the needs of our manufacturers and be there for the jobs of tomorrow. That is why we brought this up. That is why we are bringing it up in this fashion. I would just go one step further to say, when we talk about national security, I think we ought to broaden that definition to include not just the number of bombs we have, but the quality of life that our people in this country enjoy: whether or not people have the security of a job, whether they can afford a college education for their kids, whether they can afford to buy a home, whether they can afford to put food on the table. We live in the richest country in the world, and there are 42 million Americans who are hungry, and yet we somehow can’t get the political will to address that problem or fix some of these challenges. We are going to take any opportunity we have to bring to the floor serious ideas that we think will benefit the American people, uplift the American people, and that is why I think that this bill that we are trying to bring up, H.R. 2933, authored by my colleague, Mr. POCAN , is appropriate. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I really believe very strongly we need to do more in workforce training in America. I am a former chancellor of postsecondary education, former chair of workforce development for the State of Alabama. It is something that is very near and dear to me. I know that we are working very hard on these issues and have already produced this one bill, the Perkins bill that we passed in the absolutely 100 percent vote here on the floor. There will be more coming. But the National Defense Authorization Act authorizes what our military does and doesn’t do and how it does it around the globe. This is a separate, different vehicle designed to provide for the defense of the American people. I appreciate the gentleman’s comments. We need to take those comments up at another time as we take into consideration other bills that work on our workforce development. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, there is a theme that is developing on the Republican side. We can always take it up at another time, at another time in the future. We can do the NDAA bill and this. That is the whole point of defeating the previous question. You can still debate the National Defense Authorization Act, and you can bring up this other thing that we think is of great value to workers in this country. It doesn’t have to be one or the other. It is that same thinking when it comes to war. As I began this debate talking about the war in Afghanistan and the fact that it is the longest war in American history, we don’t even talk about it here. We don’t even debate it here. We ought to respect the men and women who we put in harm’s way enough to make it a priority in this Chamber, and we don’t even talk about it. We can’t even bring amendments to the floor to deliberate on that. What we are told is: Well, we will vote on a study, another study. After 16 years? That is the best we can do? Or we are told that it falls under the jurisdiction of another committee. Well, my friends on the Republican side are in charge. I am sorry to say that, but you are. b1345 And I don’t know what is standing in your way from asking the committees of jurisdiction or multiple committees to come together and to actually present to this Chamber an AUMF for these wars. There is nothing, other than the fact that you want to avoid an uncomfortable vote for your Members. Well, that is just too bad. War is a big deal. It ought to be a big deal, and we ought to treat it more seriously than we are. And I will repeat what I said at the beginning of this debate: What the Rules Committee did last night was shameful; blocking germane amendments, blocking serious amendments, to address an issue that, quite frankly, we should have been talking about a long time ago. Again, I regret that this is the rule that my Republican friends have come up with. They can say they are proud of it. Quite frankly, I am ashamed of it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I remind all of us that the war in Afghanistan was authorized by an AUMF that was passed by Congress in 2001. So while we can have a debate about the other conflicts in other places, that conflict is, indeed, authorized, and has been authorized from the very beginning. So I would take exception to the gentleman’s comments with regard to Afghanistan. There are provisions in the underlying bill that this rule makes in order and in those provisions that do things to help with that war effort, help the men and women over there fighting that war effort for us. 
JULY10, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE MCGOVERN : As orga nizations representing Americans across the political spectrum, we are writing to voice our strong opposition to attempts by Members of Congress to increase the Pentagon’s fiscal year 2018 budget above both the budget caps set by the Budget Control Act and the President’s budget request. The Pentagon is currently funded at a higher level than at almost any time since World War II, and the budget problems it faces should be solved by better fiscal management, not by adding more money to an already bloated and wasteful department. The challenges facing our military are partially the result of years of failing to make the necessary, tough choices our nation’s security requires. Rather than prioritizing basic needs of the warfighter, lawmakers have pursued huge, expensive weapons systems that fail to meet technical specifications and may never be ready for combat. Waste and unnecessary overhead abound, with a Defense Business Board study showing that the Department of Defense could save up to $125 billion over five years just by eliminating excess bureaucracy and inefficiencies. Claims of a socalled ‘‘readiness crisis’’ are exaggerated. As former DoD Comptroller Robert Hale said in February, these claims are just the services ‘‘putting their worst foot forward’’ in the hopes of securing funding increases. General David Petraeus has also said that this idea of a readiness crisis is a myth. By opposing important costsaving measures like base realignment and closure which could save several billion dollars a year just by closing excess infrastructure, Congress is demonstrating that it is not prioritizing fiscal responsibility or making the choices that will actually keep us safe. Moreover, the Pentagon cannot be sure what it is spending as it is the only federal agency that has never passed an audit. Budgets necessitate tradeoffs. Pentagon spending increases shortchange other important priorities, from domestic needs including education, health and nutrition and affordable housing, to paying down the national debt. Further increasing the Pentagon’s budget by tens of billions of dollars without a clear strategy will do little to solve national security challenges. Rather, it will simply guarantee further wasteful spending at the Pentagon. We hope that you will oppose any attempts to increase the Pentagon’s budget for fiscal year 2018. Sincerely, American Friends Service Committee; Center for International Policy; Coalition on Human Needs; Council for a Livable World; Freedom Works; Friends Committee on National Legislation; Iraq Veterans Against the War.

Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the RECORD a letter to all Representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union in opposition to the Hartzler amendment, which it deems as discriminatory and unconstitutional. 
AMERICAN CIVILLIBERTIES UNION, Washington, DC, July 13, 2017. Vote NO on Hartzler Amendment No. 315 to the NDAA—Discriminatory and Unconstitutional. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is strongly opposed to Hartzler Amendment No. 315 to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (NDAA), H.R. 2810. This amendment would bar transgender members of the Armed Forces and military families from receiving appropriate and medically necessary health care. This is a discriminatory, unconstitutional attack on transgender service members and their families, plain and simple. It should be overwhelmingly rejected by members of the House of Representatives. Barring access to appropriate and medically necessary health care, including transitionrelated care, for transgender service members and their families is not only discriminatory, but runs counter to scientific evidence and contemporary medical standards of care. It also puts the health of certain service members at needless risk and undermines the ability of military medical professionals to provide necessary care for their patients. There is a clear and overwhelming consensus among the leading medical organizations—including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Psychological Association—that transitionrelated care is safe, effective, nonexperimental, and medically necessary. If a military doctor determines that transitionrelated care (e.g. hormone therapy) is medically necessary for a transgender service member, then that treatment should be provided just as it would be for any other medical condition for any other service member. Members of the House of Representatives should overwhelmingly reject this discriminatory attempt to deny necessary health care to certain service members and their families. All of the members of our Armed Forces willingly put their lives on the line in defense of our nation. The least that Congress can do is ensure that the health care needs of our service members and their families are being met. Accordingly, the ACLU is strongly opposed to Hartzler Amendment No. 315 to the NDAA and urges all members to vote NO on it. Please contact Ian Thompson, legislative representative. Sincerely, FAIZSHAKIR , National Political Director. IANTHOMPSON , Legislative Representative. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, it is ironic to me that we have time to debate a bill that discriminates against transgender members of the Armed Forces and military families, but we can’t find the time to debate war. It really is sad. It is a sad commentary on the way the Rules Committee conducted itself last night. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman believes that what we are doing in Afghanistan is consistent with what was envisioned 16 years ago, he can go on thinking that, but it isn’t. And if he thinks it is okay that that authorization is used to justify every military involvement we have all around the world, he can go ahead and think that way. I think he is very much mistaken. Mr. Speaker, Congress has to stop kicking the can down the road. It is unconscionable that the Republican leadership continues to prevent meaningful debate on these wars. But let me say one thing about why our House colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, keep bringing these issues up, despite the opposition from the Republican leadership. And that is because it is our job. The American people sent us to Washington to debate the uncomfortable issues and to take difficult votes. Now, there were some in Congress— maybe my friend is included in that— who think that it is acceptable to give this administration a blank check to continue these endless wars. Why anybody—no matter who is President, but especially with this President—would feel comfortable giving him a blank check is beyond my comprehension. There are others who would like to end them and bring our servicemen and women home. And then there are others who look for a different policy somewhere between these two positions. This is why we need to debate these wars. This is why we need to bring updated AUMFs to the floor for a vote. If that is a debate that you would rather not have, if that is a vote that you would rather not take, then Mr. Speaker, let me suggest that you should look for a new job. You should go into a different vocation. I am sure that I speak for all of my colleagues when I say that protecting the lives and wellbeing of our uniform men and women is one of the highest priorities, if not the highest priorities, of this Congress. But they deserve more than a ‘‘thank you’’ on Veterans Day. We do not respect their service and sacrifice and that of their families when we refuse to debate and take any responsibility for sending them year after year into war. They deserve a thoughtful, reasoned, and engaged debate. They deserve a debate. They deserve a little attention in this Chamber, not excuses and not more reports and not more, ‘‘We will get to it in the future.’’ And that is why, along with many of my Republican and Democratic colleagues, we will continue to demand that the Republican leadership of this House allow a debate and a vote on the future of these wars. I just want to say, finally, Mr. Speaker, I have been raising this issue not just when Republicans have been President, but when Democrats have been President. I really believe that Congress has forfeited its constitutional responsibilities. We have abrogated our constitutional responsibilities. We have acquiesced time and time again to Democratic and Republican administrations when it comes to war. We can’t allow that to happen. That is not responsible governing. We have an obligation to make sure that whatever we are doing with regard to our military, that it is the right thing to do. The idea that we once again come to the floor with the National Defense Authorization bill and we are told we cannot debate any of these things, we can’t vote on any of these things, I mean, give me a break. What are you thinking? Why is this such a big, difficult thing to overcome with the leadership? Again, if my friends don’t want to take uncomfortable votes, then do something else. Don’t vote. But it is not the right thing to do. We should be ashamed of this process. There is no justifying shutting out debate on war. Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and vote ‘‘no’’ on the underlying bill, and vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule, too. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The gentleman said we can’t debate anything. The rule we passed yesterday makes in order 210 different amendments to be debated on top of the general debate of the bill itself. And that is on top of 275 amendments in the committee of jurisdiction, the Armed Services Committee. This is the most debated piece of legislation we have every year, and it should be for the very reasons the gentleman from Massachusetts itemized, because what we are doing here is of profound importance. Now, I know that there are other issues that people try to stick into this bill every year that, frankly, distract us from the underlying importance of the bill; and that is, we are trying to do everything we possibly can to protect the American people. The threats the American people face today are more diverse, more profound than we have seen since the end of World War II. So, yes, this bill authorizes a lot of very important and expensive things. I acknowledge they are expensive. But it is even more expensive if we don’t do them, or don’t do them right, and we leave the American people exposed. Just take into account one of our threats, Kim Jongun in North Korea. That missile test he did recently was an ICBM, an intercontinental ballistic missile. He does not need such a missile to hit South Korea or Japan. He needs that missile to hit us, to hit Alaska, to hit the West Coast of the United States, and ultimately to hit the entirety of the United States. 
It is a direct threat to the safety of the people of the United States. This bill authorizes an increase in missile defense, just one of the things that it does. So I hope that all of us will take the many things that we are going to debate here over the next several days very seriously and that we will come to the bipartisan conclusion, as we did in the committee, that when you take the totality of this bill together after you have gone through all of these amendments, it does the most important thing we are here to do, which is to defend the American people. b1400 Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 440 and the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
THEVOTEONTHEPREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of adoption of the resolution.

b1522 So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. KATKO ). There being no further amendments, pursuant to House Resolution 431, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania) having assumed the chair, Mr. KATKO , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2810) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 The SPEAKER pro tempore.

AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . GARAMENDI  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 115–217. Mr. GARAMENDI. I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, this amendment facilitates the construction of badly needed icebreakers. The United States does not have any heavy icebreakers that are available all year round. We only have one, and that is used in the Antarctic and, therefore, unavailable in the summer in the north. Joining me on this amendment is the ranking member and others from the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. We need icebreakers; in fact, we need six icebreakers. We need to build the first one immediately and get it underway. Language in the underlying bill provides a mechanism for us to fund that icebreaker using the authorities of the Department of the Navy, specifically, one of their sections. This amendment clarifies the language and makes it clear that the Navy can act as the fiscal agent to carry out the icebreaker task. It does not require in any way that the Navy shipbuilding account be used in any way to pay for the icebreaker. The money for the icebreaker will have to come from other sources. But it makes it clear that the Navy can expend money as a fiscal agent using the special account that was designated, that has been in existence for some time. I can go into great length about why we need icebreakers, but the very short story is that Russia has over 40 icebreakers, probably closer to 50, many of them heavy icebreakers capable of operating in very thick ice in the Arctic. The United States really has none. We have some light icebreakers, but they will not suffice during the Arctic spring and winter. Therefore, we have to get with it. We do know that in the future—well, today and this year, this summer—the Northwest Passage will be open for shipping, and the East Passage, which is along the Russian coast, is also open. So the Arctic is a navigable ocean. The U.S. Navy cannot operate there without an icebreaker. We cannot conduct civil and maritime as well as military exercises without a heavy icebreaker. This allows us to do that. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment to strike a critical provision of this year’s NDAA. I do share my colleague’s concern for the current state of our U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker fleet. I do believe there are ways that we can address that issue, but I disagree with his proposed solution. To be clear, the National Defense Authorization Act authorizes funds for the Department of Defense. The U.S. Coast Guard falls under the Department of Homeland Security. This amendment seeks to take millions of dollars away from the Navy in the long term and shift it to the Coast Guard for their expenditures. Make no mistake about it: if this amendment passes, there is no stopping the Department of Homeland Security or any other agency from poaching enormous sums of our Defense Department budget in the future. Today it is Coast Guard icebreakers, and next year it may be the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research and survey vessels. The possibilities are endless; unfortunately, the funds are not. Mr. Chair, I would urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment to ensure that our Navy and Department of Defense funds are used only by the Navy and the Department of Defense. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. LARSEN ). Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the GaramendiHunter amendment because I know how important a strong icebreaker fleet is to national security. The committee recognizes this reality, as elsewhere in the bill we give the DOD some important authorities to support icebreaker procurement. However, this section 123 prohibits DOD funding for icebreaker procurement. This amendment strikes this provision because flexibility will be essential to funding new icebreakers. Coast Guard shipbuilding budgets are insufficient for icebreaker procurement absent radical cuts elsewhere. As co chair of the Arctic Working Group, I know that the United States needs icebreakers. These ships protect economic interests in the region, and they defend our sovereignty. As the Arctic becomes increasingly navigable, the importance of icebreakers will only grow, and I urge my colleagues to support the Garamendi Hunter amendment. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ), my friend and colleague. Mr. BACON. Mr. Chair, I rise today in respectful opposition to this amendment. No one can dispute America’s need for icebreakers. These capital ships are indispensable tools to ensure the safe and rapid movement of commerce in Arctic waters. I commend my colleagues for their strong advocacy for these ships and share their belief that we need them. However, the responsibility and accountability for constructing and operating America’s icebreakers must rest solely where the Congress has assigned it: the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard. The question we are debating today is not whether we need icebreakers, but how to appropriate the funds and who should build them. As important as icebreakers are, they are not warships, and we must not allow funding legitimately appropriated for our combat 
fleet to be diverted for nondefense needs. While I acknowledge the temptation to raid defense accounts for a worthy cause, we must be mindful of how deep in the hole we are with our air, land, sea, space, and cyber forces. We need to keep our eye on the ball in rebuilding our military’s readiness and our modernization. Mr. Chair, I urge a vote ‘‘no’’ against this amendment. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, may I ask how much time I have remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, just a couple of things. First of all, there is a thing called the National Sealift Fund, which has been in existence for a long time, and it has been used to build nonNavy ships. That is exactly what we intend to do here is to use the National Sealift Fund, not the Navy shipbuilding fund. Secondly, you may notice or you may want to know that the U.S. Coast Guard is, in fact, a defense as well as a civilian vessel; it has both obligations. We also need to understand that we are not stealing money from the Navy. This is simply a mechanism in which the Navy acts as a fiscal agent to carry out the task. The Coast Guard is not well suited to build ships of this type. We are looking for the most efficient and effective way to carry out the task, and the use of the National Sealift Fund, together with the U.S. Navy as the fiscal agent, is the best way to accomplish that. I would end by simply saying the U.S. Navy is toothless, useless in the Arctic unless it has an icebreaker. So if you care about the Arctic Ocean and the role of the U.S. Navy in carrying out our national defense functions in the Arctic, then you must help us find a way to build the icebreakers. We will do so without, in any way, taking funds away from the U.S. Navy shipbuilding. Indeed, it would be up to the appropriators to appropriate money quite hopefully from the Department of Homeland Security for this purpose, putting the money into this National Sealift Fund so that it can then be used to build the icebreaker, with the Navy acting as the fiscal agent. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER ), my friend and colleague. Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I join with Chairman WITTMAN in expressing opposition to this amendment. As he has indicated, the Navy has no indication that they have a military requirement for icebreakers. Right now we are trying to reverse the effects of sequestration. We are fighting against budget cuts. When you use money for something other than what it was intended for, it is a budget cut, and that is what this would be. No one is talking about raising the top line of the overall defense budget, but they are talking about using the funds otherwise for something that is not defense. I want to join with everyone who is speaking on this issue of the importance of the Coast Guard and certainly its impact and certainly the issues of icebreaking, but shipbuilding for the Navy and for our military should be concentrated on our military. Certainly the funds that we are appropriating to the Department of Defense should remain in the Department of Defense, and, therefore, I rise with Chairman WITTMAN in support of the opposition. b1545 Mr. Chair, in closing, I want to say that—going to Admiral Richardson’s words—Admiral Richardson clearly states that the mission of icebreaking is a Coast Guard mission. There is not a disagreement there, but the disagreement is using resources that are within the Defense budget in order to do that. If you are going to put the responsibility for building icebreakers and maintaining and operating them with the Coast Guard, yet you are going to put the money in the Department of Defense budget where there is no control, there is no oversight, that is a catastrophe waiting to happen. If this is going to happen, it should happen within the Department of Homeland Security’s budget or there needs to be a debate about where, ultimately, the Coast Guard needs to be located. But to put money in one area of the budget and expect that it is going to be managed properly and applied properly with someplace where there is not even jurisdiction, I think is problematic. Again, it is clear where the missions are. It is clear where the responsibility lies between the Homeland Security Department, the Coast Guard, the Navy, and the Department of Defense. I want to make sure we are building more cutters and icebreakers, and if we are going to do that, let’s make sure we do it in the proper way. I think there are ways to construct language to make that happen, but this is not the way to do it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . BUCK  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 115–217. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 85, after line 24, insert the following: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. BUCK. I thank Chairman THORN BERRY for the opportunity to speak about my amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. Our military is the greatest fighting force in the world. I applaud the Department of Defense’s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. However, with our limited resources, we must ensure that these resources are being put to use in the best possible way. Every penny spent by the Department of Defense must be used to advance our military’s mission and support our troops. Incorporating higher cost fuel sources into the Department’s energy acquisition process is money lost to repair planes, buy ammunition, and defeat the enemy. Moreover, Congress must ensure that we are being good stewards of the American people’s money. With our debt soaring towards $20 trillion, it is irresponsible to ask American families to subsidize with their tax dollars fuel sources that have not yet been proven costeffective. Of course, the Department of Defense would still be allowed to research alternative sources of energy. My amendment ensures that the Department of 
Defense can conduct research on alternative fuels to ensure these energy sources can be costcompetitive in the future. My commonsense amendment is simple. It provides a framework for ensuring the Department of Defense is engaging in responsible energy acquisition practices. It prohibits renewable energy mandates placed on the Department of Defense and ensures that every unit of energy our military purchases is the most costeffective option available while still maintaining the ability to research new sources of energy. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a blatant attack on the use of alternative energy by the Department of Defense. So we have existing contracts right now for renewable energy, both liquid fuels and electricity, at the Department of Defense, and this amendment seeks to really pump the brakes on those policies and bury them in a web of unnecessary requirements. So requiring procurement managers to track all Federal subsidies and tax credits would be a burden to the government, and requiring suppliers to provide such information would be onerous, expensive, and may, in fact, actually drive them away. Also, this will result in less competition for contracts, and higher costs for the Department of Defense. Ultimately, it is going to result in higher costs to the taxpayer. So most alarmingly, this amendment does not include any waivers for times of emergency when a retail, timesensitive purchase of readily available alternative fuels might be imperative to completing the mission, even if it is at a price point higher than the usual market cost. Mr. Chairman, it also does not provide consideration for renewable energy projects for military installations that, although they might not reduce costs, do have other quantifiable benefits that increase combat effectiveness or enhance mission resiliency. This amendment is also redundant. For bulk purchases, of which the DOD has many, current law already prohibits the Department from an alternative fuel purchase unless fully burdened cost is costcompetitive with traditional fuels. Burying suppliers in these requirements is an unnecessary compliance burden and could disincentivize some suppliers from doing business with the DOD. Finally, this amendment is opposed by the Department of Defense. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. PETERS ). Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I am opposed to this amendment, which would unnecessarily tie the hands of our military as it seeks to diversify its energy supply. The Pentagon is pursuing alternative energy not because they are some kind of tree hugger, but because the diversity of energy options improves mission capabilities and saves lives. Just because the price of oil is low today doesn’t mean it won’t spike tomorrow and force military leaders to divert resources away from mission priorities. In some cases, this has meant turning ships around and cutting their voyages short because of budgeting issues around fuel. This is of particular concern as we continue the fight against ISIS while pivoting towards the Pacific. The Pacific Ocean has an area of 64 million miles. It includes hotspots like the South China Sea and North Korea, whose recent aggression threatens the region and our security. As we ask our military leaders to respond to threats at a moment’s notice, they need the flexibility that comes with alternative energy sources. But you don’t need to just hear that from me. That is the position of General Mattis at the Department of Defense, who opposes this amendment. My colleagues on the other side are going to say that this is merely about choosing the most costeffective option, but this amendment would place an undue burden on DOD procurement managers to track all subsidies and credits for fuel. It doesn’t include a waiver for national security considerations or increasing combat effectiveness, and it would inhibit innovations that increase readiness and save lives. A 21st century military with the capability to counter new and dynamic threats cannot be powered solely by the energy sources of yesterday. I encourage my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I don’t believe that asking the Department of Defense to make a costeffective decision in any purchase is an unnecessary burden. Mr. Chair, I disagree with my colleagues, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, as I said, I believe this amendment would significantly hinder the Department of Defense’s ability to procure energy, and I urge its defeat. As I stated previously, this amendment is opposed by the Department of Defense. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, the United States military is the greatest fighting force in the world. Our troops need to be focused on the mission at hand and have every tool at their disposal to complete that mission. My amendment ensures that we practice fiscal discipline in the Department of Defense’s energy acquisition process by ensuring that we are buying the most costeffective source of energy. I thank the chairman. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado will be postponed.

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 115–217. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the committee for his hard work and his defense of those who wear the uniform and take on that tough task. In these tough and troubling times, especially in financial austerity, he stood up and let everybody know how the military, in actual dollars over the last 8 years, has been cut significantly, and the impact on our national security. In that vein, my goal with this amendment is to prioritize those limited defense resources on efforts that pose an immediate and direct threat to our national security. This amendment would strike section 336 of the NDAA, which strikes the requirement for the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the vulnerability to military installations and combatant commander requirements resulting from climate change over the next 20 years. I am not here to debate climate change, whether it is real or it is not, how it is created, how we fix it, and all that stuff. That is for another day. My point is that this shouldn’t be the priority of combatant commanders in our military. The United States military is currently operating in a very complex threat environment in which our country must be ready to face our adversaries. Our country is facing direct threats from a myriad of sources, including Islamic extremists: ISIS, alQaida, the 
Taliban, Abu Sayyaf. The alphabet soup of names in that regard is continuous and unrelenting: North Korea, China, Iran, Russia, even in space. Over the past 8 years, our military strength and readiness has suffered as a result of the underfunding and neglect from the previous administration that are in support of sequestration. Through the NDAA, we simply must prioritize, decide what is most important and be for that, and let our warfighters know where we stand. These things must strengthen the rebuilding of our Armed Forces and resolve their focus on what they need to pay attention to. Literally litanies of other Federal agencies deal with environmental issues, including climate change. This Federal mandate detracts from the essential mission of the Department of Defense, which is to secure our Nation from enemies, and is best left to the agencies that are better suited to deal with these issues. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 1
1⁄2minutes. Mr. Chair, this amendment would strike a provision that we have already thoroughly debated and approved in a bipartisan fashion within the Armed Services Committee. Section 336 acknowledges what Secretary Mattis has already said and what we already know: that a changing climate will affect our military’s readiness and alter the threat landscape for years to come, and that we must study these impacts to prepare for them. I cannot see the harm in gathering information and doing an assessment. We already see the strategic implications of new sea lanes being cut in the melting Arctic, where countries are seeking an economic advantage. As we speak, along our coasts, rising seas are affecting our naval installations, including at Naval Station Norfolk, the home of the Atlantic Fleet. The report required in section 336 is not about causes of climate change, nor do we discuss specific emissions, targets, or green energy goals. Instead, my section of the Armed Service Committee is very factual. We focus squarely on the readiness of our Armed Forces to combat the coming and existing climate threat, starting with a study of the 10 most vulnerable bases in each service, and a report on how a changing climate will affect combatant commanders’ strategic battle plans. b1600 As Secretary Mattis has said, ‘‘the effects of a changing climate—such as increased maritime access to the Arctic, rising sea levels, desertification, among others—impact our security situation.’’ Mr. Chairman, we need to support our leaders in the military and intelligence communities in addressing these concerns, so I urge defeat of this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 21⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Rhode Island has 3
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK ), who is my good friend and the chair of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the House Armed Services Committee. Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in opposition to Mr. PERRY ’s amendment which would strike language that requires the Department of Defense to compile a report on the vulnerabilities of military installations and combatant commander requirements resulting from climate change. As we heard earlier today, this language passed by voice vote on a bipartisan basis during our markup in committee. Increased maritime access to the Arctic, rising sea levels, desertification, increases in natural disasters, damage to existing infrastructure, and other effects of climate change are drivers of geopolitical instability and degrade the security of the United States. We would be remiss in our efforts to protect our national security if we do not fully account for the risk climate change poses to our bases, our readiness, and to the fulfillment of our Armed Forces mission. This is about a report. Let’s get the information. This is why I believe we have bipartisan support within the committee. We must incorporate environmental factors in our threat assessments and contingency planning to ensure the longterm operational viability of our missions and the safety of our men and women in uniform. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ). Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this Perry amendment which will strip vital language regarding the impact of Department of Defense activities associated with climate change. The Defense Department does so many vital things for the safety and security of the United States and the American people. We all owe the brave men and women who wear the Nation’s uniform a debt of gratitude that we can never truly repay. However, we must be cognizant of all the impacts that DOD activities have across the globe. The Defense Department has such a large footprint, and the amount of military construction and other activity that it undertakes year round impacts our environment. How could it not? We are talking about possible implications such as contributions to sea level rise—which is particularly important to my constituents in south Florida—that it would be irresponsible for us to ignore. I have a Coast Guard base in my district, Coast Guard Miami Beach, located right there on the water in Miami Beach, and we know the impact of sea level rise in that area. So as a member of the Climate Solutions Caucus, I urge my colleagues to oppose this Perry amendment. We have got to be cleareyed, Mr. Chairman, about every possible impact of our military activities, and that includes the impact that we place on our environment. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. PETERS ). Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, last year the Pentagon released a directive stating that the Department of Defense must be able to adapt to climate change in order to maintain an effective and efficient U.S. military. General Mattis—now Secretary Mattis—during his Senate confirmation said: ‘‘Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today.’’ Bases in the region I represent in San Diego—which is home to the largest concentration of military forces in the world—are already facing challenges from sea level rise, drought, and reliable energy sources. For years, the most decorated military leaders in our country have been telling us that climate change is a national security threat. Congress cannot afford to make this debate about politics or ideology. We don’t have to agree on what causes climate change. We only have to agree with our military leaders that the effects of climate change are altering the security environment and the threats we face. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this reckless amendment and ask my colleagues to do the same. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, how much time remains? The Acting CHAIR (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia). The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Rhode Island has 30 seconds remaining. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, as we noted in our committee markup, there would be nothing controversial about studying this threat and being prepared to mitigate the risks. In fact, that is our responsibility. The support for this climate resiliency language was truly bipartisan in 
committee, and I hope we will send a strong message of support to the servicemen and women who will have to lead with the effects of climate change by opposing this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me the Secretary of Defense doesn’t need Congress to tell him what the threats are. He knows what the threats are. I can tell you as a person who has been privileged for over 30 years to wear the Nation’s uniform—the Army, the military’s uniform—and as a person who was privileged to lead troops in combat in the Middle East, I didn’t need Congress to tell me who the enemy is or was. We know that. We also don’t need Congress to tell us to report the issues that we might have in defending the Nation to the Congress or to the Commander. We know our duty, and we will do our duty. If we have issues that need to be reported—whether it is sea level rise or the enemy has a new weapon or we can’t feed our troops or what have you—we will report it, and we will resolve it. We don’t need people in Washington, D.C., telling us how to run the war. That is our job. That is the military’s job. This amendment simply says that we ought to prioritize that. We ought to let them prioritize that. We ought to let combatant commanders—we ought to let the men and women who wear the uniform and defend our country focus on the enemy. If the enemy, indeed, is climate change, then they will focus on that as well, and they will submit information so that we can make decisions. The point is, should somebody— should all of us in this uniform in Washington, D.C.—be telling the fine men and women in uniform across the globe defending our country that we know better? That is exactly what I am trying to avoid here. Little by little, drip by drip, we have watched our Nation’s and military’s focus eroded—this and that. Believe me. I have filled out the reports. As an officer, I have filled out a whole bunch of reports on a regular basis that have nothing to do with completing the mission of securing our Nation and defeating the enemy—nothing to do with it. This is just one in the long line of them. My only goal is to send this to where it needs to be—the agencies best adapted to deal with it and take it out of the agencies that shouldn’t be dealing with it and should be dealing with securing our Nation and fighting the enemy. Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Chair, Naval Air Station Key West provides key training and support for the nation’s military operations and readiness. The base trains fighter pilots from all branches and is home to the Joint Interagency Task Force South, which combats illicit narcotics. However, most of the land in the Florida Keys lies at elevations 3 feet or less above sea level, making the Naval station extremely vulnerable to sealevel rise. But this threat is not unique to that station; many of our bases across the, country and around the globe are susceptible to the effects of climate change. Recognition of this threat, and prudent planning for these contingencies, are vital to our military bases and maintaining the national security interests of the United States abroad. I congratulate the gentleman from Rhode Island, and the Committee, for recognizing this and including language in the underlying bill asking the Pentagon to report on the vulnerabilities posed by climate change so we can responsibly identify and implement adaptive measures. This includes an honest discussion of the realities of our changing environment. As cochair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, I urge all my colleagues to reject the Perry Amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . GOSAR  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in House Report 115–217. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment with the intent of accurately and transparently determining the prevailing wage for Department of Defense contracts. My amendment would require the calculation of wages for contractors and all defense projects to be based on actual statistics calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, as opposed to the current process which determines these rates based on fundamentally flawed surveys within the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor, or the DOL. This amendment is needed. A 2008 Department of Labor Inspector General report found that ‘‘one or more errors existed in 100 percent of the wage reports.’’ The Congressional Budget Office estimates that upwards of $13 billion could be wasted over 10 years if DavisBacon is left unreformed. As stewards of the public treasury, we have an obligation to spend taxpayer money wisely. This amendment addresses that very need. Additionally, this amendment doesn’t remove funds from the Defense budget. The money this amendment saves—potentially in the billions of dollars—will be kept within the Department of Defense budget to be used for other important defense priorities. In a fiscal environment where every dollar counts, this amendment presents a welcome opportunity to make our defense dollars go further. This amendment isn’t an attempt to repeal DavisBacon. It is about competition, equality, accuracy, and transparency for everyone. It simply asks that wage determinations for Department of Defense contracts be made with statistically sampled information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics so that we are able to spend Federal dollars in a more efficient manner and support more jobs. The BLS has proven time and time again that they are the only agency capable of accurately determining these wages. A fair wage for a fair job is fair to the American taxpayer. Again, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their continued work on the committee. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I come here today to speak in opposition to the amendment, one that would hurt the local economy, devalue workers’ pay, and take a very important tool out of the toolbox for both Republicans, Democrats, and Americans. Almost 100 years ago, two Republican Congressmen, James Davis and Robert Bacon, realized there was a problem with Federal contracts. Those contracts were unfair to the local economies. So in 1931, Congress unanimously approved DavisBacon prevailing wage. It ensures that construction workers are paid the same as construction workers in that local community. The prevailing wage is based on surveys of local wages and benefits, not whether there is a union or not. It keeps the community vibrant, and it takes into account those things that happened in that local community. So when you hear the term ‘‘if it ain’t 
broke don’t fix it,’’ this is a classic example. They are trying to talk about surveys and methodologies. Quite frankly, this system has worked for over 80 years. They are talking about technicalities, but the fact of the matter is this is about cutting wages in your local community. Why would you ever want to go back and say, I want to hurt the people I represent? But apparently that seems to be what we are doing. So we want to make sure that local workers are paid a fair wage. The system has worked fine for so many years and makes sure that those men and women who work hard each and every day are properly compensated. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ). Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. NORCROSS , my cochairman of the Congressional Building Trades Caucus, to be able to discuss this. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to this amendment offered by my friend from Arizona. His amendment would change dramatically the methodology used to determine wage rates paid to construction workers across America. While this proposal may appear to be reasonable at first blush, it would dramatically depart from the current practice and would result in massive pay cuts for working families. Unlike the current system, the methodology would not take into consideration the total value of all wages and benefits into account. It excludes the cost of pensions, healthcare, and, vitally, training that we need to have. So what we are trying to say, Mr. Chairman, is the full benefit must be considered, and it is not in this amendment. Mr. Chairman, as someone who began in the construction industry in 1965, 52 years—after 52 years in this business, I understand how the DavisBacon Act works and how it works across the country. So let’s not forget, these wage protections are not just for union workers but for all construction workers. It ensures that the local workers can make a fair living on projects in their community. This amendment, unfortunately—as well intended as it might be—would undermine that. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not antiDavisBacon. Let me give you some fun facts. In some cities, the Wage and Hour Division’s calculated wages are 75 percent higher than the actual prevailing wage. In other areas throughout the country, they are below minimum wage and only 33 percent of the actual prevailing wage. What is fair is fair. When you start looking at the figures that are used for calculation, they haven’t been updated in many cases since 1970. Give me a break. This isn’t about DavisBacon, this is about crony capitalism. This is about a vestige of the Jim Crow era. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. b1615 Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ). Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I align myself with the remarks of my friend, Mr. NORCROSS , and that of my friend, Mr. MCKINLEY . There is bipartisan opposition to this amendment because we know what it would do. You can talk about it any way you want to talk about it, but the net effect is reduced wages for workers in the communities we represent. I come from Flint, Michigan. I represent folks who play by the rules and have the right, after working in a trade, to get compensation that is equal to the quality of the work that they deliver. If we don’t support that, all we are going to do is continue this race to the bottom. We all talk about the fact that wages have not kept up. Here is yet another effort that will undermine the ability of American workers who work hard every single day to be able to have a decent wage, take care of their families, put their kids through school, and set something aside for retirement. This is the American Dream. Back in the 1930s, this is why this legislation was first put in place. This amendment would undermine that promise. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, may I ask how much time I have remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 1 minute remaining. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I want to just bring this back home. Why in the world would you ever want to cut the wages of the men and women you represent? This is about fairness, leveling the playing field. It works, and we want to continue it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, once again, this is not antiDavisBacon. We want to make it an issue like that, but the statistics speak for themselves. The Federal Government is willing to pay the wages for our hardworking contractors on what they deserve, but as stewards of the taxpayer dollar, we must insist that these wages are accurate, fair, and transparent. The inspector general has stated there are fundamental problems with the current methodology. We owe it to the American taxpayer and the contractors themselves to make sure funds are based upon accuracy and wages are being paid fairly. The opposition claims to be fighting in favor of DavisBacon, but if they really cared about its longevity and effectiveness, they would support this amendment and improve and strengthen it. The opposition also believes this amendment is an attack on the American worker. Tell that to my contractors who have been put out of business with the military in south Arizona. Please tell them that when they couldn’t calculate the DavisBacon application and were put out of business by the Department of Labor. That couldn’t be further from the truth. This provides certainty and clarity to the wages of hardworking tradesmen and women across the country who perform services for the government. We as a body should be for fiscal responsibility and for proper worker compensation. This amendment is an opportunity to act exactly on this. I urge my colleagues to support this goodgovernance and commonsense approach. I ask my colleagues: Do you support transparency and accuracy? Support my amendment. Do you support the responsible use of taxpayer dollars? Support my amendment. Do you support workers and fair compensation? Then support my amendment. Do you support a fair wage for the hardworking contractors of the DOD? Support my amendment. Anything stays safe in the military budget. This is militaryspecific. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chair and the ranking member for their help, and I urge everybody to vote ‘‘yes’’ for this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . THOMAS J . 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in House Report 115–217. Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Strike section 541 (page 146, beginning line 20), relating to prohibition on release of military service academy graduates to participate in professional athletics. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. THOMAS J. R OONEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, on April 29, Secretary Mattis issued guidance requiring graduates of the Air Force Academy, West Point, and the Naval Academy to compete 2 years of active commissioned service before they can seek permission to pursue a professional sports career while at the same time fulfilling their service obligation. Traditionally, the service Secretaries may exercise discretion over whether or not to permit the very few academy graduates with the exceptional athletic talent to jointly serve either in the reserves, in Active Duty, or a combination of both, and be part of a professional sports team. My amendment supports the flexibility and the discretion that has always been built into the Secretary of Defense’s discretion to determine on a casebycase basis how to deal with his own personnel. Section 541 of this year’s NDAA replaces Secretary Mattis guidance with a far more stringent, onesizefitsall policy that allows for no exceptions, without explanation. No one is saying that graduates should not fulfill their service requirement. No one is saying that graduates shouldn’t pay for their education. Section 541 is a significant departure from the policy which allows the Secretary of Defense and the military branches discretion, and more specifically, today, it handcuffs our own Secretary Mattis from implementing the policy as he sees fit, just like Secretaries of the past have always done. Section 541 stipulates that academy graduates must fulfill, without exception, 5 years on Active Duty before they are able to request release to pursue an athletic career. This policy is overrigid and will make it nearly impossible for graduates of our service academies to pursue any professional athletic career. Denying student athletes on a Secretaryapproved, casebycase basis the opportunity to pursue a professional athletic career in conjunction with their military service is a mistake. The possibility, no matter how remote, of going pro is a powerful recruiting tool that can attract exceptional, diverse high school athletes to attend and excel in our service academies. Very few college athletes are talented enough to play professionally. I played college football and I ended up here. Most high school athletes dream and believe that they can go pro. The truth is, most won’t. But to kill that dream before a student chooses a college also ruins the chance of the academies from recruiting top athletes. Why does this matter? Because striking section 541 will maintain Secretary Mattis’ policy, which was created to ensure that preserving the option for our academy athletes, we do so in a way that maintains the readiness and lethality of our military services. But it is also about morale at the academies. I taught at West Point. I serve on their board today. I served on the Navy board before. I can tell you that if section 541 is retained, we lose out on the boost in morale afforded to the academies with competitive athletic departments and the recruitment benefit of the soldier athletes’ exposure with professional sports teams and their fans. If section 541 is retained, we will be sending a message that if you are a highly talented high school athlete and you also want to go to the Naval Academy, West Point, or the Air Force Academy, you need to give up any possibility of athletic aspirations after school. We will be doing ourselves a disservice by not recruiting the absolute best and brightest individuals who could be so versatile enough to be professional athletes and also serve their Nation honorably. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to the gentleman from Florida’s amendment. This amendment strikes section 541 of the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, which ensures that graduates from military service academies fulfill their military service commitments, without exception, before participating in professional sports. Current policy allows a cadet or midshipman to be released from their 5year Active Duty service to participate in professional sports just 24 months after graduating from a military service academy. As chairman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee and a Marine Corps combat veteran, I believe that the service academies exist to develop future officers to lead, enhance readiness, and increase the effectiveness of the Armed Forces. This is not an issue of recruiting qualified and motivated applicants. Each year, my district office receives far more applications from talented and qualified students who wish to serve their country than we can accommodate. For example, there were 17,000 applications for 1,100 slots last year at the Naval Academy. All of our military service academies have similar numbers of applicants. We are a country still very much engaged in hostilities around the world, and we need these officers leading our troops and defending the country, not playing professional sports. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the provision in the overwhelming bipartisan HASCpassed FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act and oppose Representative Rooney’s amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY ). Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to colead this bipartisan amendment. It would strike section 541 of the bill, a provision that would make it nearly impossible for graduates of the military service academies to play professional football, basketball, or any other sport. I serve on the Board of Visitors at West Point, and I believe section 541 will be detrimental to recruitment and morale at the service academies, could undermine efforts to bridge the militarycivilian divide through the use of sports ambassadors, and could compromise the effectiveness of our officer corps. If our amendment is successful, the policy governing the circumstances under which graduates can play professional sports will be the guidance issued by Secretary Mattis earlier this year. Pursuant to Secretary Mattis’ guidance, an academy graduate must complete 2 years of active commissioned service before he or she can seek approval to pursue a professional sports opportunity. Section 541 goes far beyond this existing guidance, requiring a graduate to serve 5 years on Active Duty before pursuing a professional sports opportunity. This is the functional equivalent of prohibiting a graduate from playing professional sports altogether. Section 541 applies retroactively to current academy student athletes, not just prospectively to future athletes, which strikes me as unfair. Moreover, it removes the flexibility and discretion built into Secretary Mattis’ guidance, replacing it with a onesizefits all policy that allows for no exceptions. Before Congress takes such drastic action, we should carefully weigh the arguments for and against such action. That process has not taken place. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment and to allow Secretary Mattis’ guidance to remain in effect until such time as we can examine this issue more fully. Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ). Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chair, I am truly impressed by my colleague, Mr. ROONEY , on any number of issues. This is not one of them. This is absurd. It is absolutely absurd. We have military academies to train the next leaders of this country. We are not running a training camp for the National Football League. If you want to serve as a leader of the military, then you go to one of the 
military academies. If you decide you want to have a pro football career, then pay back the $500,000 that the taxpayers of this country have paid for each and every one of these students. In the Rules Committee yesterday, Mr. ROONEY listed three names of examples of academy graduates continuing in professional sports after graduation. All of the names he mentioned—Roger Staubach, David Robinson, and Alejandro Villanueva—served on Active Duty for at least 2 years. The model for how this should work is like Villanueva, who served his 5 year commitment, deployed three times to Afghanistan, received a Bronze Star for valor, and then pursued a professional football career. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 30 seconds. b1630 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chair, I will just say that going pro, as Mr. ROONEY has said, is not the goal of our military academies. If we are concerned about morale because we want to make sure they can go out on the football field and have great games against the Army and the Navy, fine. If in the end you want to go pro, then pay back the money and go pro. Otherwise, you are taking a very important slot from any number of talented young men and women who want to be trained and then serve as the leaders of our military. Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ), my friend and colleague. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition. As the only Air Force Academy graduate in Congress, we train these cadets to become officers and leaders and warfighters for our military. We are not training them to become pro athletes, just like my colleague said here. And you want to talk about morale? Having been there, there is nothing worse than watching somebody try to get out of their commitment to go play pro sports, for the rest of the cadets that are there ready to lead America into battle. I strongly support the underlying bill. We are at a time of military crisis and readiness crisis right now. We do not release people to go fly for the airlines or go start their own business or go be an entrepreneur or go to a high tech company and then just say: Oh, just pay it back. There are so many people that are trying to get into these academies so they can wear the uniform and lead America into battle. So this is about warfighting, not about becoming a linebacker. So let’s please—I am urging my colleagues to vote down this amendment and to support the underlying bill. Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I think that if Roger Staubach played for the Dallas Cowboys, graduated from the United States Naval Academy, served his entire ActiveDuty commitment of 5 years before he went to play professional sports, this does not eliminate somebody from playing professional sports. The fact is that we are a nation at war, and it is very competitive to get into these academies, and they ought to fulfill their 5year obligation. If they want to play professional sports, there are lots of schools they can go to outside of our service academies. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 7 OFFERED BY MR . KEATING  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in House Report 115–217. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle C of title VII, add the following new section: 
Using funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2018 for the Defense Health program, the Secretary of Defense may authorize grants to medical researchers and universities to support testing ticks for the purpose of improving the detection and diagnosis of tickborne diseases. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment that would authorize the Secretary of Defense to make existing funds available from the Defense Health Program for collaboration with medical researchers and universities to address the growing number of tickborne diseases through research and testing. The Army Public Health Center has operated a basic tick testing program for nearly 30 years. Through this program, military personnel can assess tick identification services through military healthcare facilities at no charge. However, the tests provided by this program are limited to only six tick borne diseases, whereas the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Defense have now identified 16 of these tickborne diseases, some of which can be fatal. According to the Centers for Disease Control, around 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported each year. However, additional CDC research reveals the actual number of diagnoses could be as high as 300,000. And, alarmingly, nearly 20 percent of the people surveyed in areas with high incidence of Lyme disease were unaware that the disease was even a risk. This issue is of particular concern in my region. According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, my district includes the counties with the five highest rates of Lyme disease in the Commonwealth, including Barnstable County, home of Joint Base Cape Cod. However, my region is not alone on this issue. Ticks carrying dangerous diseases can be found in all corners of the continental United States, from Massachusetts in the north to Texas in the south, from Pennsylvania in the east to California in the west. Our servicemembers are especially vulnerable as they frequently are exposed to heavily tickinfested areas. For example, Powassan. The Powassan virus is a serious tickborne illness known to cause encephalitis, meningitis, and even death. Multiple cases of Powassan have already been reported in Massachusetts this year, yet the DOD tick testing program does not even include a test for Powassan in their regimen. Mr. Chair, I realize there is a concern that amendments to this legislation might lead to a Defense Health Program pushed beyond its capacity. That is not the case here. The military tick testing program already exists. This amendment would necessarily help the Department of Defense modernize the existing program to meet new challenges in the field of tickborne diseases. Indeed, the DOD’s own website informs us that emerging tickborne diseases are being discovered all the time and that yearly cases of known tick borne diseases have been increasing steadily for years. We are fortunate to have experts already working to combat the rise in tickborne disease. My amendment would facilitate collaboration among these experts in DOD to test more tick samples for more diseases, meet the growing needs of our military, and ultimately lead to better healthcare outcomes. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. THOMPSON , for joining me as a cosponsor in this amendment. Pennsylvania is among the States in the midAtlantic region experiencing drastic increases in the incidence of tickborne illnesses. And the hope is our efforts today on the floor and by the Secretary of Defense in the next fiscal year will help save lives. Also, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY  for his work on this important legislation as well. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might consume. Mr. Chairman, I have tremendous respect for the gentleman from Massachusetts. He is exactly right, the Department of Defense Medical Research Program is already spending money on tickborne diseases. I believe it is about $5 million this year. It was about $5 million last year. And as I understand the gentleman’s amendment, he would expand the number of diseases that they can research. I rise to claim the time in opposition, however, to express concern about the direction of this program. Mr. Chairman, I have a chart that indicates the tremendous growth of dollars going into this congressionally directed medical research program. It has increased tremendously in recent years, and I would like to take just a few moments to read some of the diseases that it is researching: ALS, Lou Gehrig’s disease, autism, bone marrow failure, breast cancer, leukemia, muscular dystrophy, epilepsies, food allergies, lung cancer, multiple sclerosis. There is a couple here that I can’t pronounce, so I won’t read. Osteoporosis, ovarian cancer, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, cancer, PeerReviewed Orthopaedic, prostate cancer, spinal cord injuries, of course, tickborne disease, tubular sclerosis, and the list goes on. And let me just say I certainly support Chairman TOMCOLE’s attempts to increase funding for NIH and other sorts of medical research through the NIH. What I am concerned about is that, increasingly, DOD dollars are being spent to research diseases that have a tangential, at best, connection with the Department of Defense and our military. And what happens is it is taking dollars away from the sorts of injuries and diseases that our military does confront. This is a trend that is getting worse each year. So I don’t necessarily oppose the gentleman’s amendment. As he points out, there is research going on here, but it is a trend I do think we have to be cautious about. And for that reason, I want to at least raise a warning flag about the trend to add to the amount of money and the number of diseases which we are looking to the Department of Defense to help research diseases which are not related, necessarily, to key functions of the Department of Defense. So I appreciate the gentleman letting me express that concern, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, in my earlier remarks, I did associate myself with the chairman’s concern that the Department of Defense, the Defense Health Program could be pushed beyond its capacity. It is very important to recognize what he recognized, because if it gets pushed too far, it can’t accomplish the things that it is working to really address. In this instance, as he mentioned, I believe I did distinguish the fact that this is nearly a threedecade program, and what we are doing here is making sure its mission is modernized so it is dealing with what is happening in the healthcare field within that area of tickborne illnesses. So I do appreciate the comments of the chairman, and I think it is wise to point that out. I do hope my colleague supports this amendment, because I have been able to distinguish that from this trend. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 115–217. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in House Report 115–217. 
AMENDMENT NO . 10 OFFERED BY MRS . HARTZLER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in House Report 115–217. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle A of title VII, add the following new section: 
Funds available to the Department of Defense may not be used to provide medical treatment (other than mental health treatment) related to gender transition to a person entitled to medical care under chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, today, North Korea is plotting the next ballistic missile test, Russia is threatening the NATO alliance, ISIS is spreading evil, and China continues their expansion in the South China Sea in defiance of the international community. Our military has never been in such high demand, yet our readiness to confront these threats is at a dismal level. We must confront these challenges by ensuring our defense dollars maximize the military’s readiness and lethality. That is why I am offering an amendment to advance these goals by prohibiting taxpayer dollars from funding gender reassignment surgeries and related hormone therapy treatment for members of the military and their dependants. There are many problems with this policy, but funding transition surgeries with tax dollars is especially problematic because the surgery is very costly. Surgical recovery time decreases deployability of our soldiers, and there is lack of medical consensus on the effectiveness of gender transition treatments. Funding transition surgeries means diverting money from other defense priorities. Surgical costs alone can top $1.3 billion over the next 10 years. These resources could fund 13 F–35 aircraft to fight near peer adversaries like China and Russia; 14 F–18 Super Hornets to fight ISIS; or 8 KC–46 tankers needed for longrange strike missions to North Korea. Our spending priorities must match our threat mitigation priorities. We must have soldiers who can deploy if called upon. Military members undergoing transition surgery are nondeployable for up to 267 days. Similarly, regular hormone treatments renders individuals nondeployable into the future. It makes no sense to create soldiers who are unable to fight and win our Nation’s wars, and it is unfair to nontransitioned individuals who must leave their families and deploy in their place. For all these reasons, Mr. Chair, I offer this amendment as a responsible member of the House Armed Services Committee who has studied the threats and heard from each servicemember about the need for increased funding and readiness. b1645 Prohibiting funding for transition surgery is the right policy for our military, our budget, and it is the right policy for the American taxpayer. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chair, this amendment goes backwards in an area where we have gone forward. This amendment takes us in the wrong direction. For years, we have had people serving in the military who are openly gay, lesbian, and transgender, and they have served, and served this country well. For a lot of years, we did not allow them to do so openly. We finally repealed that for lesbians and gays, and now, just last year, we had the Department of Defense say we are going to do the same thing for transgender. So the people who have been fighting and protecting our country will be allowed to do so openly. It does not harm readiness at all. These people have served in 
the military, served it honorably, and served it well. As far as the costs, the military pays for people who have addictions, who have alcoholism, who smoke. They pay for a lot of things that are contained within the military. This amendment would target one specific group, and very unfairly. And most unfairly, it wouldn’t just, first of all, target transgender surgery, it would target some of the hormone drugs, which cost, like, $100 a year, cost absolutely virtually nothing to the military. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself an additional 30 seconds. Most importantly, this wouldn’t just impact transgender people who are serving, it would impact their children. If you are serving in the military and you happen to have a child who is transgender, you would now be cut off from this military service. All these other things, alcoholism, drug addiction, smoking, all manner of different problems would be served, but transgender people would be targeted to not be allowed to provide healthcare for their children. This isn’t going to help readiness. This is a social agenda that has no business being in the Defense bill. We didn’t have it in committee, we shouldn’t have it here on the floor. Let’s focus on the threats that Mrs. HARTZLER talked about, not make this into a social agenda based on the ignorance of what transgender truly is. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 30 seconds. First of all, this does not preclude service by the transgendered. This simply says that we are not going to have taxpayers pay for this surgery. This is different than somebody going in and having a cold, because this is a major surgery that requires a medical diagnosis that is going to render someone nondeployable. Just the recovery from the surgery alone is 287 days, and then the ongoing treatment precludes them from certain abilities to serve overseas. So we need to take a look at all of this and make sure that we are addressing the threats, and we are spending every dollar that we can to go after the threats. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ), Army National Guard Brigadier. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chair, I thank Mrs. HARTZLER , my good friend, for offering this amendment. Mr. Chair, we are $20 trillion in debt. Taxpayers, by my figures, are projected to pay $3.7 billion over the next 10 years for sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy for those in the military who wish to transition from one sex to another. The total cost includes the manpower lost while the individual transitions, which can take up to a year or longer, depending on complications. Sex reassignment patients also require specialized medicine following the procedure. And I find that interesting, in the face of the fact I just had a young gentleman come to my office who wants to serve, but he can’t serve, because he has got a peanut allergy. Right? He can’t go downrange, because we can’t have the medicine downrange, and that doesn’t cost the taxpayers anything, but we are going to spend $3.7 billion over the next 10 years on sex reassignment surgery as opposed to buying aircraft and body armor and the things that warfighters need to be successful in defending the Nation. It is really just a priority issue. With limited defense resources and the current state of our Armed Forces, we must prioritize increasing our strength and readiness. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, there is no study whatsoever that shows this is going to cost $3.7 billion. And this amendment is not just about transgender surgery, it is about any treatment. Let’s keep that in mind. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the distinguished minority leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his extraordinary leadership as our ranking member on the Armed Services Committee. I thank him for his leadership in trying to help define what our security mission is so that we have the resources that are necessary to honor our oath of office to protect and defend. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. THORNBERRY  as well for his leadership in the defense of our country. The bipartisanship in defending our country is something that we value, and any interference with that is unfortunate. It takes a special kind of person, my colleagues, who steps forward to serve in the U.S. military. They are men and women of courage, of strength, and of patriotism, who shoulder the burden of defending our liberties so that the rest of us can live in security and freedom. We owe these heroes an immense debt, a solemn responsibility to do everything we can to defend those who are risking and giving their lives for the United States of America. The Defense bill before us today should be about honoring that responsibility, protecting those who protect our national security; instead, here we are considering a Republican amendment purposebuilt to attack the health and dignity of thousands of men and women serving with honor and courage today. Make no mistake, the effect and the intent of this unjust and meanspirited amendment is to ban patriotic Americans from serving our country. It is designed to drum transgender servicemembers out of the military. Instead of protecting the men and women who risk their lives to defend our freedoms, they are fighting to rip away the healthcare of thousands of brave servicemembers. The integration of openly transgender servicemembers into our Armed Forces is the unfinished work of the bipartisan—and I commend our colleagues—efforts to repeal the discriminatory Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy. I call upon my Republican colleagues that you immediately withdraw this cruel, discriminatory, and appalling amendment. If not, I call upon all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to defeat this amendment, prevent this assault on transgender servicemembers, and get us back to the subject at hand, which is the defense of our country, which the distinguished chairman, Mr. THORN BERRY , and ranking member have served this Congress and our country so well in doing. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 15 seconds. Mr. Chair, I just want to point out that this amendment doesn’t address any of the full healthcare that every soldier is entitled to; it just says that in this particular instance, we are not going to pay for the gender reassignment surgeries and related hormone treatment. And there is a high cost for it, there is a reason for doing it, and that is why we are addressing that today. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have left? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 45 seconds remaining. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr. HUNTER ). Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the minority leader’s words. I did three tours as a U.S. marine. This is the silliest opposition to this amendment that I have ever heard. You are joining the U.S. military. Choose what gender you are before you join. We are not saying that transgender people can’t serve, but if you are going to take the big step of serving in the U.S. military, figure out whether you are a man or a woman before you join up. We are not stopping transgender people from joining. We are saying taxpayers in this country right now are not going to foot the bill for it. This is a silly thing. It is time to put this to bed. I support the gentlewoman’s amendment. Let’s Make America Great Again. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SEAN PATRICK  MALONEY ). Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I would note to my colleague from California that perhaps the members of their family are supposed to decide on all their future medical care, because this relates to their healthcare, and not just to the servicemembers’. 
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the Hartzler amendment. No one in the Pentagon has called for this. In fact, we know right now Secretary of Defense Mattis is running a review of this issue. He does not need to be micromanaged by Members of this body to advance their own agenda. Until last night, all of us had worked in good faith across the aisle to keep this important Defense bill free from political booby traps and land mines, but if you are feeling deja vu, well, don’t worry, because I am, too. You may remember that I stood here last year and fought against a similar amendment, again to the Defense bill. That amendment would have allowed Federal contractors to fire LGBT workers under the pretense of religious observance. I told you then that my dad was a disabled veteran, that he taught me to support and honor the military, but also to speak the truth and know the difference between right and wrong. I told you that I had never voted against the Defense bill, and I never imagined I would. And then, after a lot of twists and turns, 43 of our Republican colleagues joined with us to vote down that discriminatory amendment, and I want to publicly thank them for their courage. Well, here we go again. The Hartzler amendment would single out and rob a small group of military servicemembers and their families of their healthcare merely because these folks or members of their family experience gender a little differently. Mr. Chair, it is that simple. We are talking about Americans who right now are risking their lives to keep us safe, and we should not undermine their military service. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the distinguished minority whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, this amendment is not about defense, this amendment is about politics, and I congratulate Chairman THORNBERRY for urging that this amendment not be added to the bill in committee. We ought to defeat this amendment. It has one purpose, and one purpose only: to politically denigrate some of our fellow citizens, to treat them less equally than we would want to be treated. Let us not do that. Let us not sink to that level. We are better than that. We are representative of all of the people. Reject this amendment. Get on with the defense of this country and its values. Mr. Chair, I rise in very strong opposition to this amendment. It is discriminatory. It is disparaging to our military—to all our men and women in uniform. And it hinders our armed forces from carrying out their mission of keeping our country safe. It is appalling that the Rules Committee would even make this amendment in order, the first ever to come to this floor that directly takes away the rights of transgender Americans. For those transgender Americans currently serving, it would deny them health care services open to other servicemembers. For those thinking of enlisting, it would be a powerful deterrent, keeping talented, driven, and dedicated men and women from serving. I hope my colleagues in both parties who are ashamed that this amendment has reached the floor will join me in voting to defeat it. Mr. SMITH OF Washington. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, this is about addressing Korea, Russia, ISIS. We need every defense dollar to go to meeting those threats, not anything else, and we need to make sure our troops are ready and can be deployed. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the Hartzler Amendment. Transgender individuals are part of the fabric of America and have always been part of our military, whether we have historically acknowledged them or not. Selectively denying healthcare to trans servicemembers, which is available to other members of the military, only serves to alienate, undermine, disrespect and ultimately harm those serving our country. This amendment is a shameful and targeted attempt to enact a conservative agenda that singles out transgender individuals. It circumvents, our military’s doctors and uses the denial of healthcare to force currently serving, and future transgender members of our armed services from their posts entirely. Transition related care is considered medically necessary by nearly every major medical association. It should not need to be said that when a military physician determines that hormones, surgery or other transition related care is necessary, we must treat it as we would any other medical care. Anything less is an abdication of our duty to provide healthcare to those who have chosen to serve our country. Using finances to tie the hands of our military’s medical professionals to target transgender individuals demonstrates an appalling lack of respect for our servicemembers, their doctors and the democratic ideals of equality our country was founded on. I urge my colleagues to support our servicemembers by opposing this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Missouri will be postponed. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. PERRY ) having assumed the chair, Mr. COLLINS of Georgia, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2810) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
b1705 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. JODYB. H ICEof Georgia) at 5 o’clock and 5 minutes p.m.

AMENDMENT NO . 12 OFFERED BY MR . COLE 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in House Report 115–217. Mr. COLE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle H of title XII, add the following new section: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) and a Member opposed each will control 15 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. Mr. COLE. Mr. Chair, since 2001 when we passed the original Authorization for Use of Military Force against al Qaida and against associated enemies, the nature of the war on terror in which we find ourselves has changed dramatically. We now find ourselves fighting enemies that simply did not exist at the time in areas that nobody in Congress anticipated we would be at war. This has caused a number of us to have very serious concerns as to whether or not the original Authorization for Use of Military Force is still relevant, and frankly, many of us have concerns that the warmaking power of Congress is slipping away from us. Indeed, we find ourselves engaged since that original AUMF in 14 different countries on more than almost 40 different occasions without Congress authorizing the use of force. In our view, a new AUMF is necessary. However, I also recognize that needs to come through a process. My effort here is to try and set up a process where the administration can participate, we can have an orderly discussion, and the appropriate committees can mark up a new AUMF if Congress, indeed, thinks it does—and again, I think many of us do. A new AUMF would provide clear authority for ongoing operations against ISIS and other terrorist groups, and it would fulfill the constitutional responsibility of Congress to authorize the use of force. My amendment directs the President to put forward a strategy, an analysis, and a framework that we can actually debate and take action on. The underlying bill being considered today provides authorization for training and equipping our military. Just as important is the time to debate and deliberate how that military should be used to defeat our enemies. Recently, in an appearance before the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Secretary Mattis made an appearance, and I actually asked him would it be helpful to have an AUMF. At that time, he said it absolutely would be helpful. Our men and women who we have deployed in places, again, that nobody in 2001 thought they would be deployed to, need to know that the Congress of the United States is fully supportive of their deployment. So this amendment would direct that the President, within 30 days after the passage of the legislation, present to Congress a report that, again, justifies the action, tells us the strategy, lays out the objectives. Within 30 days after that report was received, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense could be called before the relevant committees to actually explain and defend that. Now, again, in my view, I still think we need a new Authorization for Use of Military Force, but I want to start a process whereby that would begin, and I think this would help us achieve that. If others have an opinion, that is fine too, but I think they would still find the report useful and the testimony invaluable. Sooner or later, Congress needs to take responsibility. I think with the best will in the world, we have slipped into almost endless warfare in a lot of places that none of us anticipated we would be. b1800 Again, these are not actions that I necessarily question, but I think they have not been authorized, not been debated, not been examined, and, frankly, the American people have been denied that debate. Also, frankly, they have been denied the opportunity to hold their Members responsible. Remember, that original Authorization for Use of Military Force was 2001. Almost 80 percent of the Members of this body have been elected since that original authorization. I think they ought to listen to the debate, and, frankly, their constituents ought to be able to hold them accountable. So I would urge adoption of the amendment, Mr. Chairman, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, although I will not oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. PALMER ). Without objection, the gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Cole amendment. I am a great admirer of the gentleman from Oklahoma. We have worked together on several bipartisan letters to Speaker RYANasking that the Speaker bring to the House floor an AUMF to address the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. I value the gentleman’s leadership and desire to find common ground with Members on both sides of the aisle. But it is frustrating, Mr. Chairman, to know that this amendment was made in order while every other amendment to require the House to take concrete action on these wars were denied their right to debate. Maybe my good friend from Oklahoma is right and Congress has to take baby steps. It needs yet another report on Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. Its Committees on Foreign Affairs and Armed Services need to be ordered to hold hearings with the Secretaries of Defense and State to review these matters. But what then? According to this amendment, nothing. Now, I have had my fill of Congress doing nothing. I admire the gentleman from Oklahoma. I support his amendment. But I am sick and tired of reports. After 16 years in Afghanistan, we need a debate on the future of U.S. military engagement there, and we need it now. The gentleman said ‘‘sooner or later.’’ Well, after 16 years, we have already arrived at sooner and later. After 
6 years of military operations in Iraq and Syria, we need to vote on an AUMF to address the fight against the Islamic State, and we need it now. How much longer will Congress keep sending our brave servicemen and women to war while it sits on its hands back here in Washington safe and sound? So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, but I demand that the House Republican leadership find the courage to act on these matters now. Our troops and their families deserve more than silence from a Congress that has no qualms about sending them to war but fails to have the political courage to take a vote. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ), who is the distinguished chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from Oklahoma and his consistent and strong leadership on this issue. I, like him, believe that it is time to have a new AUMF, given the change of circumstances and the evolution of the threats which we face. This is the third administration that has had to take the 2001 AUMF and stretch its meaning to encompass all sorts of groups in all sorts of countries in all sorts of circumstances. I think, from a legal standpoint, we need to update the AUMF so that we are consistent with the intent of the Constitution. The even more important point is the point that the gentleman from Oklahoma made, and that is that the men and women who are out there risking their lives deserve to know that they have the full backing of the country that comes from an AUMF that Congress has passed. I do want to take exception with one point that is sometimes made. This House has voted twice to update the 2001 AUMF. It voted in 2011 and in 2012 to update that AUMF to include associated forces. It happened to be part of the NDAA, even though the Armed Services Committee is not the committee of jurisdiction. The Foreign Affairs Committee worked with us, and we passed it twice in the House. It did not survive contact with the Senate, and although there was some detention language that came from it, but there had been efforts in this House to update this language. But I think the gentleman’s approach is exactly right as for the strategy, the budget that goes with it, and the legal framework we are to follow, including the AUMF. So I do think it is a methodical, deliberate process that will take us closer to doing what we ought to do, and that does include updating this Authorization for Use of Military Force against terrorist groups as that terrorist threat evolves. I commend the gentleman for his amendment and I support it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH), who is the distinguished ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I really want to follow up on the committee chairman’s remarks. He is absolutely right. In 2011 and 2012, I was actually very intimately involved in the process of trying to update the AUMF, and I have all the bruises and scars to show for it. It is a very difficult process. The main thing I want to accomplish in my 2 minutes here is to explain to everybody why we haven’t updated it, because there are actually very clear reasons. I am not sure they are good reasons, but they are very clear. Everyone sort of acts like: Well, we just haven’t done it. Why are we twiddling our thumbs? The reason is because, well, lawyers and how words are interpreted. As we went through and tried to word it exactly correctly, and as we negotiated with the Senate, we discovered that basically no matter how you word it, two groups are going to oppose it for diametrically opposite reasons. One side is going to say that it is too broad; it gives the President way too much power for too long a period of time and gives him too open a hand. Other groups will look at that exact same language and say that this unfairly restricts the President; it is going to make it more difficult. You have these conversations those of us on the committee have with the Pentagon as they are trying to figure out—I haven’t had as many conversations with the current administration as with the previous, but I talked at length with the Obama folks about deciding what could they do? Where could they commit a strike? Against which groups? It was a very lengthy process to go back through and try to figure out whether or not it was under the law allowed. So if we change this, the lawyers on both sides are going to go bananas saying that this new language proves that you can’t do that or it is too broad. Now, all of that is not to say that we shouldn’t do it. We should. But I just want people to understand the difficulty of it and for our House to actually be willing—and the Senate—to do the work we should do. Don’t kid yourself that this is something, well, gosh, we could just do it, it would be easy, and if everyone understands it, we are just ducking it for no good reason. It is going to be really, really hard. It is going to take bipartisan, bicameral cooperation. But it is way past time for us to do it. Yeah, when we do it, lawyers will interpret it, and there will be some uncertainty. But there is uncertainty now as they try to, as the chairman described, bootstrap the 2001 AUMF on to a whole bunch of other things. We have an obligation to do this even if it is difficult. Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend both the chairman and the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee for their approach to this problem. It is well known in this body that probably the House Armed Services Committee is the most bipartisan committee that we have. The fact that you have tried in the past and the fact that you are willing to work with us here today is deeply appreciated. I also thank my friend from Massachusetts, and I want to associate myself with his frustration. He has every right to be frustrated. My friend, the ranking member, is correct. This is a difficult job. It will require bipartisan cooperation and bicameral cooperation. But isn’t that what war is about, to achieve a national consensus? I think that is exactly what Secretary Mattis was asking for: We will go do any mission that you as the Congress and the administration ask us to do, but give us a clear mission and give us your absolute support in carrying that through. If we have this debate, there will undoubtedly be dissenting views. That is what democracy is supposed to be about, too. So my friends that would oppose the use of force, for instance, in Afghanistan, that voice ought to be heard and that case ought to be made. Frankly, those of us who are supportive of what we are trying to accomplish against ISIS need to make our case and persuade the majority of this House and of the United States Senate to move forward. So I take this as the first step on a road. Like my friend, it is a baby step. I would agree with his characterization, but at least it is a step. This couldn’t have happened without the cooperation of our leadership in the House and certainly without the help of the chairman and the ranking member of the committee. But, also, it couldn’t have happened without the persistence of my friend from Massachusetts. We have worked together, and, believe me, that is unusual. We don’t agree on a lot of issues, but we respect one another. This is also a question of congressional authority. I think it is a profoundly important constitutional issue, and I do believe we have inadvertently—because of the difficulty of the task—allowed warmaking power to slip away from us. That needs to stop. We are responsible to the American people. The Constitution is very clear about where warmaking power lies. Frankly, it ought to be difficult to go to war. It ought to demand a lot of cooperation. It ought to be something that we think is worth setting aside our differences, working together, because we are asking men and women to risk their lives. We are putting them in harm’s way, and they deserve to know that we are 100 percent supporting them. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. SCHIFF ). Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Cole amendment. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for his work in pushing Congress to have a debate on an AUMF. I had offered an amendment as well to the defense bill, along with Mr. SANFORD and Mr. M OULTON , that would put in place a new consolidated AUMF, and I wanted to describe it. I know there has been considerable debate over whether this is the right bill for an amendment of this nature. But what we have tried to do in this language is avoid the red lines that both parties seem to have in this debate. As I perceive those red lines, my friends on the Republican side of the aisle are reluctant to—in what would be considered too restrictive a way—tie the hands of the Commander in Chief by putting limits on geography or the introduction of ground troops. On the Democratic side, we are resistant to the idea of giving the Commander in Chief too much of a blank check. The way that we have sought to navigate the distance between these two red lines is a resolution that would repeal the old authorizations which no longer really apply to our current situation, replace it with an authorization of use of force against alQaida, ISIS, the Taliban, and their associated forces. It would place no geographic limits and no limits on the introduction of ground forces, but it would have these necessary safeguards. First, it would have a sunset date of 3 years so that we don’t again get to a 15year period where we can’t get a vote on an authorization and it goes on beyond its intended life. But it would also provide that, if a President decided to introduce ground troops in a combat mission, a privileged motion would be in order that any Member could trigger where within a discrete period of time set up by the War Powers Act you could compel a vote to either approve or modify or repeal the existing authority. That would, of course, not prevent us from taking a vote at any other time, but it would at least allow a vote and some accountability. So I commend it for people’s consideration as a way that we might navigate the distance between the parties. I appreciate, again, my colleague from Oklahoma’s efforts to get us to weigh in and consider and live up to our constitutional responsibility. Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I want to advise my friend that I am prepared to close, although, believe me, I could talk about this a long time. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I always enjoy hearing the gentleman talk about this. When we agree on things, it is always pleasant. I commend the gentleman from Oklahoma for this amendment because I think it is important that we move forward, even if it is a small step forward. As I said initially, I am frustrated. I know Mr. SCHIFF is frustrated, and a lot of other people are frustrated who had amendments that were perfectly germane to this bill that I think should have been debated and that many of us think they are long overdue. Mr. Chairman, 16 years in Afghanistan is an awful long time. Some of us fear that these wars are becoming endless. They are essentially on automatic pilot. We don’t give the attention that I think is appropriate to what is happening, especially given the fact that so many brave men and women have their lives on the line on behalf of our country. But beyond that, this AUMF in Afghanistan that has now been going on for 16 years has also been used to justify what we are doing in Syria, what we are doing in Iraq, in Somalia, and I could go on and on. This is ludicrous. b1815 As the gentleman from Oklahoma knows, before we began to get sucked in militarily in Syria, some of us tried to have a debate on an AUMF in Syria, because we thought the time to debate an AUMF, the time to debate military action, actually should be before we get involved. Once we are involved, it is a lot harder to have these debates and to raise the questions that are so important as to whether or not some of these interventions are actually the right thing to do. But we skirted that issue, and we continue to put this on the back burner. As I said, I have no objection to this amendment. I support this amendment. I just think we are at a point where we should be doing much more. We are much further along than to just require a report or to mandate hearings. I am concerned that after these reports and these hearings are done, then what? The gentleman’s amendment doesn’t require that Congress take up an AUMF or that we actually have to have a vote in so many days or so many months. So I look forward to working with the gentleman to make sure that not only are these reports and these hearings conducted as we all want them to be, but to continue to press this leadership to do the right thing: to not give away Congress’ constitutional responsibilities and to do what is right by the men and women who sacrifice so much for our country. There are only a small group of people who are directly impacted by these wars, and that is the men and women who are fighting and their families. The rest of us are asked to do basically nothing. I think that Congress has shirked its responsibility. We can’t tolerate that. I hope there is a big, strong bipartisan, if not unanimous vote, for the gentleman’s amendment, but this is just the first teeny step in what we need to do. I promise him that he has my cooperation in any efforts to get it to the point where we actually debate these wars and develop AUMFs where people, as he said, can vote for them or against them. My view of what we should be doing, I know, is very different from the gentleman from Oklahoma, and perhaps even different from the gentleman from California, but that is the kind of genius and the wonder of this place. We can all have different points of view, and we can even differ, but at the end of the day, the majority decides. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Cole amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by associating myself very much with the remarks of my good friend from Massachusetts. Frankly, this is an area where we have found common ground because I think we both deeply revere this institution and, frankly, respect the Constitution of the United States. When he says that we have shirked our duty, in my view, we have. I think it is absolutely a fair statement to make. I think the gentleman from Washington is also correct that it is hard. This is a very complex, difficult kind of war. It is a new kind of war, its enemies morphing into different forms and different places. All that is true, but it doesn’t excuse us from the obligation to do our job and give those men and women the assurance that they are acting at the direct request and order of the American people in fulfilling the responsibility we have asked them to take. It doesn’t directly relate to this issue, but I felt very much the same way as my friend did at the time about Libya. We stretched the NATO alliances so far to get involved in a country where, in my view, we should have never been involved. More importantly, Libya didn’t attack NATO. It really didn’t make a lot of sense to use that kind of instrument to justify a war. I aim this at no particular President, either the last one or current one, but, frankly, Presidents don’t like Congress very much to tell them what they have to do. They want to be able to do it. Well, I am sorry; the Constitution is very clear about that. One of the reasons we have a Constitution is because we didn’t want to live under a system where it is a monarchy as opposed to a Presidency. It is part of our duty to keep a check on the extraordinary power that we place in the hands of the Chief Executive of the United States, regardless of who that person is, regardless of what party they represent. My friend makes a good point when he says sometimes we don’t trust one another, or we don’t want to give the President too much power. We also 
don’t want to take too much responsibility ourselves, sometimes. For that, we ought to look in the mirror. We ought to be willing to take that awesome responsibility that the Constitution entrusts us with and make the tough decisions that the American people send us here to make. I actually think going through this process will be very good for this institution. My friend is correct, it is a baby step, and I share his frustration. But I think the current administration deserves a chance to be heard and to present a justification, not just inherit an ongoing conflict. I think the committee of jurisdiction, the Foreign Affairs Committee, deserves the opportunity to hear this. My friend expresses a concern which, quite frankly, I share, that we will have a hearing and not much more. That would not be where I would propose that we end. I would hope and would work with my friend to make sure that is not where we end. I think at the end of the day, whatever the deliberation is, whatever the recommendation is for a new AUMF, it needs to come to this floor, and it needs to be open for full debate. If we can’t muster a majority to approve that, then we shouldn’t be fighting in the places we are fighting if we are not willing to actually vote and use that. So I am going to pledge to continue to work with my friend and urge the administration, assuming this actually gets in the final bill, to take it as an opportunity to establish a very clear set of objectives, a very clear strategy, a very clear estimate of the budgetary cost, and a very clear analysis of the legal framework under which they are operating. I think they, and we, owe that to the country. We certainly owe it to the men and women that we have asked to go and do difficult things and risk their lives on our behalf. They do it willingly. Again, the Secretary of Defense said this would be helpful. This kind of debate would make a difference. I, again, thank my friends for their cooperation in this. I thank particularly the chairman and the ranking member for allowing us to use this particular vehicle to express it. I thank the leadership of the House for being willing to grapple with this issue. I thank my friend from Massachusetts for his persistent efforts; and my friend from California, Ms. LEE, who has also worked on this. A lot of people on our side of the aisle feel exactly the same way. This is a debate about the future of a conflict, but it is also a debate about the appropriate constitutional authority of the Congress of the United States and a willingness by the Members to embrace this. So it is actually, I think, a good day, even though it is the first step in a long journey. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 13 OFFERED BY MR . FRANKS OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in House Report 115–217. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle H of title XII, add the following new section: 
and I want to help. There is no desire in my heart whatsoever to single out any group of innocent people or denigrate their faith in any way. However, the reality remains that there is one spectrum of Islamic ideology whose variants are responsible for the 9/11 attacks, feeling the insurgency in Iraq, the countless attacks on civilians in Europe, and the boundless evil of the Islamic State. In 2017 alone, there have been 1,134 attacks in 49 countries, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed and 8,000 more were injured. Our allies across the world, including in the Muslim world, have now begun to study and analyze the ideology that foments Islamic terrorism so they can begin to resist it on a strategic ideological level. If we in America do not also address this on a strategic level, this underlying ideology that catalyzes the evil of jihadist terrorism across the world, then its list of victims will only grow longer. Mr. Chairman, my amendment will help us to categorize those perpetrating violence in the name of Islam and help us to identify our allies within the Muslim world who can assist in countering the Islamic message of global jihad. Those who would oppose this amendment choose to continue the status quo, that is to say, no strategy at all. So, Mr. Chairman, I would just implore the Members of this body to pass this amendment and join this sincere effort in finally identifying our enemies, empowering our friends, and ending this evil destructive ideology once and for all. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I am a Marine Corps infantryman. When I was fighting door todoor in Iraq, some of the bravest marines in my unit, men of valor and patriotism, were Muslims. They stood with the Iraqis to risk their lives and endangered loved ones to help us. At this very moment, marines are still fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of them are Muslim. They still rely on the steadfast support of our Muslim allies. That is why I find this amendment so troubling. b1830 Mr. Chairman, at a time when American forces are deployed across the Muslim world and depend on the support of Muslim governments, the Franks amendment will send exactly the wrong message to our friends and adversaries alike. By singling out a faith tradition for a strange and unprecedented study by our military, we are sending a dangerous message and signal that America is at war with Islam. America is not ever going to be at war with a single religion. It is our task as Members of Congress who care about our military and about the American values that our servicemembers risk their lives for to defend it and to reaffirm those values, and we can do that by defeating this misguided amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chair, how much time remains on this side? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona has 15 seconds remaining. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ). Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chair, if the Congress of the United States were to direct the Department of Defense to study and examine and scrutinize your religion to list leaders in that religion and teachers, to decide what was orthodox and unorthodox, you would be among—I don’t know—the Christian community, the Jewish community, Buddhists, Hindus, and Muslims. But only Islam is selected out in the Franks amendment, only one religion is done so. Mr. Chair, if you select out one religion for particular scrutiny, to scrutinize their doctrine, to declare to the government what is orthodox and unorthodox, and to identify teachers of it, you have simply abridged the free exercise of that religion. That is unconstitutional. Nobody is saying you can’t study terrorism. You can study what motivates people to commit acts of terrorism; and we should, but we don’t, not equally. The fact is that this amendment singled out and stigmatizes one religious group. It is wrong, and it should be voted down. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ). Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this dangerous and divisive amendment that is the latest attempt to criminalize the religious beliefs of Muslims in this country. Let me remind my colleague from Arizona that our country was founded on the principle of religious liberty, and the First Amendment guarantees that right. In calling for a strategic assessment, this amendment tramples on our Constitution’s separation of religion and State, singles out the Muslim religion, its practices and leaders, and it does nothing to keep our Nation safe. In fact, fearmongering undermines trust and national security, and pits neighbor against neighbor, community against community, and is an insult to our American Muslim communities. This amendment doesn’t even apply its arbitrary surveillance equally, because if it did, it would include assessments of White supremacist terrorism or terrorism committed against abortion clinics and doctors. Mr. Chairman, our fight against terrorism is not against any religion. It is against the acts that are committed and those who commit the acts. It violates our Constitution and runs counter to who we are as a nation. Frankly, it is horrifying, and I urge my colleagues to resoundingly oppose it. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ). Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment, which selectively requires the military to identify Islamic religious doctrines, concepts, or schools of thought used by various extremist groups and how they have been incorporated into terrorist messaging. The problem, of course, is that terrorist killers have used religious doctrines and concepts from every major religion on earth, including not just Islam, but Christianity, Judaism, Mormonism, Hinduism, Buddhism, for homicidal purposes. Because religion is based on faith and not reason, and because religious texts are not selfexplanatory, good people will invoke scripture for good causes and evil people will invoke scripture for evil causes. We don’t need a big government study to teach us something so commonsensical, which the Founders taught us a long time ago. If we want to study the exploitation of religion for terrorism, let’s study it universally. Focusing on one religion not only vastly understates the problem, but exacerbates the problem by fomenting the myth that religious fanaticism and terrorism are unique to the charlatans and predators of Islam when they are common to the charlatans and predators of nearly every religious faith and identification. Constitutionally, we do not single out particular religions for governmental inspection and suspicion under the First Amendment. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have available? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona has 45 seconds remaining. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I think what we need to remember is there is some commonality here; and I am reminded of this almost every weekend, especially when I stay here in Washington, D.C. I go to section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery to visit my friends that died in the war in Iraq. In every headstone there, you will see a lot of different symbols of religions, whether it is the Jewish star, whether it is the Islamic symbol or the Christian symbol, or the nonbeliever, no symbols whatsoever. 
The one thing they all have in common is they are all sharing the same ground. They are all sharing the same sacred ground of Arlington National Cemetery because they all died for the same American values. That American value says that we will not ostracize somebody else for their religion, for who they believe or who they don’t believe. Any steps towards that is dangerous. If we want to continue to reaffirm the values that those men and women have died for that are now sitting in section 60, we need to defeat this amendment and do it because we know it is the right thing to do, and it reaffirms those American values that those men and women have died for. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time. Mr. Chairman, this amendment will empower America to identify those heroes within the Muslim world who are working so bravely to counter the odious violent ideology which continues to use Islam to justify the murder of tens of thousands of innocent men, women, and children. It will save American lives, it will save Muslim lives, it will save lives across the world, and I would encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. FRANKS ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 14 OFFERED BY MS . CHENEY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14 printed in House Report 115–217. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle E of title XVI, add the following new section: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wyoming. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment that will help ensure the strength of our nuclear deterrent by preventing further reductions to our deployed ICBM fleet below 400 missiles. At this point, our deployed fleet at 400 missiles is at the basic level necessary to maintain a strong and effective nuclear deterrence. Mr. Chair, our ICBMs are a critical leg of our triad as they provide our commanders with a responsive, flexible, and survivable military response ready 24/7, 365 days a year. Our ICBM leg of the triad also adds significantly to our deterrence capability by increasing the number of targets our adversaries must hold at risk. My amendment is a safeguard that prevents any unilateral disarmament that would leave our Nation vulnerable to attack. My amendment does not impact our compliance with the New START, and it does not change our current alert level or require the deployment of any additional ICBMs at this point. The amendment simply reaffirms to our adversaries and our allies that our nuclear deterrence will remain strong. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simply not necessary, as it is a solution in search of a problem. Now, the budget request for fiscal year 2018 has no funding for reducing the level or reducing the number of deployed ICBMs below 400, and there are no plans to do so in the future. It also presupposes the completion of the nuclear posture review, which is currently ongoing and is expected at the end of this year. So instead of jumping the gun and acting precipitously, we should allow the administration time to finish the review and base our actions on its findings. This is particularly true because it may be that reducing the number of ICBMs and reducing alert levels could, in fact, be beneficial to enhance strategic stability. Preventing such a reduction also disregards the crucial and fundamental role of our Nation’s submarines, which provide an assured, survivable secondstrike capability, and which dissuades an adversary from thinking they could launch a disarming attack against the United States. ICBMs can be seen as destabilizing in that they would force a very rapid decision by the President and are useor lose nuclear weapons. History has shown us concerns about the potential for a rushed decision in response to a false alarm that none of us wish to see repeated. Mr. Chairman, if we are going to talk about keeping ICBMs, it should be done in a meaningful, informed discussion based on the findings of the Nuclear Posture Review instead of yet another annual amendment driven by what seems like a parochial interest, which does not consider the other legs of the nuclear deterrent. Instead, we should focus on increasing accountability and ensuring that we are improving the morale and culture inside the Air Force with regard to nuclear weapons so that some of the serious and embarrassing problems that have plagued the ICBM missileers and security forces in recent years may be properly addressed. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Chair, there is nothing in my amendment that has any negative impact on our submarine fleet. In fact, I support strongly, as does the NDAA, the importance of the triad, as have administrations of both parties over many years. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS), the distinguished chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for offering this amendment. A provision nearly identical to this has been in the final version of the last two NDAAs, and it should be in the final version of this year’s NDAA. As chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I understand that the responsiveness and distributive nature of our ICBMs are the most critical features. Without ICBMs, an adversary would need to strike less than 10 targets to disarm our nuclear forces. But with ICBMs, an adversary needs to strike hundreds of hardened targets deep in America’s homeland. That is a much more difficult proposition and is at the very heart of our deterrence. During his confirmation hearing, Secretary of Defense Mattis agreed 
with this assessment, noting: ‘‘The ICBM force provides a costimposing strategy on our adversaries.’’ We should confirm this policy once more. It is vital that our ICBM force remain robust and responsive. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amendment. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH), the distinguished ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, this amendment basically unnecessarily ties the hands of our administration in terms of choosing how best to spend Defense dollars. Now, the gentlewoman mentions that this does not say anything about reducing our submarine force or reducing our bomber force. It does, however, lock in a certain amount of ICBMs that we have to have, and, in that sense, it does impact all other choices in terms of our Defense policy not just within the nuclear framework. But within the nuclear framework, there is, as I keep emphasizing and people keep resisting, a finite amount of resources available to fund the Department of Defense. In fact, that is the central problem with this whole bill, as I have mentioned. We don’t have a budget resolution. This is $72 billion overthebudget caps that the House has shown no willingness to vote to lift. So here we have $72 billion that we are just kind of hoping is going to be there. So at some point we are going to have to make some choices. I keep saying that. We keep delaying it—doing CRs. We even shut down the government once. We continue to sort of stumble forward with no clear plan, but amendments like this are just another example of how we lock in a lack of flexibility in terms of how we spend our money. What is the best approach to our national security? Now, it has been mentioned and I keep harping on the fact that we don’t have a national security plan yet. And it has been mentioned, well, Presidents usually take awhile to deliver them. And okay, fine, we will, you know, sometime in the next year hopefully get that plan. But amendments like this trap that plan, restrict the ability of the President to deal with a finite amount of resources to come with what is the best approach. b1845 And there are a lot of arguments that ICBMs are not the best approach to nuclear deterrence. Do we need an absolute fixed amount? I don’t think so. I think we need greater flexibility, particularly as we await the findings of the Nuclear Posture Review to figure out what our best strategy going forward is. So we have all these little parochial pieces where we make sure that the piece that is closest to us, you can’t touch that. We have to have exactly the same number. That is not in the best interests of a comprehensive National Security Strategy. We need flexibility in this budget. We are not going to have as much money as everybody seems to think that we are going to have. That is just the fact. We are $20 trillion in debt, running up deficits of $700 billion a year. We have the budget caps. At some point, we are going to have to start making choices. This amendment does not help in that. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. LANGEVIN. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds. Mr. SMITH of Washington. As I like to quote: ‘‘Gentlemen, we are out of money; it is time to think.’’ We are, in fact, running out of money—that is a Winston Churchill quote, by the way—but we appear to not be willing to do the thinking part about making choices on where we should not and should spend our money. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have left? The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Wyoming has 2
3⁄4minutes remaining. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ), a retired brigadier general and the former commander of Offutt Air Force Base. Mr. BACON. Mr. Chair, I just want to point out, when I came to the Air Force in 1985, we have since then reduced our ICBM force by 60 percent. Enough is enough. Four hundred is the level we should not go below. Our strategic nuclear force enterprise is America’s force of last resort and has, for decades, asserted peace through strength for the United States and its allies around the world. I would like to remind my colleagues that every one of us in the House and the many millions of Americans we represent have lived and prospered in peace precisely because we have made the conscious decision as a nation many years ago to keep a strong, responsive, and resilient nuclear deterrent. The ICBM leg of the nuclear triad is, by design, the largest, safest, and most responsive part of our central strategic forces. It is the very foundation of our nuclear deterrent, and we must preserve the longstanding bipartisan consensus that our ICBMs be kept at high levels of alert and at sufficient numbers to ensure our nuclear deterrent stays credible. As we continue down to a new START level, a treaty level of 400 ICBMs, it is essential that we go no lower. When we say ‘‘promote the common defense,’’ this is what those words mean. Mr. Chair, I urge support of this amendment. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I believe, as I said before, this amendment is an unnecessary amendment. It does not meaningfully address the three legs of the nuclear triad. Let’s wait until the Nuclear Posture Review is done and base our decision then on facts and not on speculation. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Chairman, we have seen over the years many misguided efforts to unilaterally cut our strategic forces and to do so in a way that has been really based on a notion that somehow if we reduce the level of weapons in our inventory, that our adversaries will do the same. We know that is simply not the case. This amendment is crucial to ensure that we maintain the kind of deterrent that is necessary in a world in which we are facing increasing threats. Our ability to deter against the threats of our adversaries depends in large part both upon their understanding of our will to use our forces as well as their belief in our capability, and the last thing we should be doing is reducing below a safe and secure number. Mr. Chairman, in offering this amendment, my intention is very much to say, look, our obligation as Members of the House of Representatives is to provide for the common defense and to ensure that, while we are overseeing activities by the executive branch, we are not allowing the kind of irresponsible cuts that could put us at risk. So I urge the adoption of my amendment, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 15 OFFERED BY MR . LAMBORN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 15 printed in House Report 115–217. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. L AMBORN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The goal of this amendment is simple: given the rising nuclear and ballistic missile threat from North Korea and Iran, we have a renewed urgency to do everything we can to make sure that the Missile Defense Agency goes as fast and as far as possible. This includes cutting unnecessary bureaucracy. This amendment would normalize the operational test and evaluation process for our ballistic missile defense system, simply treating it like every other major weapons system that we have. This amendment fixes an outdated bureaucratic requirement which requires the Secretary of Defense, himself, to guarantee in advance a system will work before it can even be bought. This is such a high bar, we don’t use it anywhere else. Under this amendment, we will still have a robust, rigorous testing program, without the Secretary of Defense needing to get personally involved. The Director of OT&E, which is the Pentagon’s testing office, would still be required by law to evaluate and approve testing plans, analyze and evaluate testing results, and publish an annual public report with this information. Congress and the Secretary of Defense will still have the power to say no. The difference is MDA won’t have needless obstacles to prevent them from moving forward. Let’s free the Missile Defense Agency and unshackle it so it can better do its vital job of protecting us from missile attack. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chairman, I regret that my good friend from Colorado has offered this amendment. It was not voted on in either subcommittee or in full committee. It should be rejected by this House, and rejected overwhelmingly. Why? We need to make sure that our missile defense works. This is not a vote on whether we are for or against missile defense. I am strongly for missile defense. I just want to make sure that it works. In the National Defense Authorization Act of 2015, there is a strong section in that act that requires that it work. The gentleman’s amendment is not supported by the Missile Defense Agency, it is not supported by the Pentagon. What it is is a vendor’s dream, what it is is a defense contractor’s dream, because it would enable them to sell stuff to us, the American taxpayer and to the citizens of this country, promising national defense, but not proving it. We need to fly it before we buy it. We need to test it before we invest in it. We need to make sure that it works before we fork over the dough. If this loophole were to be established into law, allowing missiles to be flown through this loophole, it would delight the defense contractor industry. This is an amazing breach of what really, I think, has been American law for 150 years. Back during the Civil War, there was a law passed called the Lincoln Law. And because so many Americans were outraged that the bullets sold to the Union soldiers did not work and the cannonballs did not work and the boots didn’t last in the rain, they passed one of the toughest laws ever passed by this Congress, to penalize defense contractors who sold us stuff that did not work. We need to make sure these missiles work. The gentleman is absolutely correct. The threat from North Korea is real, the threat one day from Iran could be real. We need to make sure these missiles work. And to shortcircuit, to obviate a testing requirement would be an appalling thing for us to do. This has been law since 2015. It is working, it works fine, the Missile Defense Agency is all for it. Let’s keep it. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. And to allow contractors to sell us stuff that is unproven, that is not tested, that has not flown before we buy it, oh, my gosh, I wouldn’t want to be on that side of that transaction. So the gentleman is an outstanding Member, he does great work. As I say, this was not voted on in either subcommittee or full committee. It would be a mistake for the full House to support this amendment at this time. So I would urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, if there is any evidence that MDA or DOD does not favor this amendment, I sure haven’t seen it, and I would like to see that produced so I could see that. At this point, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS), my friend and colleague, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his amendment. This committee has been trying to seek out and remove impediments to speedy acquisition for years. Section 1662 of fiscal year 2015 NDAA is just such an impediment. I don’t understand why Congress believed it was prudent to let DOD’s testers prevent the Secretary of Defense from deploying military capability. Further, I do not agree with the contention that this amendment will further reduce oversight of the testing of missile defense capabilities. In fact, the plain language of the amendment inserts ballistic missile defense systems into the existing title 10 DOD OT&E testing requirement, just like every other DOD acquisition program. This is literally where the socalled ‘‘fly before you buy’’ term comes from. Every year, we already receive another report from DOD OT&E on the testing of ballistic missile defense, and then there is the Integrated Master Test Program that MDA and DOD OT&E collaborate on. And then, finally, the GAO does a report, also, that helps Congress oversee BMD programs. How many reports do we need to do the same thing? Especially when North Korea is making unprecedented progress on its ballistic missile capability, we should be making MDA more efficient and nimble, and I think removing redundant reporting requirements and impediments on the deployment of proven capabilities is a commonsense step. Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chairman, this Congress in 2015 passed this requirement because it made sense. Institutional memory can be short. The MDA is already exempt from normal Pentagon acquisition processes. No one in this body should think that MDA is subjected to the DOD 5000 regular acquisition rules. What this amendment would do would be to shortcircuit that process. And which Member of this House in either party would want to admit to the constituency that they represent that they voted to allow missiles to be purchased by this country before we knew they would work? The threat is real, and we need to be prepared for that threat and we need defense missiles that work. Already the shot doctrine is several to one. We have to shoot up four missiles and hope that we can stop the one from coming over. We need things that actually work better than that. We need to make sure this equipment that the U.S. taxpayer is buying functions correctly. We have already expedited the acquisition process for the MDA. Let’s not expedite it further. If our missile defenses don’t work, we are all in trouble. The Congress decided wisely and rightly in 2015. The MDA, as I say, does not support this amendment. They have had ample opportunity to come to us and say that they want more flexibility, more freedom, they want things that work too. This House should want things that work. So I urge my colleagues to support what works and oppose this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. How much time does each side have? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado has 2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Tennessee has 1
1⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, as my colleagues know, just one successful ballistic missile attack on U.S. territory 
or forward deployed forces or allies would carry an enormous cost of life and treasure. I am pleased that we are finally making some real progress in this bill at funding missile defense programs that have been underfunded for years. General John Hyten, who is in charge of missile defense, said recently: ‘‘What really worries me the most is I’m worried that our Nation won’t be able to go fast enough to keep up with our adversaries anymore.’’ He argues that we need to empower our engineers with the authority and responsibility so they can go faster. We have the greatest minds at the Missile Defense Agency. They are motivated people that serve our country every day when they come into work. We just need to let them do their job. But we must not let outdated, duplicative bureaucratic requirements keep us from defending ourselves from ballistic missile threats. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which would free the Missile Defense Agency to move faster to defend us from future threats. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chairman, I know this amendment comes late in the process and my colleagues are tired of hearing all these National Defense Authorization Act amendments, but this one is really important. Already the North Koreans threaten the United States. Other countries could do so. We need to make sure that our missile defense works, and our constituents will not accept excuses. Now, as I say, defense contractors love this approach if they can sell us something that is not proven to work, but this equipment must work. b1900 This Congress got it right in 2015. The MDA is on board with the testing that they have to do. The process now works. Let’s not change it, and this amendment would change it for the worse. It would be a defense contractor’s dream. Let’s not cave in to the lobbyists, let’s not give away the American taxpayers’ money, and let’s make sure that the defense equipment we buy works. By stopping this amendment, we will do so. This amendment would be a giveaway to the defense contracting industry. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COOPER ), my colleague. He is very sincere in what he says. I believe we have so many checks and balances that we will not be buying things that don’t work. But, we need to unshackle MDA so they can get their job done faster and better than they can right now. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Tennessee has 15 seconds remaining. Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chairman, Admiral Syring has been a great leader of MDA. He did not request this change. Admiral Syring has done a great job. Let’s follow his lead, and let’s reject this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado will be postponed.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST), a combat veteran. Mr. MAST. Mr. Chairman, I rise today because veteran suicide is an epidemic. Nearly every week, I hear from a veteran who is thinking about taking their own life—maybe walking into their garage, turning on their car, and never coming out. That is why I introduced the Oath of Exit, and why I urge you to pass this bill as a part of the National Defense Authorization Act. The bill creates a voluntary operation oath for members of the Armed Forces with a specific aim of reducing veteran suicide. The idea for this bill came from friends of mine who have struggled with suicidal thoughts since leaving the military—people like my friend Boone; people who have actually been there on the edge. I think we all know that, throughout our lives, the most important commitments that we make are spoken— 
whether it is an oath upon joining the military, the vows at our wedding, or saying the Pledge of Allegiance—and this verbal commitment to reach out to a brother or sisterinarms is important, as well. Mr. Chairman, integrity is more than a word to a servicemember. So, if we commit that we will reach out to a brother or a sister because we need help, then we will do it. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSONCOLEMAN ). Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. SMITH for including my amendment en bloc and for allowing me to speak on it today. Mr. Chairman, among the amendments under consideration in this en bloc measure is one that I have authored to address various challenges to the Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve sexual assault prevention and response programs. While sexual assault among our Active Duty forces has been a frequent topic of discussion, I rise today to draw attention to the same issue that remains just as prevalent within our Reserve component forces. More than half a million members currently serve in the Army Guard and Reserve. Hundreds of incidents of sexual assault are reported each year, and it is estimated that several hundred more go unreported. The Reserve components of the Army continue to suffer from staffing imbalances, poor budget management, and slow investigations that delay access to care for hundreds of sexual assault victims. My amendment directs the Department of Defense to take steps to address these issues. Sexual violence is a criminal behavior, and it has no place in our military. We must regain the trust of the servicemembers, who have been brave enough to come forward to report those crimes, by bettering our military justice system. Congress has a responsibility to protect the servicemembers who make immeasurable sacrifices to serve and protect our country. We must foster a system that encourages servicemembers to seek help and care, and that protects the very people who keep our Nation safe. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Washington and the gentleman from Texas for their leadership, making their way through a very important action on behalf of the American people, and that is the defense authorization. I thank them for the amendments that were made en bloc, and I hope to speak quickly about these important amendments. I am very grateful. Over the years, I have consistently introduced the triple negative breast cancer amendment because of the many women in the United States military who benefit from the research necessary. My amendment authorizes and encourages increased collaboration between the DOD and the National Institutes of Health regarding combating triple negative breast cancer. It has a particular impact on AfricanAmerican women, but it impacts White women, Hispanic women, and others, as well. This is a serious illness that affects between 10 to 17 percent of female breast cancer patients and is more likely to cause death. My amendment would help to save lives. I am delighted because this would impact ActiveDuty women, as well as veterans; but, in particular, ActiveDuty women with testing. It affects women under 50 years of age, and, therefore, women who would be in the United States military. I am very grateful for the acceptance of the South Sudan amendment. My amendment directs the Department of Defense to prepare contingency plans to assist relief organizations and delivery of humanitarian assistance efforts in South Sudan and to engage in consultation with South Sudan military counterparts to deescalate conflict. Famine in South Sudan has been created by conflict. On February 20, 2017, famine was declared formally in two counties of Unity State. 100,000 people will be in jeopardy of dying from famine. It has come about between the conflicts between the President and his former Chief of Staff, or his former Vice President. We need to have the engagement to save lives, and I thank the support for this amendment. Likewise, the North Korean ICBMs. As I was in Europe, during the Fourth of July, my amendment, in particular, supports upholding the goals of the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and under water; addresses the fact that our Nation should take the next step in preparing for a nuclear North Korea; and establishes that the stakes may be far greater. We have all been discussing the question of North Korea and ICBMs. We have to be studious in assessing it. Let me also say, however, that I am disappointed that the amendment dealing with the AUMF on North Korea did not get in. I believe it is an important issue that we must be concerned about. I want to continue to work with the committee on PTSD and ensuring that, even though authorized, more funding can come. I had asked for $2.5 million. And then I want to indicate the importance of recognizing, in light of the large footprint that Russia now has in its effort to undermine the democracy in this country, that we be very concerned about recruitment of college students by foreign agents. I had an amendment for us to be concerned about that. I look forward to working with the committee. I plan to introduce this as legislation because a young man by the name of Glenn Shriver, an outstanding college student, majoring in international relations at a college in Michigan, while doing a study abroad in China, developed an interest in Chinese culture, and he was sought after by the Chinese. I also want to work with the committee on addressing the question of elections for our soldiers. And, finally, I want to make sure that we stop cyber attacks by foreign entities into our elections. But, I am asking support for my amendment on the Korea ICBMs, the TripleNegative Breast Cancer, and the support of helping humanitarian aid get to South Sudan. Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member and chairman, and I ask support for my amendments. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman THORN BERRY and Ranking Member S MITH for shep herding this legislation to the floor and for their devotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces who risk their lives to keep our nation safe. I especially wish to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for including Jackson Lee Amendment No. 56 in the Chairman’s En Bloc Amendment to H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018. This Jackson Lee Amendment authorizes and encourages increased collaboration between the DOD and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer. ‘‘Triple Negative Breast Cancer’’ is a term used to describe breast cancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, and do not have an excess of the ‘‘HER2’’ protein on their cell membrane of tumor cells. This makes commonly used test and methods to detect breast cancer not as effective. This is a serious illness that effects between 10–17 percent of female breast cancer patients and this condition is more likely to cause death than the most common form of breast cancer. Seventy percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast cancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed. The Jackson Lee Amendment will help to save lives. TNBC disproportionately impacts younger women, African American women, Hispanic/ Latina women, and women with a ‘‘BRCA1C genetic mutation, which is also prevalent in Jewish women. TNBC usually affects women under 50 years of age and makes up more than 30 percent of all breast cancer diagnoses in African American. African American women are far more susceptible to this dangerous subtype than white or Hispanic women. The collaboration between the Department of Defense and NIH to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer can support the development of multiple targeted therapies for this devastating disease. A Triple negative breast cancer is a specific strain of breast cancer for which no targeted treatment is available. The American Cancer Society calls this particular strain of breast cancer ‘‘an aggressive subtype associated with lower survival rates.’’ 
Triple negative breast cancer is a term used to describe breast cancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, and do not have an excess of the HER2 protein on their cell membrane of tumor cells. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control predicted that year 26,840 black women would be diagnosed with TNBC. The overall incidence rate of breast cancer is 10 percent lower in African American women than white women. African American women have a five year survival rate of 78 percent after diagnosis as compared to 90 percent for white women. The incidence rate of breast cancer among women under 45 is higher for African American women compared to white women. Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells account for between 13 percent and 25 percent of all breast cancer in the United States and are usually of a higher grade and size, are more aggressive and more likely to metastasize, and onset at a much younger age. Currently, 70 percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast cancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed. African American women are 3 times more likely to develop triplenegative breast cancer than white women. AfricanAmerican women have prevalence TNBC of 26 percent versus 16 percent in non AfricanAmericans women. AfricanAmerican women are more likely to be diagnosed with larger tumors and more advanced stages of breast cancer. Currently there is no targeted treatment for TNBC exists. Breast cancers with specific, targeted treatment methods, such as hormone and gene based strains, have higher survival rates than the triple negative subtype, highlighting the need for a targeted treatment. Because there continues to be a need for research funding for biomarker selection, drug discovery, and clinical trial designs that will lead to the early detection of TNBC and to the development of multiple targeted therapies to treat this awful disease, the Jackson Lee Amendment is essential to paving a way for advancements in these areas. That is why I am pleased that Jackson Lee Amendment No. 56 has been included in the Chairman’s En Bloc Amendment and I urge all Members to join me in voting for its adoption. I also wish to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for including Jackson Lee Amendment No. 168 in the Chairman’s En Bloc Amendment to H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018. This Jackson Lee Amendment directs the Department of Defense to prepare contingency plans to assist relief organizations in delivery of humanitarian assistance efforts in South Sudan and to engage in consultation with South Sudan military counterparts to deescalate conflict. As a member of the South Sudan Caucus, and the sponsor of H.R. 48, the ‘‘Equal Rights and Access for the Women of South Sudan Act,’’ I have long advocated and supported emergency assistance to South Sudan, the world’s newest nation, located in the center of Africa and bordered by six countries. Such emergency assistance is desperately needed now to respond to the famine in South Sudan. On February 20, 2017 famine was declared formally in two counties of Unity State, which is located in the northern region of South Sudan. The United Nations currently estimates that more than 100,000 people in two Unity State counties are directly affected by the famine. In addition, food security experts are concerned that famine will spread. According to expert analyses, in the absence of urgent humanitarian action, as many as 4.9 million South Sudanese, about 4o percent of the country’s population, face the grim and certain prospect of starvation. In 1998 the region suffered from a famine spurred by civil war and approximately 70,000 to several hundred thousand people died during that famine. Although South Sudan has previously experienced widespread food insecurity, the present famine crisis is different because it is almost entirely manmade. South Sudan is rich in oil, but following decades of civil war it is also one of the least developed regions on earth—only 15 percent of its citizens own a mobile phone and there are very few tarmac roads in an area larger in land mass than Spain and Portugal combined. This makes the Nile River, which flows through regional centers, an important transport and trade route. Since South Sudan overwhelmingly voted to break away from Sudan in 2011, the government’s main concern has been to get oil flowing following disagreements with the regime in Khartoum. There have been a few small armed rebellions, border clashes and deadly cattle feuds but these have all taken place far from the capital city of Juba. Signs of friction within the governing party, Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM), came when President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, the country’s largest group, fired his deputy Riek Machar, who is from the second largest tribe, the Nuer. President Kiir believes Mr. Machar was behind a coup plot to oust him and seize power. Mr. Machar denies the accusations, but has publicly criticized Mr. Kiir for failing to tackle corruption and vowed to challenge President Kiir for leadership of the SPLM. It is not clear what led to the breach in their relationship but what started out as a political squabble has escalated into ethnic violence. The loyalties of the South Sudan army are divided with each of the principals commanding significant military support and forces loyal to each man have clashed around the country. And some of the most intense fighting has taken place in areas where famine is most severe. Compounding matters, South Sudan is awash with guns after decades of conflict and there is a history of ethnic tension for politicians to exploit if they believe that could help them gain, or remain in, power. Complicating this situation is the fact that while the Government of South Sudan has reportedly promised access to the most atrisk areas, humanitarian organizations remain unable to provide vital food, water and shelter in many locations. The actions of South Sudan Government in prohibiting humanitarian assistance from getting to starving communities has undermined the most proactive attempts by the United States and others to address what has now become a famine. The Jackson Lee Amendment directs the Department of Defense to prepare contingency plans to assist relief organizations delivering humanitarian assistance and consult with South Sudan’s military leaders to deescalate intraparty conflict, put petty disputes aside, and to put the wellbeing of the South Sudan people first. Mr. Chair, let me conclude by observing that while bringing an end to the civil war and humanitarian relief the faminestricken in South Sudan must be our first order of business, it is also very important to note that all of us who worked to secure its independence want the country to succeed and become a productive and constructive member of the community of nations. That is why I have reintroduced the ‘‘Equal Rights and Access for the Women of South Sudan Act’’ (H.R. 48), which promotes the human rights of women in South Sudan as the country transitions to a longterm government and to ensure women enjoy the right to participate fully in the political and economic life of the country. Despite its newly won independence women in South Sudan continue to face brutal violations of their human rights. A lack of infrastructure as well as gender inequality has the potential to regress much of the progress that has been made in South Sudan. Such a lack of human development factors only furthers the marginalization of women in South Sudan. The ‘‘Equal Rights and Access for the Women of South Sudan Act’’ puts equal rights and access for the women of South Sudan at the forefront by: 1. Encouraging the appointment of women to high level positions within Republic of South Sudan Government; 2. Ensuring that a significant portion of United States development, humanitarian, and relief assistance is channeled to local and United Statesbased South Sudanese organizations, particularly South Sudanese women’s organizations; 3. Providing longterm financial assistance for primary, secondary, higher, nontraditional, and vocational education for South Sudanese girls, women, boys, and men; 4. Providing financial assistance to build health infrastructure and deliver 
highquality comprehensive health care programs, including primary, maternal, child, reproductive, and mental health care; 5. Requiring military training regarding the protection, rights, and particular needs of women and emphasizing that violations of women’s rights are intolerable and should be prosecuted; and 6. Taking all necessary steps to ensure that internally displaced South Sudanese women are directly receiving food aid, shelter, relief supplies, and other services from United Statessponsored programs. Mr. Chair, as a nation, we should support the Republic of South Sudan in its efforts to become a freer, more equitable society that respects, supports, and endorses the rights of women. That is why I am pleased that Jackson Lee Amendment No. 168 has been included in the Chairman’s En Bloc Amendment and I urge all Members to join me in voting for its adoption. Mr. Chair, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee Amendment No. 83, as designated by the Rule governing debate on H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018. This Jackson Lee Amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to develop measures to defend against deployment of nuclear ICBMs by North Korea to protect against damage or destruction of satellites critical to U.S national defense and global communications, International Space Station, and other vital assets. I request the support of my colleagues for this Jackson Lee Amendment because it: upholds the goals of the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and underwater; addresses the fact that our nation should take the next step in preparing for a nuclear North Korea; establishes that the stakes may be far greater than a nuclear North Korea when they may have the capacity to launch a device using an ICBM, because of our nation’s dependence on the global telecommunications infrastructure that includes Geostationary satellites as well as its implications for Space Stations and our space program; and may have serious consequences for a range of environmental factors that are critical to the health and wellbeing of our planet. On July 4th, our nation’s Independence Day, the U.S. confirmed that North Korea had achieved a major step toward its objective of delivering a nuclear weapon as far as U.S. shores. This test represents a new escalation of the threat that a nuclear North Korea poses to the United States and our interest. The launch of Hwasong–14 missile reached a range of approximately 4160 miles, a distance capable of reaching Alaska, according to experts. The timing of this test launch was confirmed as a calculated insult when North Korean Leader Kim JungUn stated that the missile was a ‘‘gift to Americans for the July 4th Anniversary.’’ The United States must attempt to manage this situation and retain the peace in the region. We understand the end to the Korean War was a Armistice Agreement signed in 1953, that put into place a cease fire. North Korea still views itself as being at war with the United States. Otto Warmbier, an American college student who died days following his release from a North Korean prison was held as a prisoner of war. Given the unstable nature of the North Korean government, which has political purges in recent years that included members of North Korean President’s Kim Jongun’s family we can hold little hope for cooperation that is essential to avoid unintended conflicts and reduce tensions with its neighbors. A nucleararmed North Korea does not mean that country will be able to shoulder the burden of managing a responsible nuclear weapons program, given their single minded pursuit of a nuclear armed ICBM. Nuclear arms programs are not always safe or easy for the nation attempting to develop weapons. The United States had its share of near disasters. For example, in 1961, a B–52 Stratofortress carrying two 4–megaton Mark 39 nuclear bombs broke up in midair, dropping its nuclear payload in the process over North Carolina. Fortunately, neither bomb detonated averting a catastrophic nuclear incident at our own hands. North Korea’s program poses a danger to the entire Korean Peninsula, Japan, and the Asia Pacific region because it insists on using the world as its nuclear testing ground. Even if an unarmed ICBM should land in a populated area, this could trigger a conflict. If North Korea decides to test nuclear weapons on its ICBM rockets this poses serious problems for peace and stability not only that region of the world, but the United States as well. Since the entry of the space age, America has lead and we now rely on the fruits of our investments in manned and unmanned missions to support a global telecommunications infrastructure; a permanent research presence in the International Space Station; plans for going much further. A nuclear North Korea armed with ICBMs can put all of that in jeopardy. We also have interest in the environment within our atmosphere, but also the physical environment that envelopes the earth. One component of the earth’s space environment that protects against solar radiation is called the Van Allen Belts. The Van Allen belts present another factor to be considered when talking about North Korea’s nuclear program. The Van Allen belts may respond to incoming solar radiation and is known to change size. The primary benefit to people on earth is they protect us from solar radiation. Should North Korea’s tests of ICBM include nuclear devices of significant size this could pose risks to not only our satellites, space stations, but extend to the Van Allen Belts. This Jackson Lee amendment allows for a deliberative approach to addressing the potential for a nuclear North Korea. This amendment works to develop plans to develop effective countermeasures to the threat that North Korea’s nuclear program presents. I ask that my Colleagues join me in support of this Amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER ). Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support my bipartisan amendment, introduced with Representative GOTTHEIMER and Representative SINEMA . This amendment would expand opportunities for ActiveDuty military men and women to learn career skills and provide education that would assist them as they transition back to civilian life. The current United Services Military Apprenticeship Program is an effective program that provides this employer specific training. But, that program is only offered to the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, which is less than half of our uniformed services personnel. This amendment expands the program to offer it to any member of U.S. uniformed services—Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Public Health Service. We should make it easier for these brave men and women who have served to transition to civilian life with a steady job, and, at the same time, infuse our workforce with the strong leadership skills that the military can provide. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER ). Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Washington for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to voice my support for my amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. Our men and women in uniform are not immune from the epidemic of opioid addiction, an abuse that is ravaging our country. In fact, the National Institutes of Health reports opioid misuse are higher among servicemembers than among civilians, due to the use of these drugs to treat the symptoms of PTSD and chronic pain. Our brave servicemembers have earned our gratitude and deserve our highest quality of care. We need to do all we can to ensure our military doctors are equipped with the most upto 
date, best practices to help fight back against this disease. This amendment requires medical professionals in the Department of Defense that prescribe opioids for pain management to undertake 12 hours of training every 3 years in order to prevent overprescribing and better identify and treat abuse. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense amendment to ensure that our ActiveDuty military get the medical care they truly deserve. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM ). Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment, which encourages partnerships between the DOD, DOE, and the private sector, to facilitate the licensure, transfer, and commercialization of innovative technologies. We cannot let groundbreaking research and new technologies in our Nation’s Federal laboratories sit idle when they have the potential to reenergize domestic manufacturing, create highpaying jobs, and transform our economy. It is not government or private sector, it is government and private sector working together to create opportunities that have led to the development of many products in the marketplace today, including batteries powering electric vehicles, internet servers, and GPS. Both the DOD and DOE have separate programs that support technology transfer to the private sector, but they don’t work very well together. My amendment would fix that and ensure that these departments are actively collaborating to support the commercialization of cuttingedge technologies and make them more widely available to American businesses and consumers. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues’ support. b1915 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I urge adoption of the amendments en bloc. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I, too, urge adoption of the amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, my amendment is similar to an amendment of mine that passed the House 243–180 in the FY2017 NDAA. This amendment mirrors language that I have introduced called the SEND Act. While the Department of Homeland Security—not the Department of Defense—is tasked with maintaining the safety of our southern border, it has long received help and assistance from the DOD and our military. One of the ways the DOD helps the border patrol is through the transfer of equipment it deems ‘‘excess’’ to its needs. Under current law, the transfer of this ‘‘excess’’ equipment already gives preference to counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border security activities. My amendment simply takes that preference a step further, giving border security preference for a few specific pieces of equipment which are particularly useful for border security applications: unmanned surveillance vehicles including Aerostat blimps, nightvision goggles, and Humvees. The border patrol is the first and last line of defense against those criminal gangs. In my home state of Texas, and in other border states like New Mexico and Arizona, the war against the cartels is an ongoing affair. Cartels are involved in labor and sex slavery. Just last week in Southern Texas, border patrol agents raided a home to find 37 illegal immigrants, including three children. These men, women and children were being held by cartel drug runners for ransom. I’ve been to the border countless times, Mr. Chair. I’ve spoken with the men and women who have sworn to protect the good folks of Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico from the dangerous people who cross the southern border. A Texas Ranger told me that they are outmanned, outgunned, outfinanced and out equipped by the drug cartels. I’ve heard firsthand the need these men and women have for new equipment, specifically the equipment I just listed. In fact when I recently visited the border in April, I met with the Border Patrol in the Rio Grande sector and they informed me that in areas where they were using Aerostat surveillance blimps, crossings were way down. When asked what we could do to help the sector, the answer was clear: More Aerostat blimps. Well, that is what we are trying to do here with this amendment, Mr. Chair. This idea isn’t new. In 2010, with our help, the excess equipment program sent 6 excess military Humvees to Texas Border Sheriffs. Often, before this transfer, the border sheriffs were forced to chase the drug cartels in Crown Victorias. This amendment mandates that DOD give border security applicants an additional preference for the equipment listed in this amendment. I’ve heard from our agents down on the border and this is the equipment they need. Let’s put this ‘‘excess’’ equipment to use on the southern border in the war against the drug cartels and help bring security, peace of mind, and more safety to those Americans living in the area. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. MARSHALL ). The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, this en bloc package consists of a variety of amendments from Members from both sides of the aisle. I believe that they deserve the support of the House. I recommend adoption of the en bloc package. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I agree with the chairman. I support the en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. SMUCKER ) having assumed the chair, Mr. MARSHALL , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2810) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege and honor to address you here from the floor of the House of Representatives in this great deliberative body that has been deliberating all day long in the markup of the National Defense Authorization Act. The work that is done, especially by the members of the Armed Services Committee, goes deeply into the destiny and the future of America. They have to look at the whole globe and the whole budget, and they have to look at the equipment that is out there and the technology that is developing, and it is a heavy responsibility to present this NDAA authorization bill to the floor. Often, there are efforts that are made to turn it into a political bill, rather than the bill that can defend America, and ensure that we have the best military that the world has ever seen, and the best equipment for the best military the world has ever seen, and the best standards to uphold the best people, the nobility of the United States military. So I want to compliment especially the members of the committee and the chairman for his work and the work that has been done here on this floor. They are going to take a deep breath and tomorrow will bring this thing back to the floor for a vote and a potential final passage. I came to the floor to address a bit different topic, and I may revert back to the NDAA, and I actually intend to do that, Mr. Speaker. But I have wanted to come to this floor for some time to discuss the circumstances going on here in the United States of America and an issue that has been very important to me for a long time; and that is the issue of the United States of America getting to the point where we finally declare a language, our English language, as the official language of the United States. I sat down once, and I went through the—when we had the World Book Encyclopedia, before the internet, more or less, eroded the ubiquitousness— that means everywhere—the World Book Encyclopedia was everywhere in the country and many places in the world. I looked through—I took a 1979 almanac, and I looked at all the flags for all the countries in the world, and I looked up every single country to find out, do they have an official language, or don’t they? And from that 1979 almanac, and some of the countries have changed since then, but every single country in the world had an official language, at least one of them, except for the United States of America. As I studied this, and it comes to me, the more I look at history, the more I look at the forces that move the world and the people in it, often it is the culture; it is the cultural foundation that moves policy in America, and in every country in the world. The culture lives in the hearts and minds of its people; and what is in the hearts and minds of its people is, if you are members of a nation state, what binds us together is having a common experience, a common cause, common enemies, perhaps, a common sense of history, a common sense of struggle, a common sense of economic ties, and also, a common language. A common language is the most powerful unifying force anywhere in the world throughout all of history, even more powerful than religion, and religion is a very powerful unifying force, and sometimes it can be a dividing force. But of those powerful unifying forces we have, it might be race, it might be ethnicity, it might be national origin, it can be those things. It could be religion, but all of these components go together to make your culture, and the binding force that we have proven in this country over and over and over again is the common language. Some years ago, just one floor down, out that door, I sat down with several ambassadors to the United States from Israel, and I remarked to them that they had established Hebrew as their official language in 1954. The country was approved by the motion in the United Nations in 1948, and 6 years later, the Israelis established Hebrew as their official language. I asked them: Why did you do that? Hebrew was a dead language. It was essentially a language only of prayer for 2,000 years. But they resurrected that language and decided we are going to make it the common form of communications currency in Israel in order to bind the Israelis together. And so they did. They deployed the Hebrew language in the streets of Israel. In fact, there weren’t any streets in Tel Aviv at the time. They created Tel Aviv also as a manufactured city to add to the glory of Israel. But as the people walked in the streets, they decided we are going to embrace this language of Hebrew. So it is today the language of the Israeli people, Hebrew. Why did you do that? And their answer to me was: We looked at the United States. We knew we were going to be assimilating people from many countries in the world, maybe even all countries in the world, and they would come from all races, all ethnicities, all national origins, coming back because—primarily they were attracted back because they were of Jewish faith, many of them by Jewish blood and heritage; but they came into Israel, and they needed to be bound together as Israelis. And the best way to bind them together—these are smart people—was a common language. And a common language that was unique was helpful, also. It gave them the distinction and the pride that they would have of the nationalism of being Israelis. And so Hebrew became the official language of the fresh new nation state Israel just 6 years after it was formed. I was not astonished by that, but I was very impressed by the wisdom that they used to apply the necessity of a common language to bind them together so that they could be one people. I went there, and I traveled, and I looked at what they were doing. They had brought in several hundred people from Ethiopia to come into the Israeli society, and they get 6 months to study Hebrew and to be assimilated into the broader Israeli economy. Those who come to Israel that are not literate in their own language, they first had to teach them to read and write in the language that was native to them, their natural language, and then they taught them Hebrew and converted them into being able to read and write and speak in Hebrew. But they got 6 months to do that, and then out into the world they went. That is a pretty fast assimilation process. But I don’t know if there is a country since, other than the United States, that has done a better job of assimilating people from everywhere in the world into one society than has happened in Israel. Mr. Speaker, I would say that I never, ever hear anybody talk about divisions within Israelis. I don’t hear them speaking, well, you are an African Israeli or a German Israeli or a Russian Israeli. There are a lot of them, but they see themselves as Israelis. They have a common language, common culture, and they are pulled together out of a need to have a common defense and a common cause. 
That is the model that they created by looking at the model of the United States of America because we had been so successful in assimilating people into this country and binding us together by having a common language; that common language, a common form of communications currency that allows us to communicate with every American everywhere, to walk into any city council meeting, any county supervisor’s meeting, any State legislature, any discussions that go on here in the House, in the Senate, any meetings that go on within the government buildings in the Federal and the State and the political subdivisions thereof. All of our meetings take place in English. Anybody that speaks English can walk in there and understand them. That is the policy that brought us together as a people. That is the policy that was so admired by the Israelis that they emulated it. Yet we sit here still the only country in the world, by the measure that I described, of the World Book Encyclopedia and the 1979 almanac, at least, the only country in the world that doesn’t have at least one official language. We have a common language that is English. We need to make our official language English, and, of course, I have introduced legislation, Mr. Speaker, to do that. It is H.R. 997; it has been H.R. 997 since I came to this Congress, and one day we are going to see a President sign that bill, and it might very well be this President we have today, President Trump. He has spoken in favor of official English, and I certainly agree with him on this. But it is more than this. When President Bill Clinton introduced the executive order, I believe it is 13166—and I am operating from a dusty memory here. Perhaps I have got it on a note. But let’s go with 13166. That executive order directed that any government facility that is there needs to accommodate any language request that comes from anybody who walks into a Federal building or a State building or any government service. It just runs up the cost of our government in an unnecessary way. The idea, I suppose, is, well, we are going to make it easy for people who have trouble understanding English; and so if we do that, eventually they will pick up and learn and understand English, and they will assimilate into society because, after all, every other generation, every other people that has come into America has assimilated into our society. b1930 But when you change the rules and you change the format and you take away the incentive, then you can’t expect to have the same result. And how it was, was that people were brought into this country and they were immersed into the American culture and the American civilization. For example, my grandmother came to the United States from Germany and she spoke only German. My father went to school, kindergarten—one of seven siblings altogether, number three in line—speaking German. He was quite confused on his first day of kindergarten, even though ‘‘kindergarten’’ is a German word. And when he came home from school that day, he walked into the house and said ‘‘hello’’ to his mother in German. My grandmother, his mother, Freda Catrina Johanna Harm King, said to her son: Emmett, speaking German in this household is for you from now on verboten. I came here to become an American. That means speaking English, and you will go to school and learn English, and you will bring it home and you will teach it to me. So my father had spoken his last words of German in that household, and he went to school and learned English, and he brought it home and taught it to his mother, and she learned English from her son and her sons, but primarily my father. That was an expression of gratitude to the country that had embraced her and welcomed her, and she embraced this country, the United States of America. And of the six sons that she raised and a daughter, one of the sons was physically unable to serve, four of the remaining five went back to fight against the fatherland. And my father went to the South Pacific for 2
1⁄2years to fight the Japanese, and came home weighing 115 pounds on U.S. rations with a lot of stories that he never told. That was the way she thanked the host country, the United States of America. And there I sat growing up in a small town in Iowa being told: You hit the jackpot, Steve. You were born into the greatest country on the face of the Earth. You could not have been born anyplace better than this. The United States of America is the greatest country in the world, and you need to pay back this country that so welcomed the people that have come here. Well, I want to continue to do that by tying together our society and our civilization, knitting us together, and English is the very best way to do that. We can eliminate the billions of dollars that we are unnecessarily spending by proliferating other languages within our government. I think it is important that people learn multiple languages. It is important, especially in this world that we are in today where we have got so much foreign trade and so much foreign travel and so many foreign visitors into this country. I do a significant amount of travel myself. But to try to promote other languages to be spoken on the streets of America or confuse our students by catering to the language that is the language of their home rather than the language of the streets, then we end up with ethnic enclaves and people that really don’t embrace the American culture and the American civilization. I was quite struck by the book that was written by Winston Churchill called ‘‘A History of the English Speaking Peoples.’’ I carefully read through that book forward and back. It took me quite a while to get through it carefully. I absorbed it and soaked it up. When I finished the book, I remember it was about 1:30 in the morning, and I looked up at the ceiling, and I thought: Huh. Wherever the English speaking peoples have gone, by reading Churchill’s book, freedom has accompanied the English language. How did that happen? The concept of freedom is carried by the English language all over the world. And if you look where the British have gone, as far away as India where they taught English, and you look at the African continent where the English language has been established, you see that freedom is more likely to be found in the English speaking peoples than of any other speaking peoples on the planet. Is that some kind of coincidence? Or is there something about our language that carries freedom with it? Or is it about the people that carry the language that understand the concept of Godgiven liberty, and then they transport that Godgiven liberty and that freedom to the countries that they are settling, that they are contributing technology and science and medicine and literature and academics to and economy to? I think it is a couple of things. One is the British had enough confidence in their culture and their civilization to export it to the rest of the world. And we as Americans, up until the last generation or so, have had enough confidence in our culture and civilization to export it to the rest of the world. And the rest of the world has embraced our values, and we have seen it happen over and over again. I point out Ataturk in Turkey, who, for 40 years, moved Turkey to the West, and the prosperity in the nation state of Turkey improved the closer they got to the West. I recall seeing pictures recently in Afghanistan from the 1960s, when the women wore Western clothing and there was a lot more civility in Afghanistan and more prosperity in Afghanistan. I sat with the son of the Shah of Iran just a couple of months ago, and we had an engaging conversation. We have met several times along the way throughout the years. His father, the Shah, was moving Iran to the West. The women were uncovered; they wore Western clothes, and their education was accelerated, and they were moving into the Western world, and they had significantly more prosperity than they have today. Part of that was English language, part of that was culture, part of it is the Western civilization that we are. But we wouldn’t have a Western civilization if we didn’t have an English language that helps to tie that together. And the Western civilization itself is rooted in the real estate where 
the very footprint of Christianity laid the foundation for civilization, and most times it is the English language that is part of that, that ties that together. And where it doesn’t exist, they have more troubles than where it does exist. So I tip my hat to Winston Churchill for the wisdom that came together in his book. I want to reiterate, Mr. Speaker, that he never wrote that the English language took freedom to the rest of the world. He just wrote about the history of what happened to the rest of the world when the English speaking peoples engaged themselves with the rest of the world. However, there is another intellect from the United Kingdom, Daniel Hannan. Daniel Hannan is a member of the European Parliament. He has written a book that goes even deeper and takes a bigger bite out of this. He says that, as a member of the European Parliament, he will put his earphones on to listen to the interpreted versions as they are using different language. By the way, English is the official language of the European Union, and he has an understanding and he is at least, I will say, at a minimum, marginally fluent in multiple languages. And as he listened to the interpreters interpret into other languages, he would take that earphone back away from him and he would listen to the language they were using, and then he would hear the interpretation in the other ear. He said that what he learned was that other languages didn’t have the utility to express the concept of freedom that the English language has. I believe he is right on that. So our concept of freedom and liberty, at least theoretically and by the theory of Daniel Hannan and my own, cannot be carried in any other language. And the English language does carry freedom. It expresses it like it can’t be expressed in any other language because our history goes back to the Magna Carta. By the way, the Romans, who laid the foundation for a republican form of government and the rule of law, had a significant imprint on what is the United Kingdom today, Old England, and the English language that emerged from that brought many of our values to us. If America had been formed by any other culture or any other civilization, any other language, we wouldn’t be the country we are today. We wouldn’t have the Declaration of Independence that we have. We are very unlikely to have this concept of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And we are very unlikely—and I will say it would be almost impossible—to conceive of a Bill of Rights that would give us the pillars of American exceptionalism, almost all of them packaged up in the Bill of Rights. This came from our history, our culture, the derivatives of Mosaic law, Greek age of reason, the Roman rule of law, the Roman republican form of government that flowed up into England and into other parts in Europe and came about over here to the United States of America at the dawn of the industrial revolution with unlimited natural resources, a concept of manifest destiny, a JudeoChristian foundation of beliefs and morality. America was a giant Petri dish that was formed by, I believe, the hand of God that shaped this Nation and the foundations of this Nation. I would defy anyone, challenge anyone to reverse engineer America and come up with a better product than we have today. But our principles, our values that came to us are essential to the future of our country as well. It is not just enough to look at our history and think—well, here is what some of my colleagues believe in, and I have trouble with that. They believe that society evolves, and this evolution of society can’t be reversed, it can’t be changed. It is essentially the product that comes because of time and technology and the force of human nature. So they are often looking at this on both sides of the aisle, but I just take some blame over here on the Republican side of the aisle, too, and they are kind of looking over their shoulder thinking: I am their leader. So I better get in front of this society and see where it is going because it is not going to revert back. The fundamental principles can be changed, too. Well, I disagree, Mr. Speaker. I think what was a sin 2,000 years ago is a sin today. Fundamental principles are fundamental principles. The pillars of American exceptionalism are the pillars of American exceptionalism; and if we mess with them, if we alter them, we better come up with a good and a strong argument about why we should change these pillars of American exceptionalism. We can’t just simply dish it off and say: Well, society has moved away from a man and a woman joined together in holy matrimony, so the family doesn’t matter anymore, or we can redefine it to be something else. We can’t just say, even though technology has proven without a doubt to us that human life begins at the moment of conception, that we can ignore that scientific fact and set aside the immorality of abortion and somehow our Nation is going to be blessed. We can’t ignore the idea that even though Adam Smith wrote his book on ‘‘The Wealth of Nations’’ published in, what a glorious year, 1776, and he laid out the fundamental principles of free enterprise that inspired this country and a world. We can’t just disregard those principles and decide that, well, we can have now college students that reject free enterprise and embrace socialism and managed economies on the basis of what? On the basis of some kind of belief that free enterprise and capitalism victimizes people because some people get rich and other people don’t get so rich? You can be a socialist, you can be a Marxist, but you have to believe it is a zero sum game if you are one of those folks, and then you are about redistributing the wealth, but the wealth ends up in the hands of the elitists—the leftist elitists. And if you belive in free enterprise and a meritocracy, then you know that the pie gets bigger. The more people create, the bigger the pie gets. The bigger the pie gets, the more people are prosperous. It is an axiom for the world that when technology is invented and deployed, on average, it improves the standard of living of everybody. Some marginally, some not even noticeably, many a lot. But it moves the world into a modern place. How could we think that whatever we had for net assets, or let me say—well, that is fine. Whatever we had for net assets in the year 1900 are not the net assets that we had in the year 2000, and not the net assets we have in the year 2017. We didn’t have a lot of inventions in the year 1900 in comparison to what we have today. It was a smelly place, it was a dirty place, it was a dangerous place. There was no modern medicine. People died of diseases and the garbage got dumped out the windows, and the sewage ran in the streets, and we had invented the steam engine, and we were on the cusp of an airplane and a locomotive—well, we had locomotives by then. And we were on the cusp of airplanes and automobiles. b1945 Modern medicine hadn’t emerged. Pharmaceuticals hadn’t emerged. Surely, the internet had not. All of the technology that has been developed in the last century has made our efforts far more efficient. Back in the days when we were subsistence farmers and you had to spend 8, 10, 12 hours a day to try to raise a crop to feed you and your family and you had very little left to sell or to trade, our time was occupied with staying alive. I have a cousin who spent 8 years in Honduras near Tegucigalpa in the Peace Corps. He was struggling to try to get them to raise 10 bushels of corn per acre, and we were raising 100 bushels at home at the time. I said: ‘‘Jim, why don’t you bring some seed corn down there? Why don’t you bring some nitrogen fertilizer down there? What is the capability of that soil?’’ He said: ‘‘Oh, it is a 100bushel soil and 100bushel climate.’’ ‘‘Cannot you bring them into the modern world? That is what you are doing down there.’’ And his answer was: ‘‘No, my biggest task is to keep them from having to eat their seed corn.’’ Well, we moved along a lot faster in our society today. We have done genetic engineering, GMO products. We have gone from their 10 bushels an acre now to 300 bushels. We are on the way to 300bushel corn. We can feed 7 billion people on the planet, and we will be prepared to feed 9 billion people on the planet as well, Mr. Speaker. 
But technology has always moved us forward. It has always put us in a place where the standard of living for the world was improved, whether it was medicine, where not only our standard of living, our quality of life and the length of our life has been improved dramatically over the last couple of generations, or the technology that comes from this iPhone that is here, that has far more storage capacity and computer capacity in it than was in Apollo 13 that went to the Moon, and it saves us time. We communicate in real time. It has changed our lives. When I started my construction business, we all had to go in to eat lunch at noon, and we had 12 until 1 when we sat by the telephone and ate our lunch because that is when we communicated and reset our afternoon. We didn’t have any other way to communicate with each other other than to be by that landline phone. And when they rolled that landline phone out, maybe 40 years earlier or so, we were pretty happy to have that because we had to go talk to people facetoface to communicate. Now if you send out an email and it is one that needs an action on it, if you don’t get an answer back in 15, 20 minutes or 30 minutes, you think, well, that person is not a very good businessman or woman if they are not answering their email, they are not answering their texts. So now we make decisions on the fly. It is real time. Our efficiency is far much better because the communications are far much better. That is what has happened with technology. That is what has happened to move us into the modern era of the world. But we still have this thing that is culture and civilization. We still have this thing that is language. And I know that the argument has been made to me that one day we will just hold up our iPhone and someone who speaks another language, it will come back and it will be interpreted into our ears, and we will be able to understand what they say. And I think that will happen. I think that will happen, but I don’t think we should overvalue what that means. Because if we are going to walk around and listen to our iPhone even when we are looking at people facetoface and eyetoeye, and if there is a delay in the interpretation—and there will be that delay, that will last indefinitely— we still have those pieces of our culture and our civilization that are instantaneous. When people speak to us, we need to be able to hear and understand their voice inflections. We need to watch the body language and timing with the voice inflections. We need to pick up the slang and the vernacular that is used within the communities that we are. A nation needs to be able to do that in real time, instantaneously. And when we can do that, we are bound together and suspicion dissipates and unity comes together. That is why America needs to establish English as the official language, because it is our common language. We are extraordinarily blessed to have English as our common language, and we can eliminate, then, the billions of dollars that we spend as we hire interpreters, and we slow down our process. And if we establish English as the official language, we will accelerate the learning of our language all across this land. I mean, I don’t know why in the world Spanish is in the airport in LaGuardia, for example. That is a long ways away from any country that speaks Spanish, but that is up there in dual signs, in English and in Spanish as you walk through the LaGuardia Airport. As I am in a foreign country, I sometimes try to learn the language; and if they have got dual signs up there, I will try to read the sign to learn that other language while I am there. But I also know this: my eyes always revert to the language that I know and that I am comfortable with, and for me it is English. When we put multiple languages on our signs in this country, it just helps facilitate for people—it takes away their desire to learn a foreign language. And so I am a strong supporter of English as the official language, H.R. 997, and I urge its movement here—and cosponsorship is necessary, of course—to finally get a vote on English as the official language here in the floor of the House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, I spent 6 years on this project in the State of Iowa, and I brought it three different ways in three different general assemblies. And finally, in the last term that I was there, I was able to—well, I didn’t get to see the bill signed into law because the Governor wasn’t thrilled about the bill signing ceremony, but he signed it nonetheless, and it is the situation in Iowa and in nearly 30 States in this country that have adopted English as their official language. The bill that I have introduced here is a mirror of the bill that is now law in Iowa. We did have to sue once on it and litigate, but it was because the secretary of state was determined to violate the law. He got pulled back in order. Otherwise, there would have been no litigation on the legislation itself. It has happened smoothly, and it has been a useful utility. It saved money in the State of Iowa. It saved money in every State where English is the official language, and it is time for this Congress to adopt that a majority of the States have established English as the official language. I intend to continue beating this drum until such time as it becomes law, and at that point, then I will begin the celebration myself, Mr. Speaker. I was about to change subjects, but I will carry on for just a moment. I should also say that English is the language of success. Those who have developed proficiency in the English language do better than those who don’t. We are seeing people who are sometimes three generations into America without learning the official language. I recognize my friend from Tennessee has arrived and I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. JIMCOOPER. Mr. COOPER. I thank the gentleman from Iowa for yielding. 
Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may be permitted to revise my remarks, made during consideration of amendment No. 15 in the Committee of the Whole earlier today, beyond technical, grammatical, and typographical corrections. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MARSHALL ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. COOPER. I thank my friend from Iowa for yielding. Mr. KING of Iowa. Reclaiming my time, I am always happy to yield to the gentleman from Tennessee, and I appreciate his contribution to the United States Congress while I have served here, and each year that he has been here as well. Mr. Speaker, I would like to shift gears a little bit now and address the circumstances of the NDAA debate that has taken place. I want to express my disappointment with some of the decisions that were made, some of the votes on the amendments, and also decisions that came from the Rules Committee. Last year, in the authorization of the National Defense Authorization Act, I offered a number of amendments that were made in order, and I brought them here to the floor. We had a legitimate debate on those amendments, and I appreciate the ability to do that. But I also want to reiterate that this is a deliberative Congress, and Members have a right to be on this floor and to debate and to vote. The Rules Committee’s job is to make sure that that is in an orderly fashion, and I recognize that when you have well over 100 amendments that are offered, we could be here a long time if everyone debated those. I would also point out that there was a unanimous consent agreement that was negotiated here a little bit ago, and the chairman, Mr. THORNBERRY , made the unanimous consent request that the balance of the amendments that weren’t debated today would be approved en bloc. I supported that, and I verbally voted in support of it. That is a process that we do here. But the amendments that I offered before the Rules Committee, all four of them, every single one of them was turned down, even a couple of them that I offered last year that were debated here on the floor. The first one was an amendment, and it is this: ensuring that no funds under 
the NDAA would be used to enlist DACA aliens—Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals was how President Obama listed it—to ensure that no funds will be used to enlist illegal aliens into our military, including our DACA personnel, into the United States military when they only consider them through the MAVNI program, which is to try to find special skill sets that aren’t available in the United States. That is what the MAVNI program is about. But President Obama, I will say, distorted that program, Mr. Speaker, and he began to push the DACA recipients through there. Well, DACA is unconstitutional. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, as he named it, is unconstitutional. President Obama, 22 times, told the world that he didn’t have the constitutional authority to grant amnesty to people who came into America, at least allegedly, before they were 18 years old—22 times. The last time that I recall was at a high school here in Washington, D.C., which was only 2 or 3 weeks before he issued this policy, which was in September of 2014, to grant a quasi—and I will say an unconstitutional legal status to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Now, it has been my position, conviction, and belief that if we reward lawbreakers, we get more lawbreakers. And it was the conviction of President Obama that he didn’t have the constitutional authority to reward these lawbreakers. In his lecture to the high school students shortly before he implemented this policy, President Obama said: No, you are smart students. You know that there are three branches of government. Article I is the legislative branch; they pass the laws. Article II is the executive branch, which he headed at the time. They enforce the laws. Article III are the courts, and they interpret the laws. That is about as clear and concise as it gets. And President Obama was an adjunct professor who taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago. I would take issue with some of his constitutional interpretations, but I would not take issue with that one. He was right. He had no constitutional authority to award a de facto amnesty to people who attested that they were brought into this country maybe against their will, without their knowledge, or too young to be held accountable, to reward them with a path to citizenship. But that is what this NDAA legislation fails to do is to strike out this language that was implemented by President Obama in September of 2014 that rewards people who attest that they came into America illegally, committed the crime of unlawful entry into the United States, criminals who then stepped up into the military and applied to go into the military and took an oath to support and defend our Constitution after they broke our laws. They had to lie to get into the military, so they committed the crime of unlawful entry. They lied to get into the military, and then they took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Well, two of those three things are wrong at least. But did they mean it when they took the oath to support and defend the Constitution? Can you trust them if they violated our immigration laws and then lied about that in order to get into the military? This President set about rewarding those kind of lawbreakers, those criminals, by granting them a path to citizenship because they signed up in the military. I simply offered an amendment at the Rules Committee to be able to debate this on the floor of the House of Representatives so Congress could bring its considered judgment. Now, I have an oath that I have taken, and that is to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, too, Mr. Speaker. When I see a bill come before me that, on its face, rewards lawbreakers under a policy that is a constitutional violation, one that Secretary Kelly said as recently as this morning he doesn’t believe that the constitutionality of this can be upheld, and he doesn’t expect that the Justice Department is going to defend it, and he anticipates that there will be a suit that will be filed—and I will tell you the specific date is September 5— that I believe will successfully litigate and put an end to this DACA program. This Congress, every Member of this United States Congress has taken an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States—every one. And I don’t think there is a single one that stood there and had their fingers crossed behind their back as they took their oath and said: ‘‘Oh, unless I don’t like it, it makes me politically uncomfortable, or unless I have some sympathy for the people that might be facing the enforcement of this supreme law of the land, the Constitution of the United States.’’ b2000 They don’t get to cross their fingers behind their back and make an oath that they don’t mean. So when we take this oath—all 435 of us in the House and 100 of us in the Senate—we better mean it. We better believe what we say because we tell our constituents: You send me to Washington, D.C., send me to represent you in the United States Congress, and I will uphold the Constitution. That is the number one duty, to uphold the Constitution. Well, in this Constitution, to support and defend it, I tell you it requires the President to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and, under the Take Care Clause, take care that the laws are faithfully executed. That doesn’t mean kill off the law. It means enforce the law. The President has violated the Constitution. Now the Rules Committee denied the ability of the House of Representatives to strike this out of the policy that exists under the authorization now of the National Defense Authorization Act. They are asking me to vote for this bill even though it violates a principle that was encompassed in our oath and a principle that was encompassed in everyone’s oath. Not only did we not get to put these Members of Congress up on a vote and challenge them afterwards as to whether their conscience is clear and whether they meant it when they took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, we don’t get to have the debate. We don’t get to have the vote. So here is the National Defense Authorization Act all ready for a final passage to come to the floor tomorrow with unconstitutional components encompassed within it, that being something that Barack Obama 22 times said was unconstitutional, and we don’t even get a debate or a vote here on the floor of the House of Representatives. That is amendment No. 1, Mr. Speaker. That troubles me a lot. Second, a simple amendment that I brought last year ensuring that funds are not used to house UACs on military installations—unaccompanied alien children. When unaccompanied alien minors come into the United States illegally, they are violating Federal law. They are committing the crime of unlawful entry into the United States. They are facing up to 1 year in prison if we convict them and sentence them to the maximum of the law for one unlawful entry into the United States. We had a policy that existed under the Barack Obama administration to start to house them on our military bases. Our military bases are for our national security. They are not there to be babysitting for children who are under 18—so they say—to house them on those bases to weaken our defense capability and interrupt the process of our military. We need that amendment to clean up another mistake of the Obama administration, and it was denied by the Rules Committee. So we don’t get to have a debate. We could very well have an administration that just continues the old process going of housing unaccompanied alien minors—illegal aliens—on the bases in America consuming our military resources for something like that. I disagree. I don’t think they should be housed on our bases. By the way, we ought to be picking them up at the border and sending them back to the country they came from. That is what every other nation does or should do. Those that don’t are making colossal mistakes. I will try to stay out of what I think is going on in Europe today, but they are being subsumed by idiotic immigration policies. The next amendment that was denied by the Rules Committee was the Obamaera Executive Order 13672 that prohibits Federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender 
identity. It is just an unnecessary executive order, common decency, common courtesy. How do you discriminate against someone if you don’t know what their sexual orientation is and gender identity is? That has not been a problem out in this society. That executive order needed to be rescinded. We don’t get a debate or a vote on that executive order either. This is the amendment that I introduced. VICKY HARTZLER from Missouri, thankfully—I appreciate her bringing an amendment that was very similar to mine. My amendment ensured that no funds are used by the Department of Defense to force servicemen and women to undergo any kind of transgender sensitivity courses or to screen servicemembers regarding gender reassignment surgery. I will just couple it with discussion and debate on the Hartzler amendment. And that is this: that the United States military should not be used as an experiment. It shouldn’t be used to do a social experiment agenda. Yet, under the Obama administration, not only did they decide to put an end to Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, they set up an affirmative action program to promote people through the ranks who would assert their orientation to be different from heterosexual. Then we got into this national fixation on transgenderism. And the orders came down in to the Department of Defense through our Secretary of Defense that the American taxpayer—well, let’s just say we borrow money from China and Saudi Arabia to do sex reassignment surgery on people in our military? It is something that has never happened before without a vote or a debate here on the floor of the House of Representatives or in the Senate for that matter. It is not a policy that has been approved by America or Americans, but a policy that was more or less shoehorned into this by the former President of the United States and the former Commander in Chief Barack Obama. I can’t believe that President Trump thinks it is a good idea to spend one quarter or more billion dollars doing sex reassignment surgery, taking people out of the service of the military for the better part of a year while they recover from this surgery and thinking that somehow they are going to make our Nation stronger by using those resources when we have military members who are on food stamps today. So we would divert resources for sex reassignment surgery, thinking that it would somehow enhance our national security? Sex reassignment surgery enhances our national security? I can’t say that with a straight face and expect anybody in this country is going to believe this. So here we are, an America that is the unchallenged greatest nation in the world, significantly more powerful militarily than any other country in the world, but also with responsibilities that expand beyond that of any other country in the world, and we would obsess ourselves with the idea that we are going to send an advertisement out to people all over America, which is—well, maybe even outside of America—if you are contemplating sex reassignment surgery, come into the military and declare yourself a transgender, and then we will pay for that surgery. And we will have a whole lineup of people over at Walter Reed for their sex reassignment surgery laying in hospital beds next to our noble wounded who have lost an arm or a leg, or maybe both arms and both legs, maybe that have sacrificed a great deal, and we are going to divert the resources—the considerable resources— and medical skill and capabilities of our military medicine system that we have to sex reassignment surgery? Who would have thought? I can’t believe that the pundits haven’t unloaded already on this all over the world. We are going to be the laughingstock of the world if this comes out that the Hartzler amendment failed on the floor of the House of Representatives by a handful of votes, but it failed. So that says to those who want to enter into the military and are contemplating sex reassignment surgery—by the way, I am not using the language that they are using. They are saying this is gender reassignment surgery—gender reassignment surgery. Well, gender cannot be reassigned. That is in one’s head. Sex is south of the border. Gender is in the head. It is not gender reassignment, it is sex reassignment surgery. We would take those resources that we need to be using to take our combatwounded and those who are ill and sick and serving in our military and get them well with the best care that we can provide for them, the battles we have had here on the floor to try to get the VA up to speed and they would divert those resources for sex reassignment surgery and for pharmaceuticals and the kind of medication that would make them physically more like they say they are in their head? That is not a problem for the military to solve, Mr. Speaker. I am greatly troubled by the arrangement of the amendments, those that were allowed and those that were denied. This amendment was the Hartzler amendment that failed. I can only think of the MASH unit, and I will probably stop with that, Mr. Speaker, and not go any further into what images that brings to mind for me. But I saw that there were 24 Republicans that voted against the Hartzler amendment. That is greatly troubling to me, Mr. Speaker, to see that. By the way, Mr. Speaker, every single Democrat voted against the Hartzler amendment. In the course here of about 18 to 24 months, this Congress thinks that they are reflecting the will of the American people, and now we have not only a social experiment but a medical experiment, a transgender medical sex reassignment surgery experiment going on in our military while we need to maintain ourselves as the strongest and most capable military in the world. Our focus needs to be singular. We have people who can’t get into the United States military for one reason or another. Maybe they aren’t a strong enough physical specimen. Maybe they can’t pass that physical test. Former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates testified before Congress some years ago. He said that obesity is a national security problem in the United States, that too many of our young people sit in front of the television or in front of their Xbox. They eat junk food, they get fat, and they are too heavy to meet the standards to qualify to be recruited into our military in any branch of the service. He said that if we don’t do something to control the diets of young people so that they are not too fat to get into the military, he said it is a national security issue. Obesity in our young people is a threat to our national security. Yet, rather than focusing resources on getting these young people in shape, we would get out the scalpel and do sexual reassignment surgery on somebody from the same generation who went to the same school and probably sat next to some of those other youth in the high school classes, and we would take a man and physically turn him into a woman or take a woman and physically turn her into a man at their request because she says: up here that is where I am. Don’t they know that when they sign up for the military? Can’t they make that decision beforehand and can’t the military screen for that? If they can screen for obesity, if they can screen for intellect and for IQ, if they can screen for medical records and medical history, if they can screen for criminal activity or violations of the law, if they can say you can’t get into our military because you don’t meet our standards in any of these, if you are too short, if you are physically unable like my uncle who was physically unable to serve in the military, all of those things, from obesity to too short, to having flatfeet, to being crosseyed, whatever it might be, they can say: no, you don’t fit our standards. But if you walk up there and you say, ‘‘Well, I think here I am a woman and I am not a woman here,’’ then we will bring you in because you meet all other standards and we have got these specialists up at Walter Reed and other facilities around America, we will surgically make you into whatever you want to be. And somehow that strengthens America’s security and helps us to fight our enemies? This is so utterly ludicrous for the United States military to be engaged in such a diversion from defending our country. Yet this Congress turned down the Hartzler amendment. At least 
the Rules Committee allowed it to be offered. They didn’t allow mine. They allowed that one to be offered. This is what we get? This kind of answer? Every Democrat says: oh, this is okay. We want to do this. It is important to us. And 24 Republicans agreed with them? Where is our country going? Can’t we focus on the things that are important? Can’t we focus on these constitutional principles? Vote down this DACA thing that rewards lawbreakers, and support the Hartzler amendment and end this idea that we are going to do great medical and social experiments in the United States military and somehow out of that we are going to—there is no way in the world that makes us stronger. So somehow do we even maintain our power when we become the laughingstock of the world? There was also an initiative that I had to fight here a while back about meatless Mondays in our military. I recall a picture of the Norwegian military. They are vegans on Monday. Meatless military in the Norwegian military, and they are sitting there eating their vegan sandwiches and on their shoulder patch is a reindeer. I suppose that is their national animal, and that is good over there. For us, we want a strong military. We want to maintain a noble military. We want to focus these resources on those things that matter. They are all going to take an oath to support and defend the Constitution when they sign up and commit themselves to the military. b2015 God bless them for doing that. I take it, too. There are 435 of us here who did, and 100 down the Rotunda in the Senate did. How many of us mean it? How many of us will take that stand and say: I will not vote for a piece of legislation that is unconstitutional because it violates my oath of office; and I am not going to commit the resources of the taxpayers of the United States of America to do social, medical, and pharmaceutical experiments on people who now would be attracted to come into the military for that purpose and then be discharged out onto the streets of America, having been reconstructed into a different kind of human being with a different hair cut? That can happen on their own. That can happen in civilian life. That is each person’s cross to bear or each person’s choice, but it is not the duty of the United States military. It is a national security issue, according to former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, because too many of our youth are too overweight to meet the standards to get into boot camp. My answer to that was: if it is a military national security issue, sign them up. Put them in there. They can just stay in basics until they make weight. Maybe you add another 2 weeks, 4 weeks, or 6 weeks to their training. You will get them down to weight, if you work them hard enough, if you watch their diet. It will be a good thing for them. It is not a national security issue, in my opinion, for too many young people to be overweight and they can’t qualify for the military. If you work them hard enough, feed them right, keep them long enough, they will make weight. But it is far wiser to do that than it is to do sex reassignment surgery and take somebody out of operations for 200some days out of a year in order to recover from this reconstructive surgery. It is a ridiculous thing that has happened today in the United States Congress. It is disgraceful that a vote like that could take place and that a majority of the people voting on the Hartzler amendment would turn it down when we have a country to save, a country to protect. So I suggest this, Mr. Speaker. If this NDAA bill fails tomorrow, it will come back again. It will come back again with the Hartzler language in it, under a rule that will allow it to pass here on the floor of the House of Representatives. Democrats are not going to help us pass this bill. Only a handful of them will do that. So Republicans have to do the right thing. We should stop dividing ourselves. We should stop letting America be embarrassed in front of the word for a ridiculous decision that was made today. So I urge a correction to the NDAA, and I urge English to be adopted as the official language of the United States of America, because it unifies us and helps us communicate with each other. A common form of communications currency is the most powerful unifying force throughout the entire history of the world. We need to employ it here and protect it in law here in the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

The Senate met at 12:30 p.m. and was called to order by the Honorable DEB FISCHER , a Senator from the State of Nebraska. 
PRAYER The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today’s prayer will be offered by Pastor Bill Ewing of Christian Life Ministries in Rapid City, SD. The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer: Please join me. As we bow our knees before You, Father, grant us thankful hearts and let our eyes see the many blessings we have been given living in this great land. Put a protective hedge around these leaders, their marriages, and their families, and let peace dwell in their homes. O Lord, strengthen these that You have placed with this authority so Christ may dwell in their hearts through faith; and that they would be rooted and grounded in loving kindness and truth. May they be able to comprehend the knowledge of Your will and to know the love of Christ so they make decisions that protect and preserve the lives You have entrusted to them. Lord, teach us to listen. The times are noisy and our ears are weary with the thousands of sounds that continuously assault us. Give us the spirit of young Samuel when he said to You, ‘‘Speak, for Your servant is listening.’’ Let us hear You speaking in our hearts so that we get used to the sound of Your voice; that its tones may be familiar to us, and we would lead this great Nation accordingly. Amen.
