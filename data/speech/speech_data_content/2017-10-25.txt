Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning because the House must continue its work to reform and reauthorize the FAA. We have got to pass H.R. 2997, the 21st Century AIRR Act. Thirty years ago—30 years ago—the FAA identified the need to modernize or upgrade the Nation’s antiquated World War II era air traffic control system. This is a system, at the time, that used radar technology and paper strips for communications between controllers. They literally would take these paper slips and hand them from one controller to the next controller to the next controller as aircraft not only moved through the airwaves, but were moving through the airport systems. Now, over the last 30 years, Canada, Australia, and many in the EU have changed to this GPS system. We have got countries all across the globe going to GPS, or decades ago have already switched. It is when they go through our airspace, we still use this old radar technology. Now, during this time, we have upgraded GPS systems. We all carry around handheld devices that use GPS: the Wave app, Google app. There are many different mapping platforms that allow you to get through cities, towns, the countryside. If there is an accident, there is a delay, it allows you to get around it and move through so that we can actually have greater efficiencies on the road. But 30 years have gone by, and today, after spending $7 billion, the FAA still uses this outdated radar technology, moving from beacon to beacon, getting passed along as you travel across the United States. And, yes, our air traffic control system still passes these little pieces of paper from one to the next to the next. Oftentimes, if you travel around, you will go through areas where you are not captured by the radar at all, while other countries continue with this GPS system. This outdated air traffic control system negatively impacts the entire flying public. An outdated ATC means route inefficiencies, which means higher costs, which yields more congestion in our skies and sitting on our tarmacs. I would like to see a system where you don’t leave the gate to go sit on the runway until you know that you actually have a slot and are moving into the air and have a direct flight to your point. But today, you will see many airlines that will sit you out on the tarmac waiting for a slot. More congestion is a direct factor of flight delays and canceled flights. The reforms in this bill will provide more ontime departures and arrivals and less canceled flights. This bill is for the average flier. It doesn’t matter which airline you take, we ought to have an air traffic control system that serves them all with a GPS system that allows you to get from point A to point B without the time delays. This also has the Air Improvement Program fully funded, which actually increases the Airport Improvement Program from $3.3 billion to $4 billion. It has the ability to upgrade our airports. Mr. Speaker, I also served my country in the Air Force for 16 years. As a veteran, I know that national security comes first. The 21st Century AIRR Act does not jeopardize the interaction between the Department of Defense and air traffic control; in fact, it strengthens it. The Federal Government retains exclusive sovereignty and control of the airspace, and the President maintains critical authority to assume control of the airspace during emergencies in times of war. The time to bring up the bill, H.R. 3997, the 21st Century AIRR Act, is now. The public has waited way too long. We have been bypassed by other countries. If we can identify it 30 years ago that we had World War II technology, we ought to recognize it today and stop passing these little pieces of paper back and forth through our air traffic control systems. Let’s upgrade our systems, let’s create efficiencies, and let’s get people moving across this country in an efficient manner where they are not sitting on tarmacs waiting for flight delays. f 
DEMAND ACTION FOR VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) for 5 minutes. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise, once again, to honor, mourn, and demand action for victims of gun violence. On October 1, a gunman armed with semiautomatic weapons equipped with bump stocks fired hundreds of rounds in a matter of minutes at concert goers in my Las Vegas congressional district, killing 58 and injuring 489 others in attendance. During my tenure in Congress, I have stood for too many moments of silence on this House floor to remember lives lost to senseless gun violence. Many of my colleagues and I know all too well about the senseless loss of life in our streets, movie theaters, schools, and, now, concert venues. We have pleaded, we have watched, we have mourned as more and more victims suffer, and we have seen nothing from congressional Republicans. This just can’t go on. We can’t ignore the lives lost due to gun violence in my district or in any other for any longer, and if we don’t act soon, we will just be here doing it again. So I want to call the names, say the names, remember the names of the 58 casualties who lost their lives in my district. Let us honor their memory, and let these 58 names give the Republicans 58 more reasons why we must take action now. Hannah Ahlers; Heather Alvarado; Dorene Anderson; Carrie Barnette; Jack Beaton; Steve Berger; Candice Bowers; Denise Burditus; Sandy Casey; 
Andrea Castilla; Denise Cohen; Austin Davis; Thomas Day, Jr.; Christiana Duarte; Stacee Etcheber; Brian Fraser; Keri Galvan; Dana Gardner; Angela Gomez; Rocio Guillen Rocha; Charleston Hartfield, a police officer off duty; Chris Hazencomb; Jennifer Topaz Irvine; Teresa Nicol Kimura; Jessica Klymchuk; Carly Kreibaum; Rhonda LeRocque; Victor Link; Jordan McIldoon; Kelsey Meadows; Calla Marie Medig; James ‘‘Sonny’’ Melton; Patricia Mestas; Austin Meyer; Adrian Murfitt; Rachael Parker; Jenny Parks; Carrie Parsons; Lisa Patterson; John Phippen; Melissa Ramirez; Jordyn Rivera; Quinton Robbins; Cameron Robinson; Tara Roe; Lisa RomeroMuniz; Chris Roybal; Brett Schwanbeck; Bailey Schweitzer; Laura Shipp; Erick Silva; Susan Smith; Brennan Stewart; Derrick ‘‘Bo’’ Taylor; Neysa Tonks; Michelle Vo; Kurt von Tillow; and Bill Wolfe. These are the 58 people who lost their lives from gun violence in my district in Nevada; 58 more reasons why we shouldn’t stand silent, but we need to take action now. 
b1015 RECOGNIZING NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION’S AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS CENTER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the critical and lifesaving work being done by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Aircraft Operations Center. On September 23, I had a front row seat flying into the eye of Hurricane Maria as it headed toward Puerto Rico and the coastal United States. I rode through the hurricane aboard a NOAA P–3 Orion operated by the highly specialized workforce of the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps, civilian technicians, meteorologists from NOAA, and others, who have safely navigated these hurricanes for decades. The P–3’s instruments collect and transmit realtime weather data from storms far out to the sea back to the mainland. This data is critical for hurricane forecasters used by the American public and emergency managers. Providing the most accurate forecasts of hurricane track and intensity, as early as possible, is the focus of these flights. Whether a strong hurricane directly hits a major U.S. city or weakens and spins out to sea with minimal impacts is a question that can impact billions of dollars and thousands of lives. These flights are vital to protect our Nation’s lives and property. In addition to the P–3 hurricane hunter I flew in, NOAA also has a G–IV jet that goes high above the storm. The specialized instrumentation on NOAA hurricane aircraft provides critical storm data. The dualchannel tail doppler radars provide threedimensional views of the storm. These advanced technology tools make NOAA’s fleet a critical resource to safeguard lives and property when hurricanes threaten our shores. There is no doubt that this has been a challenging hurricane season for the country, with Hurricane Harvey’s flooding in Louisiana and Texas, Hurricane Irma impacting Florida, and Hurricane Maria devastating Puerto Rico. NOAA’s aircraft have performed tirelessly throughout these events. Over a 4week period, two NOAA hurricane aircraft flew over 300 hours and dropped over 500 weather probes into these storms. After the hurricanes pass, NOAA’s work is not done. NOAA’s fleet of light aircraft perform poststorm damage assessments, taking high resolution images that enable limited emergency response resources to be delivered to the most critical areas. NOAA’s King Air aircraft emergency response efforts to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria have resulted in more than 1.7 billion requests for damage assessment images. In total, more than 65,000 images were collected, covering more than 24,000 square kilometers of impacted areas. Think about that. These images allow emergency managers and the general public to be able to flee quickly, to react quickly, and to assess quickly in these impacted areas. NOAA’s light survey aircraft also perform a diverse set of missions, including river and snow pack surveys essential for flood forecasts and water management; coastal mapping required for safe maritime navigation by commercial, military, and recreational sectors; and fisheries assessments. NOAA’s aircraft are responsive and flexible, able to deploy at a moment’s notice in support of national disaster response. NOAA aircraft provided critical data and support on scene following the Deepwater Horizon event and over the skies of New York after Hurricane Sandy. NOAA aircraft provide data critical for public safety, economic, and national security. The NOAA aircraft fleet, the NOAA Commissioned Corps, and NOAA civilians are an invaluable natural resource, and it is one that we have a duty to maintain. These crews and aircraft require regular updates, readiness training, and technology enhancements that directly benefit us and our country. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the President to ensure that NOAA aircraft fleet has all of the resources they need to safeguard lives and property for decades to come. 
PUERTO RICO NEEDS HELP The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, imagine waking up with no lights, imagine waking up with no running water, you cannot bathe yourself, you cannot feed your children, you get so desperate that you break into chemically contaminated water, into untreated sewage water, you are on dialysis, Mr. Speaker, and there is still no electricity, or you are running out of medication and supplies in hospitals that are very low. What I am describing to you, Mr. Speaker, is not a dream. It is a living nightmare, and it has been a living nightmare in Puerto Rico for over a month. For over 4 weeks, while we now begin to focus and speak about tax reform and how this Congress attempts to assist the 1 percent—the wealthiest, the wellheeled—with a handsome tax break, with the elimination of the estate tax, when we attempt to shelve, to forget, to turn our head on this nightmare unfolded in Puerto Rico, it continues to be a living nightmare. That doesn’t stop there, Mr. Speaker. Puerto Rico could lose funding also for thousands of lowincome housing units if power to the island isn’t restored soon. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, which subsidizes 203 housing projects on the island, is prohibited by law from providing Section 8 assistance to buildings that are not decent, safe, and sanitary. Every day that Puerto Rico goes without resources, potable water, medication, and electricity, the situation becomes more dangerous and the death tolls continue to go up. This has now become, Mr. Speaker, our Caribbean Katrina. The official death toll reported by the government increased today to 49 deaths, but many folks fear that it is much higher than that, after confirming a death due to leptospirosis. According to the CDC, leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals. Without treatment, this disease can lead to kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death. To date, the island has reported 76 possible cases of the disease. Investigative reporting from various sources have tallied up deaths to potentially north of 450 people. As of Friday, October 6, at least 14 people have committed suicide in Puerto Rico. They are traumatized and in distress. This is our Caribbean Katrina. A list of 113 people remain missing after Maria’s passage. I was just in Puerto Rico for the second time this past week with Congressman LUISGUTIE´RREZ . The Congressman and I helped distribute supplies and necessities to Comerio, a small town in a remote part of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico continues to need help. It needs to be woken up from this living nightmare. S.O.S. S.O.S. Get resources to them now. It is our Caribbean Katrina. Let’s own it. Let’s resolve it. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, the world is an ugly place right now. It seems that at every turn there is another crisis—another barrier to peace and prosperity, another obstacle to fight, or another cross to bear. More of our citizens, women, children, and grandkids are turning to something— anything—to mute the pain and create a false sense of peace. Society has been infected by drug addiction, a disease fueled by a loss of hope. We see it on the news, we watch it online, we feel loss in our communities. This disease is killing our friends and neighbors. Last year alone, over 64,000 lives were lost. That is more casualties in a year than we saw during the height of the Vietnam war. And this is a war, too—a war being fought in the streets and in our homes. And we are losing. Mothers, sons, daughters, and fathers are dying—from the cold streets of major cities to the quiet fields of rural America—we are all feeling the effects of the opioid crisis. What can be done? That is a question I have asked countless law enforcement officials, doctors, nurses, addiction treatment professionals, and community leaders. There is no one solution to stopping the opioid epidemic in this country. This is a manmade disaster. We must face it head on with education and awareness, addiction and recovery services, funding, prescription drug monitoring programs, and prevention. We need to prevent our loved ones from being dragged into the abyss of addiction and hopelessness. According to the CDC, three out of four new heroin users report abusing prescription opioids before using heroin. There is an easy step each of us can take to help with prevention. We can get rid of our old opioid prescriptions at home. Why chance someone taking them? Why chance your loved one being a statistic? This year alone, 153 individuals in St. Louis County have already died of an overdose. How many of them started with prescribed opioids? How many started by taking prescriptions from a parent or a family member? If we could have saved just one of these lives by throwing away old prescriptions, then isn’t it worth it? This Saturday, October 28, local law enforcement and the Drug Enforcement Agency will be set up all around the country and in our neighborhoods for National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. They are providing safe and easy locations for you to throw away unused prescription drugs. I have no idea how many people can, and will, be saved by this one simple act. But multiply this one act times thousands, and now we are getting something done. Mr. Speaker, this is an epidemic this Nation has never seen. This is a disease of our own making. This week, there is something we all can do. Think about your household. Go into your hidden cupboards and see if you have old prescriptions. I bet you do. Take them. Find your nearest drug take back location and throw them away. We need to restore hope in this fight, and it won’t happen overnight. It will take work, prayer, patience, and vigilance. Hope can be restored. If and when we band together to fight this epidemic, it will happen. So let’s restore a little hope this week. Let’s all join the fight to end the opioid epidemic. 
b1030 THE WHITEFISH ENERGY DEAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, there is something fishy about the Whitefish Energy deal that was reported in The Washington Post. Whitefish Energy, based in Whitefish, Montana, was awarded a $300 million contract to repair and replace the electrical grid in Puerto Rico. We learned that the company is 2 years old and, as of about 6 weeks ago, had just two employees. It does not have a track record of working on massive projects, certainly not one as massive as rebuilding the power grid in Puerto Rico after a onceinacentury storm like Hurricane Maria. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority did not solicit bids for this contract. They did not do what most power utilities do under these circumstances, which is rely on mutual assistant relationships with other power companies. In Florida and in Texas—and in Illinois, for that matter—after a big storm, power companies from around the country send linemen and other workers to assist the local company. But that is not happening here. The Florida Power and Light Company brought in 20,000 workers after Irma and, apparently, was willing to send workers to Puerto Rico and help, but the request for help never came. So what is going on here? A tiny company that does not have a track record gets one of the biggest contracts to help rebuild Puerto Rico in a nobid, outoftheordinary contracting procedure. That is why I wrote yesterday to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray, because I want them to investigate this deal, how it was awarded, why this company got the contract, and whether there is any evidence of it being a sweetheart, corrupt deal to boost business allies and political allies of the President and members of his Cabinet. I also plan to bring this issue up to the Oversight Committees in this body. On the surface, the Whitefish Energy deal looks fishy, but when you look a little deeper, the Whitefish Energy deal looks corrupt. Whitefish Energy is based in Whitefish, Montana. Guess what. That is the hometown of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who used to represent Montana in this body. His son even worked for the company. The chief executive of Whitefish Energy, Andy Techmanski, knows Secretary Zinke; but as a spokesperson for the Interior Department said yesterday, in Whitefish, ‘‘everybody knows everybody.’’ Guess what. That doesn’t make me feel any better about the deal. Go a little deeper and you find out that Whitefish Energy is financed by HBC Investments, which is a private equity firm founded by Joe Colonnetta, who holds the title of general partner. The Daily Beast reported that Colonnetta gave $20,000 to the Trump Victory PAC, maxed out on contributions to Trump for his Presidential campaign in the primaries and general elections, about $32,000, then another $30,000 that he gave to the Republican National Committee. Kimberly Colonnetta, his wife, was also a maximum donor, meaning she gave the maximum allowed by law during the 2016 election to Trump and his various committees. Now, please look here, and the pictures are right off the Internet. They certainly add additional evidence to the idea that Whitefish and the Colonnettas are pretty chummy with our President and his Cabinet. Right here is Mr. Colonnetta with the President of the United States, the two Colonnettas at the inauguration, and a picture of Mrs. Colonnetta with Ben Carson, one of the President’s Cabinet members. Don’t forget, all you kids out there watching at home on C–SPAN, what you post on Facebook stays there forever. Now, I know that not everything that looks corruption is in fact corruption. Sometimes what looks fishy on the surface turns out to be legit, but most of the time, you know what, it turns out to be corruption. The reason this matters so much is that, without electricity, we can’t get water restored to the people of Puerto Rico. Water doesn’t flow uphill without pumps, and those pumps need power. You cannot live without water; you die. Dialysis machines, electrical wheelchairs, refrigeration for baby formula, insulin for diabetics, chemotherapy for those with cancer all require electricity. It is a matter of life and death. I was just there and saw the suffering of the people in the villages and towns across the island of Puerto Rico. Without electricity, we cannot get Puerto Ricans back to work rebuilding their island and beginning to end the suffering. Look, the last thing we and the people of Puerto Rico need right now is a fat cat lining his pockets with money because they are well connected. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. That money should be saving lives, not ending them. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. That is why I demand the FBI and the Attorney General investigate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience. 
INNOVATIVE APPRENTICESHIPS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the PARTNERS Act, legislation I am introducing this morning with my friend, Representative BONAMICI from Oregon. Our bill would establish a grant program to support the creation and expansion of innovative apprenticeships that prepare our workers for 21st century careers. In the Third District of Georgia, the CEC in Newnan has led Georgia by implementing an apprenticeship model, and since then, we have seen apprenticeships continue to expand across our great State. I, along with Ms. BONAMICI , are introducing the PARTNERS Act today to bring more programs like this to students and workers across the Nation. By funding this grant with already existing H1–B visa fees, which are collected from foreign visa applicants, we are ensuring that workers can receive immediate workbased training at no cost to the American taxpayer. 
APPRENTICESHIPS AND WORK BASED LEARNING PROGRAMS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ) for 5 minutes. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be on the floor this morning to introduce bipartisan legislation with my colleague on the Education and Workforce Committee, Congressman DREWFERGUSON from Georgia. Our bill, Promoting Apprenticeships Through Regional Training Networks for Employers’ Required Skills Act, or PARTNERS Act, will help close the skills gap by increasing opportunities for small and mediumsized businesses to establish apprenticeships and work based learning programs. When I visit communities in northwest Oregon, I hear from many Oregonians who still feel left behind because they don’t have the skills they need to compete in today’s economy. They are not alone. Many jobs today do not require a 4year degree, but do require more than a high school diploma. In fact, those jobs make up about 53 percent of today’s labor market, but only 43 percent of today’s workers are trained at this level. This creates a skills gap, leaving businesses struggling to find workers with appropriate skills, and workers without meaningful pathways to better paying jobs. I hear from employers and workforce organizations about the importance of a qualified workforce. They want to identify new opportunities to strengthen skills training. Apprenticeships and workbased learning programs are a winwin. They provide individuals with paid, onthe job training and classroom instruction. Employers can align training with the skills they need at their workplaces, and workers can learn while they earn. Unfortunately, small and medium sized businesses often lack the infrastructure and resources to establish apprenticeships or workbased learning programs on their own. So the PARTNERS Act addresses this by establishing a grant program to support the creation and expansion of industry and sector partnerships that will help smalland mediumsized businesses develop workbased learning programs and provide support programs for workers. Industry and sector partnerships will bring together employers, education, training, labor, and communitybased organizations to develop workbased learning programs that benefit workers and the economy as a whole. In Oregon, these partnerships could address, for example, workforce development needs in rapidly growing sectors like healthcare and technology. Under the PARTNERS Act, the partnerships would use grant funds to recruit workers, develop training curriculum, and provide workers with access to tools, work attire, transportation, childcare services, and mentorship support. These support services help businesses retain employees and help workers balance caring for and providing for their families. Importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill results in no additional cost to taxpayers because it authorizes the use of 50 percent of the funds deposited in the H1–B nonimmigrant petition account, and these will be used by the Department of Labor for the partnership grants. This funding source was suggested by the administration in a June 2017 executive order on apprenticeships. Through stronger investments and workbased learning programs, we can build pathways to get more people back to work, to provide our Nation’s businesses with the workforce that will improve productivity and efficiency. I thank Mr. FERGUSON for his leadership, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bipartisan legislation that will help people in our districts across the country access good jobs. 
TAX REFORM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, today we will begin a journey that has been represented to be a lifeline for the American people in long awaited tax reform. Sad to say that this is not a bipartisan bill. In addition, it is a bill that will cause a great deal of challenge to the American people. For example, in moving firms across the ocean, overseas, the American people should know that those companies, in the construct of this bill, will cause them to be exempt from taxes forever. In a discussion this morning, I heard that it will not boost the economy. The American people should know that it will destroy, undermine, crush the economy. The representation of the level of growth is a misnomer. Take, for example, in 1986, in the tax reform, there was no surge in job creation after the Reagan tax cuts. There was no high numbers of blossoming jobs. Many in my congressional district need jobs. It will be borrowing from the future and it will be a burden on our children, our children’s children, and their children. But the most devastating part is the bill that we will be paying, the actual dollars to pay down the deficit. Of course, it should be known that we have examples that no jobs will be created. In 2004, for example, when there was a repatriation from companies regarding their taxes, there was no creation of jobs that we can even recognize. Most of the money went for stock buybacks. Now, I know that sounds completely technical, but let me be very clear. The question has to be: What will the middle class working families get? I can assure you, it will be close to zero. There are 2 million households, for example, in the State of Texas that will be impacted by not allowing the exemption of State and local taxes. We don’t know whether mortgage deductions will be allowed, charitable tax credits. So if you have in some way been deducting, for example, those State and local taxes, you will not be able to do them anymore. That will be a great burden on the working families of America. So my caution to the business community as well as the small businesses, families: Be very careful what you buy into. We will have discussions to provide you with that detailed analysis. The key is a distribution table. What and whom will get the most money. As the bill is presently written, middle class working families, don’t look for relief in the RyanMcConnell tax bill. It will all go to the top 1 percent. They will relish while, you might not be jealous, but you will certainly be poorer for it. OPIOID CRISIS  
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to also entertain the questions about the pending opioid announcement of this White House. I want to bring to the attention the article in The New Yorker on the empire of pain. 
I am working on these issues, but I realize that this has to be a comprehensive approach to opioid abuse. The Purdue company launched OxyContin with a marketing campaign that attempted to counter this attitude and change the prescribing habits of doctors. b1045 Many people know OxyContin. The company funded research and paid doctors to make the case that concerns about opioid addiction were overblown and that OxyContin would safely treat an everwider range of maladies. Sales representatives marketed OxyContin as a product to start with and to stay with. Remember that. A product to start with and to stay with. Millions of patients found the drug to be a vital salve for excruciating pain, but many others grew so hooked on it, that between doses they experienced debilitating withdrawal. If we are going to do real opioid reform, this must be a standup of the pharmaceutical companies, and they cannot be defended. In addition, we have to understand that those languishing in jail that have suffered from criminal penalties for crack cocaine—crack—there now should be a compromise for their release. Opioid reform must include all of the neighborhoods of America, not just some. 
JENNIFER KEPNER WAS MOST COURAGEOUS AND INSPIRING The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the life and legacy of a wonderful person, an incredible wife, loving mother, exceptional citizen, and one of our Nation’s finest servicemembers, Jennifer Kepner. Jennifer passed away on October 18, 2017, at the young age of 39. She lived in my congressional district in Cathedral City, California. My heart breaks for her family and loved ones. She is, by far, one of the most courageous and inspiring people I have ever met. She put family, country, and community before self. At 23, Jennifer answered the call to serve our Nation as a medic and a staff sergeant in the United States Air Force. She served for 6 years, from 2001 to 2007, and helped save countless lives on the battlefield. After being honorably discharged at the rank of staff sergeant, Jenn continued her life of service, helping patients in our local communities as a radiology technician at Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs. She led a healthy and full life in so many ways. Her many hobbies included CrossFit, hiking, camping with her family, quilting, and even painting. All who met her remember her love of country, her determined spirit, her passion for serving others, and her devotion to family. Despite her healthy lifestyle and no other risks, in 2016, Jennifer was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, a terrifying diagnosis for anyone, let alone a young mother. After exhaustive work to investigate the potential causes of her cancer, her oncologist linked Jennifer’s exposure to burn pits in Iraq as the only identifiable and plausible risk for her cancer. Burn pits are commonly used by the military to eliminate waste in Iraq and Afghanistan. The large burn pit at Balad Air Base in Iraq, where Jennifer was stationed for 6 months in 2006, covered 10 acres and burned over 240 tons of trash each day, including everything from computer parts, medical waste, plastics, and chemicals; some items we wouldn’t allow to be burned in open air in our neighborhoods here in the United States. Yet, in a crowded camp of thousands, our men and women in uniform are exposed to giant plumes of black smoke. After learning of the potential link between her exposure while she served our great Nation and her cancer, she went to the VA seeking answers and help. After being denied medical assistance and benefits from the VA initially, Jennifer reached out to the advocacy group Burn Pits 360 and my office. Along with others, and as a team, we helped her navigate the complicated VA process, cut through the red tape, and get her the benefits that she had earned. I visited Jennifer at her home. During our kitchen table talk, she told me about her daily struggle raising two small children while battling pancreatic cancer. She was brave and had an optimistic attitude. She told me what it was like living every day in Iraq right next to the burn pits—the smoke, the smell, the irritated cough, and the sickness that followed. Her main concern was to ensure her husband and children were going to be okay after she passed. Her second concern was for her fellow veterans who, like her, were exposed to burn pits. She wanted to bring awareness to what she called ‘‘the Agent Orange of our generation.’’ Imagine that. During the toughest battle of her life against an aggressive cancer, she elevated her family and fellow veterans above herself. Her advocacy was for us to prevent future exposure to burn pits and serve veterans who have already been exposed. That is why we are here, to honor Jennifer and fight for her, her family, and fellow veterans. We must find a solution. Unfortunately, it is too late for Jennifer, but we can fight in her honor. I was there with Jenn; her husband, Ben; children, Aida and Wyatt, at her bedside hours before she passed away, and I am honored to call Ben my friend. On behalf of my wife, Monica, the 36th Congressional District, and our entire Nation, we join together as a community to grieve with you, Ben, little Aida and Wyatt, and to honor your wife, your mother, and the life of Jennifer Kepner. We are awed and humbled by Jennifer’s life of patriotism and service, and her life and her love of family. Jennifer, we thank you for your service and sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, Jennifer’s memory will never be forgotten. f 
A CIRCUIT BREAKER IS NEEDED FOR PROPOSED TAX CUTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, the exercise my Republican friends are going through with their budget and tax cut proposal would be amusing if the consequences were not so serious. Coming to Congress, I worked hard to earn a position on the House Ways and Means Committee, which has been the focal point for critical decisions in the past dealing with tax reform, with Social Security. I respected its historic role and the way that its members worked together in a thoughtful and bipartisan basis. Unfortunately, unlike what has happened for other major tax reform efforts, currently there has been no effort for laying the groundwork, working with people in both parties, dealing with the hard decisions that are necessary for tax reform that will move our country forward. My Republican friends refuse to deal with the heavy legislative lifting necessary for true reform. In fact, my Republican friends now have given up on tax reform. They are rushing through, in a matter of days, not reform but as big a tax cut as they can possibly get, predicated on strong arming their Members with narrow control in Congress and disregarding the fundamentals of responsible budgeting. The budget resolution that the House will soon be considering by the Republicans to enact their tax cut via the process known as reconciliation is a fantasy. Read it carefully. It is predicated on increasing our national debt $1.5 trillion, when previously they promised that their tax reform would be budget neutral. It is predicated on $4 trillion of unspecified budget cuts that will be concentrated on Medicare, Medicaid, and the other programs that Americans care the most deeply about. The proof for this fantasy is the fact that even though Republicans have an ironclad grip on the appropriations process in both the House and the Senate and they don’t have to worry about filibusters, they don’t need any Democratic votes at all, but they still cannot summon the courage of their convictions to implement the beginning of this strategy. It doesn’t have to wait for 2 or 4 or 10 years. They could start now with the 
budget cutting that they are relying upon for this fantasy budget, but they know that the American people won’t stand for it and their own Members wouldn’t vote for those cuts now even though there is nothing stopping them. That is why it is absolutely essential that, even if they are modestly successful with this reckless agenda, that we take steps to prevent the resulting fiscal train wreck, because we have seen deficits explode in the past where rosy projections about economic growth and stern budget cuts fail to materialize. The landmark 1986 tax reform legislation, the last time we had real tax reform, by the way, predicated on bipartisan cooperation and a lot of hard work, had no discernible impact on economic growth, even though it was, in fact, worth it. As a result, I will be offering standalone legislation and amendments in the Ways and Means Committee to establish a circuit breaker that will suspend the tax cuts if the rosy projections fail to materialize. If deficits explode and budgets are not cut according to their plan, then the American people should be spared the economic chaos by calling a timeout and rolling back these reckless proposals, allowing us to catch our breath and hopefully develop better policy based on bipartisanship and facts, not fantasy. America deserves a farbetter vision than the Republican budget fantasy and the reckless tax cuts that they are pushing so hard to enact. At a minimum, we should have a circuit breaker to stop it if they can’t follow through on their promises. 
AMRO FABRICATING CELEBRATES 40 YEARS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 40th anniversary of AMRO Fabricating Corporation, whose Riverside manufacturing facility is adjacent to the March Air Reserve Base in my district. AMRO is a small business manufacturer that plays an important role in supporting NASA, the Department of Defense, and our community. Under the guidance of CEO Michael E. Riley, the grandson of founders Michael K. and Thora A. Riley, this family company is helping to develop a strong and skilled workforce in southern California. AMRO is partnering with the State and Federal Government on projects that place high school and college students in internships and apprenticeships, which prepare them for a successful future and support our local economy. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the AMRO team on this milestone, and I am proud to represent this terrific small business that is doing such great work for our community and for our Nation. THE BIG BANKS ARE MAKING BIG BUCKS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, once again, I am honored to stand in the well of the Congress of the United States of America, although I am sad to bring the news that I shall share with you. I am saddened by something that has happened in this Congress. The big banks are making big bucks. They are doing very well, and they just received a big bonus from Congress. The big bonus is this: if you do business with them, you will have to participate in arbitration, and you won’t be allowed to sue them to resolve your dispute by way of litigation. Congress has decided that the big banks making the big bucks can force you to go to arbitration, and you will have to pay a fee to negotiate your way through the arbitration process. I think that there is something wrong with this picture. There is something wrong with this picture when we realize that one bank—and I will just single one out, I won’t go through all of the entirety of the industry, but one bank, Wells Fargo, one bank, opened 3.5 million accounts in the names of persons without their consent. In the names of customers, 3.5 million accounts without the consent of customers. b1100 This one bank, Wells Fargo, paid $185 million as a part of the resolution. This one bank, Wells Fargo, paid $80 million for enrolling customers into auto insurance that they didn’t need. One bank, Wells Fargo, paid $2.8 million in refunds to customers. One bank, Wells Fargo, in 2012, illegally foreclosed on servicemembers’ homes and autos—one bank, Wells Fargo—and for this, they paid $311 million. This was about $125,000 per servicemember. So we find ourselves in a circumstance where banks that do these ugly things to customers won’t have to go to court. They won’t have to face a jury. They will simply require the customer to negotiate with them. I find this quite shocking, to be quite frank with you, and I am very saddened by it, because I know that, if you take from the bank, you will go to court. But, apparently, Congress has concluded that, if the bank takes from you, you go to the bank and negotiate. It is a sad state of affairs. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 11 o’clock and 1 minute a.m.), the House stood in recess. b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. POEof Texas) at noon. 
PRAYER Reverend Dr. Christopher Girata, Saint Michael and All Angels Episcopal Church, Dallas, Texas, offered the following prayer: Gracious God, we thank You for the gift of this life and ask Your blessing upon the world You have made. Have compassion on those who suffer from any grief or trouble. Give to the people of our country a zeal for justice and the strength of forbearance that we may use our liberty in accordance with Your gracious will. Guide all who govern and hold authority in this Nation, and kindle in every heart that true love of peace. Make our lives a sign of Your love to this broken world, that unity may overcome estrangement, forgiveness, heal guilt, and joy conquer despair. Grant that the bonds of our common humanity, by which all Your children are united one to another, may be so transformed by Your grace that Your will may be done on Earth as it is in heaven. All this, we ask in the name of God, our creator, redeemer, and sustainer. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PITTENGER ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. PITTENGER led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
WELCOMING REVEREND DR. CHRISTOPHER D. GIRATA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, it is my true honor to introduce and recognize our guest chaplain today, Father Chris Girata. I am honored because he is my rector, the rector of Saint Michael and All Angels Episcopal Church in Dallas, Texas, where my family and I have worshipped for over 20 years. Although he has been our rector for only a little over a year, Father Girata has brought a renewed spirituality and passion to our parish. His enthusiasm for God’s Word and will is infectious to us all. His sense of humor always brightens our day, and he leads by example. As one parishioner put it, Mr. Speaker: ‘‘He is a true voice for the powerless and poor and is constantly challenging us to even better walk as Christ did.’’ And whether it is through our service at the Jubilee Park and Community Center in South Dallas, the millions in charity provided through the St. Michael’s Woman’s Exchange, or any of the other ministries or outreach projects of our parish, under Father Chris Girata, Saint Michael is more humbly and effectively serving God’s children. And as we do, Father Girata leads us not to just serve our neighbors’ physical needs, but to serve their spiritual needs as well. I am grateful that his prayer and his example could be shared with the House today. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, October 25, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER : Pursuant to the permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Clerk received the following message from the Secretary of the Senate on October 25, 2017, at 9:07 a.m.: That the Senate passed S. 226. That the Senate passed S. 1766. That the Senate concur in the House of Representatives amendment to the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 2266. That the Senate agree to without amendment H.J. Res. 111. Appointments: United States Holocaust Memorial Council. Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission. With best wishes, I am, Sincerely, KAREN L. H AAS. ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the immediate passage of the Dream Act to bring certainty to the more than 10,000 DREAMers in Oregon and DREAMers across the country. I have met with DREAMers in my State of Oregon, and tearing them away from their lives would be a tremendous loss for our communities. DREAMers like Daniel, a dedicated second grade teacher, DACA allowed him to come out of the shadows and give back to his community. But with President Trump ending DACA, Daniel is rightly anxious about his future. He worries about the effect on his students if he is forced to leave abruptly in the middle of the school year. When we threaten DREAMers, we put their futures at risk, but we also risk harming the many people who rely on them, like Daniel’s students. Mr. Speaker, we must work together and pass the Dream Act immediately. We just pledged, ‘‘with liberty and justice for all.’’ Let’s bring justice to the DREAMers and pass the Dream Act. f 
PREVENTING TAXFREE BONDS FROM GOING TO ABORTION PROVIDERS (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the No Abortion Bonds Act, to end Federal taxexempt bonds that support abortion providers. Under a loophole in the current law, cities, counties, and States can issue Federal taxfree bonds to finance construction of abortion clinics. In 2012, the New York City government issued a taxfree $15 million bond for a $30 million renovation of Planned Parenthood’s national headquarters, which was subsequently sold 3 years later for $60 million. In 2007, Sarasota County, Florida, floated an $8 million taxfree bond to pay for a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic. These taxfree bonds are intended to finance schools, hospitals, infrastructure—not abortion clinics. The No Abortion Bonds Act has over 30 bipartisan cosponsors and is endorsed by Americans United for Life, Susan B. Anthony List, National Right to Life, March for Life, the Family Policy Alliance, and the Eagle Forum. Please join me today in applying the spirit of the Hyde amendment to the Tax Code by preventing taxfree bonds from going to abortion providers. 
MEDICARE BUYIN OPTION (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, Medicare is the best public option that already exists to improve the Affordable Care Act and to provide immediate relief to Americans on the individual market. Next week, the Nation’s State insurance commissioners will make public insurers’ price gouging increases for next year, including a 60 percent increase in Georgia, a 50 percent increase in Florida, and the remaining States up to a 50 percent 1year increase. A Medicare buyin option for younger Americans is the only hedge against these price spikes that every American will look to Congress for relief from. Congress has been negligent in their 7 year near obsession with repeal and replace. You can no longer blame ObamaCare. Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member of Congress to support the Medicare Buy in and Healthcare Stabilization Act and Medicare X legislation. It is time to unleash the market power of Medicare to lower costs, improve quality, 
HONORING DONALD GILLEN, CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL RECIPIENT (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of one of my constituents, Donald Gillen, who is in Washington, D.C., today to receive the Congressional Gold Medal for his service to our Nation during World War II. Donald joined the Army on July 26, 1945. He was stationed at Camp O’Donnell in the Philippines from November 1946 through June 1947. As part of the 12th Philippine Scout Division, he became a company commander in the 57th Infantry Regiment. Donald moved to Belleville, Illinois, with his college sweetheart, Marilyn, to be close to his family, including four grandchildren. Now he is a guest staffer for the Belleville NewsDemocrat and supports his wife’s singing in their church choir. I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming Donald to our Nation’s Capitol and thanking him for his service. We are forever grateful. 
RECOGNITION OF LOS BANOS POLICE DEPARTMENT (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the men and the women of the Los Banos Police Department as Heroes and Heroines of the Month for California’s 16th Congressional District, part of the people whom I have the honor and pride to represent. These men and women tirelessly serve our community and truly are remarkable in embodying their motto: Pride in Service, Integrity in Action— Pride in Service, Integrity in Action. But the pursuit of excellence is not without cost. We know that they risk their lives every day on a 24/7 basis. Earlier this summer, two Los Banos police officers, Kristifer Hew and Aaron Pinon, were shot in the line of duty. I am happy to report that both officers are making spirited recoveries, but the risk police officers face every day to keep us safe cannot be overstated. So we salute them and their families. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Los Banos Police Department Heroes and Heroines of the Month for California’s 16th Congressional District, as well as recognizing all of America’s law enforcement officers. We can never ever thank them enough for their dedicated service as they protect all of America throughout our Nation. NATIONAL FOREST PRODUCTS WEEK (Mr. POLIQUIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join 1.3 million fellow Mainers in celebrating National Forest Products Week. Mr. Speaker, our great State is 90 percent covered by healthy, sustainable forests which support more than 30,000 goodpaying jobs. Now, nationally, our working forests support 930,000 hardworking Americans who manage the forests, who harvest the trees, and who transport the wood to paper mills and energy plants across our great Nation. Every day, products like paper and lumber and pet food bags and toothpicks and pencils make our lives better. And the best part, Mr. Speaker, is that these trees grow back after we cut them, so this entire green, sustainable industry creates goodpaying jobs generation after generation. Now, Democrats and Republicans must do everything humanly possible to help make sure our forest products industry is healthy and thrives. And to that end, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank everybody in this Chamber to make sure that we continue to treat biomass fairly in our regulations, make sure biomass is carbon neutral. This will avoid unnecessary and costly regulations being imposed on our mills, factories, and energy plants. 
b1215 HEALTH INSURANCE OPEN ENROLLMENT (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we are one week away from the open enrollment period—an opportunity for Americans to purchase health insurance for 2018. President Trump ended the cost sharing reduction—the CSR—payments, which reduce outofpocket costs for lowincome working families. A Congressional Budget Office analysis says ending these payments would likely increase premiums by 20 percent next year and by 25 percent by 2020. In the Senate, there is a bipartisan agreement, led by Senators ALEXANDER  and MURRAY , to stabilize the marketplaces by funding the CSR payments and increase resources for open enrollment outreach. Last night, unfortunately, a couple of the Members in the majority added partisan objectives to the bill, cutting mandates, which will keep costs low, and adding antiabortion restrictions to CSR payments. Mr. Speaker, I urge the majority to drop the poison pills and work with Democrats to bring the AlexanderMurray bill to the floor as soon as possible to stabilize markets and lower costs for American families. The failure to fix the health reform will cause millions of Americans to lose healthcare, and, that is, ‘‘No Care TrumpCare.’’ f 
40TH ANNIVERSARY OF SUNBELT AG EXPO (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Sunbelt Agricultural Exposition. Last week, I had the pleasure in attending the expo with a few of my colleagues. Known as North America’s Premier Farm Show, this annual event in Moultrie, Georgia, attracts visitors from across the Nation to showcase farming technology, research, and equipment. More than 1,200 exhibitors participated to display the latest and greatest agricultural technology and innovation. Agriculture is the largest and oldest industry in the State of Georgia, and it is only fitting that an event that celebrates and encourages the success of agriculture be held in Georgia’s Eighth Congressional District. American agriculture depends on strong and tireless advocates, and I commend the participants for creating an opportunity to educate the public on the importance of strengthening our farmers. As the world’s agricultural leader, the expo recognizes the tireless work of American farmers and their role in providing a safe and affordable food supply. I could not be more delighted to stand here today and honor a truly spectacular event and look forward to its continued success. 
CONGRATULATING REVEREND DR. JONATHAN L. WEAVER (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Reverend Dr. Jonathan L. Weaver on his 30th pastoral anniversary. As the pastor of the Greater Mt. Nebo African Methodist Episcopal Church, which was founded 140 years ago, Reverend Weaver provides outstanding spiritual leadership in Maryland’s Fourth Congressional District and the entire region. Pastor Weaver has a deep and active faith, and lives that faith not just with words, but with deeds. He has committed his life to lifting up people—to feeding the hungry and caring for the poor, comforting the afflicted and making peace—where there is strife. He has overseen not only the church’s growth, but the charitable works of more than 50 ministries that serve its members and the wider community. 
Pastor Weaver has led missions to Africa, serves as national president of a 500church ecumenical association, and board chairman of the oldest and largest AfricanAmerican community bank in the national capital region. Mr. Speaker, as Reverend Weaver continues his service to our community, I am confident that he will continue ‘‘to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with our God.’’ 
SPARTA, NORTH CAROLINA (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, Forbes magazine recently discovered something many of us have known for a long time, which is that Sparta, North Carolina, is a wonderful place to live and work. Sparta, located in Alleghany County, is a wonderful community made up of people with vision, strong work ethic, big hearts, and dreams. Forbes encouraged young entrepreneurs to move to seven locations around the country—and, in particular, to Sparta—for the highspeed fiber internet and relatively low cost of living. This would allow innovators and job creators to live affordably and work globally. Mr. Speaker, this is a great reason to move to Sparta, but it is not the only reason. I urge entrepreneurs and families to live in Sparta for the wonderful quality of life, sense of community, and incredible heart that makes this town a wonderful place to call home. 
BUDGET RESOLUTION (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with millions of middle class Americans, to oppose the Republican budget resolution. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support tax reform. Unfortunately, this budget resolution is a partisan tax reform package. I support tax reform, which will help lower taxes for lowincome Americans, I support tax reform that will rebuild our middle class, and I support tax reform that simplifies the Tax Code for small businesses. I will not support a tax plan that disproportionately gives advantages to the rich. But, Mr. Speaker, this tax plan will raise our deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. Mr. Speaker, this tax plan will take away critical dollars from an infrastructure bill that our Nation so desperately needs. We still have time. Let’s work together to do what is right for all Americans. Let’s work together and do what is right for our country. 
RECOGNIZING ANTHONY SMITH (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, 1 week ago, I had the privilege of presenting a Purple Heart to Mr. Anthony Smith of Warsaw, Illinois, in my congressional district. During the Vietnam war, Anthony served in the Army’s 1st Cavalry Division. In 1968, on a particular bad day for our troops, Anthony was able to singlehandedly take out several enemy machine gun units, protecting his fellow soldiers from harm and death. Anthony’s bravery on that day was rewarded with a Bronze Star with Valor, and with a Purple Heart, although he was not given a physical Purple Heart medal at the time. Almost 50 years later, our office worked to help correct this, and it was one of the highest honors of my time in office to present Anthony Smith with this welldeserved medal in front of a crowd of his friends and family in Warsaw last Tuesday, October 17. I want to thank Anthony Smith for his bravery and service to our country, his dedication and commitment to our military, and to the entire Warsaw community for coming out to support this true American hero. We are indebted to his service, and we honor him today. 
TRIBUTE TO GAIL KEMLER (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an inspiring woman in my district, Mrs. Gail Kemler. Gail is celebrating her 100th birthday this month on October 28. Gail has lived in Rochester, Michigan, since 1931, and has been an integral part of the city—through her steadfast volunteerism with the Rochester Board of Education; Daughters of the American Revolution, Stoney Creek Chapter; RochesterAvon Historical Society; Rochester Lions Club; and Questers Organization. Gail’s longest tenure as a volunteer was with the Rochester Area Neighborhood House, an organization that she has helped from its inception. She remained a dedicated volunteer with the organization for over 50 years. An active supporter of the Rochester Community Schools, Gail also served as a room mother and scout leader, and was one of the original PTA founders. She has been a member of the First Congregational Church in Rochester for over 85 years, and has served on the building committee, pastoral search committee, and board of trustees. Gail and her late husband, Donald Kemler, have four children, nine grandchildren, four greatgrandchildren, and four greatgreatgrandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have such a selfless, giving, and inspirational woman in my district. Thank you, Mrs. Gail Kemler, for your service to the entire Rochester community, and happy 100th birthday. f 
RECOGNIZING BRUCE HARBACH (Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the head coach of the Lancaster Catholic High School football team, Bruce Harbach, who has recently announced his retirement. Coach Harbach has been coaching for a remarkable 41 years and has spent the last 16 years of that career leading the Crusaders. His accomplishments at Lancaster Catholic are too many to mention, but let me provide just a few highlights: two State championships, eight section championships, nine district playoff appearances, six district championship appearances, and a perfect 16–0 season in 2011. In fact, I was glad to host Coach Harbach and the team at the Pennsylvania State Capitol following their State championships in 2009, and then again in 2011. Our coaches for our youth, it is not only about the scores and about their winning, but they are responsible as a role model—their players look up to them—and the most successful coaches also practice what they preach. We want our coaches to instill integrity in our kids and to show them the value of teamwork, commitment, and perseverance. That is exactly what Coach Harbach has done for these many years. I know the Crusader community joins me in thanking Coach Harbach for his 16 years leading their team from the sidelines. 
WILDFIRES IN THE WEST (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, as we all know, the wildfires in the West have been very devastating for a lot of people, a lot of property, and a lot of habitat. One of the subjects this week in the Natural Resources Committee was a sagegrouse habitat that has affected so many western States, including my own district in northern California, and my friend in Nevada as well. We worked very hard to have a good sage grouse plan, except what is the common bond in all this and the inability to have a successful recovery of this species as well as use of the land? The Federal Government. In the past, its involvement has been to merely slow down a process or say no to wise management practices. Cattle graze is a very effective tool, when prescribed correctly, to help make this habitat better and more sustainable longterm. We need more cooperation, we need the Federal Government to be more 
bold in putting out the type of policy that will help the grazing be an effective tool in that and not cower every time an environmental organization may come along and wish to threaten the entanglement of lawsuits that are stopping good management like that. It is hurting the habitat, it is hurting the sagegrouse population, it is hurting western lands, and western economy. Mr. Speaker, we need solutions coming from Washington, D.C., not impediments. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H. CON. RES. 71, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 580 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 580 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to take from the Speaker’s table the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 71) establishing the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2018 and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2019 through 2027, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House, without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on the Budget or her designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to adoption without intervening motion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. b1230 Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, it is budget day. I don’t know if you were as excited about that when you got out of bed this morning as I was, but, to be fair, I sit on the Budget Committee. I have the great honor of serving on the Rules Committee, and that is why I have the great honor of bringing this rule to the floor today. But I serve on the Rules Committee by night. By day, I serve on the Budget Committee with my friend Mr. PASCRELL and others, and we have been working since January to produce a budget for the United States of America. I have got to tell you, Mr. Speaker, we produced a whale of a budget coming out of the House Rules Committee. You remember that budget, you supported that budget. We did a fantastic collaborative job bringing that budget to the floor, and then it went to the United States Senate. Now, you know how this happens, Mr. Speaker. We all grew up watching, ‘‘I am just a bill sitting here on Capitol Hill. Well, it is a long, long journey to the capital city, it is a long, long wait while I am sitting in committee.’’ We all know the song from our childhood. It is a long process to move a bill through, and nine times out of ten, it comes back differently from the United States Senate than the way we sent it over there. Well, Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity today by concurring with the Senate amendment, and if we pass this rule, that is what we will have an opportunity to do. If we pass this rule, we will have an opportunity to have the debate, concur in the Senate amendment, and bring a unified budget to the floor. Now, what does that mean, Mr. Speaker? We have already been working on appropriations bills this cycle, and for the uninitiated, that is the bulk of the Federal spending that goes on. All of the mandatory spending that you and I both know about, Mr. Speaker, Medicare, Social Security, those important income support programs on which so many Americans depend, that money is already going out the door. So today what we have an opportunity to do in passing this budget is to create what they call reconciliation instructions, because contained inside this unified budget of which the House and the Senate agree are reconciliation instructions that allow us to bring what I believe will be the most comprehensive, fundamental reform of our Tax Code since Tip O’Neill and Ronald Reagan did it in 1986. Since 1986, 4 decades ago, Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity today to do something that no other Congress has been able to do since I have been an adult, and I am excited about that opportunity. Now, to be fair, we are going to have a lot of disagreement about how to get that done. That is not the debate we are having today. For any of my colleagues or anybody back home, Mr. Speaker, who is worried that right here in this debate on a Wednesday, we are going to sort out our entire Tax Code, fear not, fear not. That is not the debate we are having today. The debate we are having today, Mr. Speaker, is will we or will we not take on the challenge of reforming our Tax Code. I believe that we will. The debate that we are going to have today is will we or will we not confront the fact that America has one of the least competitive tax codes in the world, but Americans deserve one of the most competitive tax codes in the world. The debate we are going to have today, Mr. Speaker, is not about the details of tax reform, but about the premise of can we do better for the American people or can we not. I have the great benefit, Mr. Speaker, of not having to learn what I know about this Chamber from watching it on TV or reading it in the headlines. I consider myself very blessed to have the opportunity to serve among these men and women. If I just had to read about them in the headlines, I would have a very low opinion of them. I confess, I would have a low opinion. But because I get to work with these men and women, Mr. Speaker, I get to see the real commitment to their constituencies, the real commitment to their home States, the real desire to deliver on behalf of their constituencies and on behalf of the United States of America. We may have a divisive debate today. We sometimes do. But my prediction here in hour one, Mr. Speaker, is that by the time we leave this floor, we are going to have an agreement to take on one of the challenges that no party has been able to take on since Democrats and Republicans came together in 1986 to get it done. It is my great hope that we will use that model, that we will repeat that model, that we will improve upon that model, and that we will produce something that all of our constituency can be proud of. I know that America is hungry for tax reform, and I believe we can deliver it for them. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule, support the underlying concurrence in the Senate amendment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia, my friend Mr. WOODALL , for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong opposition to this rule. Today, House Republicans are pushing a jobkilling budget so they can use fasttrack reconciliation procedures to steamroll through their billionairesfirst tax plan. Mr. Speaker, we are supposed to be the people’s House. We ought to have the people’s budget, a budget that helps the millions of Americans who sent us here to Congress, not a budget that helps only a few, the wellconnected and the welloff. I disagree with Mr. WOODALL . This is not a time to celebrate. This is a terrible budget. This budget will devastate America’s investments in good 
paying jobs, it threatens growing wages and the bedrock promise of a secure and healthy retirement. It makes cuts across the board that would hurt seniors, children, veterans, and the hardworking people across this country who are already struggling to get by. Why are Republicans doing this? Well, it is all in the name of fast tracking the RyanMcConnell tax plan, which explodes the deficit by $1.5 trillion, and then provides multitrillion dollar tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. We Democrats think this is a horrible idea. What is particularly astonishing is the blatant hypocrisy of Republican leaders pushing this deficitbusting budget. Republicans are always telling us how much they care about the deficit, but when it comes to giving their beloved tax cuts to their billionaire friends, they suddenly develop a convenient case of amnesia. They say: What deficit? Don’t worry. These tax breaks will pay for themselves. Mr. Speaker, this is absurd. In this Republicancontrolled Congress, we can now say with certainty that the deficit and debt no longer matter. All of the talk by Republicans, well, they didn’t really mean it. If Republicans really cared about the deficit, they would in no way imaginable bring up a bill, a budget that is as reckless as this to the floor. This kind of shows what they truly believe, where their values are, where their priorities are. How many times have Republicans talked about the importance of a balanced budget? The Speaker called for a deficitneutral tax plan in his Better Way agenda. Well, I guess this debtcreating budget is the ‘‘Somewhat Less Better Way’’ plan. Your budget chair took to Twitter just 2 weeks ago to chastise Senate Republicans for not pursuing a balanced budget, yet now she is fully in support of their budget, which adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit with no way to pay for it. Now, let me spell this out for my Republican friends. This is not a balanced budget. Clearly, Republicans desperately need a refresher on basic arithmetic. Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely nothing balanced about hitting middle class families and millions of hardworking Americans with cuts while giving billionaires and corporations tax cuts they simply do not need. Billionaires aren’t knocking down our door asking for more tax breaks. This is disgusting. This is shameful. The Republican budget destroys middle class jobs by stealing hundreds of billions of dollars from investments in infrastructure, job training, advanced energy, and research and development. It devastates Medicare and Medicaid. It demands deep cuts to safety net programs like SNAP. I am talking about food for hungry children and hardworking families. It goes after college affordability. It makes college more expensive for working families. It undercuts key supports for veterans and their families. What is particularly offensive is that Republicans are using this terrible budget as a means of passing tax cuts for the wealthy as quickly as possible regardless of the consequences and without bipartisan support. The tax reform framework supported by Republicans in Congress will raise taxes on the middle class and cut taxes for the wealthy. Under the Republican plan, the top 1 percent would receive 80 percent of all tax benefits. Let me repeat that. The top 1 percent would receive 80 percent of all tax benefits. Give me a break. Those making more than $900,000 a year would receive an average tax cut of more than $200,000. Think about that. A person working full time in minimum wage makes $290 a week before taxes. And under this plan, people who make over $432 an hour, $900,000 a year, would get a massive tax break. Corporations will receive a tax cut totaling $2 trillion. Who loses in this plan, Mr. Speaker? According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, one in three middle class taxpayers earning between $50,000 and $150,000 would actually receive a tax increase, and nearly half of middle class families with kids will see their taxes go up. Can you believe that: raising taxes on the middle class to pay for tax cuts for billionaires and corporations? This is insane. To make matters worse, Republicans are planning to steamroll their tax plan through Congress. We are reading in the press that we might see actual text of their plan next week and maybe a markup and floor consideration a week or two after that. Really? Don’t you think we owe it to our constituents to have thoughtful, open debate on this legislation which will impact every single one of them? I guess not. Democrats agree that our tax system needs to be updated, to be more fair, and especially to be more fair to the middle class and to working families. We have always been willing to engage in real bipartisan tax reform, but the Republican tax framework is not tax reform. It is just one more GOP multitrilliondollar giveaway to the wealthiest at the expense of the middle class and working Americans. In all my time in Congress, I have never seen a budget and a tax plan that harms so many just to benefit so few. I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule, to vote against this cruel Republican budget, and to oppose a tax plan that puts wealthy corporations and the top 1 percent ahead of hardworking middle class families. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I had an opportunity to mention at the beginning that we might be debating the details of the tax reform plan that does not exist today. I see that we are, in fact, going to do that. There are a lot of studies out there on this tax reform plan that does not yet exist, but let me tell you that we can all agree that we have the single leastcompetitive Tax Code on the planet today. We can all agree that with the click of a mouse, a company can transfer its assets overseas and grow jobs there instead of growing jobs here. Let us have the debate that we want to have about who should bear the burden of American taxation. That is a legitimate debate and we should have it. But let us not have the debate about whether foreign workers should benefit or American workers should benefit from American capital, because that answer should be clear in the hearts and minds of every single Member of this Chamber. We have an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to go from worst to first. Now, I confess that I don’t actually expect to get all the way to first. I will settle for getting up in the top five and getting out of the bottom five when it comes to being able to lead in this country. But I want to mention, Mr. Speaker, what I think is a source of frustration of constituencies on both sides of the aisle, and that is the usagainstthem conversation that goes on day in and day out. I looked at the chart my friend from Massachusetts brought down to the House floor. It happened to be in university colors of Georgia’s red and black, but I can see that as a representative of all the hardworking families in my district, that chart didn’t do anything to inspire me about the impact of tax reform going forward. My friend quoted the Tax Policy Center. Now, The Wall Street Journal called the Tax Policy Center a shill for those groups that don’t want to see any tax reform of any kind, but that is currently. The Tax Policy Center has been doing research for a long time. The research my friend from Massachusetts quoted was a study of a bill that does not yet exist. The research I am going to quote is of historical tax rates in this country. What my friends at the Tax Policy Center said is that about 30 percent of Americans—onethird of Americans— pay no income taxes today; that the Tax Code, as it exists today, protects them from any tax liability at all. Now, what we are proposing when we get into fundamental tax reform, Mr. Speaker, is to double the standard deduction. For those families that are already claiming the standard deduction, we are talking about doubling it. Now, the brackets are still in question, the details are still in question, but we are talking about doubling the number of folks who don’t have to deal with the IRS at all. Today, about 30 percent of American families don’t pay any income taxes, 
and that same 30 percent gets a refundable tax credit that rebates to them their entire Social Security and Medicare contribution that they make and the entire Social Security and welfare contribution that their employer makes on their behalf. Now, these are not my numbers; these are the Tax Policy Center’s numbers, that a full third of Americans aren’t paying one penny in Federal income tax or Federal payroll tax of any kind. b1245 Now, I am not here to debate the wisdom of that, Mr. Speaker. I am here to tell you that I don’t know how much lower I can cut taxes in that group. I don’t know how in the world I can lower the tax burden on folks who are not only paying no income taxes, but are having all of their payroll taxes rebated to them also. Is this a group we should talk about, Mr. Speaker? Should we talk about folks who are grabbing onto the bottom rung of the economic ladder and struggling to climb to the top? We should, and we do. Should we talk about how it is that the entitlement system, the benefit system in this country, is trapping people at the bottom of the ladder and not allowing them to climb to the top? We should. I would say to you, Mr. Speaker, that it would be misleading to the American public to suggest that this tax bill is focusing its attention in one direction instead of another direction. The fact simply is that I can’t lower taxes any more at the bottom of the spectrum. We are talking about lowering taxes on corporations. That doesn’t inspire many people. I have that conversation regularly: ROB, what in the world are you doing lowering taxes on corporations? I support the FairTax, and in the spirit of folks who are not particularly enthusiastic about tax reform, I am not in that camp. I am enthusiastic about tax reform. I just thought there was a better way. I couldn’t get the votes to have my better way done. My better way is the FairTax, and what I would say to you is corporations don’t pay taxes. Corporations do not pay taxes. They collect taxes from their consumers in the form of higher prices, from their employees in the form of lower wages, or from their shareholders in the form of lower capital—lower capital returns. Now, lest you think: ROB, you are just a conservative Republican from the Deep South. What do you know about this? I will again quote the Tax Policy Center, which says that a full 20 percent of the corporate income tax burden falls on workers. Fair enough. If we want to argue about where the tax rates are going to end up and how the cuts are going to look and what the policies are going to be, let’s have that debate. Let us not mislead the American people into believing there is a free lunch anywhere in this Tax Code. We have an opportunity to move from worst to first, and every single American, regardless of their region, regardless of their politics, is going to benefit from that change. They benefited from it when Democrats and Republicans came together to do it in 1986, and they will benefit from it when we come together and get it done today, as I believe that we will. We must. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, boy, I don’t even know where to begin after that. My good friend, the gentleman from Georgia, made reference to the Tax Policy Center, and I have the report from the Tax Policy Center here. In fact, it is their analysis that was the basis for that chart that I held during my opening remarks, which said that the top 1 percent would receive 80 percent of the tax breaks based on the Republican framework. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  excerpts from the Tax Policy Center report. 
[From the Urban Institute & Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center Staff, Sept. 29, 2017] A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE UNIFIED  FRAMEWORK  
ABSTRACT  The Tax Policy Center has produced preliminary estimates of the potential impact of proposals included in the ‘‘Unified Framework for Fixing Our Broken Tax Code.’’ We find they would reduce federal revenue by $2.4 trillion over ten years and $3.2 trillion over the second decade (not including any dynamic feedback). In 2018, all income groups would see their average taxes fall, but some taxpayers in each group would face tax increases. Those with the very highest incomes would receive the biggest tax cuts. The tax cuts are smaller as a percentage of income in 2027, and taxpayers in the 80th to 95th income percentiles would, on average, experience a tax increase. The findings and conclusions contained within are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect positions or policies of the Urban Institute, the Brookings Institution or their funders.

Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, where did I get this figure about adding to the deficit by $1.5 trillion? Did I just make that up? I will tell the gentleman where I got it from. It is basically the Republican report in the Senate on the budget. Let me read from their report here. It says: ‘‘This title includes two reconciliation instructions to the Senate committees. The first would allow the Finance Committee to reduce revenues and change outlays to increase the deficit by not more than $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years.’’ These are the words of Republicans in the Senate. The gentleman wants to know why we are talking about the tax plan. It is because we are presented here with a budget that essentially fast tracks a tax plan. He is right, we don’t have all the details yet because it is being negotiated and written in some back room somewhere in this building. I wish I knew where it was so we could maybe try to find out some more details. But what we do know is the framework that the Republicans have put forward, and that is the basis for the analysis that economist after economist have stated that this budget basically is a giveaway to the wealthiest individuals in this country, and it is not somehow a break for the middle class. It is the exact opposite. This is a gift for billionaires and millionaires, and it does nothing for working families. That is why this is all relevant. This budget puts in place procedures for the Republicans to fast track a tax bill that they are now writing in some back room somewhere that nobody will see probably until the last minute, and basically it will be rushed through here, and it is a big giveaway to the wealthiest individuals in this country. I just wanted to clarify that for the RECORD . Mr. Speaker, let me say that Republican plans for tax reform would also eliminate the State and local tax deduction, called SALT. This deduction prevents millions of middle class families from being taxed twice on the same income by deducting alreadypaid State and local taxes from their Federal income tax. Half the people hit by this tax hike would be middle class families earning a household income of less than $100,000, and local communities will also feel that pain. 
Repealing the SALT deduction, which would effectively make State and local taxes more costly for taxpayers, would put pressure on local governments to lower taxes. The bipartisan National Governors Association said in a September 22 letter that the SALT deduction, ‘‘has contributed to the stability of State revenues that are essential for providing public services.’’ These services include healthcare, police and fire departments, and schools. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the letter from the National Governors Association. 
NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION , Washington, DC, September 22, 2017. Re Tax Reform (State and Local Tax Deduction and Municipal Bonds). Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL , Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. CHUCK SCHUMER , Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. ORRIN HATCH , Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. RONWYDEN , Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. KEVIN BRADY , Chairman, Committee on Ways & Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. RICHARD NEAL, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways & Means, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL , M INORITY LEADER SCHUMER , SPEAKER RYAN, MINORITY LEADER PELOSI , CHAIRMAN HATCH , RANKING MEMBER WYDEN , CHAIRMAN BRADY , 
AND RANKING MEMBER NEAL: The nation’s governors appreciate congressional efforts to reform and improve federal tax policy. Federal and state tax systems are complex and often interconnected. Therefore, as Congress considers reforms, we urge you to maintain the balance between state and federal tax systems by preserving the income exclusion for municipal bond interest and the deductibility for state and local taxes. The financing engine that drives U.S. infrastructure is the $3.8 trillion municipal bond market. Changes to federal laws and regulations should not increase issuance costs to states for municipal bonds or diminish investor demand for them. If federal changes make issuing municipal bonds cost prohibitive for states and local governments, then fewer projects could be funded, taxes could rise, fewer jobs created, and economic growth will suffer. Governors also believe that no federal law or regulation should preempt, limit, or interfere with the sovereign rights of states. A mark of sovereignty includes the ability to develop and operate revenue and tax systems. Deductibility of state and local taxes has contributed to the stability of state revenues that are essential for providing public services. We encourage you to avoid changes to the tax code that would undermine the ability of state and local governments to meet the needs of the citizens whom we all serve. Eliminating state and local tax deductibility, moreover, exposes a higher share of an itemizing taxpayer’s income to federal taxation because it adds back mandatory payments of state and local taxes already paid, as taxable income. Federal tax reform requires an intergovernmental partnership because decisions at the federal level will affect state and local governments profoundly. We look forward to working with Congress on bipartisan tax reform to maintain balance between our systems and modernize the federal tax system to meet the needs of our citizens. Sincerely, Gov. BRIAN SANDOVAL , NGA Chair. Gov. STEVE BULLOCK , NGA Vice Chair. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to ask Members to vote to defeat the previous question; and if we do, I will offer an amendment proposed by Representative SCHNEIDER that would prohibit any legislation from limiting or repealing the State and local tax deduction. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, to discuss this proposal and to discuss the importance of the State and local tax deduction, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ), who has been outspoken on this issue on behalf of States and communities and middle class taxpayers. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, there are some real terrible parts to this budget, but this, to me, is the worst. This deduction has been part of our tax system before there was an income tax, going back to the Civil War, for the very reasons that my friend from Massachusetts just talked about. It wasn’t just picked off the shelf. People count on it. People count on this. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule, the previous question, the budget, the weather, whatever. We know that this budget resolution paves the way for a tax reform bill done through reconciliation. I am sure that is interesting. Reconciliation on Governor Street in Paterson, New Jersey. I am sure they want to know reconciliation when we are talking about their pocketbooks; a dubious maneuver that blocks us Democrats completely out of the process and allows Republicans to pass a purely partisan, juiced up bill. Comprehensive tax reform is a goal we should all share, and lasting tax reform should be bipartisan. My friend from Georgia, I think, believes that, but this ain’t it. While they are cutting deals behind closed doors, what we are pushing is eliminating the State and local tax deduction, and that is in the Senate budget. They wrote it right out, the Capito amendment. Republicans are so adamant about eliminating this middle class benefit that they added an amendment to that budget before us today, the socalled Capito amendment. Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. A vote for this rule is a vote for the budget, is a vote to repeal the State and local deduction. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues representing New Jersey, New York, Illinois, California, Minnesota, and so many other States, including Georgia, including Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, better think long and hard about their vote today. The American people are watching to see if they vote to raise their taxes. This amendment, the Capito amendment, in the budget falsely claims that the SALT only benefits highincome taxpayers. Let’s take a look at that. The fact is that repealing it would hurt the middle class and working families. At the same time, how do you justify—through the Speaker, how do you justify keeping the deduction still viable for corporations? They can deduct the State and local taxes, but the families of America can’t? How can you justify that? I want to hear your justification of that. That is going to be a good one. Forty percent of taxpayers with incomes between $50,000 and $75,000, more than 70 percent of those making $100,000 to $200,000, claim the State and local tax deduction. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I will make it short, but I could stay here all afternoon on this because I feel it in my bone marrow. We are talking about tax cuts. We are increasing the tax burden on the middle class, and you cannot deny it. There is no place in that budget that you can deny it. None whatsoever. You could say: Well, we are going to do this over here and this. Look, I am tired of that walnut trick. Okay? Have you figured out which it is under? Groups representing realtors, mayors, teachers, firefighters, sheriffs, et cetera, all support retaining the State and local tax deduction. It is bad policy, plain and simple. Mr. Speaker, I appeal to you, we have enough ammunition. We don’t need this ammunition for next year. Let’s think about the budget of the American people in a nonpartisan way. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, if you have wondered what kind of passion we have on the Budget Committee, I will just once again recognize how much I enjoy serving with my friend from New Jersey on 
the Budget Committee. Everything you just heard from him was from the heart. I get to hear it in committee day in and day out, and I will tell you, we end up with a better product as a result of that. It is a legitimate debate to have about the State and local tax deduction. It is perfectly legitimate. There are those from lowtax jurisdictions that ask: Why would the Federal Government and the Federal taxpayer want to subsidize those States that are highertax jurisdictions? There are those jurisdictions that are lowtax jurisdictions. Because the gentleman’s constituency in New Jersey makes so much money, they pay so much more in Federal income taxes. And States like mine in Georgia, States like Alabama, States like Mississippi are the beneficiary of those dollars as the Federal Government distributes them. Undeniably, there is a case to be made on both sides of this issue. The falsehood, Mr. Speaker, is to suggest that we are deciding that issue today. We are not. We are not. I don’t blame any of my colleagues for fighting for their constituency at the height of their ability, at the highest vocal point of their capability, because issues are, at their core, local and personal to each and every one of us. We are going to have to have this conversation and we are going to have to sort it out, and I believe it is not going to be a partisan conversation. In fact, I know it is not going to be a partisan conversation. I know Republicans who share my friend from New Jersey’s opinion, and I know Democrats who share SHELLEY  MOORE CAPITO ’s opinion on the Senate side. We know this to be true. We are going to sort this issue out, Mr. Speaker. What I fear, though, is that emotions are going to run so high that we are going to miss an opportunity to figure these things out. For example, to conflate personal deductions with business deductions is to create confusion where there needn’t be any. Every business in America can deduct the meals that they serve throughout their day as a business expense. I will share with the gentleman that my family cannot deduct our meals from our income taxes. Every business out there that has rented an apartment somewhere in order to conduct business, they can deduct that rent from their income taxes as a business expense. I will share with my friend, in the great State of Georgia, I am unable to deduct my rent as a business expense from my income tax. There is just a fundamental difference between families and businesses, and that fundamental difference goes back to what I said at the very beginning, and that is there is only one taxpayer in this country. It is not Walmart, it is not Apple, it is not Microsoft. It is the American consumer. We are the only ones. At the end of the day, the buck stops with each and every American family. The debate over how to structure a corporate income Tax Code, Mr. Speaker, is perfectly legitimate. To suggest that the fact that the personal code and the business code look different and that is somehow nefarious is to deny what is just now over 100 years of income tax policy in this country. b1300 Mr. PASCRELL. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. PASCRELL. So, now that you have agreed to the fact the families are going to get shafted but corporations will continue to be able to deduct their local and State taxes, this is pertinent to the budget, my friend, through the Speaker. Right in the bill, the budget bill we are talking about right now, the rule, previous question, related to changes in Federal tax laws, which may include reducing the Federal deduction such as this—this is right from the budget. Why do you say we are not discussing this? Mr. WOODALL. Reclaiming my time from my friend, Mr. Speaker, what you hear is absolutely right. I want to make that clear. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion; they are not entitled to their own facts. The words my friend is reading are absolutely accurate. What they are not are absolutely binding. That is what they are not. What this is is such a personal and important issue to folks on both sides of it that it got its own personal line out of the United States Senate. I can’t even get nominations out of the United States Senate, Mr. Speaker. I am sitting here trying to staff out region four down in the great State of Georgia. Folks are delaying debate. Folks won’t let me get my people in place. This is so important to the United States Senate that it came with its own line. Mr. Speaker, I don’t want to diminish the importance of this issue on either side. What I do want to insist upon, though, is that it will not be decided during this hour today; and I want to insist, Mr. Speaker, that it will not be decided on partisan lines. I would just ask of you, Mr. Speaker, and of my friends here on the floor, we have two things we can do with our voices: we can either sow consensus, or we can sow discontent. I know that we are passionate about these things in which we believe, but to suggest, Mr. Speaker, that we are not going to come together and sort it out and do the very best we can for Americans is to sell this institution short and is to further the misunderstanding, the misimpression, the misinformation that the media sends out about us every day. I know we are better than that, and I am proud to be a voice saying that here on the floor today, Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ) to respond. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, families in my friend’s State, the great State of Georgia, will lose a tax deduction of $9,000, those families, on average. I think you are concerned about that. You cannot fib that you are not. And the fact of the matter is you used the words—through the Speaker, you used the words that your States are subsidizing the donor States? Well, let me give you an idea of New Jersey. States like West Virginia, the average SALT deduction claim is $9,463 per household; in Ohio, it is $10,445; in Wisconsin, it is $11,653. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds, and this will probably have to be it because, unfortunately, we have so many speakers over here. I wish I could enjoy the loneliness that my colleague from Georgia enjoys that nobody wants to speak to defend this budget. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, 48th, 49th State, that is where New Jersey is in getting back the money we send down to Washington. Who subsidizes whom? And Mnuchin, go back and tell the Secretary of the Treasury he doesn’t know what he is talking about. He says New Jersey is being subsidized? Not these numbers; the numbers don’t show that. You can’t defend this. You can’t defend it under any circumstances whatsoever, and you have admitted that we are talking facts here today. I rest my case. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDYCHU). Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the underlying rule that would allow for consideration of the Senate passed Republican Budget. If passed, this budget would allow Republicans to fasttrack their tax plan through Congress without Democratic support. Now, I stand in support of a tax plan to help the middle class, but that is not the tax plan we are seeing proposed by Republicans. Instead, we see that 80 percent of the benefits will go to the richest 1 percent in this country. The problem? Somebody has to pay for it, and it looks like it could be the middle class. I have heard from workers worried that cuts of contributions to their 401(k) plans will ruin their retirement. I have heard from seniors worried that losing homeowners’ incentives will make it harder for them to stay in their homes. And I have heard from families worried that a repeal of the State and local tax deduction will increase their tax burden. 
In fact, we know that onethird of the middle class will see their taxes increase under this plan. And the numbers show that, as our constituents begin to learn more, they are realizing that this plan only cuts taxes for the wealthy and corporate interests and leaves middle class families behind. That is why a Reuters poll released yesterday found that fewer than a third of Americans support the Republican tax plan at all. This tax plan for the rich will increase the deficit by $2.2 trillion. And who will pay for it? Your children and their grandchildren. They will have to suffer from the cuts made down along the line to education, to Medicaid, to Medicare. And for what? To make the rich richer? To line the pockets of Washington special interests? That is not right. Reject this budget. Most importantly, reject this tax plan. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We have heard a lot about the distributional analysis of tax reform, and, as I have suggested, it is hard to do. Folks who make a whole lot of money, like my friend from New Jersey’s constituency, they pay a whole lot more in taxes. I hope that one day my constituency makes as much money as my friend from New Jersey’s constituency, and if we can stimulate the economy the way that I believe that this tax proposal will, we are going to have a shot at getting that done. But we have to have these conversations about limiting tax deductions for the wealthiest Americans if we are going to solve the issues that my friends have raised. And reading right out of that Senate budget report, the whole purpose of considering the State and local tax deduction and considering modifying it, capping it, eliminating it, whatever you want to insert there, Mr. Speaker, is designed around limiting those tax deductions that only benefit the wealthiest among us—that only benefit the wealthiest among us. That is the conversation that folks are trying to have. Again, Mr. Speaker, there is so much more that we agree on than that we disagree on in this Chamber. But it appears, time and time again, we come to the House floor and focus, in the most shrill voices, on the 20 percent of those things that divide us instead of the 80 percent of those things that we could come together and deliver on for our constituency. Tax reform doesn’t have to pass with 51 votes in the Senate. We move reconciliation bills through the Senate with 60 votes. We have moved them through the Senate with 70 votes. We have moved them through the Senate with 80 votes. Growing the American economy, Mr. Speaker, is a commonsense goal that is shared in every single region and in every single political quarter. Let’s not make this about us here. Let’s make this about our bosses back home. We can, and we should, and I believe that we will. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ), the ranking member on the Tax Policy Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this bill is truly about one thing and one thing only. It is about lavishing tax breaks on Donald Trump personally, his family, and all of his billionaire buddies. It is about lavishing tax breaks and incentives on the very same giant multinational corporations that have shipped away so many American jobs, that have refused to pay their fair share of our national security by hiding their profits in offshore island tax havens. It is about doing all that and hoping that, at this time of the year, here at Halloween, that they can trick American middleclass families into believing that a little of those tax benefits will trickle down to them. Because if they can do that, if they can pass this bill, they will treat themselves, the billionaires, and the job exporters, to tax benefits of almost astronomical proportions. To suggest that there is anything bipartisan about this bill or anything bipartisan about the tax proposal that Republicans will unveil next week is truly a farce. There is no bipartisanship here. They learned nothing from their failed healthcare repeal efforts. No, they plan to use surprise, jackinthe box tactics to pop out a bill at the last minute, force it through this House, through our Ways and Means Committee, and foist it off on the American people. With Halloween coming, there is a simple ‘‘trick or treat’’ test that you, as an American family, can use. If you are in the top 1 percent, you get 80 percent of the individual benefits out of this bill. So just look at your income. If you are not up there in the $700,000 or $900,000 range, don’t count on getting much benefit out of this bill. In fact, a number of studies show your taxes may actually go up while others see a significant decline in the revenue the richest few are asked to pay to finance our country. And what about the idea of growing jobs? After all, growing our economy is what we should all be about and what is claimed for this bill. Well, I turned to that objective source, Goldman Sachs, the home of the Treasury Secretary and top economic advisers. Goldman Sachs, within the last month, has advised its own investors: Don’t expect much out of this tax bill because any momentary growth at the beginning will be offset by the trillions of dollars of additional debt from the same people who have been telling us for years we can’t afford another dollar for abused children, and we can’t afford dollars for children’s healthcare because we are so very worried about the national debt. Well, there is reason to be worried about the national debt and not to explode it by trillions of dollars with this giant unpaid tax bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HOLDING ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. DOGGETT. A zombie of supply side economics is returning from the dead. We know it didn’t work for President Bush. We know it didn’t work in the Reagan era. They are bringing it back again, saying, if you just give a little more to those who have so much already, it will benefit everyone else. The data does not show that. This is a tax bill that needs to be rejected because it is so unfair and inequitable to the American people. This is much worse than the healthcare repeal because its ramifications in leading to cutting Medicare and Social Security will be farreaching. There will not be a family in America that goes untouched. Reject this budget. Reject this awful tax bill. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to agree with some of what my friend had to say. There will be absolutely no family that goes untouched. If you would like to go to the Council of Economic Advisers web page, Mr. Speaker, you can see their most recent report, which suggests, on average, $4,000 in additional wages for every wage earner in this country, every family in this country, making a difference for economic growth. We all know that economic growth matters. More jobs mean more pressure on labor. More pressure on labor means higher wages. Higher wages mean more income for the Federal Government in taxes and more income for families to put into their pocket. We are hearing about zombies and surprises and tricks. You can tell that Halloween is right around the corner, and scaring folks is kind of the tagline of Halloween, Mr. Speaker; and, sadly, that is what we see going on here today. I promise you, you have not heard a single bipartisan word about this tax plan from my friends on the other side, so I am going to provide those words for my friends. I will read from yesterday’s Wall Street Journal, Mr. Speaker: ‘‘In 2012, President Obama and his advisers proposed lowering the corporate tax rate because it ‘creates good jobs and good wages for the middle class folks who work at those businesses.’’’ b1315 We can argue about what the tax reform ought to look like. What we can’t argue about is the benefit for American families of tax reform. In 2013, Lawrence Summers, President Clinton’s Treasury Secretary and 
Chairman of President Obama’s Economic Council, argued that the tax on corporate profit creates a burden without commensurate revenues for the government, and that changing it is as close to a free lunch for the American taxpayer as reformers will ever get. That was President Obama’s Treasury Secretary. Again, we can argue about what it looks like. What we can’t argue about is what it is intended to do and what leading experts believe it will do. In 2015, Democrat CHUCK SCHUMER and Republican ROBPORTMAN cosponsored a Senate bill to reduce the top corporate tax rate, which is the highest of the 35 countries in the OECD today. As CHUCK SCHUMER says: ‘‘Our international tax system creates incentives to send jobs and stash profits overseas, rather than creating jobs and economic growth here in the United States.’’ We can fix that together, and we will fix that together. Bill Clinton, in 2016, said he regretted raising the corporate tax rate to its current level for exactly those reasons. Who is advantaged by trying to persuade the American people that something nefarious is going on here? Who is advantaged by that? I don’t know about my friend’s constituencies, Mr. Speaker, but my constituency wants to believe we are making things work together. My constituency wants to believe in rolling up our sleeves and sorting things out together. My constituency wants to believe that we are united in making a difference for them together. We have this opportunity. If we pass this rule and we concur in the underlying Senate amendment, we will move forward on tax reform that will leave no American family behind. The best government program we have in this country is the program that allows jobs to develop so folks can have one. The best program we have in this country, Mr. Speaker, is one that allows wages to rise so that folks can earn more. My constituency is not looking for anything from the other side of the aisle except cooperation on freeing up the marketplace so that my constituency can go to work, so that folks can go and make their own pathway and future forward. We can do it in ways we haven’t done together since 1986, Mr. Speaker. Who is advantaged by convincing folks that cooperation, consensus, making a different together is dead? I don’t believe anyone. In fact, I would tell you that not just the debate but the body politic is damaged by those concerns, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I hope we will join together and refute those. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would just say to the gentleman from Georgia, we don’t need lectures on cooperation and bipartisanship. We have offered to work with Republicans on tax reform. We have offered to work with Republicans on improving the Affordable Care Act. Every time the Republicans talk about rolling up their sleeves, we are not there. We are not invited. So if you want bipartisanship, open up this process. Go back to regular order. Hold hearings. Listen to our ideas. Don’t write bills in the back room and rush them to the floor and force the Members up here to vote up or down on them. Yes, we want cooperation. We want bipartisanship, but we don’t need any lectures from anybody on the other side of the aisle. This has been the most closed Congress in history. We don’t need any lectures on the importance of cooperation. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KIND). Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule because I rise in opposition to the underlying budget—a budget which is really a budget buster that could be before the full House for consideration tomorrow. It calls for an additional $1.5 trillion worth of debt accumulated over the next 10 years. They call for that, I fear, in order to clear the path for unpaid for tax cuts. There is a bipartisan path to move forward on tax reform. It has been 31 years since we have taken a serious run at the Federal code. It is long overdue. It is one that would simplify the code, that would broaden the base and lower the rates and make us more competitive at home, but especially abroad, in light of what the rest of the world has done. That can also help promote economic growth, but I fear that that is not the direction that the opposing party is taking with their tax reform proposal. I say fear because we haven’t seen the details yet. So we can’t say with certainty just what exactly will be offered over the next couple of weeks. But if history is any guide, there is a proclivity to pass large tax cuts that are not paid for. If history is a guide, we have been down this road before, in the 1981 tax cuts, the 2001, the 2003, that promised to bring a boon of economic growth that would offset and pay for the lost revenue. It didn’t materialize. Instead, we had huge budget deficits. Unfortunately, today, we don’t have the luxury of time to help us recover from a huge fiscal mistake. Because today, 70 million baby boomers are beginning their massive retirement and joining Social Security and Medicare—10,000 a day. If we go down this route of going with massive tax breaks that aren’t paid for, we are going to jeopardize the longterm solvency of Social Security and Medicare at exactly the wrong moment in our Nation’s history. The folks back home tell me they would like to see tax reform along the lines that I just described, but they are not telling me that they are more interested in trickledown economics where the predominant relief goes to the most wealthy, hoping that it somehow benefits everyone else. Now, they would like to see it a little fairer for working families, for small businesses, for family farmers so that they can share in the economic growth and the prosperity that could be offered if we do this the correct way in a bipartisan fashion. But instead, I fear that we are going to be witnessing history repeat itself. But unlike the time of the past, we don’t have the luxury of time going forward without jeopardizing Social Security and Medicare, and without leaving a legacy of debt once again for our children and grandchildren to inherit. So let’s regroup. Let’s do a budget that makes sense for the longterm fiscal solvency of important programs, but especially our children’s future. This budget doesn’t get us there. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to reject the rule and reject the budget if it comes up tomorrow. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I actually want to associate myself to my friend from Wisconsin’s comments. I can’t disagree with a word he said right up until it got to the end where he said to vote against the budget. Right up until there, we were on the same page. There is so much that we could do together. My friend spoke out on behalf of small businesses and family farmers. As the Tax Code exists today, when you see my friends put up charts about tax benefits going to the top 1 percent, they are talking about those small business and family farmers. They are talking about that small business in my district that has plowed every single penny back into the business—back into the business for new technology to make their employees more productive, back into the business to open up a new facility, back into the business to add more distribution, because they have got 350 families who depend on them to make that business successful so that those 350 families can put food on their table. But when the Tax Code is analyzed, Mr. Speaker, when the IRS sends back the statistics, that small business in my district that sends every single penny back into the business, they look rich. They look like they are the wealthiest, and they are not. They are those small family farmers. They are those small family businesses that are trying to make a difference. I want to say, because my friend from Wisconsin had a very significant concern about blowing holes in deficits, Mr. Speaker, as you know from your experience, one cannot pass tax reform that is permanent through reconciliation if it adds to deficits in the out years. That is what is so wonderful about this process, Mr. Speaker. I support what my friend from Wisconsin said about keeping an eye on deficits. I 
support what my friend said about making sure Medicare and Social Security are growing, which they do when people go back to work and when folks earn more money. I don’t want to be in the business of lecturing my colleagues, Mr. Speaker. I want to be in the business of working with my colleagues. But folks have a choice when they show up to work every day. Are we going to make this a day about arguing with one another? Are we going to tear something down today? Are we going to build something up today? I stand for building something today, Mr. Speaker. Unabashedly, let’s build something together today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ), the distinguished ranking member of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, certainly, my constituents in Texas would like to see the same spirit of togetherness that we have just heard about. How has that been handled in our Ways and Means Committee, and why do I call the claims of bipartisanship here a farce? Well, people in Texas would like to know: What is the effect of being taxed on our payment of property taxes? People in Michigan want to know: What is the effect of putting a cap on how much we can contribute to our retirement savings? Other people were concerned about adding $0.20 and a border adjustment tax to every purchase made from Mexico, or Canada, or elsewhere. Since May, I have been asking for hearings on these matters. I have been asking for one single Trump administration official to have the courage to come in front of our committee and answer questions about their proposal and the great gap between what President Trump says one day, and what they do the next. They have refused every day. We have been here all of September. We have been here all of October. They have refused to have a single hearing with a single Trump official because they plan to jam through—while they yell ‘‘kumbaya,’’ they plan to jam through a gift to the superrich and the multinationals that keep shipping these jobs offshore. And they don’t want any accountability for it. They don’t want any public involvement either. They want the public to know as little about the details of their sham as possible. That is why they will have it introduced next week, passed in committee the following week, forced onto this floor and into the Senate, and the American people have to understand and speak up and say ‘‘no.’’ Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to say I don’t want to sneak anything past anybody. I want to claim full and total credit for what we are about to do together. I don’t want anybody to be confused about whose fault it is. It is my fault. When we get tax reform and get this economy growing again, blame me. When we can see wages rising in this country again, blame me. When we have an opportunity to go from worst to first in the international business community, blame me. I don’t want anybody to believe there is anybody hiding here, Mr. Speaker. I share with my friend from Massachusetts that I do not have any speakers remaining, and I am prepared to close when he is. Truth needs no defense, I would say to my friend. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, today we are considering a budget that will basically pave the way so we can bring up a massive tax cut for billionaires. Again, the gentleman from Georgia mentioned the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in his opening remarks, and this chart is based on their analysis. Basically, let me repeat, the top 1 percent get 80 percent of all the benefits. If you think that that is fair, if you think that that is representing your constituents, then go ahead and vote for this budget, because it is paving the way for a tax cut that will do just this. I don’t think it is fair. I don’t think anybody on the Democratic side of the aisle thinks it is fair, and I am hoping that there are some on the Republican side of the aisle who think that that is not fair as well. The gentleman from Georgia talks about cooperation and about we need to get along. I mean, who disagrees with that? But actions speak louder than words. You can’t talk about open, transparent processes and then, as we just heard from the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ), have the Ways and Means Committee which is writing this tax bill behind closed doors without any help from the Democrats, but having no hearings—not allowing any administration official to come up and testify. How is that an open and transparent process? How does that encourage the spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship? I mean, I thought my friends would have learned from their terrible experience with their repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act what happens when you write bills behind closed doors without bipartisan input, without even the committees of jurisdiction, by the way, in that case, deliberating on what the final product should be. I thought you would have learned from that process, and you ended up failing at the end of the day. I hope that this effort that my Republican friends are now undertaking for tax cuts for wealthy people in this country, I hope that that fails as well. A lousy process usually leads to a lousy product. My friends on the other side of the aisle have mastered the art of lousy processes. In the Rules Committee, almost virtually everything is closed. Everything is shut down. Germane amendments routinely deny the ability for Members to offer them on the House floor because the Republicans don’t want to deal with them. They are afraid they might lose. They don’t want to have the debate. If you want cooperation, if you want a bipartisan tax reform bill, then you just can’t say it; you have to do something. In 1986, the last time Congress did a comprehensive tax reform, we had 30 days of full committee hearings spanning over a year. There were 26 days of markup between September and December. This time, the timelines being reported in the press are maybe just a week, or a little bit more, if that. b1330 Again, if recent history is any indication, we might not even get that. A bill might just miraculously appear one day and be rushed to the floor so that no one has time to read it or analyze it and so that none of our constituents have time to understand what is really happening here. So I go back to that chart. One percent—1 percent—of the wealthiest interests in this country get 80 percent of the tax breaks. If you think that that is fair, then vote for this budget, because this budget paves the way for that tax bill to move forward. If you care about a balanced budget and if you care about deficits and debt, please vote ‘‘no’’ on this budget, because this allows us to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Whatever happened to deficits matter? I guess it is inconvenient because tax cuts for billionaires matter more than deficits and passing on that debt to our kids. So I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question, to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule, to vote ‘‘no’’ on this budget, and to fight like hell against this horrendous tax cut plan that my friends on the Republican side are pushing. This is bad policy. This is bad for our country. This is bad for middle class families. This is bad for not only my constituents, I would argue it is bad for your constituents. It is about time that the people’s House starts enacting legislation that benefits the people of this country, not just a few who are well off and well connected. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, sometimes I wish I could bring school groups down here onto the House floor just to help the next generation understand why we face some of the challenges that we face. We are down here today confronted with a tax bill that folks are certain is going to give away everything to everybody whom they don’t want it to go to, and we are down here confronted with the fact that there is 
no tax bill whatsoever to look at and it is going to get sprung on folks with absolutely no notice and no ability to read it. Now, either one of those things could be true. It happens to be that neither of those things is true. But how in the world do folks listening to this debate think that we are advancing the cause of reform? Deficits do matter, to my friend’s point. They do matter, and the stranglehold that the Obama regulatory economy created here in America on economic growth reduced economic GDP growth by a full onethird—by a full onethird. For every 0.1 percent of GDP growth, we talk about 200 billion additional dollars coming in to the Treasury over the 10year window. So a full percentage point that we have lost is $2 trillion coming in to the Treasury. Mr. Speaker, if we had Bushera growth instead of Obamaera growth over these last 5 years, the budget would be balanced today. But we are where we are, and the question is: Can we do better tomorrow? We can. Now, before I talk about that, Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize some of the folks who helped to get us here. My friend from Massachusetts and I come down here and carry the debate, but the work goes on behind every single one of these doors and in every single one of these committee rooms. I serve on the Budget Committee, Mr. Speaker, and our staff director over there, Rick May, has done an amazing job shepherding this process, standing up for the House’s work product. Jenna Spealman, Andy Morton, Tim Flynn, Robert Cogan, Patrick Louis Knudsen, Jim Bates, Mary Popadiuk, Jonathan Romito, and Elise Anderson are all working day and night—and weekends, many times—to get this product to the floor. Steve Gonzalez, Eric Davis, Robert Yeakel, Ellen Johnson, Emily Goff, Brad Watson, Brittany Madni, and Steve Waskiewicz are folks, Mr. Speaker, who don’t come here because they have political passion; they come here because they have policy passion. They want to do those things that matter. They could go anywhere they want to in town and make more money, but they stay here working for the American people because they believe they can make a difference, and they are right. Mr. Speaker, they are right. They can make a difference. We can make a difference. This rule—this rule—if we pass it today, Mr. Speaker, will allow us to concur in the Senate amendment. Concurring in the Senate amendment does not bind us to the Senate process, but it enables us to move a bill that direction that they can process. We have seen the holdups in the Senate, Mr. Speaker. I am not happy about that. That is just the way Senate process is. We can do better. Reconciliation allows us to do better, and passing this rule enables us to do better. Vote ‘‘yes,’’ Mr. Speaker. Vote ‘‘yes’’ on this rule, and vote ‘‘yes’’ on the underlying budget and open yourself up to doing together what has not been done together in 31 years. I don’t just believe we can, I believe that we will. I am excited about it, I am proud of it, and I am ready to get to it, Mr. Speaker. Vote ‘‘yes.’’ Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee, I rise in strong opposition to Rule governing debate on the Senate Amendment to H. Con. Res. 71, the Congressional Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2018, and the underlying resolution. Let us be very clear and direct: the resolution before us is not intended to reconcile tax and spending priorities to reflect the priorities of the American people or to reduce the deficit and national debt or to put our fiscal house on a sustainable path to economic growth. Rather the sole purpose of Republicans bringing this jobkilling budget to the floor today is to fasttrack their ‘‘Billionaires First’’ tax plan, which will cause significant harm to working and middle class families, especially to my constituents in the Eighteenth Congressional District of Texas. The McConnellRyan tax plan, which this budget resolution is designed to grease the skids for, would raise taxes on about 1.5 million Texas households, or 12.4 percent of households next year. On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a $794 increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on families struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook. An estimated 2.8 million Texas households deduct state and local taxes with an average deduction of $7,823 in 2015. The McConnellRyan plan eliminates this deduction, which would lower home values and put pressure on states and towns to collect revenues they depend on to fund schools, roads, and vital public resources. The proposed elimination of the personal exemption will harm millions of Texans by taking away the $4,050 deduction for each taxpayer and claimed dependent; in 2015, roughly 9.3 million dependent exemptions were claimed in the Lone Star State. Equally terrible is that the McConnellRyan tax plan drastically reduces the Earned Income Tax Credit, which encourages work for 2.7 million lowincome individuals in Texas, helping them make ends meet with an average credit of $2,689. The EITC and the Child Tax Credit lift about 1.2 million Texans, including 663,000 children, out of poverty each year. This reckless and irresponsible GOP tax plan is made all the more obscene by the fact that 80 percent of the GOP’s tax cuts go to the wealthiest 1 percent. To achieve this goal of giving more and more to the haves and the ‘‘have mores,’’ the GOP budget betrays seniors, children, the most vulnerable, and needy, and working and middleclass families. For example, the Republican budget steals hundreds of billions of dollars from critical job creating investments in infrastructure, job training, clean energy and research and development. It devastates Medicare and Medicaid by cutting $500 billion from Medicare and $1.3 trillion from Medicaid, hurting veterans, seniors with longterm care needs, children and rural communities. The GOP budget’s steep cuts in program investments fall most heavily on lowincome families, students struggling to afford college, seniors, and persons with disabilities. This Republican budget adopts Trumpcare but does even more damage because in addition to depriving more than 20 million Americans of healthcare, denying protection to persons with preexisting conditions, and raising costs for older and lowincome adults, cuts more than $1.8 trillion from Medicaid and Medicare. This Republican budget ends the Medicare guarantee and calls for replacing Medicare’s guaranteed benefits with fixed payments for the purchase of health insurance, shifting costs and financial risks onto seniors and disabled workers; this represents a $500 billion cut to Medicare over ten years. Mr. Speaker, the federal budget is more than a financial document; it is an expression of our values and priorities as a nation. The values expressed by this Republican budget are not the values of my constituents, the people of Texas, or the American people as a whole. For these reasons, I oppose the Rule and the underlying budget resolution. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 580 O FFERED BY  MR. MCGOVERN  Strike all after the resolved clause and insert: That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to take from the Speaker’s table the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 71) establishing the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2018 and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2019 through 2027, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House, without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on the Budget or her designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment with the amendment specified in section 2 of this resolution. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of the question. SEC. 2. The amendment referred to in section 1 is as follows: At the end of the Senate amendment, add the following new section: 
‘‘SEC. lll. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST ANY TAX BILL THAT RAISES TAXES ON MIDDLECLASS FAMILIES BY ELIMINATING OR LIMITING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION. 
(a) P OINT OF ORDER .—It shall not be in order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses, or conference report that repeals or limits the State and Local Tax Deduction (26 U.S.C. 164). (b) WAIVER AND APPEAL .—Subsection (a) may be waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of threefifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.

The question of consideration shall be debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating the point of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but shall otherwise be decided without intervening motion except one that the House adjourn.’’ 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. WOODALL.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, October 25, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER : Pursuant to the permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Clerk received the following message from the Secretary of the Senate on October 25, 2017, at 11:47 a.m.: That the Senate passed with an amendment H.R. 304.

HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. Let me thank our chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, my friend, EDROYCE from California, for his work moving this bill. I was pleased to join him as the lead Democratic cosponsor when we introduced this bill in March of this year. I stand by his entire statement that he has just made. We have an absolute meeting of the minds on this bill, and that is why we were able to get 323 cosponsors on both sides of the aisle, because people understand and realize the threat that Iran poses to us, to the world, and to our allies. The Foreign Affairs Committee has been hard at work this year devising new tools and approaches for dealing with the threat of Iran. There is no doubt that Iran must be one of our major priorities in our foreign policy, the world’s most prolific state sponsor of terrorism, a serial abuser of human rights, a lifeline for the murderous 
Assad regime in Syria, and the challenge we are dealing with today: Iran’s illicit development of ballistic missiles. The chairman and I share the view that when it comes to the nuclear deal, which we both opposed, the best path forward is to enforce the hell out of it even while we work to hold Iran’s feet to the fire on all these other harmful activities. We passed a tough sanctions bill last summer to crack down on Iran, as well as North Korea and Russia. While the bill before us today basically contains very similar provisions which we dealt with then and, as the chairman explained, we go one step further here, I am always eager to find even more ways to dial up pressure on the regime in Tehran, which is a malevolent regime, which is a regime that sponsors terrorism, which is a regime that is hostile to the United States, hostile to our ally Israel, and hostile to our other allies in the Middle East. But I worry that the administration isn’t taking this problem seriously. So far, the White House hasn’t fully implemented the previous bill we sent to the President. The White House’s approach to the nuclear deal sends a bad message to allies and adversaries around the world that the United States might not live up to its word. Rather than extracting more concessions with Iran, which I believe may be possible by working hard to build a strong multilateral coalition, the course of this may instead push Iran to leave the deal and resume work on a bomb. We can never allow that to happen. So I am happy that we keep passing the sanctions bills, but Congress’ role can only go so far. It is up to the administration to lay out its goals, devise a strategy, and implement the tough sanctions Congress has passed. It is more than 60 days since we passed the sanctions bill, and the President has not implemented it. According to the bill, which the President signed, it was supposed to be implemented within 60 days, so it sends a mixed message. Talking tough is not enough. Congress sends a bill to the White House, the President signs it, it really should be implemented. So I want to urge the President and the administration to listen to this Congress in a bipartisan way. We passed this bill. It needs to be implemented, and it needs to be passed and implemented again. In the meantime, I am happy to support this bill. I think this shows that we need to work together when it comes to Iran in a bipartisan way to show that there is really not a shred of difference, that we will not stand for Iran’s aggression, we will not stand for the mullahs threatening us, we will not stand for Iran stomping on its own people. Mr. Speaker, I again thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue. I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security. He is a former Federal prosecutor and a senior member of our Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, let me first commend Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL for their strong bipartisan work on this very important legislation that sanctions Iran’s ballistic missile program and the Iranianbacked terror group Hezbollah. Over the last several decades, the tyrannical regime in Iran has been racing to develop a nuclear weapons program that could threaten the United States and our allies and potentially spark an arms race in the Middle East. Unfortunately, the extremely flawed JCPOA kept parts of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in place and strengthened the regime’s leader with a windfall of cash. Because this toothless deal failed to address Iran’s other malign activities, such as support for terror and their intercontinental ballistic missile program, we must now find other ways to apply new pressure. Fortunately, the House is taking action today. One of the bills we are considering will require the President to impose additional sanctions on enemies and individuals supporting Iran’s development of ballistic missiles. I sincerely hope that we can soon add even more pressure on Iran by designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization, legislation I pursued in the last two Congresses. Going after state sponsors is an important part of winning this fight, but we must fight also directly individual terror groups to limit the resources to prevent future attacks. That is why I am pleased that we also are considering measures to target Hezbollah. This package would direct the President to impose new sanctions on financial institutions and foreign governments that support Hezbollah and affiliated organizations, as well as individual members of the terror groups, that they have used civilians as human shields. b1445 I will say it is Hezbollah that killed so many of our marines in Beirut, Lebanon, let us not forget. The chairman and ranking member and I recently visited Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu, who described the Shia Crescent of Iran going into Iraq, into Syria, into Lebanon. He talked to us about the manufacturing plant in Lebanon manufacturing rockets pointed straight at the State of Israel. These bills, I believe, will take us steps closer toward ridding the world of this terrible threat posed by Islamic terror. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), the esteemed majority leader of the House. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. I want to thank the gentleman for his work as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. Speaker, I stand on this floor thinking of the world and America’s place in it. What I desire most is peace. America has no desire to fight those who do not harm us. I would gladly support any international agreement that I thought would bring us to an honorable and enduring peace. But peace is not based on hope; it is not based on good intentions; and it is not based on pieces of paper signed at wellplanned ceremonies. Peace is based on strength. America and our allies will only be at peace if those who hate us fear us. This is where our credibility matters. When an American President agrees to a deal that is so obviously unequal and untenable, everyone stops fearing us. They start to think they can push us around. Let me be clear. They may start to push, but no one can knock us down. America will win any fight. Our enemies should know that. But, frankly, I want our enemies to be so afraid of us they don’t even want to fight. That saves everyone a great deal of trouble. When I look back to our nuclear deal with North Korea and our deal with Iran, they aren’t just flawed; they are dangerous. The displays of weakness have consequences beyond nuclear weapons. Our North Korea deal has failed. The Kim regime will soon have nuclear warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles. These warheads will be capable of hitting our homeland. In the meantime, they have reportedly fired missiles over our allies South Korea and Japan and, almost daily, threatened war. The deal with Iran is on a path to failure, designed in such a way that, even if it were followed, a regime that chants ‘‘death to America’’—let me say that again, a regime that chants ‘‘death to America’’—could have nuclear weapons the day after the deal expires. Even ignoring the deal, Iran continues to destabilize the region for its own goal, funding terrorism abroad and fueling violence between Shia and Sunni Muslims that is tearing the Middle East apart. The spread of nuclear weapons is a danger in and of itself. I do not need to explain why enemies of the United States should be stopped from gaining the power to level American cities, but the evil is made worse when our enemies, with any weapons, think they can push America and our allies around. America will not be weak any longer. Today’s sanction on Iran undermines its ballistic missile program and the terrorist warriors of Hezbollah whose pockets are filled with Iranian money, 
just as their hands are covered with American blood. This is an important part of our Nation’s new Iran strategy. Yesterday, we passed the most far reaching sanctions we have ever imposed on North Korea. Those who do business with North Korea support a regime run on slave labor. They support a regime that deprives its citizens of every freedom, even the freedom to think, and they support a regime that tortured and murdered American citizen Otto Warmbier not because he committed a crime or threatened their government in any way, but because he was an American. If you do business with such a regime, there will be severe consequences. I had the honor of meeting Otto’s parents, Cindy and Fred. They told me about Otto’s warmth, his joy, his love of life, and the great hopes he had. In everything, he stood as a living example of the good in humanity that the Kim regime seeks to destroy. We renamed that legislation as the Otto Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions Act. It won’t bring him back, but it will remind North Korea that evil has consequences. Otto’s murder was a crime we cannot accept, but it is a crime, I fear, our enemies would repeat on a much larger scale if we do not start stopping them now. Let’s remind them who they are up against. America will not fail. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, and she is the author of multiple laws addressing the Iranian threat. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE for authoring this bill alongside our good friend Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL , the dynamic duo of Foreign Affairs. I want to thank them for their leadership and their continued effort in holding Iran accountable. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill is called the Iran Ballistic Missile and International Sanctions Enforcement Act, authored by our chairman and ranking member. It is a strong and important bill. It sanctions Iranian and foreign persons and entities that support, that facilitate, that finance Iran’s ballistic missile program. It is a necessary measure because, as we know, Iran has felt emboldened to continue advancing its missile program since the P5+1 and Iran concluded the weak nuclear deal. Tehran has taken advantage of this deal and the U.N. Security Council resolution that endorsed the agreement. Despite language that prohibits Iran’s ballistic missile testing in U.N. Resolution 2231, Iran has actually increased its missile activities, violating both the spirit and the letter of the resolution. With the President having made his determination 2 weeks ago that Iran is not in compliance with its commitments under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, we now have an opportunity to address the weakness in the nuclear deal and also Iran’s illicit activity. We must continue to press forward on a dual track. We must continue to hold Iran accountable for its nonnuclear illicit activity, while also looking to address our concerns with the nuclear deal. They are not mutually exclusive, Mr. Speaker. Both are extremely important for our national security. This is an important step. I thank the Members for their great leadership. I support passage of Chairman ROYCE and E LIOT ENGEL ’s measure. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). He is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for this legislation. Mr. Speaker, Iran continues to be one of the two greatest threats to the United States’ national security and to global security. The other, of course, is North Korea. It has become very clear that the Iranian deal has not moderated the regime. Regardless of where people are on whether we should have signed it or not signed it, it hasn’t stopped the aggressive activity and belief of the regime. I believe that they are still developing or trying to develop nuclear weapons. No one denies that Iran is actively working toward developing a delivery capability for a nuclear payload. Iran’s ballistic missile program is going to be and already is a menace not only to the United States, but to Europe and other parts of the world. Iran is working with North Korea to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching our shores. These two nations engage in their activity and belief in hate—hate—of freedom to destroy the United States and our some of our allies. We should understand that this is a reality and the threat is now. We should deal with both of those countries accordingly, not in 10 years. This legislation, Mr. ROYCE ’s Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act, is very crucial. We must hold the Ayatollah accountable for threatening the global security and our security. We must hold the Ayatollah and the IRGC and Hezbollah accountable for the people that have been murdered throughout the world because of their response to hate, their hating of all peoples who don’t agree with them. We must target the entire global supply chain of Iran’s ballistic missile program. I believe the Ayatollah, Mr. Speaker, when he tells us, on a periodic basis, ‘‘Death to America.’’ I believe him when he says that. That is their foreign policy to the United States: ‘‘Death to America.’’ Americans should believe this. Mr. Speaker, we must make sure that he does not have the capability to achieve a delivery system of his nuclear weapons, and I urge voting in favor of H.R. 1698. Mr. Speaker, I also do want to mention another bill that I think is important that we pass today, Mr. DEUTCH ’s H.R. 359. In 2013, the European Union finally came around to designating Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, but for reasons that make absolutely no sense to me, the Europeans only designated Hezbollah’s military wing, not the political wing. By distinguishing between a terrorist group’s socalled military and political wings, it seems like we have legitimized this group’s deadly behavior. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, and wherever you look in the Middle East and you find trouble, you will find the IRGC and Hezbollah working together. These two agencies from Iran are the gestapo actors for the Iranian Ayatollah, and it is time that we hold them accountable for what they are doing. We must pass these pieces of legislation, and this will go a long way in doing that. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as we have shown again and again, and you can tell with all the comments that were made here, there is support on both sides of the aisle for holding Iran accountable for its dangerous behavior. While today’s bill is similar to the bipartisan sanctions Congress passed during the summer, the direction we are moving today with this bill is the right one: going after Iran for something outside the scope of the nuclear deal. When the nuclear deal was negotiated, we were told very clearly that it would not prevent us, would not stop us from slapping sanctions on Iran for other things, other things like support of terrorism or ballistic missiles, or all the troublemaking activities that they do. This is what we are doing today. We are slapping sanctions on Iran for its behavior. We are slapping sanctions on Iran because we are not going to stand for their doing whatever they please and helping terrorism, suppressing rights of its people, and being a general threat to the United States. b1500 So I hope that we can get a strong, bipartisan, overwhelming vote for this bill the way we did in the bill that Chairman ROYCE and I introduced 3 
months ago, again, which gave the President 60 days to identify sanctions, which was not done beyond the 60 days, and I hope that the administration forthwith does that now. So I think this is an important measure. I think it is an important measure to have a strong bipartisan vote because we have to show the Iranians that, while we may disagree on certain things, there is no disagreement on the fact that we regard Iran as the largest state sponsor of terrorism. It is true of both sides of the aisle that we regard Iran as threatening; that we regard Iran as dangerous in the Middle East; that we regard Iran, unfortunately, as an adversary of the United States. The comments with the rallies that the Ayatollah holds, death to America, death to Israel, is not something that we can countenance in this country, and so we are going to fight it. I am very proud of what the House is doing today. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. And I want to thank Chairman ROYCE , once again, for his strong leadership on this measure and so many other measures. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to submit any statements or any material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all our members who worked on this bill. Over the last few years, the Foreign Affairs Committee has conducted dedicated oversight of the threats posed by Iran, and we have had dozens of hearings. And whether the topic was the nuclear program, or the missile program, or Iran’s support for terrorism, or the regime’s human rights abuses, the conclusion was clear. The United States must respond to the full range of threats, and with this bill and the others before us, that is what we are doing here today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1698, and am proud to cosponsor the Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enhancement Act because we must do everything in our power to curb, and ultimately put an end to Iran’s malign behavior in the Middle East region and across the globe. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231, which governs implementation of the JCPOA, contains travel restrictions for certain Iranian individuals. One such individual is Commander of the IRGC’s Quds Force, General Qasem Soleimani. There are troubling reports that General Soleimani has traveled to Russia, and other countries, in violation of UNSCR 2231, yet, the United States and the United Nations have failed to act. I am pleased my amendment to require a report on any credible information regarding violations of the UN travel restrictions and any exemptions that have been approved by the Security Council is included in this bill. These travel restrictions were put in place for good reason and we deserve to know whether in fact violations have occurred and what the U.S. and UN plan to do in response. I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 1698. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1698, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
SANCTIONING HIZBALLAH’S ILLICIT USE OF CIVILIANS AS DEFENSELESS SHIELDS ACT Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3342) to impose sanctions on foreign persons that are responsible for gross violations of internationally recognized human rights by reason of the use by Hizballah of civilians as human shields, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3342 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Sanctioning Hizballah’s Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act’’. 
Congress finds the following: (1) Human shields are civilians, prisoners of war, and other noncombatants whose presence is designed to protect combatants and military objects from attack, and the use of human shields violates international law. (2) Throughout the 2006 conflict with the State of Israel, Hizballah forces utilized human shields to protect themselves from counterattacks by Israeli forces, including storing weapons inside civilian homes and firing rockets from inside populated civilian areas. (3) Hizballah has rearmed to include an arsenal of over 150,000 missiles, and other destabilizing weapons provided by the Syrian and Iranian governments, which are concealed in Shiite villages in southern Lebanon, often beneath civilian infrastructure. (4) Hizballah is legally required to disarm under both United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006) and the Taif Agreement (1989). (5) Hizballah maintains an armed military force within Lebanon’s sovereign territory in direct violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006), thus preventing Lebanon from exerting its lawful control over its internationally recognized borders. SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It shall be the policy of the United States to consider the use of human shields by Hizballah as a gross violation of internationally recognized human rights, to officially and publicly condemn the use of innocent civilians as human shields by Hizballah, and to take effective action against those that engage in the grave breach of international law through the use of human shields. 
The President should direct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations Security Council to secure support for a resolution that would impose multilateral sanctions against Hizballah for its use of civilians as human shields.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members might have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am rising in strong support to this Shields Act, as we call it, which sanctions Hezbollah, sanctions them for their use in southern Lebanon of not only families, but entire villages as human shields; and let me explain this. As we have discussed today, the Iranianbacked terrorist organization, Hezbollah, has constructed an entire military apparatus in the nation that sits just north of Israel’s northern border in Lebanon. It is now complete with missile production facilities that are intended to strike at Israel’s civilian centers. I do want to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER ) for his leadership because he has helped bring this critical attention to us today. But, in the process, as we talk about Hezbollah, they have placed Israeli and Lebanese civilians directly into the path of the conflict. If you go to that border, as I have done, you can see command post after command post, not manned by the Lebanese Armed Forces. Those flags you see are not Lebanese flags, they are Hezbollah battle flags. And they man those posts, surrounded by antitank and infantry positions, surrounded by underground tunnels and rocket launchers and arms depots. In short, countless Lebanese villages are, in effect, military bases, the ones that are right along that border, financed and equipped by Iran. No one has the right to sacrifice the lives of innocent women and children, and certainly not those dedicated to the twisted and evil goals of destroying the State of Israel. When I say I have seen this firsthand, in 2006, I was in Haifa during the war that Hezbollah was conducting with Israel, and Hezbollah forces used human shields extensively in a cowardly effort to protect their rocket launchers from counterattacks by Israeli forces. I watched as those rockets came into civilian populations in Haifa and exploded there, and sent those civilians to the trauma hospital. In Rambam trauma hospital, as they were bringing people in, I asked for the count that day. There were 600 victims, wounded victims of those attacks, being treated in that hospital—Arab Israelis, Jewish Israelis, Druid Israelis, all of them victims of those Hezbollah attacks. It seems—and by the way, when you see the devastation, every one of those Iranianmade missiles has 90,000 ball bearings in it, and that is what they are launching on schools, civilian areas. They attempted to hit the hospital itself. It seems that Hezbollah and its Iranian backers are willing to fight to the 
last villager there in their quest to annihilate the people of Israel, yet neither Hezbollah nor Iran has been held to account by responsible nations for these egregious crimes. While Foreign Minister Zarif of Iran was coddled by the EU, this issue was never raised, not by us, not by the EU. We never raised this with the Iranians as a serious issue. We have to because the willingness to overlook these human rights violations is why we find ourselves in the position that we are in today and why this legislation is critically important. This bill calls on the U.S. and its partners to hold Hezbollah and Iran accountable through targeted sanctions and appropriate action at the United Nations Security Council. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

R OYCE , Chairman. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this measure. Let me start off by thanking Representatives GALLAGHER of Wisconsin and SUOZZI of New York. Mr. S UOZZI is a very valued, new member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I want to thank both of them for their hard work on this bill. And, as always, I want to thank Chairman ROYCE for his leadership. This is the first of three measures that we are considering today to crack down on the terrorist group, Hezbollah. I have been focused on this challenge for a long time. More than a decade ago, I wrote a law to get Syria out of Lebanon and, with it, Syria’s support for Hezbollah. But this is a group made up of extremists, and they will always try to find new ways to gather resources and spread their reach, all in aid of its dangerous and violent agenda, which is undermining Lebanon’s political independence; supporting Iran’s activities, aggressive activities throughout the region; fueling chaos and war in Syria; and threatening our ally, Israel. We need to do everything in our power to isolate Hezbollah. We need to crack down on its recruiters and financiers. We need to cut off its supply of weapons, and we need to silence its propaganda machine. The three measures we will now consider will help us meet this challenge. The first is a new sanctions bill aimed at Hezbollah’s use of innocent civilians as human shields. It would ban entry into the United States to anyone who uses human shields on behalf of Hezbollah, and it would freeze whatever assets they have in the United States. This bill would call upon our Ambassador to the U.N. to push for multilateral sanctions for the same behavior, and it would require the administration to keep Congress apprised about whether certain Hezbollah leaders would be caught up in the web of these sanctions. It is a good bill and a piece of a broader strategy to cut the legs out from under this odious group. You know, some our friends in Europe like to say: Well, there are really two parts of Hezbollah. One is the military wing, and one is the humanitarian wing, and the socalled humanitarian wing takes care of people who are in trouble, who need aid, who need help, and that is the way the story goes. The fact is, a terrorist organization is a terrorist organization. You cannot cut it in half and say one wing is good and the other wing is not. A terrorist organization is not good. A terrorist organization kills innocent people. A terrorist organization doesn’t want peace, they want war, they want killing, they want people to continue to suffer. So let us remember, Hezbollah is a terrorist group. Hezbollah is primarily financed by Iran. Assad was losing the war in Syria on at least two occasions, and, on those times, Syria had an infusion of Hezbollah fighters sent by Iran on the side of the Assad regime to prop up Assad. And after they did it, the Russians came in and propped up Assad. So let’s remember the hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians who have been murdered in Syria in the Syria civil war. That is Hezbollah, a terrorist organization—bombs in Israel against innocent civilians, bombs every place else. We cannot sit idly by. And so this bill, again, is a piece of a broader strategy to cut the legs out from under this odious group. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support it. I urge everyone to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER ). He is a member of the Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees. He is also the author of this bill, along with Mr. TOMSUOZZI of New York. Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 3342, the Sanctioning Hizballah’s Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act. First and foremost, I would like to thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for their steadfast support of this effort and their broader leadership, not only in the Middle East and as it pertains to rolling back Iran’s influence in their terrorist proxies, foremost among them Hezbollah, but also as it pertains to making the case 
for American leadership in the world, making the case for why American leadership, buttressed by its strong alliances, is a sound investment in our safety here at home. I would also like to thank my friend and colleague, TOMSUOZZI , for his tireless work to make this bill a reality. He and his staff have been a pleasure to work with every step along the way, and I think he is a perfect example of someone who is here and unafraid to reach across the aisle when it comes to doing what is right for the country. Mr. Speaker, this bill comes at an extremely important time, when Iran and its proxies, such as Hezbollah, are making a concerted push on the ground in the Middle East against the United States, our allies, and our interests. This isn’t a new phenomenon, of course. Since its founding in the early 1980s, Hezbollah has been one of the most dangerous and destructive forces throughout the greater Middle East. With the exception of alQaida, no foreign terrorist organization has killed more Americans than Hezbollah. b1515 With the support of the Iranian Government and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hezbollah has engaged in a sustained campaign of terrorism and violence, including against the United States and Israel. Congress, along with the United Nations, has repeatedly documented Hezbollah’s numerous violations of international law, including employing human shields throughout the 2006 conflict; concealing an arsenal that has grown to over 150,000 missiles and other destabilizing weapons provided by the Syrian and Iranian Governments in southern Lebanon, often beneath civilian infrastructure; and maintaining an armed military force within Lebanon’s sovereign territory in direct violation of numerous U.N. Security Council resolutions, thus preventing Lebanon from exerting its lawful control over its internationally recognized borders. The State Department designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997, leading to the creation of a sanctions regime against the group. Despite these sanctions, Hezbollah has continued to expand its military capabilities due in large part to extensive Iranian financial support. The State Department has continually expressed alarm at Hezbollah’s capabilities and influence, describing the group in 2010 as ‘‘the most technically capable terrorist group in the world.’’ In 2013, State Department noted the increasing tempo of Hezbollah’s terrorist activities. Despite its extensive track record of terror, Hezbollah has yet to be specifically sanctioned by the United States for its barbaric practice of using defenseless civilians as human shields. The Shields Act finally changes that and finally punishes Hezbollah for these atrocities. Just a few of the measures included in the Shields Act include: identifying and sanctioning Hezbollah members and those acting on behalf of Hezbollah who are complicit in or responsible for ordering or directing the use of human shields; identifying and sanctioning foreign persons, agencies, or instrumentalities of foreign states who have provided, attempted to provide, or facilitated provision of material support to identified individuals; and invoking financial penalties blocking real estate transactions, and leveraging powers ascribed by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In short and in sum, the Shields Act is a vital and bipartisan bill that advances American interest, punishes those who support and enable the barbaric practice of using human shields, and protects our allies in the region. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this critical legislation, and I thank the chairman again for his help and leadership. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SUOZZI ), my colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee, a fellow New Yorker, and one of the new good members of our committee, and coauthor of this important bill. Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by thanking Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member E NGEL for their bipartisan leadership and the model that they show all of us on this committee in the work that they do together, and for their mentorship as well. I would also like to thank and applaud my colleague and friend, MIKE GALLAGHER , for his leadership on this bill, and for working so closely to get this done. We are very grateful to him for his work here. The Shields Act that I rise in support of right now will sanction Hezbollah members and their supporters for the use of human shields. It also seeks to punish the governments that enable such war crimes, including their primary supporter, Iran. This summer, I visited Israel and I stood near Lebanon’s southern border, not far from where Hezbollah threatens Israel’s security. In the over 30 years since Hezbollah in 1983 killed hundreds of Americans when it bombed the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, they have become one of the most dangerous terrorist organizations, not only in Lebanon, but across the entire Middle East. In 2006, it provoked a war with Israel by killing and kidnapping soldiers in crossborder raids, and then for nearly a month rained rockets down on Israel cities, killing dozens of civilians. Journalists and human rights groups found that it fired many of these rockets from populated areas, even from inside private homes and other civilian buildings. That war ended more than a decade ago, but Hezbollah remains committed to Israel’s destruction. It has spent millions to replenish its arsenal, which now includes up to 150,000 missiles scattered across southern Lebanon, much of it concealed in mosques, hospitals, schools, and homes where civilians are used as human shields. Hezbollah has continued its provocative actions on the border between Lebanon and Israel. It has killed and wounded Israeli soldiers. It has threatened bombings of gas fields and chemical plants. It has tried to smuggle advanced weapons into Lebanon. It has built an expansive network of tunnels through civilian neighborhoods. The civilians caught in its destructive web of terror would have no safe haven if Hezbollah started a war. Hezbollah has also expanded its nefarious activities regionally, most notably playing a major role in the Syrian civil war, deploying thousands of its own men to prop up Bashar al Assad’s vicious regime. Hezbollah members are fighting alongside a Syrian army that has killed almost half a million of its own people and driven millions more into exile. In the process, it has trained for its next war with Israel. The Israeli intelligence official have said that the group has learned frightening skills in urban warfare from its years on the ground in Syria. It did all of this, of course, at the behest of its Iran patrons who continue threatening to rain warheads down into Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. From Iraq to Gaza, from Yemen to Bahrain, Iran’s proxies have been at the center of the chaos consuming the Middle East. But Hezbollah remains Iran’s oldest and deadliest proxy, and its actions in Syria deserve particular attention. In town after town, Hezbollah’s militants prevented civilians from fleeing the Assad regime artillery. Activists have accused the group of carrying out mass killings and torturing refugees and other civilians. Hezbollah is one of the main reasons Assad’s murderous regime continues to stay in power in 2017. Hezbollah is not only a threat to the people beyond Lebanon’s border, it is a threat to the Lebanese people. The U.N. has implicated Hezbollah in the assassination of a Lebanese Prime Minister. Its use of civilians as human shields endangers the Lebanese people every moment of every day. I applaud the leadership and the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee for continuing to find ways to crack down on Hezbollah and Iran. Today there are four suspension bills on the calendar: H.R. 1698, the Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act, which prevents Iran from undertaking any activity related to advancing their ballistic missiles program; H.R. 3329, Hizballah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act of 2017, which restricts Hezbollah’s ability to raise money and recruit for their nefarious activities; H. Res. 359, which urges our European allies to drop their false distinction between Hezbollah’s political 
wing and its military wing, and designate them in their entirety as a terrorist organization; and, finally, my and Mr. GALLAGHER ’s legislation, H.R. 3342, the Shields Act. We must pass these four bills to continue to reduce the influence of a group and its primary backer, Iran, that have menaced their neighbors and their own people for far too long. By passing H.R. 3342, the bipartisan Shields Act, we will send a strong message that the United States of America will not stand for the use of innocent civilians as pawns in the destructive chess game of Iran’s and Hezbollah’s effort to destabilize the region and the West. Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleague, Congressman GALLAGHER , for his leadership. I am proud to join him in this effort. I ask my colleagues for their support. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, you can say that again. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be here with Ranking Member ENGEL and Chairman ROYCE . I want to congratulate both of them on the great work that they are doing on especially Middle East issues. Over and over again, they have been on top of the situation and making sure that America’s position and the moral position of the world is declared by this Congress. Today we have four bills that are in keeping with that tradition and the great job that they have already been doing. First of all, let us just note that this human shield legislation, whatever way Hezbollah acts, it is worth us saying: Look how horrible it is. Look at the horrible tactics they are using. It is worth us having a resolution to draw people’s attention to it, but let’s just be fair. What this is today is we are calling for peace in the Middle East. We are pleading with those people who have degenerated to the point that they are using innocent people as shields, where their bodies will be cut apart by shrapnel or by enemy fire. This is how far down those people who would destroy Israel have gone. So it is just and right for us today. Yes, they point out the human shields, but this is part of a bigger problem. That is, that you have the leadership in the Islamic world, in that part of the world anyway, in the Middle East. The Islamic leaders in that part of the world refuse to recognize Israel and its right to exist. Whether they are using their people as human shields and innocent people as human shields to accomplish their mission, whether they are allied with the mullah regime who chants ‘‘death to Israel,’’ no; when those people—and whether it is Iran or Hezbollah or their allies throughout the Middle East—recognize that Israel has a right to exist, a major step forward would happen. Instead, they play games about the right of return. So how would Israel ever be able to accept the fact that their country is going to be inundated with other people and taken over the minute they make some kind of an agreement to let them do so? What we are calling out for today is—yes, we are pointing our fingers at the immorality of Hezbollah and their association with both the mullahs and the tyrannical Assad regime in Syria. We point that out, but what we are really asking for is not just a condemnation. We are asking for peace. We are asking for these people to take a look at moral arguments. America is standing for these moral arguments. Please, we are pleading with you through these condemnations of immoral activity, we are pleading with you to reach a peace agreement with Israel and to reach a peace agreement with the other peoples of that region. I am very proud to stand with Mr. ROYCE and Mr. E NGEL , as all of us are, in the bipartisan effort to make sure America stands for truth, justice, and morality. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL ), a valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the bipartisan leadership of this committee. Mr. Speaker, this week marks the 34th anniversary of the devastating Marine Corps barracks bombing in Lebanon. As the very proud mother of a U.S. marine, this is deeply personal to me. My son returned safely from his tours of service. Not so blessed were the families of 220 marines and 21 other service personnel who were murdered when Hezbollah struck with truck bombs at a Marine Corps compound in Beirut, Lebanon, on October 23, 1983. The marines we lost that day were someone’s husband, father, brother, or son. Except for alQaida, Hezbollah has killed more Americans than any other terrorist group in the world, and it continues to be a menacing threat to all humanity. Just look at Syria, the greatest humanitarian crisis of our time: hundreds of thousands of civilians murdered; 5 million have fled as refugees; Hezbollah, a tool of Iran, propping up Assad and fueling the violence. Their actions don’t stop there. Israelis live under the constant shadow of Hezbollah’s missile arsenal that is pointed directly at them. In just a decade, they have increased their rocket count from 15,000 to 150,000. They hold the Lebanese people hostage by embedding weapons in their mosques, their hospitals, and their schools. These bipartisan bills before us that I wholeheartedly support will help America go after the full range of Hezbollah’s activities, sanctioning them for utilizing civilians as human shields, targeting Iran’s financial support to Hezbollah, and urging the European Union to designate Hezbollah in its entirety as a terrorist organization. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of these bills. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LETHINEN ), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our dynamic duo once again for this wonderful legislation and for bringing this bill before us this afternoon. I rise in strong support of H.R. 3342, Sanctioning Hizballah’s Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act, authored by our friends, Congressmen GALLAGHER and S UOZZI . I thank the gentleman for their leadership. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I applaud our effort here in the House to take up several measures, as you have heard, that address a variety of threats that Iran and its proxies pose to our national security and the security of those in the region. The use of human shields is unconscionable, morally unacceptable, and a clear violation of human rights. Yet for terrorist groups such as Iran proxies, Hezbollah, and Hamas, the use of human shields is an acceptable tactic. It is a tactic used because they engage in terror activity and asymmetric warfare. They don’t have the same beliefs and morals of the United States or Israel. b1530 It is an attempt to cause innocents to be dragged into their conflict and to cause as many casualties as they can with no regard whatsoever for human life. Iran and Hezbollah know that if they engage in hostilities with Israel, the world will be quick to blame Israel for civilian deaths despite the great precautions Israel takes to not only save human lives, but to only go against belligerents. Responsible nations must condemn this tactic by Hezbollah and by all of its state sponsors of terrorism. We must take action to hold anyone who engages in such actions accountable. Iran and Hezbollah will continue to take advantage of our morality—what they perceive to be a weakness on our part—and they will continue to employ the use of human shields during armed conflicts until the world sends a strong and unified message, and that is what this bill does. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and I thank the ranking member. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GARRETT ), who is a member of the Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security Committees. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL . 
Mr. Speaker, today, I think, represents the culmination of a series of wonderful bipartisan efforts that, while on their face to those who are not initiated may seem to deal with disparate subjects insofar as they stem from Iranian ballistic missiles to Hezbollah’s use of humans as shields, are, in effect, dealing with the same subject. Mr. Speaker, one can’t separate Hezbollah from Iran. In fact, Hezbollah was born only a few short years after the Iranian Revolution, which brought such heartache that the loss of life in Iran, adjusted for population, mirrors that of the entire loss of life by the United States in combat during the entire Second World War. These are innocent Iranians killed by their own government, Mr. Speaker. And we see, also, that the Hezbollah forces in Israel, Lebanon, and, indeed, around the world quite literally have continued to use human shields. My friend and colleague from California, Congressman ROHRABACHER , said that Hezbollah actions had degenerated to the point where they were using human shields. While I hold Mr. ROHRABACHER in great esteem, I would submit that they haven’t degenerated, because that implies at some point that Hezbollah didn’t engage in such reprehensible behavior. So the bipartisan actions led by Ranking Member ENGEL and Chairman ROYCE today bring us to where, indeed, we need to be by virtue of the reality of the world in which we live. Hezbollah does not exist but for the largess of Iran and the monies funneled by the Iranian regime. The Hezbollah missiles, which Member FRANKEL eloquently spoke of, are, indeed, Iranian missiles, and the ICBMs that Iran is developing that we seek to curtail stem from a failure to include a prohibition on ICBM development in the JCPOA under which this Congress and this administration now labor. I would note for the RECORD , for the Members, and for those who might be viewing at home that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 of 2010, which included signatures from the Russians and the Chinese, said that Iran was forbidden from engaging in missile development. The JCPOA says Iran is asked not to engage in this. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Virginia an additional 1 minute. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, so we then arrive at the point where the good work of Mr. ENGEL and Chairman ROYCE is needed today, and that is what we do. It is with a glad heart that I note the bipartisan nature of these agreements. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time to close the way I always do. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides for their hard work on this bill. I want to remind my colleagues that, just a few years ago when the last war was raging in Gaza, the other terrorist group, Hamas, used civilians as human shields. We had a resolution on the floor of this House condemning it, and I was very, very proud that that resolution passed unanimously. We need to condemn these terrorist groups no matter what they do, but when they use people as human shields—innocent people—and then try to blame the other side for the death, it is not something that we can countenance or stand for at all. I hope that we rise to the occasion this time, as well, because I can think of nothing more despicable than using innocent civilians as human shields. These bomb factories are built in mosques, they are built in schools, and they are built in playgrounds. They are built where children are. They are built because they are daring Israel and the United States to go after them when we know that there will be human casualties. It is really a despicable position. Here you have two terrorists groups, Hezbollah and Hamas. One is Shia; one is Sunni. It doesn’t matter. They are both out to kill people. They are both out to terrorize people. They are both out to do the opposite of what we try to do in the United States: lifting people up. They need to be stopped, and this Congress needs to keep sending strong messages with teeth behind them to the world that we will not sit idly by and allow these terrorist activities to happen. Using civilians as human shields is really the lowest of the low. The fact that Hezbollah would put innocent men, women, and children in harm’s way as human shields tells you everything you need to know about this organization. It is a cowardly practice by a gruesome group, and it cannot and shall not be tolerated. This measure puts us on record again condemning this terrorist group, and it gives the administration more tools to deal with one of Hezbollah’s worst tools, more tools to deal with Hezbollah to stop its terrorist activities. So I urge a bipartisan ‘‘yes’’ vote. I thank Chairman ROYCE again for his collaboration with us on both sides of the aisle. That is one of the great things about the Foreign Affairs Committee because we realize that partisanship stops at the water’s edge. When we are talking about terrorist groups and we are talking about antidemocratic groups, they affect us all. It is important that this Congress sends strong bipartisan measures and a strong bipartisan voice to say we will not tolerate these atrocities. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote from all my colleagues on both sides, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time. Mr. Speaker, I did want to say I have had the opportunity to travel extensively with Mr. ENGEL and to observe him and his work here in this House for many years. He has always transcended partisanship in my view, but, more importantly, from my standpoint, he has been a servant of the national interests here and the core values of the United States of America and our attempt to represent those core values around the world. I want to take this moment, especially given his eloquent statement here about these values as he spoke about Hezbollah. These are values that I think all of us should share. The Geneva Convention, itself, establishes standards for international law, and it does so for the protection of civilians in a war zone. They specifically prohibit, under that Geneva Convention, of course, the use of civilians as human shields. It is article 58 of the Convention’s additional protocols that require parties of any conflict to avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas. So, to date, Hezbollah’s arsenal is well over 100,000. As I shared with you, all of them are manufactured today by Iran. Those rockets and missiles of various ranges today include precision guided missiles. I spoke earlier of 2006, the second Lebanon War. That actually should be called the Hezbollah war. At that time, as I talked about the 600 victims that were in the trauma hospital, they were down to an inventory of 10,000 missiles. Today, they have, in the hands of Hezbollah—again, because of Iran— over 100,000 such rockets and missiles. So I think, yes, Hezbollah has blatantly violated the wellestablished laws of armed conflict. It has targeted civilians for more than two decades in both Lebanon and Israel. As a result, both peoples are victims of Hezbollah’s—and, frankly, of Iran’s— brutality, and it is high time we hold them accountable. This we try to do in this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. ENGEL , and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3342, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend any remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today we will consider legislation targeting Hezbollah, Iran’s leading terrorist proxy, with tough, new sanctions. It was 34 years ago this Monday that a truck bomb filled with explosives 
detonated outside the United States Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 241 of our servicemen. Between 1982 and 1984, we had 272 marines, soldiers, and sailors from 39 States and Puerto Rico lose their lives while serving as peacekeepers in Beirut. Hezbollah was behind those attacks. Since that fateful day, Hezbollah has collaborated with Iran to expand terror throughout the region, taking hundreds of thousands of lives if we count the lives of human beings lost in Syria, in Yemen, in Iraq, and in Gaza. Today, as a leading Iranian proxy, Hezbollah continues to be Iran’s front line against Israel. Since its 2006 war with Israel, Hezbollah has dramatically grown its supply of rockets and missiles, allowing it to strike throughout Israel with great precision and force. It is by putting that military power to very effective use that it has gleaned through what it has learned on the ground in Syria. In Syria, its fighters are key to Tehran and its efforts to prop up the Assad regime, working with the Revolutionary Guard and also working with Russian troops there. So now Hezbollah and Iran are reportedly working to introduce game changing weapons into Lebanon and Syria, and that is what brings about this particular bill. What they are trying to do is produce facilities for sophisticated rockets and missiles there on the ground, on the border in Syria, on the border, also, in Lebanon, and that could lead to another war. It is not a cheap effort to do this. That is why the committee is focused on dismantling Hezbollah’s financial networks. In 2015, we led the way to enact the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act to target those that facilitate financial transactions for Hezbollah. Now this bill builds on that effort to further ramp up pressure on the Iranian proxy, Hezbollah. It sanctions regimes, including Iran and Syria, that provide weapons to Hezbollah—in other words, an attempt to stop the transfer of these weapons. It targets Hezbollah’s innovative fundraising and recruiting efforts, including its attempts to crowdsource small donations to support its fighters, which is the latest evolution of Hezbollah’s efforts. b1545 Hezbollah launched an online crowdsourcing campaign entitled: ‘‘Equip a Mujahid,’’ which calls for donations, large or small, payable in installments or in one sum, to equip suicide bombers and Hezbollah fighters. This bill recognizes that Hezbollah is no longer only a terrorist group, but is also a global criminal organization, which has developed a global criminal network that profits from drug trafficking, money laundering, counterfeiting, and cigarette smuggling, and it gives the administration the tools to respond accordingly. Mr. Speaker, for years, this body has led the way in calling for the need to respond to the full range of threats from Iran. Hezbollah, the regime’s leading terrorist proxy, ranks among the top of those threats, in terms of what is being encountered right now. So I urge my colleagues to support this effort to ensure that the United States has the tools to respond. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

R OYCE , Chairman. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. Let me again thank Chairman ROYCE  for his leadership and for his hard work on this bill. I am glad to be the lead Democratic cosponsor of this legislation, which builds on a law that ED ROYCE and I wrote in 2015. One of the best ways to stop Hezbollah’s dangerous activity is to cut off its financing, which is what we tried to do 2 years ago. We went after Hezbollah’s financial patrons, including Iran. But again, this is a group that, if you block one path forward, they will do what it takes to find another way around. So with this measure, we are broadening existing law by going after a bigger universe of Hezbollah supporters and enablers. This bill would impose mandatory sanctions on any third parties or governments providing money, equipment, or weapons to Hezbollah. We know that Iran will again get caught up in this dragnet, and this bill doesn’t run afoul of our obligations under the nuclear deal or any other deal. After all, Iran’s support for Hezbollah is outside the scope of the JCPOA. But it is not just Iran. In recent years, we have seen Moscow step up its support of Hezbollah, particularly on the battlefields of Syria, where Russia has supplied Hezbollah with weapons. It is really outrageous. Russia claims to be fighting socalled terrorists as they bomb schools, hospitals, and marketplaces. Yet Russian weapons are ending up in Hezbollah hands. Let me be clear: Hezbollah is a terrorist group. It is as simple as that. Chairman ROYCE and I have said this many times. The RussiaHezbollah relationship threatens to undermine global antiterrorism efforts. This bill sends a message that any government in cahoots with Hezbollah, anyone who wants to do business with this terrorist group or support its violent aims, is going to face the consequences. This is a timely bill. Iran is building weapons factories in southern Lebanon that would be buried far underground, out of Israel’s reach. The missiles that will come off that assembly line are more precise and have a longer range, putting virtually the whole of Israel in their sights. Iran’s and Hezbollah’s presence in Syria, particularly in the south, right on Israel’s borders, is a very serious concern. I worry about the deescalation zones the United States helped to establish in southern Syria. We don’t want those zones to become hotbeds of Hezbollah. Several weeks ago, I was in Israel, and we trekked up to the border between Israel and Lebanon. At the border, as far as the eye can see, when you are in Israel and you are looking down at Lebanon, you see a number of flags. Are they the Lebanese flag? No. It is the Hezbollah flag. Hezbollah has virtually taken over large parts of Lebanon, strangling the Lebanese people as well. The Lebanese people are suffering under a brutal terrorist group that is embedded in a society that disallows them to act as a free and open society. My heart really goes out to the Lebanese people, who have a terrorist group virtually sitting in their lap, refusing to move, and putting them in all kinds of danger. These areas have the potential to create a safe haven for Hezbollah and Iranian actors. They will stoke existing tensions and could create a corridor from Tehran to the Mediterranean through Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. This would present a major shift in the regional balance of power, and it would present threats to Israel that it could not ignore. If these deescalation zones end up empowering Iran and Hezbollah, then we will have betrayed our ally, Israel, at the most critical moment. That is why we are passing this bill. I, again, thank Chairman ROYCE for his continued strong leadership on this issue. I strongly support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, in view of the National Defense Authorization conference, and in view of the fact that, from the House side, Mr. ENGEL and I both serve on that conference, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ), and I ask unanimous consent that she may control that time on this legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, since I, too, will go over to the Senate side, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ), and I ask unanimous consent that he may control the time on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. ROYCE from California, and the ranking member, Mr. ENGEL from New York, once again for their leadership. They are the dynamic duo of the Foreign Affairs Committee on this issue. This is a very important day, in terms of sanctioning evildoers in the world. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor the bill promoted by Chairman ROYCE  and Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL , H.R. 3329, the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act. This is yet another strong, bipartisan bill that they have authored and brought to the floor, aimed at holding Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah, accountable for their illicit activity. I was pleased that my amendment to this bill was included to ensure that we identify those Hezbollah parliamentarians and cabinet officials who are subject to the sanctions in this bill and the underlying bill that it amends. This is important, Mr. Speaker, because Hezbollah members have prominent positions in Lebanon’s Government, and we want to ensure that they cannot use government funds to divert to Hezbollah’s terror activity, and, if they do, those institutions that help facilitate such activity are held to account. I was also pleased to see other provisions approved that would allow us to identify and track individuals and entities that are being used by Iran to supply Hezbollah with arms or support for its missile production facilities in Syria. We know that Iran uses commercial civilian aircraft to fly weapons, arms, and fighters to Syria in support of Hezbollah. We cannot allow Iran to use these civilian aircraft for such activity. This is the first step toward making sure that, once these aircraft are identified, responsible nations will think twice about allowing these Iranian planes to land in their countries. This bill also addresses Iran’s and Hezbollah’s ability to finance their illicit activities, which is so important, Mr. Speaker. We must go after those individuals and those institutions that provide financial safe havens to these terror groups, and we have got to disrupt their financial networks. That is why this bill is so important, and I urge my colleagues to support Chairman ROYCE ’s and Ranking Member ENGEL ’s measure before us today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is good to be on the floor with my friend and colleague from Florida to speak in support of H.R. 3329, an important bipartisan effort brought forward by Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member E NGEL , an important measure to further combat Hezbollah’s terrorist activity. We made great strides 2 years ago when we passed the Hezbollah International Financing Act, which has already begun to sever the terror group 
from its funding sources. However, it is clear that more needs to be done. The new bill will further restrict Hezbollah’s ability to recruit and fundraise by targeting foreign state sponsors, including Iran, while also increasing pressure on banks and other international financial institutions that serve Hezbollah. It is important to remember why it is in America’s interest to combat Hezbollah terrorism. Not that anyone here or at home needs a reminder, we all remember, or we have all learned about, the 1983 attacks in Beirut on our Embassy and the Marine Corps barracks that killed hundreds of Americans; the attacks in Argentina on the Israeli Embassy in 1992, and the AMIA Jewish center in 1994 that, in total, killed over 100 more; the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia; and more recent attacks in Europe, including the 2012 bus bombing of Israeli tourists in Bulgaria. But it has been Hezbollah’s support for the horrific Assad regime in Syria that has led even Arab governments in the region to acknowledge Hezbollah’s dangerous role as an Iranian terror proxy. Last year, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab League took the dynamic step of designating Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. Yet, even while Hezbollah is focused on the war in Syria, its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, continues to vow Israel’s destruction, a threat Israel’s leaders don’t take lightly, given two previous wars and intelligence suggesting Hezbollah now has over 150,000 missiles and rockets in Lebanon aimed at every corner of Israel’s map. In a future war, Israeli defense officials fear that Hezbollah will launch over a thousand rockets a day with the capacity to hit civilians in Israel’s north, across Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and even in the southernmost city, Eilat. This is made all the more troubling by reports that Iran, in addition to transferring advanced precisionguided missiles to Hezbollah, is now helping the terror group set up indigenous missile development facilities in both Syria and Lebanon. These are unacceptable developments. They underscore the importance of today’s legislation: cut off Hezbollah’s most critical sources of funding and support, including from its primary sponsor, Iran. I am proud to support this bipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for her tireless leadership in standing up for all those pushing back against Iran’s influence in the region, Iran’s support for Hezbollah, and specifically here, cutting off sources of funding for Hezbollah. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. For 30 years, Hezbollah has remained Iran’s proxy and Iran remains Hezbollah’s primary source of financial support—a cozy relationship. In April 2015, its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, boasted that, even under sanctions, Iran still funds Hezbollah’s terror. He anticipated that ‘‘a rich and powerful Iran, which will be open to the world’’ will be able to do even more. The Iran nuclear agreement has made it possible for Iran to provide Hezbollah with a windfall. But Tehran is not Hezbollah’s only source of income. Since its inception, Hezbollah has developed a broad criminal network involved in a range of illicit activities, from drug trafficking to cigarette smuggling, to money laundering to counterfeiting. These global terrorists double as global criminals. This is why we must employ a combination of law enforcement, financial, criminal, civil, and regulatory tools to deter, disrupt, and publicly illuminate the global illicit Hezbollah network. b1600 I want to thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for closely collaborating and developing this critical legislation, as well as Senator RUBIO and Senator SHAHEEN in the Senate that have taken the lead on this effort in the Senate. I look forward to continuing to work with them to get this critical legislation signed into law. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3329, the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act. This important legislation builds on the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015. I was pleased to have originally introduced this bill in 2014 with my colleague MARKMEADOWS . Hizballah at the behest and assistance of Iran is active in Syria and has helped Assad maintain regime control. Hizballah fighters are returning to Lebanon more battletested and more capable than ever before. In Lebanon, again with assistance from Iran, Hizballah has been able to amass more than 150,000 rockets—a tenfold increase compared to 15,000 in 2006. Iran uses several means to transfer weapons to Hizballah, including by land, sea, and air and is now reportedly building missile production facilities in Lebanon to enable an indigenous rocketproducing capability for Hizballah. Hizballah is not only a grave threat to our ally Israel, they are a threat to regional security and America’s national security interests. Hizballah will be far more dangerous than ever before with an indigenous rocketproducing capability. That is why I am pleased that an amendment I offered during the full committee markup of H.R. 3329 was included in the bill to ensure the U.S. Government is focused on this urgent threat. My amendment would require the President to report to Congress on the foreign and domestic supply chain that advances Hizballah’s domestic missile capabilities. This includes how Iran is able to transfer goods and technology, a list of those who facilitate missile transfers, and the steps being taken to disrupt the supply chain that advances Hizballah’s missile capabilities. The United States cannot stand by while Israel faces such a grave threat on its northern border. We must decisively act and we deserve to know what exactly the U.S. Government is doing to combat this threat. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3329. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3329, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
URGING EUROPEAN UNION TO DESIGNATE HIZBALLAH AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 359) urging the European Union to designate Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist organization and increase pressure on it and its members, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. R ES. 359 Whereas in July 2012 a Hizballah terror attack in Bulgaria killed five Israeli tourists and one Bulgarian; Whereas in March 2013 a Hizballah operative in Cyprus was convicted of planning terror attacks after admitting he was a member of Hizballah, was trained in the use of weapons, and used a dual SwedishLebanese passport to travel around Europe on missions as a courier and scout for Hizballah; Whereas though such Hizballah operative was convicted on criminalrelated charges, authorities had to drop terrorism charges against him because Hizballah was not listed as a terrorist organization; Whereas the European Union (EU) in July 2013 designated Hizballah’s socalled ‘‘military wing’’—but not the organization as a whole—as a terrorist organization; Whereas despite restrictions put on Hizballah since the designation of its military wing, the group continues to conduct illicit narcotrafficking, money laundering, and weapons trafficking throughout Europe; Whereas EU designation of Hizballah’s military wing has enabled substantial and important cooperation between United States and European authorities aimed at uncovering and thwarting Hizballah’s international criminal activities, such as drug trafficking and money laundering, the proceeds of which are used to purchase weapons and advance Hizballah’s terrorist aims; Whereas in December 2015 the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 (Public Law 114–102) was signed into law 
in the United States, broadening financial sector sanctions against Hizballah to compel foreign financial institutions to refrain from supporting the terrorist group; Whereas in February 2016 the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection partnered with counterparts in France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium to arrest top leaders of the European cell of Hizballah’s External Security Organization Business Affairs Component—a cell that engages in international money laundering and drug trafficking to support Hizballah’s terror activities; Whereas for many years, the Governments of Iran and Syria have been the prime sponsors of Hizballah, harboring, financing, training, and arming the group; Whereas Department of Defense officials estimate that Iran provides as much as $200,000,000 per year to Hizballah in the form of financial and logistical support, weapons, and training; Whereas Hizballah now has an arsenal of approximately 150,000 missiles and rockets, many of which can reach deep into Israel, at a time when Hizballah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah is threatening to attack and invade Israel; Whereas Hizballah fighters have been supporting the Assad regime in Syria, often leading operations in the conflict which has left more than 465,000 dead; Whereas Russia has established fusion centers in Syria to coordinate with Iran, the Assad regime, and Hizballah, and Russian air cover has given Hizballah an advantage on the battlefield against Syria rebels; Whereas Hizballah’s destabilizing actions in the conflict in Syria has fueled a migrant crisis that has brought nearly 400,000 migrants and refugees to Europe in 2016 and 2017 alone; Whereas Lebanon continues to be plagued by instability and violence; Whereas due to Hizballah’s actions in Syria, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has carried out retaliatory terrorist attacks in Beirut; Whereas the Lebanese Armed Forces, the legitimate security establishment of the country as set forth in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006), are struggling to control the flow of weapons and Hizballah fighters at its borders; Whereas Hizballah trains and provides weapons for Shiite militias in Iraq and Yemen, further destabilizing the region and perpetuating violence in those countries; Whereas in October 2012 Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Naim Qassem stated that ‘‘[Hizballah does not] have a military wing and a political one . . . Every element of Hizballah, from commanders to members as well as our various capabilities, are in the service of the resistance’’; Whereas the United States, Canada, Israel, and the Netherlands have designated Hizballah in its entirety as a terror organization, while Australia and New Zealand have applied the designation to the organization’s socalled military wing; Whereas in March 2016 the Gulf Cooperation Council, the bloc of six Gulf Arab nations, formally branded Hizballah, in its entirety, a terrorist organization, and the League of Arab States shortly thereafter adopted the same designation; Whereas in April 2016 the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, denounced Hizballah’s ‘‘terrorist acts’’ in the Middle East; Whereas Hizballah Secretary General Nasrallah said in May 2017 that the conflict in Syria had entered a ‘‘new and critical phase’’ in which Damascus, Moscow, Tehran, and Hezbollah were ‘‘in more harmony politically and militarily than at any time’’; Whereas the United States has designated Hizballah’s Foreign Relations Department, which has representatives around the world, as a Specially Designated National, subject to United States primary and secondary sanctions; Whereas the Department of the Treasury has diligently added persons and entities to the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists who have provided material support to the Hizballah terrorist organization, thereby hampering its financing and logistical capabilities; and Whereas in May 2017 the United States and Saudi Arabia sanctioned Hashem Saffiedine, a member of Hizballah’s executive council which oversees the organization’s political, organizational, social and educational activities, for his involvement in terrorist activity: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives— (1) expresses appreciation to the European Union (EU) for the progress made in countering Hizballah since the EU designated Hizballah’s military wing as a terrorist organization; (2) applauds and expresses support for the continued, increased cooperation between the United States and the EU in thwarting Hizballah’s criminal and terrorist activities; (3) supports transcontinental efforts within Europe to share intelligence information among police and security services to facilitate greater cooperation in tracking, apprehending, and prosecuting terrorists, foreign fighters, and potential offenders; (4) encourages the EU to, whenever possible and applicable with due process standards, implement sanctions against Hizballah affiliated terrorists in tandem with the United States; and (5) urges the EU to designate Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist organization and increase pressure on the group, including through— (A) facilitating better crossborder cooperation between EU members in combating Hizballah; (B) issuing arrest warrants against members and active supporters of Hizballah; (C) freezing Hizballah’s assets in Europe, including those masquerading as charities; and (D) prohibiting fundraising activities in support of Hizballah. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker and Chairman ROYCE , as well as Congressman ENGEL , the ranking member, for their help in bringing this important resolution to the floor. I also want to say how proud our committee is of the great work of Ranking Member TEDDEUTCH of the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee, and our Florida colleague, GUSBILIRAKIS , who are the authors of H. Res. 359, urging the European Union to designate Hezbollah in its entirety as a terrorist organization. I thank Mr. DEUTCH for his leadership on this. This notion, Mr. Speaker, that there can be separate wings of a terrorist organization is as absurd as the notion that Iran can be a responsible member of the international community. There is no distinction between Hezbollah members. Anyone who pledges allegiance to this terror group must be labeled accordingly. One needn’t look further than Hezbollah’s activities in Syria or its terror attacks against Israel or even the statements coming out of Iran, its patron, and Hezbollah itself to know that if you are Hezbollah, you support terror activities. Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, and Hezbollah is its proxy. There is simply no justification at all for our European friends to try to differentiate between a military wing and a political wing of a terrorist organization. They may justify it by saying it will upset the delicate balance in Lebanon and they worry about the fallout, but the sad reality is that it comes down to money. They will not take any action against Iran, as we have seen since the JCPOA, because members of the EU have signed lucrative business deals with Iran, and they don’t want to damage their economic opportunities. It is as simple as that, because even our Gulf allies have labeled Hezbollah, in its entirety, as a terrorist organization. The European Union needs to wake up, and we must urge it and its member states to designate the whole of Hezbollah as the terrorists that they are, and it must realize that doing so would be in their best interest and in the best interest of Israel, a nation that shares their values and their ideals, unlike Iran, a regime that benefits by the lack of a full designation of Hezbollah. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 359. I would first like to thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member E NGEL for their leadership on the committee in bringing this resolution forward. I would like to thank my friend from Florida, Congressman BILIRAKIS , for working with me on this resolution. I thank as well Chairman ROSLEHTINEN  for her leadership on the subcommittee and ensuring that we have the opportunity to move forward together. Mr. Speaker, in 2013, almost exactly 1 year after a Hezbollah suicide bomber blew up a bus in Bulgaria, killing mostly Israeli tourists, the European Union took action to finally designate 
Hezbollah a terrorist organization. However, they only designated what they called Hezbollah’s military wing as a terror group and not its political wing. The United States has been clear that this was a false distinction then and it remains a false distinction today. Hezbollah is one unified terrorist organization, and it is led by the terrorist, Hassan Nasrallah. It is one unified Hezbollah that is responsible for the horrific acts of terror against Europeans, Americans, Israelis, and others across the Middle East and around the globe. It is one unified Hezbollah that has helped prop up the Assad regime, and it is complicit in the death of half a million Syrians and the dissolving of a once thriving nation. So this one unified Hezbollah should be designated as a terrorist organization so we can increase international cooperation to isolate and dismantle this group. This morning, Mr. Speaker, the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee held a hearing on next steps for our Iran policy. There, I noted that 2 days ago we marked a solemn anniversary, because 34 years ago, on October 23, two Hezbollah suicide bombers blew themselves up at the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, killing over 300 U.S. and French servicemembers, peacekeepers, and civilians. That attack, like so many of Hezbollah’s deadly terrorist activities over the past several decades, was sponsored and directed by Iran. While our Nation built a memorial honoring the victims of that attack, Tehran built a monument honoring the perpetrators of that attack. A full EU designation of Hezbollah now would help demonstrate Europe’s commitment to cracking down on Iran’s use of proxy terror groups, destabilizing the region, and attacking Western interests. Now, I understand that the EU has legal concerns about this designation since Hezbollah has infiltrated Lebanon’s political system. However, I would just offer this observation. The terrorist organization Hamas operates as a political party in Gaza, yet the EU still rightly lists the entirety of Hamas as a terror organization. That has not impacted their ability to support Gaza reconstruction, just as designating Hezbollah would not prevent them from supporting Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Last year, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab League both designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. They made no distinction between the military and political wing, despite Lebanon being a member of the Arab League. I hope the EU took note of that. I thank the Speaker for bringing this resolution to the floor so that my colleagues can join me in sending an important message to our European friends and allies. More can be done to counter the Iranian proxy Hezbollah, and that begins with calling them what they are, a terrorist organization committed to the destruction of Israel and undermining the values and interests of the United States. Our EU friends must acknowledge as well the values and interests of Europe. The world knows that Hezbollah is a terrorist group. It is time for the European Union to end its false distinction and join us in designating all of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to send them that message. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, so I will wait for Mr. DEUTCH to close on his time. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Chairman ROYCE , Ranking Member ENGEL , Chairman R OS LEHTINEN , Congressman B ILIRAKIS , and to my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee and other Members for their work on the three measures today aimed at curbing the terrorist group Hezbollah. The measures that we are advancing today represent smart and tough approaches that will respond to Hezbollah and its enablers, and will build stronger international support for this important effort. This measure and the others that we have considered today are a great example of the way that we can work across the aisle to help keep our country safe. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Florida, Ranking Member DEUTCH , for authoring this resolution and bringing it to the floor today. Hezbollah has a single leadership, fungible finances, and a single hostile mission. All branches and operations serve its terrorist activities, and it is a deadly mistake to attempt to distinguish among its arms. I again want to thank Mr. DEUTCH , Chairman ROYCE , Ranking Member ENGEL for their work on this important resolution, which calls for our European allies to designate all branches of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. This is a critical step that our partners across the Atlantic must take to protect our citizens and allies from a highly organized, capable, and increasingly battletrained terror group that operates networks in countries around the world. We must work together to deprive this organization of its support. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution. I thank the gentleman from Florida for his authorship. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ), the chairman of the House Committee on Small Business and a senior member of our Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ms. ROSLEHTINEN , Chairman ROYCE , and all the other folks that have worked on a number of bills here today. I rise in strong support of H. Res. 359; H.R. 3329; H.R. 3342; and H.R. 1698, that one, in particular, aims to prevent Iran from acquiring ballistic missiles because they have the capability or soon will have the capability not just to target the Middle East and Europe, but also target us here on our soil right here in the United States if we don’t do something about this, with ultimately a nuclear device. Iran is determined to be the dominant power in the Middle East. The Iranian regime hopes to achieve this by exporting terrorism, destabilizing its neighbors, and promising death to America and to our allies. Bearing this in mind, Iran’s nuclear ambitions and ballistic missiles program are not only a direct threat to the United States and our allies, but they are a direct threat to the peace and stability of the entire world. When the Iran deal was signed, I said back then and believed back then that this was a bad deal, it would ultimately lead to nuclear weapons, and that they weren’t going to meet their commitments. And we are seeing here today the backsliding by Iran to these commitments. Ten years ago, Russia agreed to sell a number of S–300 surfacetoair missile systems to Iran. The Russians suspended the deal in 2010, but renewed it after the Iran deal, the JCPOA was agreed to. Now Moscow has delivered multiple S–300 systems. While the S–300 missile platforms strengthens Iran’s conventional capabilities, it also fundamentally complicates the United States’ strategy for eliminating a potential nuclear threat against us or against our allies. Iran displayed this surfacetoair missile system to the public late last month, so we know it is there and it is dangerous. That is exactly why H.R. 1698 is so important. It will help combat Iran’s ongoing nuclear ambitions by requiring the President to report on the Iranian ballistic missiles program and to oppose targeted sanctions on Iranian Government entities and foreign actors that aid Iran in its nuclear development. I also want to speak briefly relative to the threat that Hezbollah poses to the Middle East and the entire world. I, again, want to thank Congressman ROYCE and Congresswoman R OS LEHTINEN and Ranking Member E NGEL  and many others for their hard work on this. Hezbollah’s mission is to destroy Israel. It is backed by Iran. It poses a constant threat to the Middle East peace. We have designated it as a terrorist organization due to its routine attacks, especially rocket attacks on 
Israel that have led to war, and its brutal tactics. b1615 For years, Hezbollah has continued to accumulate larger rocket stockpiles, grow their presence, and develop even more unimaginable barbaric strategies. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for these, and I urge my colleagues to support these. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Because the gentlewoman from Florida did not close as expected, the gentleman from Florida will, without objection, be allowed to reclaim his time. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, that is very kind, but I am happy to yield to my friend from Florida, so I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Florida is now recognized to close debate. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, with that, I also yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. Let me thank my good friend and colleague from Florida, Representative DEUTCH , the Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Middle East Subcommittee, for bringing forward this measure. This measure represents another part of a good congressional strategy for combatting Hezbollah, and that’s rallying support among friends and partners . . . making sure that around the world everyone sees Hezbollah for what it is: a terrorist group. This has been a bit of a stumbling block with our friends in the European Union. Make no mistake: Hezbollah has waged its campaign of violence in Europe over the years, such as 2012, when a Hezbollah terrorist killed five Israelis in Bulgaria. Yet in 2013, the EU announced it would consider only the ‘‘military wing’’ of Hezbollah to be a terrorist organization, drawing a distinction with the socalled political wing. Well, Mr. Speaker, that’s a distinction without a difference. Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, and that’s all there is to it. The more shades of grey clouding this issue, the harder it’s going to be to work with our EU allies to stop Hezbollah’s violent activities. So this measure lays out the facts about Hezbollah’s presence in Europe and the other groups that have labeled Hezbollah a terrorist organization. It commends the work we’re already doing with our EU allies to push back against Hezbollah. And it says that it’s time for the EU to stop the hairsplitting. It calls on the EU to designate all of Hezbollah for what it is: a terrorist organization. I’m glad to support this measure. It sends such an important signal to our friends across the Atlantic. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 359, which I am proud to colead and cosponsor with my colleagues. This important resolution urges the European Union to designate Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist organization. There is no distinction between the military and political wings of Hizballah. They are part and parcel of the same entity, that is a terrorist organization that threatens the United States and our allies, and contributes to instability and violence in the Middle East. The EU designated Hizballah’s military wing as a terrorist organization in 2013, and has made notable progress in countering Hizballah activities, but more must be done. This resolution urges the EU to take practical and tangible steps to reduce the terrorist threat posed to the United States, Europe, Israel, and our other allies in the Middle East by Hizballah. For example, increasing crossborder intelligence sharing, freezing Hizballah assets, prohibiting Hizballah fundraising activities, and issuing arrest warrants for Hizballah members and supporters in Europe would not only send a strong message, but would have a concrete impact inhibiting the ability of Hizballah to operate with impunity. I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 359. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 359, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SUNSHINE FOR REGULATIONS AND REGULATORY DECREES AND SETTLEMENTS ACT OF 2017 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 469. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. NORMAN ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 577 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 469. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DUNCAN ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1621 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 469) to impose certain limitations on consent decrees and settlement agreements by agencies that require the agencies to take regulatory action in accordance with the terms thereof, and for other purposes, with Mr. DUNCAN from Tennessee in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) and the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I am glad to be here on H.R. 469. We have had the opportunity, through rule debate yesterday, to discuss this. What we are coming forward with today is a bill that I have introduced that basically breaks down to what we know is a sue and settlement ban on this part of my bill. There are other parts that we are going to get to as we go forward in this. But I think I want to start off this debate today by simply stating some of the foundational issues—things that we come here and talk about many times on the floor of the House have to do with bills and discussions. But one of the things I think that has been very disturbing for me—and I know many of our colleagues as we have come up here—is the disturbing trend of moving away from Congress relieving its powers and taking ownership of its Article I authority, and doing the oversight, doing the planning, doing the budgeting, and then sort of moving that more toward the executive branch or letting the judicial system take responsibility. And I think one of the things that we are starting out with today in these bills, that we have taken up over the past 2 days, is a general discussion to move back toward Article I authority, which Congress is doing the legislating and the oversight that it is supposed to be, and the executive branch is following through in their role of actually executing the laws that are made, judicial, of course, being the interpretive branch. What we are seeing in this bill—and one of the reasons for our sue and settlement legislation, which is my part of this bill, and I want to start here, and we will continue as we go through this through the other parts as we go— is really a fairness issue. And this is not specific to one party in the executive branch. I stated this yesterday. Sometimes it gets mixed up. But hear me clearly: I don’t care the party of the resident at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I do not care who they may be in the sense of what they do in that job. What I want to know is: Are they fulfilling the executive branch role and not overstepping Congress’ role? What we have seen over previous administrations, including the last one and the previous administration, especially under this area of sue and settlement that increased greatly during the last administration, was this idea of taking a law that we have passed, having the regulatory agency’s job to execute that law; but, at the same point in time, being sued by a friendly party, or another party, on a deadline of the bill, or something that they want to, they go into, say, with EPA or another agency, and they discuss this lawsuit. They come to an agreement, and they 
file the suit. Many times the suit and the consent were filed on the same day. The consent decree—now, look, consent decrees are good judicial tools. They have been used, and will continue to be used, even under this bill. But what we don’t want to have happen is when the consent decree basically comes at the time of the suit, or just shortly thereafter, where the party that wants to see a specific agenda pushed, along with a willing agency, goes to a judge, is able to get that consent decree, and then turn around and give it to somebody else and say: You now have to live under this without any emphasis or any input from the other party. So we are simply saying: Let’s make this a little fair. You are going to have to publicize notice, you are going to have to actually include others who may have a problem with this consent decree, and you are going to have to do it a little more transparently. So we are going to start here today, Mr. Chairman. We are going to talk about these issues and coming forward. We can talk about many other things as the day progresses, but, at the end of the day, it is about Congress itself taking control of its Article I authority and saying, ‘‘We are going to be the legislative branch that we are called to be,’’ and the executive taking their role and judiciary taking theirs. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 469, an unwarranted and costly intrusion into Congress’ powers under Article I of the Constitution that will undermine the enforcement of statutory deadlines. When passing laws, Congress routinely establishes mandatory deadlines for agency action. These statutory deadlines serve several purposes. They establish congressional priorities, attempt to reduce undue delay in an agency’s compliance with the law, and communicate the importance of a legal requirement to the public. But because agency resources are limited, there is widespread noncompliance with statutory deadlines, as the Administrative Conference of the United States has long observed. Accordingly, a plaintiff with standing may file a lawsuit to complete a schedule for an agency to complete an action required by Congress, often referred to as a ‘‘deadline suit.’’ As the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, the GAO, reported earlier this year, ‘‘Most deadline suits are resolved through a negotiated settlement agreement because, in the majority of them, it is undisputed that a statutory deadline was missed,’’ and there was no legal defense to the lawsuit. But proponents of H.R. 469 assert that these settlements undercut applicable administrative law and shortcircuit review of new regulations. This premise is based on a report by the Chamber of Commerce that the so called sue and settle process is increasingly being used as a technique to shape agencies’ regulatory agendas. This concern, however, is unsupported by any independent evidence and has been debunked by the GAO. In two reports on deadline suits, the GAO has found that, ‘‘the settlement agreements did not affect the substantive basis or procedural rulemaking requirements,’’ of the agencies it studied. In its December 2014 report on deadline lawsuits involving the Environmental Protection Agency, the GAO determined that none of the settlements finalized under the Obama administration ‘‘included terms that finalized the substantive outcome of a rule.’’ The GAO underscored this point in the title of its report: ‘‘Impact of Deadline Suits on EPA’s Rulemaking is Limited.’’ In its February 2017 report on deadline suits involving the Endangered Species Act, the GAO found that ‘‘the settlement agreements did not affect the substantive basis or procedural rulemaking requirements the agencies were to follow in completing the actions, such as providing opportunities for public notice and comment on proposed listing rules.’’ Leading experts have also debunked the Chamber’s sue and settle narrative. John Cruden, a senior career official at the Justice Department for more than two decades during two Republican and two Democratic administrations, testified on a substantially identical bill that he was ‘‘not aware of any instance of a settlement that could remotely be described as collusive, but that the Justice Department vigorously represented the Federal agency, defending the agency’s legal position, and obtaining in any settlement the best possible terms that were consistent with the controlling law.’’ Other administrative law experts, such as Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, have similarly testified that sue and settlement allegations are patently false. This bill is also unnecessary because current law and agency practice already restrict the use of settlement policy to shape regulatory priorities. During its exhaustive review of deadline litigation, the GAO found that the Justice Department is guided by the Meese memo of 1986, when litigating deadline suits. This policy, as the GAO noted earlier this year, limits the settlement of a deadline suit to ‘‘only include a commitment to perform a mandatory action by an agreed upon schedule and would not otherwise predetermine or prescribe a specific substantive outcome for the actions to be completed by the agencies.’’ The Meese memo was codified in 1991, in the Code of Federal Regulations, and applies to settlement policy today. The Meese policy primarily restricts agencies from using settlement policy to contravene the law or congressional intent. b1630 As the majority noted in its report on a substantially identical version of the bill considered last Congress, this policy is grounded in separation of powers concerns. There is no evidence that agencies do not follow this policy, and the majority’s witnesses in prior hearings on this proposal have been unable to provide examples of settlements that violate the Meese policies. H.R. 469 is also wasteful and undermines Congress’ powers under Article I of the Constitution. Congress, not agencies, establish regulatory priorities through statutes. Agencies do not have discretion to pick and choose regulatory priorities where Congress has expressly instructed that certain actions be undertaken by a specific date. By imposing a series of onerous procedures that will constrain the use of settlements to resolve a Federal agency’s noncompliance with the law, H.R. 469 erodes the constitutional function of the legislative branch. Finally, the bill is also costly. The Congressional Budget Office notes that this bill greatly lengthens the settlement process, costing millions of dollars and straining the Treasury’s Judgment Fund through increased attorney’s fees. In closing, I strongly oppose this measure. I now yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ), our ranking member, to control. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, our system of government is a tripartite one, with each branch having certain defined functions delegated to it. The Congress is charged with writing the laws, the President with executing the laws, and the judiciary with interpreting them. The Constitution divides powers between the branches in this manner in order to guard against the abuse of power by any one branch. The separation of powers is at the core of the fundamental premise of our constitutional design that a limited government, divided into three branches exercising enumerated powers, is necessary to protect individual liberty and the rule of law. Unfortunately, over the last several decades, Congress has allowed its powers to gradually be chipped away at by the other branches. By allowing its powers to be diminished, Congress, especially this House, effectively is permitting the people to be deprived of their most responsive voice in the Federal Government. Through the legislation before us today and other legislation that the House has actively pursued in recent years, we can begin to 
reestablish and enforce the limits on the authority of the other two branches. Although no package of bills by itself can rebuild Congress’ institutional strength and restore the Constitution’s integrity, it is absolutely necessary that Congress begin reasserting the powers that it has ceded to the other branches. This package of bills promotes the restoration of Congress’ Article I powers. The first bill in the package addresses executive branch negotiated regulatory decrees and settlements. Over the past several decades, consent decrees and settlement agreements increasingly have been used in Federal litigation to allow the executive branch to write new law in ways that give short shrift to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, Regulatory Flexibility Act, and other laws by which Congress has prescribed how agencies must conduct rulemaking. While the executive does have some regulatory authority, these settlements and consent decrees have been used to aggrandize that authority and shift regulatory priorities under the cloak of judicial authority. This subverts the boundaries both the Constitution and Congress have placed on administrative authority. The Sunshine for Regulations and Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act limits the ability of the executive branch to collude with plaintiffs to abuse consent decrees and settlement agreements in a manner that allows the executive to thwart laws written by Congress and increases the power of the judiciary beyond its constitutional limits. The second bill in the package, the Judgment Fund Transparency Act, increases transparency over Federal spending by requiring the Treasury Department to publish data on settlements and courtoffered judgments entered against the Federal Government. One of Congress’ core powers is the authority to authorize and appropriate money from the Treasury. In order to properly exercise this power, Congress needs to know how the bill it has appropriated is being spent. This bill will allow Congress to better scrutinize and understand where Federal taxpayer dollars are going. Only through the transparency this bill provides can Congress make the executive and the judiciary more accountable for the money that comes out of the Judgment Fund. The final bill in the package, the Article I Amicus and Intervention Act, makes clear Congress’ ability to defend and assert its institutional interests in litigation that puts the powers and responsibilities of Congress into question. Currently, when the executive branch declines to pursue litigation in defense of an act of Congress, it is not required to give Congress notice sufficient to allow the House or Senate to defend the lawsuit before court filing deadlines have expired. In addition, the House of Representatives, unlike the Senate, does not have a statutory right to intervene or file amicus briefs in cases questioning congressional authority. This legislation ensures that both Houses of Congress have adequate time and a right to intervene in litigation that questions congressional authority. We cannot continue to abdicate our powers and responsibilities to the other branches of government, weakening the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution and threatening the very liberty divided powers were designed to protect. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to be here to support—well, I don’t think it is going to be support. It is really more in opposition to this socalled Sunshine for Regulations and Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act. Well, why? Well, because it is anticonsumer. Well, why? Because it is antienvironment. Well, why? Because it is antiprivacy. Not surprisingly, a broad consortium of more than 150 organizations strenuously oppose this bill, including some of our best nonprofits: the National Resources Defense Council, for example; the Sierra Club, for another example; Public Citizen; and a lot of labor organizations and other groups. Title I of this bill, for example, has one goal: it is to discourage the use of settlement agreements and consent decrees that compel agencies to follow the law. When enacting new statutes, Congress routinely establishes deadlines for agency action, particularly when it involves urgent public health and safety concerns. When agencies fail to meet these deadlines, a party with standing may file a lawsuit under section 7 of the Administrative Procedure Act to ensure that the agency performs this mandatory, nondiscretionary duty. By delaying the enforcement of statutory deadlines, the bill, however, jeopardizes public health and safety, which explains why the previous Obama administration issued a veto threat to similar legislation considered only last Congress. Title I imposes nearly impossible hurdles for agencies seeking to resolve the deadline lawsuits and gives opponents of regulation multiple opportunities to stifle agency regulatory actions. With respect to consent decrees concerning a rulemaking, an agency would be forced to go through two public comment periods—one for the consent decree, and one for the rulemaking that results from the consent decree— doubling the agency’s effort. In addition, it would allow any affected party to intervene in opposition to a proposed settlement agreement or consent decree. Contrary to the claims of those who support this measure, the Government Accountability Office has found no evidence that these deadline lawsuits are collusive. As the Justice Department, which represents most Federal agencies, acknowledged earlier this year, these agencies are left with few defenses, if any, to these lawsuits. I am also concerned that H.R. 469 will inevitably generate more litigation that will result in millions of dollars of additional transactional costs, all of which will be borne by you know who— the American taxpayer. For example, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, in its analysis of the bill’s predecessor from the last Congress, concluded: 
The measure would impose millions of dollars in additional costs, most of which would be incurred because the litigation involving consent decrees and settlement agreements would probably take longer under the bill, and agencies would face additional administrative requirements. 
That is a quotation. In other words, Title I of this bill is a costly solution, again, in search of a problem. Now, Title II of the bill isn’t much better. For instance, Title II overrides the Privacy Act to require publication of sensitive personal information of victims of government abuse or unlawful conduct, which raises serious privacy concerns. Although proponents of this measure argue it will increase government transparency, its real effect will be to force the Treasury Department to publish, on the Internet, the names of individual victims of government misconduct compensated for their claims by the Judgment Fund, including victims of race and sex discrimination, and so, in effect, revictimizing victims harmed by the Federal Government. Finally, Title III would facilitate the ability of the House majority to intervene in pending cases where the Justice Department has already determined that it will not defend the constitutionality of a Federal law. Not only do these provisions raise possible separation of powers concerns, it is unclear why they are even needed. This measure has not ever been the subject of a single hearing or markup by the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives. As a result, there has not been any opportunity to consider these critical issues and to analyze the ramifications presented by Title III. For all of these reasons, I must, accordingly, urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 469. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments, especially of my friend from Rhode Island. I would agree in principle with the Meese amendment as well. The problem is that, through the Clinton administration and through preceding administrations, it has been watered 
down. I would actually go back to that. The problem is lack of transparency and the lack of a coherent voice here as we go further, but I do appreciate the comments. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN ). Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Chair, I rise today in overwhelming and adamant support of H.R. 469, the Sunshine for Regulations and Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act, which will strengthen Article I powers for Congress. Let me begin by briefly quoting Article I, Section 8 of our Constitution, the Necessary and Proper Clause: ‘‘The Congress shall have the power . . . to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers . . . in the government,’’ meaning, Congress must continue to respect and reinforce the idea of the separation of powers in our government, but, at the same time, Congress can ultimately decide when, whether, and how to legislate the powers and authority of another branch of government. b1645 Mr. Chairman, this piece of legislation will go a long way in fortifying the balance of powers and reestablishing Congress’ authority set forth by James Madison and our Founding Fathers and Article I of the United States Constitution. Furthermore, we must be sure to use our constitutional authority to effectively guarantee and ensure that government is more efficient, transparent, and accountable to all American citizens of our great Nation, and this bill will do just that. It is time for Congress to establish procedures for honest regulations, transparency within the Treasury Department, and judicial intervention in unconstitutional court cases. Mr. Chairman, again, I rise in full support of H.R. 469, and I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers to make sure this is a government not only of the people, but for the people. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER). Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 469, the newly renamed Congressional Article I Power Strengthening Act. This bill stitches together three unrelated bills, each one problematic in its own way. Title III of the bill, the Article I Amicus and Intervention Act, would permit as a right the House to intervene as a party where an amicus in a lawsuit with the Department of Justice declines to defend the constitutionality of a law or regulation. While this proposal may have some merit, it was introduced only last week. It was the subject of no hearing. It has had no markup. We simply do not know the full implications of the measure. If it is a worthy proposal, we should take the time to consider it in committee before moving forward. Title II of the legislation, the Judgment Fund Transparency Act, would require additional reporting about the funds paid out of the Treasury Department’s Judgment Fund by the United States Government to resolve legal claims against it. This legislation raises significant privacy concerns. It would require publishing sensitive, personally identifying information about individual claimants who are the victims of government misconduct, such as medical malpractice, racial discrimination, or sexual harassment. Our laws should carefully balance the need for public disclosure of government spending with the need to protect the personal privacy of individual citizens. This bill upsets that balance. By far, the most concerning aspect of this legislation is Title I, the Sunshine for Regulations and Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act. This provision also poses as a transparency measure, but its real aim is to disrupt and delay the process for issuing rules that protect public health and safety. Congress frequently sets a statutory deadline for an agency to complete a rulemaking, but the agency sometimes misses that deadline. Under current law, private parties can sue the agency to meet its statutory obligations. Since there is little dispute that the agency has failed to do its duty, these lawsuits often end up settling, with the agency agreeing to a new schedule in which to complete the required rulemaking. That is perfectly reasonable. However, the Republican majority and the businesses that are the subject of such regulation believe these lawsuits have some nefarious purpose. They have concocted an imagined vast conspiracy by which private parties collude with the government to file a lawsuit, and the government happily either settles or enters into a consent decree, supposedly allowing it to impose obligations or rules beyond what it could otherwise do. Unfortunately for supporters of this bill, there is no evidence of such a conspiracy and no evidence, in fact, of any problem. To solve this nonexistent problem, this bill adds numerous procedural requirements before a settlement or consent degree can be entered into. The effect of these requirements would be to make any settlements or consent decrees more difficult and more timeconsuming to enter into, with the predictable result that agencies will not even bother to enter into them at all. Most troubling, the bill would create a special and more permissive rule for virtually any party to involve itself in the case as an intervener. These interveners would do their best to ruin, block, or delay any settlement, including during what should be private negotiations. That, of course, is the true purpose of this bill. They seek to tie government agencies up in years of litigation so that they are unable to issue rules protecting public health and safety. The real conspiracy here is the Republican plot to destroy the regulatory state. With one hand, we defund the agencies; and with the other hand, we build all sorts of hurdles in the regulatory process so that the agencies have no ability to complete their work. It is a shameful effort that may save big businesses some money and regulatory compliance, but it will cost our citizens their health, their safety, and possibly their lives. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this terrible legislation. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I don’t believe, as was just stated, that there is a nefarious plot here. It is to get government doing the regulation it should with transparency—and that is what needs to be done—and have Congress do what it should be doing, and that is writing laws and having the regulatory process start from here. That is simply what we are looking at. If that is too much, I understand. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. STEWART). Mr. STEWART. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Mr. COLLINS and Chairman GOODLATTE for their work. Mr. Chairman, I have to say, in listening to this debate, I can’t imagine why anyone would oppose this legislation that is entirely designed to create transparency. This is good work that Chairman GOODLATTE and Mr. C OLLINS  have worked on. Last week we heard a number of shocking stories about government malfeasance, such as Chairman GOODLATTE ’s investigation that the government had settled and revealed that the Obama Justice Department had funneled money to politically allied groups. We are grateful for that. Today we are taking up H.R. 469, and I am thrilled that this legislation includes the text of my bill, the Judgment Fund Transparency Act. As I said, the purpose of this act is really very simple. Actually, contrary to what has been said, it is to bring simplicity, it is to bring transparency. This bill would go a long way to providing our constituents and taxpayers a better idea of how their tax dollars are spent. Heaven knows, and for heaven’s sake, those of us here certainly know that sometimes the Federal Government makes mistakes. It is not perfect. It is prone to errors and it can cause harm to individuals. And when that happens, especially when these errors are particularly egregious, the government is sued and damages can be awarded. Early on, in fact, this Congress spent a lot of its time doing nothing but that, sorting through claims and making appropriations to pay those claims. In fact, not even 100 years ago, much of this body’s work was consumed only by 
this topic. It wasn’t until 1956 that Congress established the Judgment Fund and gave authority to the Treasury Department to resolve these claims in ‘‘a permanent and indefinite appropriation.’’ That has simply been abused. In keeping with the law, the Treasury Department files a yearly report with Congress and maintains a web page that supposedly can be searched. That sounds good, but it doesn’t work that way. It is cryptic and has otherwise limited information related to each payout that has made the data almost entirely worthless. There is no information on what the government did. There is no information on the claimant. We are all familiar with, for example, when the previous administration took $1.3 billion out of the fund and converted it to cash and delivered it to Iran. Four years ago, The New York Times reported what was likely an illegal billiondollar payout to farmers who had never even sued the government. This isn’t just unacceptable, it is crazy. It is horrible government. It is what leads people to distrust the Federal Government. It would require the Treasury to make payment out of this fund public, and it would include very simple things that common sense would simply demand. This bill would name the agency. It would name the name of the plaintiff and the amount that they were paid, then a brief description of the facts around that claim. Mr. Chairman, I will conclude by just saying the Judgment Fund Transparency Act may not prevent bad decisions by all government employees, but it will shine a light on decisions to the American people. It is about helping to increase trust between the American people and government, a government that we have given them reason not to trust. Let’s bring in accountability and transparency to that. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and the language found within this bill. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to again remind folks that, during the course of this argument, we have heard this narrative about the problems with the sue and settle, as Mr. NADLER described it, an imagined, concocted vast conspiracy, but without any evidence that it actually exists, a solution in search of a problem. Just to remind folks, there were two reports done by the GAO—I have them in my hand; they are thick—that, in fact, undermine the suggestion that there is any such problem. In response to requests from the Republican committee chairs, the Government Accountability Office has twice concluded that agencies cannot and do not circumvent the rulemaking system through settlements relating to statutory deadlines. Finally, we received testimony earlier this year from Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department that current agency policy, which was codified in 1991, prohibits circumventing the rulemaking process through deadline lawsuits. We have heard similar testimony from career Justice Department officials in prior administrations. I ask the question: How is H.R. 469 necessary in light of this complete lack of support for this socalled sue and settle phenomenon and the presence of controls against this from happening in the first instance? Mr. Chair, again, there is just no evidence to support the necessity for this. I think it has been articulated very well by my colleagues what the dangers are of moving forward with this legislation. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON ), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak in favor of H.R. 469, the Sunshine for Regulations and Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act. This is an important piece of legislation because, as has been noted here, it seeks to increase accountability on the regulatory process by providing greater scrutiny of sue and settle cases. Yes, they do exist. It requires the Department of Justice to release details of payments made through the Judgment Fund, and it strengthens Congress’ ability to intervene on litigation regarding the constitutionality of congressional statutes. This legislation also includes H.R. 1096, the Judgment Fund Transparency Act, which I am proud to cosponsor. That piece of legislation includes an amendment I offered, which would require the Secretary of the Treasury to clearly display the total expenditures, including the attorney’s fees, interest, and all other payments made from the Judgment Fund on an annual basis. Hardworking taxpayers deserve to know where their tax dollars are being spent, and Congress must ensure that programs like the Judgment Fund are following the law. The American people must be allowed every available tool to keep their government accountable, and this will be an important tool. Also, it would ensure a terrorist organization is prohibited from receiving any taxpayer funds from the Judgment Fund by prohibiting any foreign terrorist organization, as defined in section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That statute clearly classifies a terrorist organization as those who ‘‘engage in terrorist activity or terrorism, and the organization threatens the security of the United States nationals or the national security of the United States.’’ These terrorist organizations only seek to commit serious harm or potential targets, of course, including Americans, and I believe this prohibition is warranted to be included in this important legislation. Let me be clear. We should all agree that not a cent of taxpayer dollars should ever go to a state sponsor of terrorism or foreign terrorist organizations. A recent illustration of the need for this ban on funding to state sponsors of terrorism is what we now know about the previous administration. They paid $1.3 billion from the Judgment Fund to the nation of Iran in a settlement dating back over 30 years. Although all the information surrounding this payment was never made clear to the public, Iran still remains a state sponsor of terrorism, the most notorious one. Mr. Chair, again, I strongly support H.R. 469. We must never allow taxpayer dollars to be given to violent rogue nations that support terrorists or, obviously, terrorist organizations, and this will ensure a constitutional check on the Judgment Fund. This is about Article I, the authority of this body. For that reason, Mr. Chairman, I strongly support it, and I encourage our colleagues to do the same. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say I am baffled by the gentleman from Louisiana’s assertion that this legislation improves accountability. It is very hard to imagine how undermining the enforcement of duly enacted legislation by Congress of the United States improves accountability. This is like the upsidedown world. How does that improve accountability, making it more difficult to enforce the laws passed by Congress of the United States? Mr. Chairman, I just want to say in closing that it is very important to note that my opposition to H.R. 469 is joined by a very broad spectrum of organizations, including the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, or AFL–CIO; the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; Public Citizen; Consumer Federation of America; the National Consumer Law Center; the Natural Resources Defense Council; the Sierra Club; Earthjustice; and People for the American Way; among many others. Mr. Chairman, I think that is company, which should suggest to my colleagues that this legislation does not benefit the American people, it will undermine the actions of Congress. Mr. Chairman, I urge everyone to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I yield back the balance of my time. b1700 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I just want to say that this is not just something that has 
been dreamed up, as far as from a bill perspective. And they can point to studies that say this may or may not be a part, but even the outside organization, the Environmental Council of the States, sent a letter and basically did a resolution that said there is a need to reform State participation in EPA consent decrees which settled through citizen lawsuits. I mean, this is an issue because there is not the transparency that is needed. That is why these bills are here. I would just like to remind everyone why we are considering this bill today, going back to where we first started, and why the House passed the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act and the Congressional Subpoena Compliance and Enforcement Act earlier this week: to help restore and reinforce the powers the people gave Congress in Article I of the Constitution. Restoring and reinforcing these powers is not some academic issue; this is something that we practice every day. It goes back to as early as our elementary school days dealing with our simple civics, saying this is the way our government is set up. I have said this before, Mr. Chairman, from this podium, and I will say it again. If the people in agencies down the street would like to make law, then I encourage them to leave their job, run for Congress, and come up here and make law. This is not their job to do it from a cubicle down the street through a lawsuit. We need to do it up here, as it should be properly done. So, for far too long, Congress has been giving away its power. We want to see that change. We are going to see that. That is why this bill is here. And although this bill alone is certainly not a silver bullet for restoring the power the Congress has ceded, just as powers are gradually lost over time, they will be regained by Congress gradually reasserting itself. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation to reassert congressional authority and to ensure that individual liberty protected by the powers of separation of powers between the branches is maintained. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong opposition to H.R. 469 the ‘‘Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act’’ of 2017. H.R. 469 is yet another attempt to undermine the ability of Federal regulators to protect the health and safety of Americans. This illconceived bill imposes numerous new procedural burdens on agencies and courts intended to dissuade them from using consent decrees and settlement agreements to resolve enforcement actions filed to address agency noncompliance with the law. H.R. 469 targets consent decrees and settlement agreements involving congressionally mandated federal agency actions. These agency actions in many instances have the purpose of protecting civil rights, health, safety, and the environment. H.R. 469 prescribes a host of burdensome—and, in some cases, ambiguous— steps for courts and parties relating to such consent decrees and settlements that would favor continued litigation over settlement. H.R. 469 establishes a prolonged process of publication, intervention, and courtsupervised mediation for these types of settlements. This prolonged process would waste judicial, individuals, and local governments’ resources, while wealthy corporations are empowered to perpetuate violations of federal rules. Such hurdles to settlements conflict directly with the expressly stated and longstanding policy of the federal judiciary system to favor compromise and the settlement of disputes in order to make the best use of limited resources. Proponents of this legislation argue that agencies and interest groups collude to ‘‘sue and settle’’ to avoid compliance with the procedures set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act. These allegations are unfounded in fact. The consent decrees and settlement agreements at issue do not determine the substance of agency rules. Rather, such agreements simply seek to enforce mandatory statutory and procedural duties (such as deadlines enacted by Congress). In fact, a December 2014 Government Accountability Office report surveyed settlements over deadlines for major U.S. Environmental Protection Act rulemakings and found that the settlements did not influence the substantive results. Furthermore, all public notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and the individual laws at issue still apply when an agency undertakes the substantive action for which a deadline was missed. Parties and nonparties alike are provided with numerous opportunities to provide input in advance of the rules being finalized. H.R. 469 undermines protections for the American people, masqueraded as a measure to prevent undocumented and unfounded allegations of ‘‘sue and settle’’ collusion between public interest plaintiffs and sympathetic federal agencies entering into consent decrees and settlements. In fact, H.R. 469 favors industry interests at taxpayer expense and promotes regulatory uncertainty by making it virtually impossible to actually enter into consent decrees and settlements that avoid the costly and time consuming alternative of litigation. But its most serious flaw is that H.R. 469 is really a back door way to derail the rulemaking process and undermine federal law, shifting limited agency resources away from the implementation of health and safety protections for the very people that we are supposed to be representing. What this bill truly targets are the legal rights of citizens to hold government accountable by enforcing laws designed to protect health, safety, and the environment, obligations that the supporters of this bill would prefer to remain unenforced. A broad coalition of more than 150 civil rights, environmental, consumer protection and other public interest groups opposed the bill in the last Congress. On Monday, October 23, 2017, I received a letter signed by 86 environmental protection and civil rights groups urging me to oppose this bill. A bill that attempts to give third parties the power to obstruct and delay the enforcement of federal law; which will harm plaintiff corporations, state and local governments, nonprofit groups, and individuals alike, when their interests have been harmed by illegal federal agency actions or inactions. Consent decrees and settlement agreements are simple, streamlined ways to hold federal agencies accountable when they ignore Congress by failing to commit congressionally mandated actions by a date established in statute. H.R. 469 is a sad attempt to eliminate vital and broadly supported protections that have improved and saved millions of American lives. By providing opportunities for industry to subvert or delay the process of redressing injured groups, H.R. 469 effectively makes it more expensive for agencies to do what Congress has mandated, that is to protect the American people and redress any harm to their livelihood. Some of the unwholesomeness of this bill could have been mitigated had the Jackson Lee amendment to H.R. 469 been made in order. The Jackson Lee amendment would have excepted consent decrees or settlement agreements that pertain to a reduction in illness or death from exposure to toxic substances in communities that are protected by Executive Order 12898. Executive Order 12898 directs federal agencies to identify and address the disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects of agency action on minority and lowincome populations. It is impossible to understand why even conservative Republicans would back legislation that hinders enforcement of the law, requires agencies to waste money in court on cases they believe they cannot win, and would stymie industry and state settlements along with all others. I urge all members to vote against H.R. 469 and reject this harmful legislation. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. MITCHELL ). All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–34. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows: 
H.R. 469 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . COLLINS OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part A of House Report 115–363. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of Chairman GOODLATTE , and I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 16, line 2, insert after ‘‘otherwise prohibited by law’’ the following: ‘‘(other than section 552a of title 5, United States Code)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 577, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, the Department of the Treasury’s interpretation of current law prohibits it from making public the names of plaintiffs. My amendment clarifies that these names, which this bill requires to be disclosed, will, in fact, be disclosed. In January 2016, it was reported that the United States agreed to pay $1.7 billion to Iran in a settlement arising from an agreement to sell military equipment to Iran prior to the 1979 Iranian Revolution. At the time, it was known that $400 million in cash had been transferred to Iran, but it was unclear, even after public inquiry, how the remaining $1.3 billion had been paid. On August 22, 2016, the New York Sun reported that, while conducting an ongoing but fruitless search of ‘‘Iran’’ as a claimant in the Treasury database, it found 13 payments totaling 13 cents less than $1.3 billion, as well as an additional payment of just over $10 million. Without further context, however, the New York Sun could not confirm whether these payments were, in fact, part of the settlement. It was only after months of increased public scrutiny, long after the money had been disbursed, that the previous administration acknowledges that these payments were indeed part of the Iran settlement. My amendment will ensure that the public knows about the conduct of its government and the laws that are being faithfully executed and that justice is being served. The information that this bill requires to be disclosed, which, in many cases is already publicly available in court documents, informs Congress and the public in new ways, particularly with regard to systemic government abuse. Furthermore, any concerns about the disclosure of the plaintiffs’ names are mitigated by the fact that this amendment does not foreclose a court’s ability to protect private information. Indeed, the information required to be made public in title II will not be disclosed if such disclosure is prohibited by a court order. Moreover, Federal judges have ample discretion to allow a plaintiff to proceed under the pseudonym as a ‘‘Doe plaintiff’’ or to seal and redact intimate records. My amendment is necessary to prevent future government abuse by increasing the overall transparency of the Judgment Fund and, in turn, increasing government accountability. I urge my colleagues to support this important clarification, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Rhode Island is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chairman, I think it is very important to say at the outset this is not about clarifying anything. This is about a major change in policy. This amendment will permit the publication of a victim’s sensitive information, such as the individual’s name and case history, on the internet. This overrides the Privacy Act. So let’s be clear about what this is. This is not a clarification. This is a major change in policy. This amendment will make a bad bill even worse. It specifies that the Privacy Act does not prohibit the publication of a victim’s sensitive information, such as his or her name and case history. Under current law, the Treasury Department cannot, for the purposes of the Judgment Fund, publish the sensitive information of individuals who are victims of government abuse or misconduct, such as a name or case history. This is because the Privacy Act requires an individual’s consent prior to publishing their name or other sensitive information. Although proponents of this amendment may claim that this information is, in some instances, already publicly available, the Supreme Court has recognized that a person’s privacy interests and their personal information collected in government records does not automatically dissolve because such information may be available to the public already in some other format. Individuals have the right to control the dissemination of their own personal information. This amendment makes it clear that the bill will infringe on an individual’s personal privacy if he or she is compensated from the Judgment Fund. Moreover, this amendment does not further the public interest in government transparency. Publishing an individual person’s name on the internet sheds no significant light on the inner workings of government and has no value; and so, to the contrary, it will result in potentially grave harassment or even intimidation. Revealing this information is an unwarranted intrusion on personal privacy of individuals harmed by government misconduct, which could include victims of medical malpractice as well as racial and sexual discrimination. In effect, it revictimizes the victims of government misconduct or abuse—a terrible result. So, therefore, I oppose this amendment which does not do anything to improve the bill and, in fact, makes it considerably worse. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment. And if you vote for it, recognize that you will have to go home and tell your constituents that you have agreed to a serious invasion of their personal privacy and that it will allow individuals who are victims of government misconduct to have that personal information put on the internet and shared with millions of people all over the world. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, you can also go home and tell them, if they filed a suit, that it is already currently in the PACER system, probably with more information than just that, or they could have filed it under a pseudonym or had their lawyers have this suppressed. This is an issue that is already out there; and as we look at this, this is moving forward. So I would just ask that this amendment be reported favorably. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . CONYERS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 made in order by the order of the House of October 24, 2017. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT OFFERED IN LIEU OF AMEND MENT NO. 2 P RINTED IN PART A OFHOUSE  REPORT NO. 115–363 O FFERED BY MR. CONYERS OF MICHIGAN  Page 3, line 17, strike ‘‘; and’’ and insert ‘‘, other than an excepted consent decree or settlement agreement;’’. Page 4, line 4, strike the period and insert ‘‘; and’’. Page 4, insert after line 4 the following: (6) the term ‘‘excepted consent decree or settlement agreement’’ means a covered consent decree or covered settlement agreement that prevents or is intended to prevent discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, or any other protected category. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 577, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would exempt from H.R. 469 settlement agreements and consent decrees intended to prevent discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, or other protected category. Given the often systemic nature of discriminatory conduct, settlement 
agreements and consent decrees provide an invaluable means to provide for general relief for nonidentifiable victims and to prevent future discriminatory acts. In particular, they are instrumental in enforcing critical civil rights protections in a wide variety of cases, including voting rights violations and predatory lending practices based on race. Other examples include the use of consent decrees by the Justice Department to address unconstitutional police pattern or practice activities. For example, in 2003, the City of Detroit entered into a consent decree with the Justice Department concerning the inappropriate use of force and arrest practices by the city’s police department. As a result of this decree, the police department implemented vastly improved practices that have substantially reduced the incidence of fatalities caused by law enforcement activities, a goal that the Judiciary Committee Chairman GOODLATTE and I very much endorse. According to the department’s civil rights division, these decrees facilitate institutional reforms, such as improving systems for supervising officers and holding them accountable for misconduct, as well as ensuring officers have the policy guidance, training, equipment, and other resources necessary for constitutional and effective policing. Unfortunately, H.R. 469 would make the use of such remedies exceedingly difficult by subjecting them to numerous procedural and potentially meritless court challenges. A particularly concerning provision of this bill is its broad and illdefined authorization allowing virtually anyone to intervene with respect to a proposed settlement agreement or consent decree. For example, imagine a proposed settlement agreement intended to restrict a city’s school district from discriminating against Muslims. Under the bill, any antiMuslim or neoNazi organization could petition the court to intervene for the purpose of opposing such agreement on the ground that it ‘‘would affect’’ such person. This is just one of the many fundamental problems presented by this thoroughly flawed and, I think, harmful measure, and, so, accordingly, I ask my colleagues here to join me in opposing H.R. 469. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, with much respect for my ranking member on my committee—we have served together; we have worked on a lot of issues together, namely, the Police Working Group, and other things, and his work has been very helpful in that regard—I do have to oppose this amendment because, really, what this amendment does is seek less transparency, public participation, and judicial review for consent decrees and settlement agreements for regulations that allegedly will help to protect civil rights. With all due respect, I believe this has matters backwards. More transparency, public input, and judicial scrutiny will only help to produce regulations that better protect civil rights. Further, since the bill promotes the participation of regulated entities and State, local, and Tribal entities that may be affected by or help to enforce the regulations, it will promote buyin from these groups. That will help the regulation to be better and more promptly implemented and not held for years in litigation challenging the rules. I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1715 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, although H.R. 469 has many flaws, I am particularly concerned that the bill’s broad and illdefined requirements would effectively delay and possibly deter civil enforcement agencies from providing general relief in discrimination cases, discourage courts from enforcing these settlements, and also invite costly and needless litigation. In response to this problem, my amendment would simply exclude from the bill’s burdensome requirements settlement agreements and consent decrees intended to remediate generalized harms in civil rights cases. Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense amendment, and I urge my colleagues here to support it. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ). The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . JOHNSON OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part A of House Report 115–363. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 3, line 17, strike ‘‘; and’’ and insert ‘‘, other than an excepted consent decree or settlement agreement;’’. Page 4, line 4, strike the period and insert ‘‘; and’’. Page 4, insert after line 4 the following: (6) the term ‘‘excepted consent decree or settlement agreement’’ means a covered consent decree or covered settlement agreement pertaining to a deadline established by Congress through the enactment of a Federal statute to— (A) significantly improve access to affordable, highspeed broadband internet in underserved markets, such as lowincome and rural communities; and (B) facilitate economic development in locations without sufficient access to such service. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 577, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support my amendment to H.R. 469, and to advocate for rural Georgians and Americans across the country who don’t have dependable access to broadband internet services. We are here today debating H.R. 469, a bill that would require burdensome and unnecessary processes that would delay the enforcement of Federal regulations. H.R. 469 undermines the ability of government agencies to protect public health and safety by prohibiting them from using consent decrees and settlements to enforce the law that we pass by allowing private industry to intervene in opposition to regulations that they deem unfavorable to them. It requires the publishing of the personal data of those who bring complaints against the government, thus deterring complaints. My amendment would ensure that future actions taken by Congress to increase broadband access in rural areas are not stymied by these excessive regulatory burdens. My amendment would exempt any future legislation, or any future rules that may be enacted to bring this technology to underserved areas from the requirements put in place by H.R. 469. It shouldn’t be groundbreaking news that, in many of our districts, a gap exists between urban and rural communities insofar as broadband connectivity is concerned. The Fourth District of Georgia has some rural pockets that are facing this challenge today. According to a study done by the Pew Research Center in 2016, rural Americans are still 10 percentage points less likely than average citizens to have broadband access at home. Although we have seen improvements since the 16point gap in 2007, we have much work to do to ensure that all families have access to what is now a modern necessity. My home State of Georgia ranks 21st in the Nation in terms of access to 25 megabit per second broadband, according to a report put together by the Georgia House and Senate Study Committee on High Speed Broadband Communications Access for all Georgians. In rural counties where this problem persists, we have seen local development stall without access to telehealth services, educational materials, and other digital resources. Broadband connectivity brings with it countless learning opportunities and exchanges of information that are not possible in isolated communities without broadband. The issue of broadband access is inextricably linked to the vitality of these rural areas, and it is in our best interest as a Congress to give rural communities all of the modern tools they need to succeed. 
The FCC’s 2016 Broadband Progress Report identified 24 million rural Americans throughout the country who don’t have a broadband connection—24 million Americans whose access would be delayed even further by the implementation of H.R. 469’s elimination of consent decrees. I hope Congress can agree on the importance of achieving full broadband access, and I hope that this amendment will begin removing this hurdle that is being put in place by my friends on the other side of the aisle who support business as opposed to people. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I was just sitting here, Mr. Chairman, and I am excited and welcome my friend from Georgia to the fight for broadband. I have been leading on this fight now for several years, especially in my district, which is rural, which has a company called Windstream that does not provide for its citizens. I am excited to have the acknowledgment that rural broadband is something that we need to be fighting for. My district has areas in which Windstream was supposed to use its Connect America funds to widen its footprint on rural broadband. Instead, they have shrunk it, only to compete in areas where they are competing against other companies, and only widening it in areas where they already had technology which they could have widened years before. I think it is really interesting, and I am so glad about this because it also gives me the opportunity to talk about the GO Act, the Gigabyte Opportunity Act, which actually will provide real solutions into these districts for broadband opportunity. I would encourage my friends from Georgia and from Michigan, and anybody else, to sign on to this bill. It is a good bill that has support across the way in the Senate, and also working with the administration to provide the way for States to actually look at their own States and provide gigabyte opportunity zones so that they can actually make ways and get these companies that are monopolizing the areas and not serving their constituents. By the way, Mr. Chairman, it is sad because, in some of my districts right now, it has been over really about 6 weeks or so since Irma came through northeast Georgia and knocked out power and delayed broadband, and I still have customers in my district who do not have phone service or broadband this long after that fact. This is just unacceptable, so I appreciate the concern here. The only problem is, this amendment doesn’t help. This amendment is not one that does— again, it just is another amendment, unfortunately, like the last amendment, that seeks less transparency and public participation. It does not do anything to discourage people from working to find rural broadband solutions. What this actually does, it just, again, tries to seek less transparency instead of more. But I think there is a positive here. I choose to look at the positive. I disagree with this amendment and would ask that it be voted ‘‘no.’’ But I look at the positive to say, as someone from Georgia, we have got a fight we can connect on, and that is rural broadband, because there is no longer a digital divide. There is a hope and dream divide. It is not a digital divide. It is a hope and dream for those students, and those moms, and those dads, and those families in those areas who cannot access the internet. For me, it was a radio and a book. It took me all over the world. Nowadays, it is the internet and a phone where our students can actually get what they want. Unfortunately, this amendment doesn’t do it. I have to oppose this amendment, but I am glad to welcome to the fight another friend against the evils of not being able to expand broadband. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I just enjoyed the contrast between our different styles. The Congressman, my friend from Georgia, is very upbeat and passionate. I am more laid back and kind of reserved. But we both agree on the fact that we want more broadband to be accessible to rural customers. We both agree on that. We just simply disagree on whether or not we should allow a process whereby a thirdparty corporation can come in and gum up the regulatory scheme that has been laid out in the rulings that have been made and, thus, delay the availability of broadband to rural customers. Mr. Chair, I would ask respectfully that my colleagues support my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will be postponed. The Committee will rise informally. The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. JOHNSONof Louisiana) assumed the chair.

AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . MCEACHIN  
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. M ITCHELL ). It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part A of House Report 115–363. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 3, line 17, strike ‘‘; and’’ and insert ‘‘, other than an excepted consent decree or settlement agreement;’’. Page 4, line 4, strike the period and insert ‘‘; and’’. Page 4, insert after line 4 the following: (6) the term ‘‘excepted consent decree or settlement agreement’’ means a covered consent decree or covered settlement agreement pertaining to the improvement or maintenance of air or water quality. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 577, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. MCEACHIN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment which seeks to reduce H.R. 469’s adverse effects on public health and environmental quality. More specifically, my amendment would exempt from the terms of this bill consent decrees and settlement agreements pertaining to the maintenance or improvement of air and water quality. Mr. Chairman, litigation empowers our constituents to hold Federal agencies accountable when they fail to take required actions by congressionally mandated deadlines. In many of these cases, agencies’ failures are not in serious dispute. A missed deadline is a missed deadline. Litigants’ goals are simply to ensure that the law is followed quickly and in full. In such cases, it is not unusual, and certainly not unreasonable, for lawsuits to conclude with consent decrees or settlement agreements. As reported, this bill would introduction duplicative requirements and unnecessary barriers into the process by which the consent decrees and settlement agreements are reached. As a result, both tools would be used less often and less effectively. Across the board, that change would be a mistake, but would generally be disastrous with respect to pollution. Air and water quality are matters of public health. When they fail to meet 
certain levels, people get sick and potentially die. The World Health Organization says that unhealthy environments kill more than 12 million people annually. In the United States, multiple studies have shown that tens of thousands of deaths every year are attributable to air pollution alone. These figures, of course, do not begin to contemplate nonlethal effects of health and quality of life. We all know that justice delayed is justice denied—and that is especially true when lives are at stake. When regulators fail to take mandated actions to maintain or improve air or water quality, that is an injustice. When they sincerely intend to take those actions, but fail to do so in a timely way, that is also an injustice. If we make it harder for citizens to hold regulators accountable, if we take away tools that empower Americans to make their voices heard, and hold agencies to account, we are compounding those injuries. Let me be clear: consent decrees and settlement agreements do make a real difference in people’s lives. They do this not by changing the substance of the agencies’ actions as a formal rulemaking would do, but by ensuring that the planned or required actions are actually taken. I invite my colleagues to look at the Chesapeake Bay and the settlement agreement in Fowler v. EPA. Back in 2010, the EPA was under both congressional and executive mandates to improve water quality in the bay, but the agency was not on track to implement necessary standards within the required timeframe. Citizens and public interest groups filed suit, and the case concluded in a settlement agreement that established a concrete deadline for actions that the agency was already working towards— notably, the imposition of the total maximum daily load, a binding limit on pollution in the watershed. The result has been a small but very promising improvement in the health of the bay. Were it not for the agreement, we might still be waiting on the EPA to take the actions necessary. b1730 We would have lost a significant amount of time, and, instead of improving conditions, conditions might have worsened, and the problem we faced would have grown correspondingly greater. So, again, Mr. Chairman, justice delayed is justice denied; and, again, consent decrees and settlement agreements prevent avoidable, unnecessary delay. Contrary to what my friends on the other side of the aisle have said, consent decrees and settlements do not and cannot take the place of formal rulemaking. Existing Federal regulations prevent agencies from using either tool to make commitments in excess of what relevant statutes provide. The GAO has explored whether deadline litigation affects the substance of agencies’ actions; overwhelmingly, they concluded it does not. So the only function of this bill would be to stymie citizens’—our constituents’—efforts to ensure that our laws are faithfully executed to protect our air and our water, and, therefore, our health, in court. My amendment would fix that problem in at least one area, and I urge its adoption. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman bringing it forward. Again, we have never said that consent decrees can’t be used. The issue here is how they are used in transparency. Justice delayed, as has been said, is not one that is denied, but also transparency not used is also things that are done in the dark and away from the public view which also can have issues that we go forward. Very few of these cases are actually brought by Joe Private Citizen. They are brought by groups with interest. Even in the Chesapeake Bay, which has an $18 billion compliance tag, the rushed timeframe did not allow others’ input and buyin from other localities. So, again, nowhere has abuse of sue and settle tactics been seen so much as in the environmental regulation. In fact, the Judiciary Committee’s report on this bill highlights 10 environmental sue and settle regulations from the Obama administration that equaled up to $125 billion of cost. Even the Environmental Council, as I stated earlier, in 2013, adopted a resolution calling upon the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to adopt reforms like the ones in this bill. This amendment would deny reform to precisely the area of regulation that needs it most and, thereby, substantially gut the bill. We can have good environmental regulations without shady, backroom dealing of sue and settle litigation skewing the results and excessively heightening the burden. I appreciate the gentleman bringing the amendment, but I would oppose it, and I would ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment as well. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman’s concerns, but actually having been a trial lawyer and actually having practiced law in the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia and elsewhere, there is no more transparent process than the litigation process. I would submit that the notion that somehow these actions are brought by someone other than our constituents, someone other than citizens of the United States, is not well taken. So, Mr. Chairman, I would conclude by simply asking that my colleagues support this amendment, that we move forward in that regard, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. MCEACHIN ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia will be postponed. The Chair understands that amendment No. 5 will not be offered. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in part A of House Report 115–363. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 3, line 17, strike ‘‘; and’’ and insert ‘‘, other than an excepted consent decree or settlement agreement;’’. Page 4, line 4, strike the period and insert ‘‘; and’’. Page 4, insert after line 4 the following: (6) the term ‘‘excepted consent decree or settlement agreement’’ means a covered consent decree or covered settlement agreement entered into pursuant to sections 0.160 through 0.163 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Meese Policy’’). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 577, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that would create an exception in the legislation for consent decrees or settlement agreements entered into pursuant to the Meese policy. For those unfamiliar, the Meese policy prohibits the Department of Justice from undertaking a regulatory action through a settlement. More specifically, the Meese policy directs departments and agencies not to enter into a consent decree if it would act as a socalled end run, around the regular rulemaking process or constrain an agency head from exercising its discretionary authority in the future. Any departure from these rules must be approved by the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or the Associate Attorney General beforehand. Edwin Meese, the former Attorney General for the Reagan administration, wrote a memo articulating this policy in 1986, out of a concern for the abuse of settlements by agencies. Now, the Department of Justice later codified it in 1991, in the Code of Federal Regulations. 
Simply put, there is a law already on the books that prevents the Department of Justice or other agencies from abusing consent decrees and settlement agreements used by Federal agencies, and it is working. In February of this year, the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, determined that Department officials negotiating settlement terms are covered by the Meese policy. The GAO’s report noted that any settlement would only include a commitment to perform an action already mandated by law. So if you are scoring along at home, what I am saying is this: there is a needless overlap between this bill that we are considering, H.R. 469, and the Meese policy in regard to the scope of settlements. There is also redundancy with existing laws in terms of protecting the interests of third parties. If I may be so bold, I would like to say that persons with only a nodding acquaintance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure already know that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 allows affected parties to intervene in litigation if they feel their interests are not properly represented in the case. Moreover, even if a rule was promulgated by a settlement agreement, the Administrative Procedure Act would still mandate noticeandcomment procedures for the rule. Simply put, this is a bill that is a solution in search of a problem, and my amendment underscores that fact. If I may be so bold, I would like to say that here in America we have actual real problems that merit our attention here in this House, such as why we haven’t had an infrastructure bill leading to highpaying American jobs. We need actual solutions to actual problems, not theoretical ones like in this bill. That is why I have offered this amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate the gentleman bringing in the Meese memo. We discussed this earlier that if we actually went back to the actual intent of the Meese memo which said the Attorney General would be the part, we could probably agree on that. But let’s get some things straight. There has been nothing codified. This is a regulation. It has not been codified. Codification would have to come from actual legislation passed by this body, and it is not. The amendment would seek to carve out of the bill consent decrees and settlements entered into under Department of Justice regulations ostensibly written to implement this Meese memo. The Meese memo was a Reaganera Department policy, issued by Attorney General Meese, that prohibited the Department from entering into specified categories of decrees or settlements— particularly those that allowed the judiciary, through judicial orders, from invading the constitutionally exclusive authority of the executive branch. Current regulations, however, require less scrutiny by, and less accountability for, such consent decrees on the part of the Attorney General. What we need is not less Department of Justice accountability for backroom deals that trespass constitutional lines of authority, but more accountability. The bill would restore full accountability consistent with the letter and the spirit of the Meese memo itself. Further, the amendment would carve out any and all decrees and settlements entered by the approval of officials as low as the Assistant Attorneys General—meaning most of the relevant decrees and settlements entered into by the Department. As a result, the amendment would gut the bill’s consent decree and settlement reforms. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, to conclude, H.R. 469’s proponents offer no evidence that there actually is a sue and settle problem or that agencies are not currently complying with the Meese memo. The GAO has already said they are. My amendment simply makes clear that this bill is unnecessary, and, as such, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania will be postponed. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will now resume on those amendments printed in part A of House Report 115– 363 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following order: Amendment No. 3 by Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Amendment No. 4 by Mr. MCEACHIN  of Virginia. Amendment No. 6 by Mr. CARTWRIGHT  of Pennsylvania. The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote after the first vote in this series.

b1830 PAYING TRIBUTE TO MONTANA EDUCATOR, CRAIG WILSON (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an educator who touched the lives of thousands of Montanans with his love for our State as well as his knowledge and passion for Montana politics. As one of Montana’s foremost political scientists, Dr. Craig Wilson was well known across the State and across both sides of the aisle. For 34 years, Professor Wilson spent his days in front of students in a classroom at Montana State University Billings, helping them understand the world in which they lived. He conducted reliable and respected surveys that engaged Montanans on issues that mattered most to them. His method was honest and straightforward, a welcome approach in today’s politics. Craig was a loving husband to Kristianne, a proud father of Collin and Evan, and a doting grandfather to Blair and Jett. Dr. Wilson was an educator in and out of the classroom. He was dearly loved and will be missed. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, it is National Cyber Security Awareness Month, and we have a lot of work to do to better secure our Nation’s cyberspace, and we cannot underestimate these challenges. During our district work period last week, I took the opportunity to go on a cybersecurity tour to understand better what Rhode Island’s initiatives are. During that time, I visited some of the Ocean State’s growing cybersecurity companies, stopping by SecureWorks’ Providence campus and speaking on a panel at Carousel Industries’ AlwaysOn Technology summit. I learned about efforts to stem cybercrimes from the Rhode Island State Police, and I joined Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea at an election security workshop for local officials. At the Rhode Island Society of CPAs, I encouraged our accountants to advise their clients about cybersecurity risk, and I joined State Senator Lou DiPalma to promote cyber hygiene practices. Most importantly, I spoke to PTECH students and participants in CyberPatriot about their importance as the next generation of cybersecurity leaders. Mr. Speaker, cybersecurity may be the national and economic security challenge of the 21st century, but with the talent that we have in Rhode Island, I am confident that we can take it on. 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF SAM COKER (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Dr. Sam Coker, who passed away on October 12, 2017, at 87 years of age. Dr. Coker was an active member of his community, serving as a church leader and board of trustee for 31 years at Young Harris College in Young Harris, Georgia. First and foremost, he was a Methodist minister, where he served at multiple churches across Georgia. Dr. Coker’s dedication is exemplified by his multiple trips to Jerusalem, where he baptized friends and colleagues in the Jordan River. In 2015, he was awarded the Young Harris College Artemas Lester Award for a lifetime of dedication to Christian service. Because of his love for education and others, he created the Gene Allison Coker scholarship in honor of his late wife. This scholarship enabled many 
students to achieve higher education and attend Young Harris College. Dr. Coker was a generous man, and he will be greatly missed. 
TAX REFORM (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, day after day, the President and congressional Republicans have sought to frame their tax proposal as a tax cut for hardworking middle class families and not a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, even going so far as to say it will not add to the deficit. Quite simply, they are trying to sell the American people a dream that will not become a reality. In New Jersey alone, 25 percent of the residents will see their taxes increase by $2,400, annually. That means one in four New Jerseyans are affected by this failed strategy of trickledown economics. These aren’t the very rich. I am talking about New Jersey’s regular working families. These New Jerseyans are a part of the 47 million Americans that will see a tax increase. This horrific tax reform plan and the rhetoric my Republican colleagues are using to garner support is simply fake news. It is a tax break for the wealthiest Americans. I refuse to participate in the crippling of the middle class and the working class and the halting of continued growth of the American economy by rubberstamping this billionairesfirst tax scheme. 
TAX REFORM LISTENING TOUR (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, last week in Minnesota, I conducted a tax reform listening tour, visiting small businesses in our community about why tax reform is so important. Throughout the tour, it was evident that these small businesses were enthusiastic that tax reform means more jobs, higher wages, and a stronger economy. Diversified Plastics in Brooklyn Park, an employeeowned company that manufactures and assembles plastic injection products, said that being able to immediately expense new equipment will allow them to invest more in their company and hire more people. Northstar Balloons in Plymouth, which manufactures and distributes foil party balloons, said that a Tax Code that provides stability and predictability will allow them to invest in their company with confidence. Mr. Speaker, the message was clear: fixing a broken Tax Code will help small businesses hire more people, give their employees a raise, and create a growing and a more competitive economy. f 
FILVETS (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, our country is forever grateful for the service and sacrifice of the over 200,000 Filipino and FilipinoAmerican soldiers who bravely served our country during World War II, heroes like Sixto Tabay, the last living Filipino World War II veteran on the Island of Kauai, whom I had the good fortune to meet with recently, people like him who fought bravely and sacrificed greatly. So many made the ultimate sacrifice alongside our American troops in that war, yet their service for decades has gone unrecognized by our country. Because of legislation that we passed, today, a very special day, these warriors were finally receiving the recognition that they earned and deserve, joining the heroic ranks of the likes of the Tuskegee Airmen and Hawaii’s own 442nd 100th Infantry Battalion, as we honored them in the U.S. Capitol with the Congressional Gold Medal, our Nation’s highest civilian honor. To Major General Antonio Taguba, the Filipino Veterans Recognition and Education Project, and all of our World War II Filipino veterans and their families who worked so hard and were so patient in making today a reality, ‘‘thank you very much to all of you,’’ ‘‘maraming salamat sa inyong lahat.’’ 
GERMANAMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, October is GermanAmerican Heritage Month. I am cochair of the Congressional GermanAmerican Caucus with Congressman BILL KEATING , and our caucus highlights German contributions to our country. It is estimated that 50 million Americans have German ancestry, and according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Germans are the largest single ethnic group in the United States. The caucus works to emphasize the friendship and alliance between the United States and Germany. We do so through an Oktoberfest networking event and through our support for programs like the CongressBundestag Youth Exchange internship program. The caucus also discusses timely topics such as trade, security, and foreign affairs and how they relate to our German counterparts. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we have a proud German heritage. Frederick Muhlenberg, a German immigrant and Lutheran pastor from Pennsylvania, whose family also founded Muhlenberg College, was the first Speaker of the House following the signing of the new Constitution. The caucus has more than 100 members, and I urge all those who are interested in joining to do so today during GermanAmerican Heritage Month. f 
DENOUNCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I was joined by many of our colleagues to echo the pleas of over 100 women who came dressed as brides here to D.C. to put a face on the brutal murder of Gladys Ricart, a victim of domestic violence who was killed in 1999. Yesterday I said that I was Gladys Ricart and that we were all Gladys Ricart. While this was happening, Mr. Speaker, I am distressed to inform you that a woman in my district in Inwood was fatally stabbed to death and beaten with a dumbbell by her longtime boyfriend. Police officers found Claudina Cruz dead, with multiple stab wounds to the torso and head trauma. She is also Gladys Ricart. We are all Gladys Ricart. I ask my colleagues to join me in denouncing domestic violence for Gladys, Claudina, and every victim of domestic violence across the country. Congress must reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act when it comes before us next year. 
CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MALCOM RANDALL VA MEDICAL CENTER (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Malcom Randall VA Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida. Named after its first director, who ran the hospital for 30 years, the Malcom Randall VA Center first opened its doors to our Nation’s veterans on October 22, 1967. Since then, it has grown from its original staff of 500 to be the centerpiece of our Nation’s largest veterans health delivery system. Today, the Malcom Randall VA Center serves over 140,000 veterans a year, consists of 14 hospitals and clinics, and acts as a teaching hospital in conjunction with the University of Florida medical school and other affiliates. The services Malcom Randall VA provides to our veterans cannot be overstated, and I am proud to know that this institution is in my hometown. Once again, congratulations to them for reaching this milestone. 
FEMA DENIALS (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I have often said that, even though the sun is shining after hurricanes and storms, the people are still hurting. Houston is resilient—and I might just say, ‘‘Go Astros’’—but I think it is important to talk about those who are impacted by Hurricane Harvey. I rise to help FEMA, because there is a large percentage of denials in my district. I believe that there should be a large promotion, if you will, informational provision to indicate to people the process for appealing FEMA denials. FEMA, itself, admits that many times the denials are based upon technical issues, that they should go to disaster recovery centers; but no one knows that if there is not a massive effort of information, number one. Number two, there are still in the thousands of homes in and around my district and in Texas that are waiting for FEMA inspectors. I have offered suggestions. Those suggestions should be taken up: college students, using resources of finding temporary employees, people who are already working but may have the skills to spend some hours as a FEMA inspector. In my phone are so many pictures of homes with garbage outside, people’s belongings. It is now garbage. It is their belongings. It is their life out on the front steps of their home. They are waiting for an inspector. The New York Times article says they are waiting for an inspector. FEMA, let’s work together. People are hurting. That should be part of our recovery and our appropriation coming up. 
NORTH KOREA HAS WON THE TITLE: A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the saberrattling rogue regime of North Korea should be back on the state sponsors of terrorism list, and here is why: This year, the North Korean regime kidnapped, tortured, and killed American citizen Otto Warmbier. In 2014, North Korea launched a cyber terrorist attack against Sony Pictures. A U.S. court also found, in 2014, that North Korea materially supported terrorist attacks by Hezbollah in Israel. In 2010, another court found that North Korea provided support for the terrorist organization the Japanese Red Army for their 1972 attack at an Israeli airport. In 2009 alone, there were three weapons shipments from North Korea to terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. U.S. officials have said North Korea aided Assad the Butcher by setting up a nuclear reactor that was destroyed by Israel in 2007. Mr. Speaker, it is clear, North Korea is a state sponsor of terrorism, so let’s let them officially wear the title along with their buddy, Iran. And that is just the way it is. f 
b1845 MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS ARE SICK AND TIRED (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, middle class Americans are sick and tired; sick and tired of footing the bill so that richfolk millionaires and billionaires can get another tax break. The Republicans’ proposed tax reform plan is nothing but a tax cut for rich folks. It translates to increasing taxes for the poor and middle class families in our country. That means that families already struggling to make ends meet will have a tougher time making that car note, that mortgage, and gaining nothing in return. As a country, the GOP billionaire tax cut plan steals hundreds of billions of dollars from the U.S. Treasury. That means that we can’t make crucial investments in infrastructure, job training, or research and development that would help give people a goodpaying job. Reducing our tax base also translates into cuts to popular programs like Medicare. You know how much everybody likes that. The American people want tax reform, but not a plan that would literally jeopardize families’ livelihoods. We must put middle class families first in this country, and the GOP tax plan fails to do that. We can and must do better for the American people. 
LIFE IS WASHABLE PROVIDES FRIENDLY ACCESS SENSORY SAFETY KITS (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Life Is Washable, an organization that provides comfort and support to individuals suffering from sensory processing disorders. Locally, through their partnership with the Jim and Juli Boeheim Foundation, Life Is Washable provides friendly access sensory safety kits at sporting events and concerts across the region. Often, guests suffering from a sensory disorder or a medical condition that impacts the senses, including autism or dementia, find it difficult to enjoy loud, brightly lit events. The tools in these kits range from earmuffs to antiglare glasses, and help ensure that those with sensory needs can enjoy a sporting event or concert comfortably without the usual burdens they experience. This innovative approach has helped improve the quality of these events for those with sensory disorders across the country. So far, several major venues in New York have begun using these kits, including the Veterans Memorial Arena in Binghamton and the Carrier Dome in Syracuse. We are grateful to Life Is Washable for the important steps their staff has taken locally to reduce the burdens on those suffering from a sensory processing disorder. f 
WE NEED TO BAN BUMP STOCKS (Mrs. TORRES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, it has been almost 1 month since the mass shooting in Las Vegas occurred; 58 dead, more than 500 injured, many from California—the deadliest shooting in our history. And here we are, 1 month later, and I am ashamed to say that this Congress has not taken a single action to prevent the next shooting. After the shooting, 64 Republicans signed a letter to ATF, asking ATF to regulate bump stocks. ATF just notified us that it could not act. It could not act. The ball is back in our court. Will those Members act now? Representative CICILLINE has introduced a commonsense bill to ban bump stocks. If you signed the letter, you should cosponsor the bill. It is that simple. What are you waiting for? Mr. Speaker, there are some problems that we cannot solve, but this one is not one of those. 
A FEDERAL GRANT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE A SAFE HAVEN FOR COMPANION ANIMALS (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as we continue to shed light on domestic violence during this month of October, I would like to highlight a bill, H.R. 909, the Pet and Women Safety Act. This necessary bipartisan legislation introduced by my friend Representative KATHERINE CLARK and I will establish a Federal grant program to provide a safe haven for the companion animals of domestic violence victims. Studies show that almost half of domestic violence survivors do not leave their abusive relationships out of fear of what would happen to their beloved pets. When less than 5 percent of domestic violence shelters are able to house pets, it is no wonder why so many victims choose to stay in these relationships for as long as they do. Our bill empowers these victims and gives them the necessary resources to help them step out of the shadow of fear and uncertainty. 
Mr. Speaker, the Pet and Women Safety Act now enjoys the bipartisan support of 237 of our colleagues. I encourage every Member of Congress to add their name to this legislation, and I ask our leadership to bring H.R. 909 for a vote. 
THE DEBT BETRAYAL (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, in 2010, Tea Party Republicans were swept into office on a passionate plea to eliminate the deficit, to reduce the national debt, and to not pass on a great fiscal burden to our children. Upon election, they boldly formed the Freedom Caucus, the fiscal watchdogs of the House. At the time, the national debt, in 2010, was $13 trillion, and many were deeply concerned about our Nation’s fiscal situation, and they made a promise to do everything in their power to rein in wasteful spending and to get government’s fiscal House in order. Now here we are in 2017, after nearly 7 years of a Republicancontrolled Congress, and the debt is over $20 trillion. That is 7 years of a Republicancontrolled Congress and $7 trillion in additional debt. Now we have a tax giveaway of an additional $2.5 trillion to pass on to our children. I ask all the socalled fiscal conservatives in this Chamber, all the socalled Freedom Caucus members, where is your big talk about the debt now? Is your desire to claim a victory worth betraying your deepest principles forever? 
THE GREATEST ANTIPOVERTY PROGRAM IN ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the greatest antipoverty program in all of human history: the free enterprise system. Maybe the most remarkable achievement in human history is the fact that, over the last 40 years, about 80 percent of the world’s worst poverty has been eliminated. We know the right combination of smart investments in things like research, education, infrastructure, and defense; fewer burdensome regulations; and simpler and fairer taxes creates the perfect environment for growth and innovation. So far this year, we have secured investments in things like boosting programs for early childhood education and Head Start, and medical research at the NIH. We have done away with jobkilling regulations, saving hardworking Americans billions in compliance costs and millions of hours in paperwork. Now we have the opportunity to reform our Tax Code to help millions of Americans keep more of their hard earned money, help small businesses create millions of new jobs, and help millions rise out of poverty. Mr. Speaker, now is the time to act. Let’s get tax reform done and get tax relief to those who need it the most. f 
BRING UP THE DREAM ACT (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, there are so many different issues. We are talking about tax reform, but I want to go back to an issue we have talked about for several months now, and that is the DREAMers. I rise today to call on the House leadership to bring up the Dream Act. The DREAMers who came to this country as children were brought by their parents for a chance to pursue the American Dream. These young Americans go to our colleges and universities. They are our teachers and doctors and serve in the military, and we cannot afford to upend the lives and dreams of these 800,000 DACA recipients—people like Andres, a DREAMer who lives in my district. He came to this country as a child, and America is the only home he knows. He attends school here, earned his associate’s degree, and became a building engineer. He built his personal relationships in our country and contributes every day to our society. His work, his friends and family are all in the United States. It would be a cruel mistake to force him to give all that up and send him back to a country he doesn’t know. Nearly 9 out of 10 Americans support the DACA program. It is our responsibility to the American people and to the hundreds of thousands of young DREAMers in this country to pass the Dream Act now. Mr. Speaker, we should do so as soon as we can. 
THE PRESIDENT’S CORRECT AND NECESSARY DECERTIFICATION OF THE JCPOA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, President Trump decertified the Iran nuclear deal. Tonight, during this hour, several Members of Congress will be speaking here on the House floor about the President’s correct and necessary decertification, and discussing the urgent need to address Iran’s problematic nuclear and nonnuclear activities. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal, is deeply flawed and very onesided for what is in it, and it is fatally flawed and deeply onesided for what is not in it. The socalled deal props up the wrong regime in Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, with a jackpot of $150 billion of sanctions relief. The United States made a slew of permanent concessions in exchange for temporary concessions on the part of the Iranians—a point that comes into greater focus as the sunset provisions are analyzed. This deal is not a pathway for how to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, it is a blueprint for exactly how Iran can acquire a nuclear weapon. We can and must do better. President Obama said this agreement was not built on trust, it was built on verification. I am still waiting for an answer on how you can support a deal based on verification without knowing what the verification regime is. The verification agreement between the IAEA and Iran still hasn’t been submitted to Congress, and Secretary Kerry has admitted that he never read it. We have learned, though, that Iran collects some of their own soil samples and inspects some of their own nuclear sites. No U.S. inspectors are permitted to participate in any of these inspections at all. The verification regime must become adequate and transparent, and Americans should know what the verification agreement is. Since the JCPOA was entered into, Iranian aggression in the Middle East, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere has only increased. These bad activities have only gotten worse since all of the leverage that brought the Iranians to the table was negotiated away in the JCPOA. Iran has continued to illegally test fire intercontinental ballistic missiles and finance terror. They even seized one of our naval vessels, subsequently holding hostage and publicly embarrassing 10 American sailors. Iran has committed to wiping Israel off the map, and they chant, ‘‘Death to America,’’ in their streets on their holidays, all while unjustly imprisoning American citizens. They call Israel ‘‘the little Satan’’ and America ‘‘the great Satan.’’ These are, unfortunately, just a few of Iran’s bad activities. It is so important to note that Iran has not only violated the spirit of the nuclear deal with its nonnuclear bad activities, it has also violated the letter of the deal. For example, Iran spins 
more IR6 centrifuges than they are allowed to under the JCPOA. They have assembled more IR8 rotor assemblies than they are allowed to. They have attempted to acquire carbon fiber that they agreed that they wouldn’t. They stockpiled more heavy water than they were supposed to under the JCPOA. Iran is also not allowing any inspections at all at any of their military sites. Iran is not only violating the spirit of the deal, but they are also violating the letter of the deal. President Trump was absolutely correct to decertify the JCPOA. If Iran is serious about helping turn the JCPOA into a truly reasonable agreement, then they should make those intentions clear, both in private conversations with the United States and the other countries of the P5+1, but also in their public rhetoric. Many of Iran’s other bad activities will need to cease. If Iran does not want to save the JCPOA, then the sanctions should immediately ramp up. Throughout this next hour, we will discuss the President’s correct decision to decertify, as well as the urgent need to eliminate Iran’s problematic nuclear and nonnuclear activities. b1900 Joining me tonight are Members of Congress from all across our great country who are deeply passionate about America’s best interests and supportive of the President’s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal. At this time, it is my great pleasure to welcome the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. JOE WILSON , a leader on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and throughout all of Congress, who oftentimes has been to the Middle East, who is a grandson of a veteran, a son of a veteran, and a proud father of four veterans. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON ). Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman ZELDIN  for his leadership. We sincerely appreciate his leadership for American families, particularly based on his service in Iraq. Mr. Speaker, on October 23, 1983, an otherwise peaceful Sunday morning in Beirut, Lebanon, there was, tragically, a disruption of a suicide truck bomb that crashed into the Marine Corps barracks, killing 241 courageous U.S. Marines. This was the deadliest attack, 21,000 pounds of TNT, since the U.S. Marines were in the Battle of Iwo Jima. Investigators determined that Hezbollah, an Iranbacked terrorist organization that has targeted America and our allies for decades, was responsible for the attack. The 34th anniversary of the Beirut attack serves as a solemn reminder that we have a responsibility to defeat Hezbollah and radical Islamic terrorists across the globe, many of whom are financed by Iran, all the way from Niger to the Philippines. It is important that we defeat the terrorists overseas to protect American families at home. President Donald Trump’s decision to decertify the Iranian deal was correct. President Trump is protecting American families. The deal was reckless and dangerous from the start; it never served the interests of American families; and it threatened the safety and security of America and our allies in the region, from Israel to southeastern Europe, Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania. I am grateful to join Members of the House, especially my colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in promoting the fight against global terrorism. This includes tougher sanctions like those being considered by the House that target Hezbollah and its financiers in Tehran, and it includes working together with President Trump’s administration that is committed to peace through strength. I am grateful to thank Congressman LEEZELDIN from New York, an appreciated Iraq veteran, for his leadership and for being firm with the Iranian regime, which subjugates its extraordinary people. As the father of four sons who have served our country overseas, I want to say once again: God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman WILSON for his continued leadership. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is my privilege to bring up a freshman from Tennessee’s Eighth Congressional district, DAVID KUSTOFF . Last Congress, I had the privilege of being both the lowestranking Jewish Republican in Congress and the highestranking Jewish Republican in Congress. But now that we have DAVID KUSTOFF from Tennessee here, we voted for each other to chair the Jewish Republican Caucus of two, and 1 day we may have a minion. These are our dreams that someday may come true. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF ). Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman ZELDIN  for his leadership on this very important issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the President’s decision to decertify the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or what is known as the Iran deal. This deeplyflawed Iran deal has failed to prevent the Iranian regime from ballistic missile testing and overall hostility that threatens American national security interests. Quite frankly, this was a bad idea from day one. Most recently, on September 23, 2017, Iran testfired a new longrange missile that could carry multiple warheads, and is the country’s third test of a missile with a range of approximately 1,240 miles. An Iranian news agency further stated how this missile ‘‘adds to Israel’s misery and will be their nightmare.’’ As we have seen, Iran continues to be the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, and the IRGC has known connections to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Over these past few years, we have seen these terrorist proxy groups carry out attacks on American troops and innocent Israeli civilians. In addition, Iran has gained access to over $100 billion in previously frozen assets, enabling the money to be funneled to various terrorist organizations. From the frequent ballistic missile tests to supporting terrorism and funding proxies, such as Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, Iran has escalated its aggressive behavior since the deal was signed just 2 years ago. Ultimately, this deal temporarily pushes back Iran’s ability to build up its nuclear infrastructure and does not cease the Iranian regime’s ambition to become nuclear after 15 years. The bad deal, therefore, ushers Iran into a nuclear club, where it can continue to test uranium pathways and pursue illicit nuclear materials, unbeknownst to the IAEA. President Obama entered that poorly crafted agreement using unilateral executive authority, quite frankly, circumventing the consent of Congress and disregarding the will of the American people. As we have seen, this was clearly a bad deal from day one. It does not stop Iran’s path to obtaining a nuclear weapon, but, rather, paves it. As we work in Congress to implement further sanctions against the Iranian regime, we must work toward a strategy that protects our allies in the Middle East and effectively prevents Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. We must remain vigilant against those who wish to inflict harm on America, and stand united with our allies around the world. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Congressman ZELDIN for his leadership. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman KUSTOFF for his important, insightful words. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure at this time to introduce the gentleman from Florida’s Third Congressional District. He is an important voice on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, very learned on these issues related to Iran and the Middle Eastern region especially, and a great Member here in Congress. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO). Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leadership of Mr. ZELDIN and I appreciate him using that word ‘‘learned.’’ It feels good. You know, this is an interesting thing, because I was there during the time that John Kerry and the President were negotiating this deal. Keep in mind, this is a deal that John Kerry and the President agreed to, but nobody signed. We didn’t sign it, our Senate never voted on it, and Iran didn’t sign it. So this is a deal in paper only that nobody has signed. If you 
were to do any business transaction in the real world, this piece of paper would be worthless. I want to mention words of one of our previous Presidents. It has been about 60 years after President Dwight Eisenhower announced that Atoms for Peace Program, and one lesson is clear: ‘‘Civilian nuclear programs flourish only through cooperation and openness. Secrecy and isolation typically are signs of a nuclear weapons program.’’ So here we are. I have in front of me the Institute for Science and International Security, August 31, 2017, and in the introduction, it says: ‘‘One of the most serious compliance issues concerns the IAEA’s access to military sites and credible verification of Section T, which prohibits key nuclear weapons development activities and controls dualuse equipment potentially usable in such activities. In this report, the issue of verifying Section T is discussed. The absence of credible implementation and verification of Section T undermines the effectiveness of the JCPOA.’’ My colleague, Mr. ZELDIN , brought up that we know they are using IR–6 and IR–8 centrifuges. We know they have the carbon fibers that they are not supposed to have. We also know that they have overproduced heavy water more than two times. The first time, we bought it at the American taxpayers’ expense. The other two times, it has gone to Russia. The only reason you would have an excess of heavy water is if you are producing nuclear fissile material. In addition to that, the heavy water—the inspections that we are supposed to do anytime, anywhere,—John Kerry said this over and over—anytime, anywhere, that we can go, and if they are noncompliant, the sanctions will snap back. They must have used an overstretched rubber band because nothing has ever snapped back. With the IAEA supposedly being able to inspect anywhere, there are so many places that are off limits. It is only those areas that Iran says that we can go in and inspect. Parchin military site is a place that we know they detonated a nuclear trigger. We have not been able to go in there and check the soil, Yet we have to accept their word that they are checking the soil. I brought this up in the committee, and I am going to repeat it here. It would be like having a drug addict testing his own urine sample and taking it to the lab. It is just not the way to do business in the 21st century on something that is so important. During that time, when we negotiated or when the deal was being negotiated, there was an intelligence report—I don’t know if you were in the Congress then, but there was an intelligence report that had always had Iran as a state sponsor of terror. The year this deal was done, state sponsor of terror was taken off. And when we questioned about it, they said it was an oversight. This deal just stinks from the beginning. John Kerry said: No deal is better than a bad deal. This is a bad deal. The President should decertify it. It does not take us out of the deal, but it allows us to put the pressure back on Iran so that they are fully compliant with the letter of the law. If we don’t hold up people to the letter of the law as we move forward in future negotiations, i.e., North Korea, why should they follow the letter of the law? So this is high time that we do this. I appreciate it, and I thank the gentleman for doing this. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, Congressman YOHObrings up some very important points. The Iran nuclear deal was an unsigned political commitment. Those were the words that were given to us by the administration, and to think that we wouldn’t have even asked for a signature on something so important was foolish. The next speaker tonight in this important Special Order in support of President Trump’s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal and the need to address Iran’s other problematic nuclear and nonnuclear activities is a freshman from my home State of New York, someone I served with in the New York State Legislature, and we are really excited to have her here serving with us in the Halls of Congress. She has hit the ground running and is very passionate about our military, our veterans, and also especially why we are here tonight, the path forward with regards to Iran. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York’s 22nd Congressional District (Ms. TENNEY ). Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Congressman ZELDIN . Obviously, we, from New York, all are so proud for his service as an Iraq veteran, and also for his leadership in serving both in the State Senate and also representing our great State in the House of Representatives on this very important issue. Mr. Speaker, on October 13, President Trump made the informed decision to decertify the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the JCPOA—or I am going to refer to it as the Iran nuclear deal—and to develop, for the first time, a holistic strategy to address the Iranian menace. I applaud this sound choice, which prioritizes the safety and security of our citizens and the American homeland. Predictably, the flawed deal with Iran has done nothing to stem that rogue nation’s aggression and misbehavior domestically, in the Middle East, and throughout the globe. Quite to the contrary, by frontloading the benefits to Iran, the Iran nuclear deal is funding these destabilizing and dangerous activities. Human rights abuses continue against the Iranian people as citizens who dare to speak out against the oppressive regime face imprisonment or abuse. Supporters of the Iran nuclear deal told the American people that this deal would lead to a more open Iran, with a renewed acceptance of diverse voices and opinions from within. b1915 Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, there have been already over 450 executions in Iran this year alone. Obviously, the socalled moderates within the regime with whom we negotiated the Iran nuclear deal either aren’t as moderate as we thought or are simply irrelevant in this regime. The American people were told further that the Iran nuclear deal would bring Iran into the fold and make the nation a more productive, contributing member of the international community. Sadly, but not surprisingly, Iran’s transgressions in the region continue to be appalling. The Iranian regime is expanding its malicious network of control through increased financial and military support for terrorist organizations, including Hezbollah and Hamas. In Syria, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps has provided fighters and expertise to the brutal Assad regime that gases and brutalizes its own citizens. Iran has shown no signs that it is interested in pursuing peace or even curbing its malevolent behaviors. Chants of ‘‘death to America and ‘‘death to Israel’’ continue as Iran rapidly develops its missile program and engages in proxy conflicts with the U.S. and our allies. I thank the President and my colleagues, as I indicated, especially Congressman LEEZELDIN from New York, for continuing to shine the light on this important national security issue. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman TENNEY for being here, for her remarks this evening, and for her leadership on this important deal. It is my pleasure at this time to yield to Congressman ANDY BARR, who is a leader on the House Financial Services Committee. He has been very active in the efforts as it relates to sanctions. It is also important to note that it was sanctions that brought the Iranians to the table, and applied an incredible amount of economic pressure. The Iranian regime that is in charge desperately needed relief in order to get through their next election, and now the Iranians have had an opportunity to experience life with that sanctions regime and life without it. Chairman BARR is a very important voice here in the Halls of Congress for ensuring the right leverage is on the table to deal with Iran’s nuclear and nonnuclear activities. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR). Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman ZELDIN for his leadership on this issue; his voice in criticism of this flawed nuclear deal with Iran; and, of course, for his valiant service to the United States in the military. I rise tonight in strong support of the President’s decision to decertify this 
deeply flawed JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. I agree with the President’s finding that Iran is not transparently, not verifiably, and not fully implementing the agreement. I agree with the President’s finding that continued sanctions relief is not in the vital security interest of the United States. That is because the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran was a dangerous and historic mistake. The deal provided the mullahs in Tehran with roughly $100 billion in upfront sanctions relief in exchange for Iran’s promise, future promise, to temporarily pause its enrichment program. Unfortunately, the agreement contained fatally deficient verification protocols and the International Atomic Energy Agency now concedes that it has no capacity to verify that Tehran is engaged in activities which could contribute to the development of a nuclear explosive device. That is because under the terms of the agreement, the very terms of the JCPOA, international inspectors are barred from accessing Iran’s military sites where elicit nuclear activities are most likely taking place. President Obama’s promise that there would be ‘‘anytime, anywhere inspections,’’ but that promise was replaced with ‘‘managed access’’ to suspect nuclear sites in which international inspectors must appeal to Iran, Russia, and China in a bureaucratic process that would take days during which Iran could remove anything covert and in violation of the agreement. As Congressman ZELDIN correctly pointed out, we don’t even know what the verification protocols actually are because we haven’t been able to access the secret agreement between international inspectors, nonU.S. inspectors, and the leadership in Tehran. But the most serious concern is not that Iran would cheat. It is that even if Iran is fully complying with this agreement, bad outcomes are guaranteed. First, Iran will be allowed an arsenal of nuclear weapons in as little as 10 years. Under the very terms of this agreement, Iran was not denied a nuclear weapon. The path was paved for Iran to have an arsenal of nuclear weapons with international sanction. Iran was not required to dismantle key bombmaking technology. It was permitted to retain vast enrichment capacity, and it was allowed to continue research and development on advanced centrifuges, and it will be allowed to continue to acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles. Intercontinental ballistic missiles. Why do you need intercontinental ballistic missiles if you have peaceful designs for your nuclear program? Those of you who are listening at home across America, remember this: an intercontinental ballistic missile is not a missile designed for Tel Aviv. An intercontinental ballistic missile is designed for New York City; for Washington, D.C.; for Atlanta, Georgia; for Los Angeles, California; and for Seattle, Washington; and for Chicago. Our homeland security has been jeopardized because of this fatally flawed agreement. Iran will receive a sanctions relief jackpot. They have already received upwards of $100 billion so far. In my capacity as the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees sanctions, oversees the Treasury Department’s implementation of sanctions, I can say that we have heard it. We have heard the reporting that, as a result of this agreement, Iran has not become pacified. Iran has actually accelerated its support for terrorist proxies in Lebanon, Gaza, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Nigeria. Because Iran’s neighbors know that this deal reverses a decadeslong bipartisan policy blocking Iran’s nuclear program, this agreement continues to risk a nuclear arms race in the broader Middle East. They are apologists. There are defenders of the Iran nuclear deal, and they say it is working. They say there is evidence of dismantling of the nuclear program, but we have the benefit of almost 2 years of implementation of the deal. We have the benefit of hindsight to see if this deal is actually working. Here are the facts. The facts are that since the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was implemented in January of 2016, Iran has continued to sponsor Hezbollah and other radical terrorist militias in the region. Its support for the Assad regime alone, including the use of planes to airlift military supplies, has helped claim an estimated 400 lives. Last April, even President Obama suggested that the Iranians were violating the spirit of the deal by engaging in these activities. Rather than being deterred, in October, Iran sentenced three Americans to long prison terms on bogus charges. In January of this year, the country tested a ballistic missile in violation of U.N. Security Council resolution 2231. In April, just as a commercial airline manufacturer was announcing new sales to Iran as a result of the sanctions relief under the JCPOA, we learned that dozens of Syrian civilians, including at least 11 children, were gassed in an Iraniansupported chemical weapons attack. Additionally, Iran has stated that it will no longer permit inspections of its military bases. It continues to attempt to intimidate our allies, and is facilitating the imports and exports of arms. As of February 2017, Iran has fired as many as 14 ballistic missiles, and the leaders of Iran continue to chant ‘‘death to America,’’ and pledge to wipe Israel off the face of the planet. So where do we go from here? As the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees enforcement of sanctions, we have been working on additional measures that can be taken, including nonnuclear sanctions consistent with the JCPOA to hold Iran accountable for its malign activities. On April 4, we held a hearing on the effectiveness of nonnuclear sanctions against Iran, where we determined that Iran Air, a stateowned commercial airline, has used its aircraft to transport fighters and weapons throughout the Middle East on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp. As a result of these findings, I wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin urging him to ban the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran Air. Similarly, I supported two appropriations amendments that would prevent the sale of aircraft to Iran and prohibit U.S. firms from financing such a sale. Finally, I recently drafted a letter to the Treasury Department urging it to identify all entities it believes to have transacted business with the IRGC, a precursor to possible additional secondary sanctions. These actions are all important and relevant in the aftermath of the President’s correct decision to decertify the deal because it invites Congress to step in and offer constructive recommendations on how to address the flaws, the fatal flaws, in the JCPOA. These are some of those recommendations to the administration, and we hope the Treasury Department will respond accordingly. Going forward, we must do the following to stem Iran’s nuclear ambitions: We must designate the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization. We must make permanent the sunset clauses on Iran’s nuclear program and testing. This cannot be temporary prohibition of the Iran nuclear program. This must be a permanent ban on Iran ever having nuclear weapons capability and the capability of delivering those weapons. Finally, we need to do a better job strengthening the agreement, revising the agreement, scrapping the old agreement, and actually getting to anytime, anywhere inspections. That means we have got to work with the P5+1 and our European allies to revise the JCPOA so that we mandate anytime, anywhere inspections of nuclear facilities, and so that we are guaranteed that the IAEA, that international and U.S. inspectors have access to all suspected sites within the territorial boundaries of Iran. In conclusion, I want to thank Congressman ZELDIN for the Special Order. I want to thank President Trump and his administration for their leadership on stopping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, and for the important national security imperative of revisiting this flawed Iran nuclear deal so that we can actually achieve peace in the world. Mr. Speaker, we thank Congressman ZELDIN for his leadership in pursuing this very important objective. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks. Certainly in the days, the weeks, the months that are ahead, many throughout our country will be leaning on his leadership as we discuss the path forward as far as sanctions and the right way to reestablish the leverage that 
brought the Iranians to the table in the first place. Mr. Speaker, Congressman ROKITA is a strong voice in ensuring that America has a strong but effective foreign policy, one that makes sure that our military is always set up for success, our veterans are taken care of when they come home. As I mentioned earlier, as I was introducing Congresswoman TENNEY , part of that effort, certainly is ensuring the right path forward as it relates to Iran. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. ROKITA ), from Indiana’s Fourth Congressional District. Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding and for hosting this Special Order. In my humble opinion, the people of New York are lucky to have a gentleman like him representing them; and I know it is the highest honor of his life as well. I also want to associate with my good friend, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR), for the remarks he made. I think he has made an excellent record of not only the premise of the deal, but the effect of the deal so far. Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from New York that Mr. BARR is going to be critical in leading the effort forward in sanctions, whether they are part of the JCPOA or not. I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for his words tonight as well. Earlier this month, President Trump set a new direction for the United States, a direction of leadership. He made clear that we would no longer allow the Iranian Government to continue to pursue nuclear weapons, continue funding terrorism, or threaten the very existence of our great friend, Israel, the strongest ally we have in the region. President Trump made clear that, unlike the previous administration, we will not reward Iran for chanting ‘‘death to America,’’ and we will not allow this terrorist regime to dictate our Nation’s foreign policy. Getting the Iran deal done was the only thing the previous administration cared about. Think about that, just getting the deal done. I think we all remember that sentiment around here: getting the deal done no matter how terrible was the only thing the previous administration cared about. We had to get the deal done. We had to get the deal done, as bad as it was. b1930 It is unlike our current President who has demanded action to hold Iran accountable, guarantee our national security, and protect Israel and our allies across the world night and day. I appreciate the President’s leadership on this and other matters. The United States never should have signed onto the deal in the first place, Mr. Speaker, because it was a bad deal. It gave Iran immediate access to $150 billion, it allowed the Iranians to continue their ballistic missile research, and it contains a sunset provision that will allow the Iranians to return immediately to enriching uranium without consequence. Now, even thenSecretary of State John Kerry said: ‘‘Some of the $150 billion will end up in the hands of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists.’’ That was our Secretary of State’s direct quote admitting that some of this $150 billion was going to get to terrorists. There is no situation in which the United States should allow money to get to terrorists. Hoosiers that I represent see this quite clearly. Surely, the Americans that the rest of us represent see the same thing. But then President Obama and Secretary Kerry allowed this to happen and were cheered on, in fact, by many in this very Chamber and many in the Senate. This year alone, Iran has tested their ballistic missiles at least three times, and they tested a rocket space launch vehicle. Now, in their most recent test in September, they used a ballistic missile with the potential range to hit Israel, the only stable democracy in the region. As Mr. BARRpointed out, Mr. Speaker, intercontinental ballistic missiles aren’t even meant for Israel. They are meant to come here. They are meant to go to our other allies—a bad deal indeed. The threats Iran poses are truly extreme: terrorists, a nuclear arms race, and continued threats to America and its neighbors. Unfortunately, we cannot go back in time and stop then President Obama from signing this disastrous Iran nuclear deal—and, by the way, it is signing in the theoretical sense because Mr. YOHO is also right, Mr. Speaker, when he said that this was a set of papers that truly had no signatories. It was an executive action by thenPresident Obama for sure. But, all in all, no matter what the semantics, it was a bad deal. But we can—we can—move forward by creating tough sanctions like, Mr. Speaker, Mr. BARR was pointing out and making sure Iran is held accountable. That starts tonight with the work that LEEZELDIN and other Members of Congress are doing. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York again for yielding to me, and I thank him for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, let’s get it right this time. Let’s make sure Iran doesn’t become the threat that the previous administration has allowed it to become. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman ROKITA for being here and for his important words as well and for all of the Members who have spoken. I recognize House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman EDROYCE , Congressman PETE ROSKAM , and former Congressman, now CIA Director, Mike Pompeo. These are some of the voices during the course of these last few years on this very important issue on the need to hold Iran accountable and to fight for the best possible agreement for the United States. Over the course of tonight, we discussed what was in the JCPOA, and we discussed the JCPOA as far as what wasn’t in it and some of the challenges that we have faced since the JCPOA has first been entered into. We all want to deal with Iran’s bad activities. We have to ask ourselves: How are we going to do that? What is the leverage that brought the Iranians to the table to negotiate the Iran nuclear deal? How do we get that leverage back? Now, some people out there are saying that Iran is abiding by their word and that the United States would somehow be going back on our word by the President decertifying the Iran nuclear deal. We can have a discussion about what violates the spirit of the Iran nuclear deal. We talked about Iran’s other bad activities: their financing of terror, their overthrowing of foreign governments, illegally testfiring intercontinental ballistic missiles, holding Americans hostage, and publicly embarrassing American Navy sailors. We had to pay a ransom to get hostages back in January of 2016. They call Israel the Little Satan, America the Great Satan. They pledge to wipe Israel off the map. They chant ‘‘death to America.’’ They are supporting Assad in Syria and Hezbollah. What do we do to deal with Iran’s nonnuclear bad activities? Right now we don’t have the leverage to deal with that. We really needed to bring that to the table when we were sitting down with Iran last time because, when you negotiate away the leverage that brings them to the table, what is left to deal with all of those activities that we would say violate the spirit of the JCPOA? But people say that if the President decertifies the Iran nuclear deal, then that would mean that we are going back on our word and that Iran has been abiding by the deal. We cannot forget about all of the ways that Iran is violating the letter of the JCPOA. Why is there no accountability in debate, as we know, that Iran spins more IR–6 centrifuges than they are permitted to under the JCPOA? Why aren’t we talking about that? Why aren’t we saying that Iran is not following their word when they assemble more IR–8 rotor assemblies than they are allowed to under the JCPOA? Why aren’t we saying that Iran is not following through with their word as they attempt to purchase carbon fiber that they are not allowed to try to purchase under the JCPOA? Why are we giving Iran a free pass? Does the President’s opposition despise him so much that they are willing to literally take Iran’s side when Iran says that we will never be able to inspect any of their military sites? Before, during, and after this deal, they said that we will never be able to 
inspect all their military sites. The Obama administration said we will inspect their military sites. So you have a material disagreement on this JCPOA, this Iran nuclear deal. We said that sanctions were going to be phased in over time based on compliance. The Iranian regime said sanctions relief was going to be immediate, no suspension. But why are we not holding Iran to their word on the ways that they are violating the letter of the JCPOA? Why is it that before implementation day when inspectors, the last time they got to Parchin and they found particles in the soil that are consistent with nuclear capability, and then after we discover those particles the Iranians say, ‘‘That is it. No more access to Parchin,’’ why are we not saying that Iran is not following their commitments under the JCPOA? This is the letter of the JCPOA. Now, it would be great if we can have a discussion here about what the verification regime is. I would love to read the deal between the IAEA and Iran. When I was at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing with thenSecretary of State John Kerry and I wanted to engage with him, have a conversation about what the verification agreement was, I was shocked that even he said that he hadn’t read the verification regime between the IAEA and Iran. It really makes you scratch your head. I asked the question here on the House floor last Congress while we were debating the JCPOA. President Obama says that we are entering into the JCPOA not based on trust, but based on verification. So the question that I posed then, and I still haven’t gotten an answer today, is: How do you support a deal based on verification without knowing what the verification is? We are propping up the wrong regime. In 2009, during the Green Revolution, an undemocratic election, millions of Iranians went to the streets. These are people who go to the streets that right now there are people—millions of Iranians today—who would love a free, stable, democratic Iran. After an undemocratic election, they went to the streets. We said that it was none of our business. Fastforward years later, we are paying ransom of $400 million that was disputed for good reason for decades, claims going both ways. There is a reason why that money wasn’t paid out. There was a dispute, multiple claims, U.S. to Iran and Iran to the United States, and $1.3 billion of interest. They said that it wasn’t a ransom. $1.7 billion in cold, hard cash in pallets that had to get delivered at the exact same moment of the American hostages—by the way, not all of them—at the exact same moment of the American hostages being released, and we are saying that that is not ransom. That was a coincidence that we are signing documents in the middle of January on the same exact day within 24 hours of each other. Now, after we provided a jackpot of sanctions relief in exchange for this very onesided deal, there was an election. After that election in Iran, members of the American media and around the world said that this was evidence of progress in Iran that the most moderate candidates were elected. But do you know what that completely ignores? The 12,000 most moderate candidates not being allowed access to the ballot. We are propping up the wrong regime. After our American sailors were detained, held hostage, and embarrassed in videos and photography all around the world, we said, ‘‘Thank you.’’ That was our response, ‘‘Thank you.’’ After all the concessions that were made as part of the JCPOA, our Secretary of State became president for the Tehran Chamber of Commerce, and here we are. Fastforward to today, and everyone who wants to see this President fail will stand with Iran before they would stand with the United States. They will ignore Iran’s violating the spirit of the JCPOA. They will turn a blind eye with their head in the sand over Iran’s violating the letter of the JCPOA. Mr. Speaker, we gathered here this evening to talk about the President’s correct decision to decertify the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear agreement, and to talk about the need to eliminate Iran’s very problematic nuclear and nonnuclear activities. We heard from a half dozen other Members of Congress: Congressman JOEWILSON of South Carolina’s 2nd Congressional District, DAVID KUSTOFF of Tennessee’s 8th Congressional District, Congressman TED YOHO of Florida’s 3rd Congressional District, Congresswoman CLAUDIA  TENNEY of New York’s 22nd Congressional District, Congressman ANDY BARR of Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District, and Congressman TODD ROKITA of Indiana’s 4th Congressional District. I thank them, and I thank all of my colleagues for their leadership on this issue. There is important work ahead. There really should be more Members on both sides of the aisle working together on behalf of the American people putting country first on this issue. People since the election pledged to entirely oppose and obstruct this President on everything and anything. While the President’s hand was on the Bible, the streets of the parade route were lined up with people holding up signs that said ‘‘impeach him now’’— while his hand was on the Bible. b1945 Last November, Americans all around this country elected a President whose hand was on the Bible, yet people are calling for his impeachment just for the fact he got elected. Every day we are here, we have Members who come to the floor doing whatever they can in any way that day, that minute, to try to tear the President down. I had disagreements with President Obama, but he was my President. We disagreed on the Iran nuclear deal. That is okay. We can disagree. We should disagree with President Trump, President Obama, President Bush before that, when we have strong philosophical differences on policy. That is what we are elected to do. We are not elected to all just come here and agree with each other. But for those who are so set politically on trying to bring this President down, so much so that they will take Iran’s side in this over the United States’ side, I encourage you to rethink that and put country over party, because we need to work together as colleagues representing the greatest country in the world on a better path forward. It is a privilege for all of us to be able to serve here in the United States Capitol in the United States Congress, because there is so much history on this floor. There is going to be much debate ahead on what challenges lie ahead for us with regard to Iran. With servicemembers in harm’s way, we understand and we reflect that that is what is most important. We should never send our troops into harm’s way unless they are sent to win. We send our troops to win, or we do not send them at all. When they come home, they are treated with the love, dignity, and respect that they deserve on behalf of a very grateful nation; and with a strong, consistent foreign policy and taking care of our vets and setting up our military for success. It is having the right foreign policy with challenges that are in front of us in the Middle East and elsewhere. That is why we are here for this Special Order hour in support of the President’s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal. Mr. President, you made the right decision. We stand with you. We stand with the United States. We want to hold Iran accountable. We want the best path forward for our great country. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS: AMERICAN IDEALS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak. I want to start by saying that my colleague from North Carolina is here, and I know there is going to be a group of Members from North Carolina who are coming to address their constituents. So if you are a North Carolinian looking in on this, you have come to the right place, but you are going to have to hear me first. I am speaking on behalf of the Progressive Caucus. 
I don’t know if Representative ZELDIN is still in the room. I couldn’t quite resist the opportunity to respond to his provacative remarks where he said that it appears there are people in Congress who are so determined to take the President down. I couldn’t really figure out who he was talking about. Then I realized he is probably referring to Republican Senator JOHN MCCAIN from Arizona, or maybe Republican Senator JEFFFLAKE  from Arizona, or maybe Republican Senator BOBCORKER from Tennessee, all of whom have blown the whistle this week on the egregious violations of the basic norms of the Presidency by this President, who continues to demonize and vilify U.S. citizens and engage in the pettiest and most juvenile of exchanges with people and generally demonstrate what most Americans now regard as his unfitness for the Presidency. So it seems like there was an attempt to make it a partisan issue. I think if he has got a partisan problem with what someone is saying about the President, he needs to talk to members of his own party who are the ones who are screaming the loudest about the outrageous excesses and abuses coming from the White House today. That is not what I came here to talk about, Mr. Speaker. I just thought it was a little bit beyond my humanity to endure that lecture, especially about impeachment, when the Representative comes from a party that impeached President Clinton over one lie—one lie about sex—and we get a profusion of dozens of lies every single day from the White House, from this President, about matters of public policy, crucial matters of national security, and so on. That is not even to get into the question of admitted obstruction of justice, bragging about the fact that he had fired the FBI Director because he was involved in the Russia investigation; not even talking about the rampant abuse of power that we see as recent as this week with apparently corrupt dealings in terms of the Puerto Rican rescue, when 80 percent of the island is still without power, and it looks like there are all sorts of sweetheart contracts that are afoot there. It is not even to go to the question of the domestic Emoluments Clause and the foreign Emoluments Clause, which are defied every single day with the money that is pouring forth from foreign governments directly to the Trump Hotel and Trump Tower and the Trump golf courses all over the world. I am not going to get into any of that stuff because I want to talk about something hopeful and uplifting tonight. I want to talk about America’s responsibilities in the world, something that we used to take really seriously. I want to talk about what America is and who we are and what debt of responsibility we owe to the rest of the world and how well we are doing today, given what is taking place around the world. Now, in America, unlike most countries in the world—or at least a lot of countries in the world—we are not defined by virtue of being one race or one ethnicity or one religion or one political party or one system of belief. We are unified just by virtue of the fact that we have one Constitution and one Bill of Rights. We all agree to adhere to it and live under it and struggle for a more perfect union under that umbrella. Mr. Speaker, every day we get to come to work, and we see the busts and the statues and the portraits of great Americans. We see Frederick Douglass, we see Thomas Jefferson, we see John Adams, we see George Washington. Mr. Speaker, America was the first Nation on Earth conceived in revolutionary insurgency against a monarchy, an arbitrary political leadership, and the fusion of church and State. Our forebearers rebelled against centuries of religious warfare between the Catholics and the Protestants every bit as vicious and bloody as what we see in the Muslim world today between the Sunni and the Shia. They rebelled against the idea that, as Tom Payne put it, the king is law. He said that in the democracies, law would be king. That was the idea behind America. We would govern ourselves. As Jefferson put in the Declaration of Independence, all men are created equal, all of us are endowed with inalienable rights—life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness—and government is legitimately erected only on the basis of the consent of the governed. Now I hasten to say that all of those beautiful ideals were not realized at the start of our Nation. Let’s not makebelieve. Let’s not pretend. We didn’t start, in the words of that great Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, as a nation of the people, by the people, and for the people. We started as a slave Republic of White male property owners over the age of 21, where the vast majority of people could not vote and could not participate: indentured servants, slaves, women, and so on. But still, the idea was there, and those beautiful, tantalizing ideals were inserted by Thomas Jefferson, whose memory was defended recently by a group of hardy and defiant University of Virginia students who surrounded the statue of Thomas Jefferson to defend it against the rampaging mob of racist skinheads and Klansmen who had come to desecrate the memory of Jefferson and everything that he believed in with his ideals and the words that he put in the Declaration of Independence. Those were the founding ideals of the country, and through successive waves of political and social struggle and constitutional change, we have opened America up. Through the Civil War and the Reconstruction amendments, we opened America up: The 14th Amendment gave us equal protection and due process. The 13th Amendment abolished slavery. The 15th Amendment said no discrimination on the basis of race in voting. The 17th Amendment shifted the mode of election from the State legislatures to the people. The 19th Amendment gave us woman suffrage. The 23rd Amendment said people here in the District of Columbia could participate in Presidential elections. The 24th Amendment abolished poll taxes. The 26th Amendment lowered the age of voting to 18 all across the whole country. The whole trajectory of our constitutional development has been towards greater equality and freedom for the American people. That is who we are. We are a nation that united with other nations around the world to defeat fascism, Nazism, Stalinism, communism, and totalitarianism in the last century. We did that. We stood with Eleanor Roosevelt and the United Nations in proclaiming the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which enshrined the rights of freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press, taking all those rights and freedoms that we fought for in America that are in our Constitution and trying to make them a global ideal so that all of the people of the world could enjoy the fruits and the experience of liberal democracy. When we stood at our best as a country, we have been on the side of freedom movements. We have been on the side of human rights. We have been on the side of victims of government authoritarianism and persecution. That is who we are as a country. It is all being forgotten and frittered away with the chaos that has descended not just upon the White House—that is too easy, I would say to my dear friend Mr. ZELDIN —on this institution, on lots of institutions in Washington, D.C. We are forgetting who we are. Tom Payne said America was a nation conceived as a haven of refuge for people fleeing from religious and political persecution from all over the world. That is why our great symbol has been the Statue of Liberty and not a 14th century wall and barbed wire. That is not the real symbol of America. Now, we are living in a time of rising authoritarianism and tyranny all over the world, from Russia to Saudi Arabia to Hungary to the Philippines to Venezuela. You name it. Authoritarian states everywhere are cracking down on free speech and free press, jailing enemies of the states and journalists, persecuting citizens for their religious beliefs and denying the essential human rights that are encoded in our national DNA, in our Constitution, and in the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. While the White House and this administration have abandoned U.S. leadership for human rights, the governments of the world are stepping up their authoritarianism. In Burma, in 
Myanmar, the government is waging brutal ethnic and religious violence against Rohingya Muslims, thousands of whom have been killed and more than 100,000 of whom have fled the country, in terror. Now, this savage campaign of ethnic cleansing in Burma by the Buddhistled government is being turned on all Muslims in that country. And what is our government doing? Nothing. In Turkey, which I will have a little bit more to say about in a moment, there is a vicious crackdown on free speech and free press, and the jailing of journalists and citizens without due process. In Russia, there continues to be outrageous human rights abuses against the personal political enemies of Vladimir Putin; against the LGBT community, which continues to be reviled and demonized by the government. In Chechnya, there are campaigns against journalists, and so on. In the Philippines, President Duterte has overseen the killing of thousands of people in a brutal war on drugs, with no due process at all, where the police can simply declare that you look like a drug user, you look like a drug dealer, and then they can have you killed. It is also in Venezuela, where Maduro has consolidated his power and is denying the rule of law at every turn; in Saudi Arabia; in Iran, which was mentioned before, with brutal campaigns against ethnic minorities—one of the leading administrators of capital punishment on Earth, fomenting terror abroad. b2000 Saudi Arabia, which Freedom House calls among the worst of the worst, where torture is present, where women are victims of almost pervasive sex discrimination—I think just a couple of months ago they won a limited right to drive in 2017—and on and on. And across the world, governments have passed laws against blasphemy, against heresy, against apostasy, against witchcraft, against sorcery, against all kinds of imaginary religious offenses which were wiped off of the books of our State laws centuries ago under the First Amendment, and yet there are people rotting in jail today because they belong to the wrong religious group and they are accused of blasphemy or apostasy in Iran or in Saudi Arabia or Bangladesh, or any other number of countries which use the tools of the state to oppress people because of their religious faith and their religious worship. What does President Trump do? Well, he personally praised Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines and invited him to come to America. His first state visit was to Saudi Arabia, where he publicly said that he was not going to take issue with anything that they were doing in terms of human rights, didn’t speak about any of the people rotting in jail in Saudi Arabia in a way that completely violates the human rights understandings and norms of the world. He has praised Erdogan in Turkey. And, of course, we know of his infamous and somewhat inscrutable relationship with Vladimir Putin, certainly has nothing to say about human rights violations taking place against Russians, tens of thousands of whom have summoned up the courage since the President took office to march in the streets against political corruption and for human rights. And our government does nothing to support the people in civil society in Russia who are trying to stand up for the idea of human rights in their country. Trump says, when he goes to Saudi Arabia: We are not here to lecture. We must seek partners, not perfection. And he has found those partners all over the world: Duterte in the Philippines, Putin in Russia, Orban in Hungary. On and on down the list, you find a despot, you find a tyrant, you find a kleptocrat and a bully, you have found a newfound buddy of the United States of America. Now, over the summer, media outlets reported that the State Department wanted to drop the promotion of democracy and human rights from the Department’s mission. The State Department has since eliminated the www.humanrights.gov website and moved its content to an alternative and more obscure web address. In May of 2017, Secretary of State Tillerson reversed decades of bipartisan consensus that human rights and democracy are not only essential components of U.S. foreign policy and national security, but universal values that the U.S. has adopted as a guiding principle of international legitimacy. And, of course, everyone knows of President Trump’s attempts to withdraw from treaties and agreements all over the world, including, of course, the Paris accord on climate change. Now, all of these actions, all of these statements are a betrayal of who we are as a country. We are not defined by race. We are not defined by ideology, unlike other countries around the world. We are not defined by religion. We are defined by an idea of liberal democracy committed to equality and freedom for all. If we give that up and we surrender that, we surrender what is most precious and defining about the United States of America, Mr. Speaker. And guess what. We have got human rights problems right here at home that we need to be dealing with. Do you know we have millions of Americans who can’t vote and are not represented in Congress? This anomaly was brought home to us in a very sharp way over the last several weeks with the crisis in Puerto Rico, where people still lack access to medicines that they need, where people—a majority of the population still lacks access to clean water, and power is out for fourfifths of the population. Those are our people. Those are our citizens. Those are Americans in Puerto Rico. But why were they treated differently? Why was there this notorious negligence and lethargy in responding to the plight of people in Puerto Rico? Well, they have no voting representatives in this Chamber or in the United States Senate, so we have got millions of people unrepresented. Right here in the Nation’s Capital, in the District of Columbia, we see the exact same democratic deficit, the exact same discrepancy and discord between our values and our ideals and what the reality of daily practice is. We are the only democratic nation left on Earth where the people of the capital city are disenfranchised in their national legislature. We are the only one. I have only been in this body for 10 months, Mr. Speaker, but I have noted how frequently and how joyfully this body will rise to trample the local legislation adopted by people in the District of Columbia who can’t fight back because they don’t have voting representation in Congress, and so we are very happy to kick them around if they have got a different point of view on death with dignity. Of course, death with dignity in the District of Columbia should be of no concern to us. What should be of concern is life with democracy in the District of Columbia if we are going to be faithful to our ideals. They get to decide, not us. But as long as they are excluded from representation in the national legislature, they are going to continue to be kicked around on questions of gay rights and whether or not poor women can be given full access to reproductive healthcare in the District of Columbia, another issue where the majority in this body decided to squash the political selfdetermination of more than 650,000 American citizens who live right here in the Nation’s Capital. We have got millions of people who are disenfranchised. That is a human rights problem. So we have got to deal with that. Maybe if America begins to stand up again for human rights around the world, we will begin to stand up again for human rights in our own country. So this is not a partisan issue. Of course, one of our great leaders in the advancement of human rights in America was President Abraham Lincoln, a great Republican, and his friend Frederick Douglass, a great Republican. I take pride in that. I take pride in the Republicans who fought for freedom and democracy in America. They are as much a part of my legacy as great Democrats like Franklin D. Roosevelt or President Barack Obama, the people who fought for civil rights and civil liberties in my party. So we should cherish everybody in our history who moved forward the engines of freedom and democratic change in the country. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say these are tough times in America. There is a lot of chaos that has descended upon our country, and, Mr. Speaker, we need all Americans to know, but especially young Americans to know, what we really stand for. 
We have a claim, a very strong claim to being the greatest nation on Earth, and it has got nothing to do with the military, and it has got nothing to do with our GDP. It has got to do with the way we were created, what our founding ideals were, and then the commitment of the people always to try to realize those ideals and engender a more perfect Union as we go along. Let’s keep America moving in that direction so we will continue to be a beacon of light to oppressed people all over the world. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FERGUSON ). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GENERAL BAPTIST STATE CONVENTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD ) for 30 minutes. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to recognize the General Baptist State Convention of North Carolina on the occasion of its 150th anniversary. The story of this great Baptist convention is a testament to its founders, Reverends William Warrick, Edward Eagles, C. Johnson, L.W. Boone, B.B. Spicer, H. Grimes, John Washington, Charles Bryant, Sutton Davis, and R.H. Harper, the visionary men who founded the convention on October 18, 1867. Since its founding, Mr. Speaker, great men and great women have maintained the convention’s strength and viability. The General Baptist State Convention is the oldest convention of AfricanAmerican Baptists in the United States of America. The General Baptist State Convention consists of more that 500,000 Baptist believers belonging to more than 1,400 churches, including my home church, the Jackson Chapel First Missionary Baptist Church of Wilson. The convention is subdivided into 58 associations, each presided over by a moderator. Over the last 150 years, the convention has been led by welltrained and spiritled theologians. The current president and executive board chair is my friend Dr. Nilous M. Avery, II, of Salisbury, North Carolina. He is the 32nd president of the convention. Mr. Speaker, the current officers of the convention are: First Vice President At Large, Dr. Leonzo Lynch; First Vice President, Dr. Ricky Banks; Second Vice President, Dr. J. Vincent Terry, Sr.; Third Vice President, Reverend O.D. Sykes; Fourth Vice President, Reverend Prince R. Rivers; Recording Secretary, Reverend Curtis O. Donald; Assistant Recording Secretary, Reverend Matthew Rouse, III; Statistician, Dr. Nathan Scovens; Parliamentarian, Reverend Reginald Wells. The Historian is Dr. Harry L. White, and the hardworking Executive Secretary Treasurer is Dr. Haywood T. Gray. Mr. Speaker, the Black church in North Carolina did not begin at the end of slavery. It became more pronounced and more transparent at slavery’s end, but it existed for many years. It existed for many years prior to the end of slavery. In 1831, the North Carolina General Assembly passed a law making it a crime for any free person of color or slave to preach or exhort in public, or in any manner officiate as a preacher or a teacher in any prayer meeting or other association for worship where slaves of different families were collected together. Can you imagine? The punishment for preaching the gospel—beginning in 1831, it was a crime. The punishment for violation was a whipping of up to 39 lashes on the bare back. Notwithstanding this prohibition against preaching, the Black church existed as a secret association of slaves who worshipped privately. As the antebellum period proceeded, a few of the White churches, at the urging of the North Carolina Baptist State Convention, finally allowed people of color to hold church meetings under the supervision of a White person; and, at times, a member of the White race would conduct the service. Now, Mr. Speaker, when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed on January 1, 1863, and the 13th Amendment ratified on December 6, 1865, there were 4 million slaves who obtained their freedom; 300,000 of those lived in North Carolina. The former slaves, with assistance from White northerners and the Freedmen’s Bureau, began the struggle toward freedom and equality. It was the Black church that led the way. This movement consisted of Black Baptist leaders and Black Methodist leaders and other religious leaders, both Black and White, who understood the importance of the former slaves having the ability to worship and serve their God without fear. b2015 At the end of the Civil War, the former slaves built churches throughout North Carolina. Many were of the Baptist denomination, and they were erected with lightning speed. In 1867, they came together, Mr. Speaker, at First African Baptist Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina. And I have a picture of it on display. They came together at the First African Baptist Church in Goldsboro to form the General Association of Colored Baptists of North Carolina, which was the original name for the convention. And I might say, Mr. Speaker, that my grandfather, Reverend Fred Davis, would, in 1916, become the fourth pastor of this church. Not only did Black Baptists build churches, but one of their greatest achievements was the establishment and maintenance of historic Shaw University in Raleigh, which will be discussed by my colleagues, Congressman DAVID PRICE and Congresswoman A LMA ADAMS , in just a moment. Shaw University’s contribution to African American empowerment must be known and understood by all North Carolinians. Those pioneers, who were trained at Shaw University, went into communities and established institutions and engaged in professions that empowered future generations. They went to all corners of our State. They went to eastern North Carolina; Piedmont, North Carolina; Triad; and the Federal area, which is where our esteemed sergeant at arms grew up in, Ms. Hamlett. Ms. Joyce Hamlett grew up in the Federal area. There were many other areas that were covered by graduates from Shaw University. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to include in the RECORD a list of names of AfricanAmerican physicians, dentists, pharmacists, lawyers, ministers, and teachers who were also trained at Shaw University.

Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS ), a former Bennett College professor. Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 150th anniversary of the General Baptist State Convention of North Carolina and join my colleagues, Congressman BUTTERFIELD and Congressman PRICE, in congratulating them on their achievements and the appointment of their 32nd president, Dr. Avery. In North Carolina, the convention partners with Shaw University, the 
oldest Historically Black University in the South and one of the oldest in the Nation. As a retired professor, as you heard, of 40 years from Bennett College in Greensboro, founder of the Congressional Bipartisan HBCU Caucus, and a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee here in the Congress, it gives me great pride to reflect on the general support that the convention gives to Shaw and its students. I feel a special attachment to Shaw, since that is what became my alma mater. North Carolina A&T State University was located on Shaw’s campus during its first year. Its history of leadership, activism, and service is welldocumented. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, founded on Shaw’s campus in 1960, and the Center for Alternative Programs in Education—CAPE—had its beginnings there in 1980. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman ADAMS for those enlightening remarks and for her extraordinary leadership not only here in Congress, but for 40 years that she spent in the classroom at Bennett College. She has been a trailblazer for sure. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), who also is a former college professor, who represents the Fourth Congressional District. I thank him for joining us tonight. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding, and I commend him for taking up this Special Order and giving Representative ADAMS and myself the opportunity to participate and to pay tribute to the General Baptist State Convention. The mention of Shaw University brings me to my feet because I, too, want to reflect on this significant Baptist institution, which is in the Fourth Congressional District, in downtown Raleigh. Shaw has also recently celebrated its 150th anniversary, a history that parallels that of the General Baptist State Convention. I was there last week in historic Estey Hall. I have to say—yes, point out the historic building there on the campus—when I first came to the Congress in the 1980s, my first appropriations earmark was for Estey Hall. Believe me, that was just a little bit of seed money. But Shaw has restored that building in a beautiful way. The acting President of Shaw, Dr. Paulette Dillard, is doing a wonderful job of leading that university. But the occasion last week was an inaugural lecture. The Adam Clayton PowellElla Baker lecture is going to be an annual occasion at Shaw. I was honored to give that lecture to a very lively group of students and faculty. Then we had a luncheon in Estey Hall afterwards and a great discussion, just liberal arts education at its best. I appreciated being part of that occasion, and I certainly, over the years, have come to appreciate what Shaw means: a Baptist institution. It is tied very, very closely. Shaw University Divinity School is affiliated—an institution that this convention has nurtured and that, in turn, has served thousands of people, and enriched the life of North Carolina. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman PRICE very much for those words, I thank him for his leadership and his relationship with Shaw University, and I especially thank him for mentioning Estey Hall. For many of us, who have grown up in North Carolina, we know the relevance and the importance of Shaw University. We know how Shaw University trained many hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals, who came into communities all across North Carolina and made a difference. They came into the classroom, and they taught at elementary schools and high schools all across our State. They went onto college campuses and became college professors. Many of them became lawyers because Shaw University had a law school during those days. Some became physicians and dentists. Some became pharmacists. Shaw University was a real educational engine not just in North Carolina, but throughout the country, during those very difficult days. And I say all that to say that it was the General Baptist State Convention and its predecessor that helped enable Shaw University to be born. Shaw University has done so much for so many. I recall, as a child, my parents would tell me that they, too, attended Shaw University. My dad went to Shaw University from 1919 to 1923. My mother attended Shaw University for high school. During those days, African Americans did not have the benefit in most communities of a high school education and so many of the young teens would go to Shaw for high school. It was there at Shaw University that my parents met. My dad was in undergraduate school, my mother was in the high school, and they met right on the porch of Estey Hall back in 1919. Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Price and Dr. Adams for raising up Shaw University and just telling the world what the General Baptist State Convention did by creating the environment where Shaw University could thrive. Mr. Speaker, I thank both of them for coming to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS ) for any concluding remarks. Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman BUTTERFIELD for yielding. I just wanted to add that he was almost a Shaw Bear with his parents attending there. Just last year, I had the opportunity to address Founder’s Day to all of the students there. Many firsts Shaw boasts: the first college in the Nation to offer a 4year medical program, the first Historically Black College in the Nation to open its doors to women, and the first Historically Black College in North Carolina to be granted an ‘‘A’’ rating by the State Department of Public Instruction. Over the years, as Mr. BUTTERFIELD  has said, many scholarships have been provided to those students. They have encouraged the students to not only attend their divinity school, but we find that many of them have become college presidents: the founder of North Carolina Central, the first President of Elizabeth City State, and North Carolina A&T State University were all Shaw Bears, and we are delighted. So the lives that the General Baptist State Convention has touched throughout its existence is beyond admirable and almost beyond comprehension. I want to close by saying that W.E.B. Du Bois reminded us that of all the civil rights of which the world has fought for for 500 years, the right to learn is undoubtedly the most fundamental. So I praise the General Baptist State Convention and its commitment to education, and Shaw University, as well, for their charitable giving and for their dedication to educating young people through these 150 years, a century and five decades. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Very well said, Congresswoman ADAMS . Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE) for any concluding remarks. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for this opportunity. I would like to conclude by reflecting on some of the outstanding pastors who have led this convention and led the congregations that comprise this convention. I hesitate to name any because there are so many who have served so faithfully and so well. But I want to share some memories, and I think our listeners in North Carolina will remember these as well. They exemplify what this convention has been all about and the leadership it has offered. Dr. Charles Ward, for example, long term pastor of the First Baptist Church in Raleigh, a civil rights leader, a mentor to so many people over the years, and a revered pastor. I remember him so well as I first began to think about running for Congress and sought his counsel. He unfailingly gave wise counsel and encouragement. He, of course, was a leader in the General Baptist State Convention. Reverend Lorenzo Lynch, from Durham, North Carolina, another former leader of the convention. His son, Leonzo, is now the vice president of the convention. Leonzo Lynch is a powerful prophetic preacher. He had a huge impact on the city of Durham. The Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People recently honored his lifetime achievements. And his daughter, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, returned to Durham to be part of that recognition.
