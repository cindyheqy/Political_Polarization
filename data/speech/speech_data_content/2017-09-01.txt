Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize this year’s Sacramento Japanese American Citizens League’s (JACL) high school scholarship recipients. As the members of the Sacramento JACL, the student’s and their families gather to celebrate, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing these deserving young men and women. Each year, the JACL provides scholarships to a select group of high school students who have demonstrated outstanding academic excellence and achievement, as well as community service and a desire to pursue higher education. This year, five outstanding students will receive scholarships provided by dedicated members of JACL, VFW Post 8985, and the community. This year, Kiyomi A. Sun is receiving the Harry and Kinu Masaki Memorial Scholarship and the Nisei VFW Post 8985 Scholarship. Allie T. Umemoto is receiving the Kiyoto and Rika Kawakami Memorial Scholarship, and the Noboru and Akiko May Shirai Memorial Scholarship. Kyle W. W. Kawakami is receiving the Fumio Jesse and Kiyoko Miyao Memorial Scholarship and The Nikkei Singles Club Scholarship. Cody M. Kurahara the Harry and Kinu Masaki Memorial Scholarship and the Nisei VFW Post 8985 Scholarship. And last but not least, Nozomi M. Schmoock is receiving the Sacramento JACL Chapter Scholarship. The Sacramento Japanese American Citizens League is dedicated to protecting communities affected by bigotry and injustice as well as advancing the civil rights of all Americans. It also helps to guide the Japanese American community to further social and economic equality. I trust that the students being recognized will carry this tradition forward to protect and help fight for the civil rights of all of our citizens and remain engaged in their communities. Mr. Speaker, as these students are being honored by the Japanese American Citizens League members, I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing them success in their future endeavors. 
IN HONOR OF SERGEANT ERIC SOSSOMAN’S SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITY WITH THE CABARRUS COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant Eric Sossoman for his 28 years of service with the Cabarrus County Sheriff’s Department in North Carolina’s Eighth Congressional District. Growing up in Cabarrus County, Sergeant Sossoman always had a profound sense of duty to his hometown. In 1989, he began his career at the Sheriff’s Department, starting in communications the very day Hurricane Hugo ripped through our state. Since then, Sergeant Sossoman has held many positions with the Sheriff’s Department, including the Civil Division where he became the Department’s first Social Services officer, the Crime Prevention Division, Recruitment and Retention Division and as a member of the SWAT team. Throughout his career, Sergeant Sossoman has exhibited unwavering commitment to our community and we are fortunate to have had him as a leader for all these years. Some of the many notable accomplishments during his career include bringing back the Crime Stoppers program, which was so successful that he was named the President of the North Carolina Association of Crime Stoppers, and coordinating the county’s annual Law Day, which honors fallen officers from Cabarrus County, the state and nationwide. It is my hope that Sergeant Sossoman will enjoy his retirement and remain a role model for all those he helped over the years. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in honoring the career of Sergeant Eric Sossoman for his service to our community. We all wish him well as he begins the next chapter of his life in retirement. f 
HONORING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF SERVICE BY REVEREND DR. AMOS C. BROWN 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise with pride today to join my beloved city in recognizing the 40th Anniversary of Reverend Dr. Amos C. Brown as the pastor of the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco and honoring his lifetime of moral leadership, political activism and spiritual guidance. Born and raised in Jackson, Mississippi, Reverend Brown’s history of activism and his deep involvement in the civil rights movement began at an early age. He was only a teenager when he assumed leadership of his local NAACP chapter and was driven crosscountry to San Francisco by activist Medgar Evers to meet the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. Later, Brown attended Morehouse College where he was handselected by King as one of his eight students, inspiring him to seek a lifetime of service on behalf of civil rights and social justice. He was arrested together with Dr. King during a lunch counter sitin Atlanta department store, and became one of the fearless Freedom Riders in 1961. Brown received both a Mastery of Divinity from Crozer Theological Seminary and a Doctor of Ministry from United Theological Seminary. Our city was fortunate to welcome the Pastor and his beloved wife Jane Smith Brown in 1976, when they made San Francisco their home and the Third Baptist Church their place of worship and leadership. Brown’s vision of the church as a holy place of prayer, and also a place of civic engagement and social action, transformed the Third Baptist Church into a congregation at the forefront of the fight for civil rights. His unwavering belief in future generations drove the church to establish a summer school program, an after school academic enrichment program, ‘‘Back on Track’’, and the Charles A. Tindley Academy of Music. Brown’s influence also extended beyond his local community when the church sponsored 80 children from Tanzania to receive heart surgery in the United States, and his congregation sponsored more African refugees than any other local congregation in the nation. This global reach and visionary leadership was recognized when Brown was appointed as a delegate to the 2001 United Nations Conference on Race and Intolerance in Durban, South Africa, representing the National Board of the NAACP. Closer to home, Brown was awarded the Martin Luther King Jr. Ministerial Award for outstanding leadership and contributions to the Black Church in America and he was inducted into the International Hall of Fame of the King International Chapel at Morehouse College. He has served as the president of the NAACP Branch in San Francisco, as a San Francisco Community College Trustee and as a San Francisco County Supervisor. A passionate fighter and voice for the most vulnerable in our community, Reverend Amos Brown has served as a source of change, strength and faith for 40 years. I congratulate him, along with his wife Jane and his children Amos C. Brown Jr., David Josephus and Kizzie Marie, on this milestone celebration and extend my best wishes as he continues to lead and inspire our community. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Richard, Cindy and Jennifer Crane for receiving the annual Leadership in Agriculture Award from the Santa Rosa Metro Chamber. Richard Hope Crane arrived in California in 1849 as part of the great California Gold Rush. A few years later, the family settled in Santa Rosa. They built Crane Melon Barn on Petaluma Hill Road in 1868. The Barn is made entirely of redwood and has survived several major earthquakes with no damage. Richard’s son, Oliver, developed and began selling Crane Melons out of the Barn in the 1920’s. 
Today, the Crane family owns and operates Crane Canyon Ranch, The Crane Melon Barn and Crane Vineyard. In addition to their famous Crane Melons, the family ranch sells watermelons, heirloom tomatoes, Crane Melon Honey, organic Sonoma County walnuts and metal sculptures by Richard. Crane Vineyard is a fouracre pinot noir vineyard on the ranch. Rick and Jennifer are fifth and sixth generation Sonoma County farmers. The Crane family are active members of our community, with members serving on the Sonoma County Fair Board, Harvest Fair Board, Farm Bureau, 4–H Foundation Board and Farm Trails. The Santa Rosa Metro Chamber has recognized longstanding leadership in the community and successful maintenance of agricultural enterprises with its Leadership in Agriculture Award for over forty years. The Crane family is very deserving of this award. They work hard to develop excellent produce, serve our community, and maintain the great tradition of family farming in Sonoma County. Mr. Speaker, the Crane family has been farming in Sonoma County for six generations. They are leaders in sustainable farming and contribute honorably to our community. I am proud to have such a hardworking family living in our District. It is fitting and proper that we honor them here today. 
EXPRESSING SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS AFFECTED BY HURRICANE HARVEY 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to report to the House on Hurricane Harvey, the historic storm that has devastated the Gulf Coast and my city of Houston, Texas. As a senior member and a resident of the city of Houston, I was there and witnessed the devastation that the storm wrought. Hurricane Harvey has declared war on America’s Gulf Coast, and as Americans, we must respond. We will need emergency supplemental appropriations for Southeast Texas, and the Houston metroplex, to provide support to local, state, and federal government agencies in assisting with flood remediation, recovery, victim services, and reconstruction following the catastrophic damage caused by historic flooding. So far, Harvey has dumped an estimated 11 trillion gallons of water in the Houston area. The relentless rain has inundated homes, decimated area roadways and turned neighborhoods into unrecognizable lakes. Large portions of the Bayou City have been overwhelmed by rainfall amounts that occur only once in every thousand years. To comprehend the level of destruction, the volume of water that has fallen could fill the Astrodome more than 24 thousand times over and power Niagara Falls for 15 days. The disastrous events this week have been punctuated by the tragic loss of life. In Houston, at least 44 people have lost their lives, including veteran police officer Sgt. Steve Perez, 60, who had worked for 34 years with the Houston Police Department. Sgt. Perez was trying to serve and protect others when he was swept away by the rising waters. Sgt. Perez, who worked in the traffic enforcement division, left home around 4 a.m. Sunday to drive to his duty station downtown but could not find a path because flooding caused by tropical storm Harvey had made many roads impassable. A family of six attempting to flee their home perished when their vehicle was swept into Greens Bayou. Samuel ‘‘Sammy’’ Saldivar was driving eastbound on Green River Road near John Ralston Road Sunday when rising water in Greens Bayou overcame the van. Sammy was travelling with his elderly parents, Manuel Saldivar, 84, and Belia, 81. Also in the van were the greatgrandchildren of his parents: Daisy Saldivar, 6, Xavier Saldivar, 8, Dominic Saldivar, 14, and Devy Saldivar, 16. A Neither Houston nor any city in the nation has ever experienced flooding of this magnitude. Our valiant emergency responders are overtaxed and citizen rescues have become a critical source of assistance in saving lives. So far the Coast Guard alone has saved more than 6,000 Lives in Houston. At times like this, I am so proud to be an American and to call Houston home. We are a close community that comes together to overcome any challenge that stands in our way. Mr. Speaker, this is why we need Congress and the President to provide immediate emergency funding and resources commensurate with the crisis at hand, and that means a minimum of $150 billion is needed now and much more later. I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory of all those who perished in Hurricane Harvey. 
Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Lee Paulsen, the Honorary Grand Marshal for the 56th Annual Labor Day Parade in Newtown, Connecticut. Since 1962, this annual celebration has brought together the people of Newtown and western Connecticut, and this year’s organizers invited Lee to head the parade in recognition of her decades of selfless work to help those most in need in our community. Lee moved to Newtown in 1972 with her family, and she quickly became known among her neighbors for her generosity. She has worked at the FAITH Food Pantry since its inception in 1983, and her efforts have been instrumental in keeping its doors open to those in need through economic downturns, the relocation of the food pantry, and other challenges facing the organization. Her neighbors in Newtown know Lee for her kindness, humility, and sincere commitment to helping others. Those who work with Lee note that she does not seek recognition or attention, but nonetheless, everyone knows Lee as an inspiring and altruistic person. The Labor Day Parade’s fitting theme, Labor of Love, this year recognizes Lee’s decades of work and encourages all of us to reflect on how we can contribute to our community. Lee sets a remarkable example as a caring citizen, and she has made Newtown a more generous and welcoming place through her years of work at FAITH. Mr. Speaker, Lee Paulsen has been a leading member of our community who shares her time and knowledge to help those in need in Newtown. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her here today, and thank her for inspiring others to engage in a Labor of Love. f 
L. RAFAEL REIF AND THE DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS PROGRAM 
Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the powerful words of L. Rafael Reif, president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on DACA, ‘‘Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.’’ Mr. Reif notes MIT’s commitment to intellectual excellence, merit, and national service in support of DACA. He is himself a proud naturalized citizen of the United States. 
[From the Boston Globe, Aug. 31, 2017] TRUMP SHOULD NOTREPEAL DACA (By L. Rafael Reif) President Trump is reportedly considering a repeal of ‘‘DACA,’’ the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The immediate pressure: a threat of legal action by a number of states to end the program, which sets a Sept. 5 deadline for the White House to act. As the president of one of America’s leading technical universities—an institution built on intellectual excellence, a meritocratic openness to talent, and a long tradition of national service—I believe repealing DACA would be a mistake. Repeal would be no more than a rejection of a policy and of thousands of human beings. Repeal is not, however, a solution for the country or for the young people directly involved. I strongly urge the president and Congress to find a path that better serves us all. Created in 2012 by executive action, DACA addresses the problem of young people brought to this country without documentation when they were under 16, a group sometimes known as Dreamers. DACA invites them to declare themselves openly to the government. In return, provided that they meet strict criteria, such as having earned a high school diploma, being enrolled in higher education or engaged in the military, and having committed no serious crime, DACA allows them a Social Security number, a driver’s license, authorization to work—and perhaps above all, relief from the fear of being deported. DACA is not a path to permanent citizenship; it grants a temporary but renewable opportunity for a normal life. And it applies only to the fixed pool of those who were brought to the US as children before June 2007. Repeal would run counter to our national interest in at least two ways. First, it would remove productive workers from our economy, while costing the US government tens of billions in lost future tax revenues and the direct costs of deportation. And because Dreamers are, by definition, products of the US education system, driving them out would be throwing away a tremendous national investment. We should treat these 
educated, Englishspeaking strivers not as a burden, but as a resource. Repeal also strikes me as a violation of deep American principles. The plight of the Dreamers presents a profound question of fairness. Often starting from harsh personal circumstances, these young people have done what any American family might dream of for their child: Study hard, aim high, and earn a degree or a place in college or the military, on the road to a productive career. They are undocumented through no fault of their own. And when offered an opportunity to come out of the shadows, they did—because they trusted that our government would not punish them for it. Could we ask for more, from any American? Yet, as we see at MIT and at campuses across the country, the threat of DACA repeal is subjecting these young people to brutal uncertainty. Now, because of decisions made for them when they were children, they fear losing the opportunities they earned, the communities they think of as home, and the nation they love. The surest way to provide the certainty these students deserve is for Congress to pass legislation protecting these Dreamers. As many polls have found, the vast majority of Americans oppose repeal of DACA. And many members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, have proposed humane and sensible legislative solutions. So I ask, in this urgent moment, that we unite as Americans in calling on Congress to bring a bill to the floor as soon as possible— and calling on Trump to allow Congress the time to get this right. I came to this country 43 years ago. The US immigration system worked well for me. It granted me a student visa and eventually a green card. Years later, on a beautiful day that I will never forget, I became an American citizen. I have the particular patriotism of an immigrant, rooted in deep gratitude and appreciation for a country founded on a dream of fairness. I urge Trump and the Congress to find a sound, stable legislative path to keep that promise if fairness for the Dreamers, too. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF MARINES LANDING AT GUADALCANAL 
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 75th Anniversary of our United States Marines’ landing at Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands during World War II. Three quarters of a century after this momentous event, the memory and sacrifice of these brave men should not be forgotten. On August 7, 1942, Marines joined by our allies landed on the shores of the Solomon Islands to deny their use to our thenadversary, Imperial Japan. These Marines were joined by U.S. Navy vessels, as well as by ships and troops supplied by our Australian and British allies, in a series of 26 land and naval battles that collectively became known as the Battle of Guadalcanal. Two of our future presidents served there: John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. Other Solomon Islanders served bravely as the famous Coastwatchers, providing the early warnings that allowed our outnumbered Marines to prevail against their enemies. Today, we look to the future with the knowledge that the Marines’ landing on this day threequarters of a century ago was an important turning point in World War II’s Pacific Theater. To commemorate this important event, Marines and private citizens are currently in the process of dedicating a new monument atop the battlefield known as Bloody Ridge in Guadalcanal. Their efforts are supported and aided by the citizens and government of the Solomon Islands. The approaching ceremony to occur on the famous Bloody Ridge battle site recognizes the unity of spirit that today prevails among our allies and former adversaries, all of which are now charged with maintaining peace in the Pacific Ocean. Mr, Speaker, as the efforts to create a monument to the heroism displayed by so many at Guadalcanal move forward, I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering the 75th anniversary of our Marines’ historic landing at Guadalcanal. f 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sophia Boquist for earning her Congressional Award Silver Medal. These awards are given to outstanding young individuals who meet specific standards for voluntary public service, personal development, physical fitness, and exploration. Sophia volunteered in a community award ceremony, cleaned a park trail, volunteered at the Travis Manion Foundation Heroes’ Run and worked as a volunteer aide at the Ivy Hill Therapeutic Equestrian Center. Additionally, Sophia spent time developing her ability as a pianist and her skill as a diver. As a final step, Sophia showed great leadership in planning and executing a two day canoe trip down the Delaware River. Sophia’s commitment to public service and motivation to better herself should serve as an example to all of us. 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the Baha’i Faith as Iran’s largest religious minority group which has been subjected to statesponsored persecution that has intensified since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. Statesponsored media has disseminated over 1,500 antiBaha’i pieces every month in 2016, inciting hatred against the Baha’i community. After Baha’is were barred from attending or teaching in Iranian universities, the Baha’i Institute for Higher Education (BIHE), an informal higher education system, was created in 1987 by members of the Baha’i community in Iran. In recent years, faculty and staff have been arrested and imprisoned for their participation in BIHE. We must be very clear that education is not a crime. In any diplomatic engagement with Iran, I urge the administration to make human rights and religious freedom, including the persecuted Baha’is, an integral part of the dialogue. I fully support House Resolution 274, which condemns the government of Iran’s state sponsored persecution of its Baha’i minority and its continued violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights. f 
Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in memory of Staten Island’s Joseph Calabria, who passed away on July 28, 2017, at the age of 86. A lifelong New Yorker, Joseph grew up in Brooklyn where he met his childhood sweetheart Josephine at a dance hall on Coney Island, whom he married in 1957. He nobly fought for his country during the Korean War. After joining the Army in October 1951, Joseph was responsible for delivering supplies and munitions to his fellow soldiers. When the war ended, he served his country further by tirelessly advocating for veterans. As the former Commander of the local Korean War Veterans chapter, Joseph never stopped fighting for his brothers who wore the uniform. He was instrumental in changing the name of the Richmond Parkway to the Korean War Veterans Parkway. Moreover, he was influential in renaming P.S. 6 after Corporal Allan F. Kivlehan. These were no small feats, but Joseph never grew tired of fighting for those who put their life on the line for their country. Joseph was also proud of his bluecollar roots. Working as a longshoreman for over forty years, he showed his compassion for the fellow working man by supporting them as a delegate for Local 856. Furthermore, Joseph was also a loving father to four wonderful children and a devoted grandfather to two. Mr. Speaker, Joseph Calabria has spent his life in service to veterans, community, and country. I am saddened that he is no longer with us, but I know his compassion and patriotism will live on. He led a selfless life and for that, I salute him. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Jefferson City Jays’ Baseball Team on their first place win in the 2017 Missouri Class 5 Baseball State Championship. This team and their coaches should be commended for all of their hard work throughout this past year and for bringing home the state championship to their school and community. The team members include senior players Cole Ahrens, Kade Franks, Hayden 
Hirschvogel, Gaven Strobel, Gunnar See, Jacob Weirich, Brandon Williams, and Grant Wood. The junior players include Nolan Binkley, Tyler Bise, Payton Bodenstab, Cade Galbraith, Mason Hansen, Reece Neighbors, Michael Skinner, Ryan Sturm, Joseph Travis, and Chad Volmert. The sophomore players include Landon Dunlap, Tucker Schwartz, Jack Shinkle, Blake Terry, and Justin Wood. The coaches that led this team to victory are Head Coach Brian Ash and Assistant Coaches J.R. Simmons, Kyle Lasley, Jim Womack, Steve Lochhead, and Brett Skinner. Throughout this winning year, the Jays had a record of 31 wins and 2 losses. Additionally, they received a ranking of No. 1 in Missouri and No. 18 in the nation by Baseball America Sports Writers. This state championship win was the first Jays baseball state title in 28 years. The team and the Jefferson City community are particularly proud of Head Coach Brian Ash and Assistant Coach J.R. Simmons. Coach Ash has been honored as the USA Today Missouri Coach of the Year as well as the National High School Coach of the Year by the American Baseball Coaches Association. Assistant Coach J.R. Simmons has been honored as the Regional Assistant Coach of the Year by the National High School Baseball Coaches Association. These awards are a testament to the dedication these coaches have to their team and their sport. I ask you to join me in recognizing the Jefferson City Jays’ Baseball Team for a job well done. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the White Oaks Mall on celebrating their 40th Anniversary. For forty years, White Oaks Mall has provided Springfield area shoppers with a wide range of options. In 1977, when White Oaks Mall first opened their doors, it was the largest retail shopping space outside of Chicago, covering nearly one million square feet. Currently, the mall features a wide variety of stores for consumers to choose ranging from fashion, sporting goods, electronics, home de´cor, dining and more. The mall also features entertainment for parents and children as they can enjoy a round of glowinthedark miniature golf. The White Oaks Mall has been and continues to be an institution for the greater Springfield area. Congratulations on a prosperous forty years, and I wish them many more years of success. RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE NATIONAL SOCIETY DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, SARAH BARTON MURPHY CHAPTER HON. JASON SMITH 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, Sarah Barton Murphy Chapter, as they celebrate their 62nd Anniversary in Farmington, Missouri. The chapter is an incredible asset to the community, especially as they commemorate the 230th Anniversary of U.S. Constitution Week, September 17 through 23, 2017. To help preserve our American heritage through this national observance, the Sarah Barton Murphy Chapter encourages 5th grade students in St. Francois County to participate in ‘‘Ring Bells for Freedom.’’ They promote displays in six libraries in three counties and books on Colonial founders to help residents retrace the American story. The Chapter asks all residents of St. Francois County to study our nation’s birth through the events that led to the drafting of the Constitution and its signing on September 17, 1787. The Sarah Barton Murphy Chapter of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution works tirelessly to keep their communities aware of America’s amazing heritage. I am honored to recognize the chapter today before the United States House of Representatives. 
IN RECOGNITION OF MARJORIE BENBOW AND HER APPOINTMENT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA STATE BOARD OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Marjorie ‘‘Margie’’ Benbow on her recent appointment to the North Carolina State Board of Community Colleges and the North Carolina Community College Board of Trustees. I’ve known Margie for many years, and believe she will make an excellent addition to these boards. Educated in North Carolina, Ms. Benbow graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and went on to receive both her Juris Doctor and Masters of Business Administration from Wake Forest University. Since finishing school, she has applied her education to community service and helping those who need it most. Over the years, Ms. Benbow has dedicated her life to furthering the state of North Carolina. Currently practicing law at Moretz & Skufca, Ms. Benbow focuses on technology transfer, licensing, corporate matters and distillery & brewery law while simultaneously serving on the RowanCabarrus College Board of Trustees. Prior to her legal work, she served as Science and Technology Officer for the state’s fourthlargest hospital system and as the Executive Director for the region’s North Carolina Biotechnology Center. Ms. Benbow has served in nearly every leadership role imaginable. She served on the boards of the NC School of Science and Math, NC Sustainable Energy Association, Charlotte Ventureprise, NC Motorsports Foundation, Institute of Political Leadership, Charlotte Area Science Network and Leadership North Carolina. Ms. Benbow is an excellent nomination to the North Carolina State Board of Community Colleges. Her dedication to North Carolina earned her a spot as one of Charlotte’s 50 Most Influential Women and one of Charlotte USA’s 20 Most Dynamic Women. I am extremely grateful for Ms. Benbow’s service to our community and I wish her continued success. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in congratulating Marjorie Benbow on her appointment to the North Carolina State Board of Community Colleges and the North Carolina Community College Board of Trustees. f 
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I rise to honor the life of Mr. Mario Gutierrez. I ask my colleagues to join me in tribute to Mario’s truly remarkable life. His work has saved countless lives, and there will be a significant void without him. Mario’s impact on telehealth is immeasurable. His work at CCHP has profoundly impacted the telehealth policy landscape on both the state and federal level. He served as a program director with The California Endowment for twelve years and as a senior program officer with The Sierra Health Foundation for six years. Mario always viewed telehealth as a means to ultimately achieve what he firmly believed and fought to accomplish: to make sure that every person, no matter how poor or how isolated, could access highquality healthcare. Mario’s work researching and supporting telehealth innovations has helped children in remote rural communities receive lifesaving treatment from worldrenowned physicians, and has explored the potential of connecting health care providers in Mexico with undocumented individuals needing care in California. Mario and his wife would often spearhead and lead medical missions to other countries to provide medical care for people in need, who may have never otherwise received vital medical treatment. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the life of Mr. Mario Gutierrez and in offering our condolences to his wife, family, and colleagues. His life’s work will continue to improve the lives of so many people and those who knew him will truly miss him.
