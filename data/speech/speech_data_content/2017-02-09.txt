Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a dedicated public servant from the Sixth Congressional District of Illinois, Mayor Michael ‘‘Mickey’’ Straub of Burr Ridge. Almost five years ago, Mayor Straub embarked on a historic and patriotic pilgrimage in honor 
of Lincoln and our veterans when he visited 50 capitols in 50 days. In 2012, between September 4 and October 17, Mayor Straub drove nearly 15,000 miles to 48 state capitols and flew to two others—Hawaii and Alaska. His momentous journey began in Pennsylvania, and after a small ceremony in Gettysburg outside the home where Lincoln finished writing the Address, he traveled to the state capitol in Harrisburg. Forty three days later, he concluded his capitol journey in Springfield, Illinois in front of the Lincoln Tomb. The historic and record breaking trip was no easy task. The trip cost over $20,000 and added a great many miles to his Lincoln Town Car, homage to the 16th President. Nevertheless, Mayor Straub remained steadfast in his belief that the journey was a great success due to God and the American people saying, ‘‘I launched the trip on behalf of God and country, but it was actually God and country that pulled me through. It started more about principles and patriotism, but it was the people who kept me going.’’ Mayor Straub has represented his community well and has been a strong voice for the Village of Burr Ridge throughout his time in office. His service to the people of Burr Ridge and to Illinois is truly commendable. It is our hope that the public will continue to benefit from his involvement as a valued member of the community and Mayor of Burr Ridge. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Mayor Mickey Straub on his historic journey across the United States, and also taking his lead in remembering the spirit of the Gettysburg Address and President Lincoln. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor the life and memory of California Appeals Court Justice Vaino Hassan Spencer. A month after Vaino was born in 1920, women gained the right to vote. She grew up during the Great Depression, started her professional career as a real estate broker, and married fellow broker Lorenzo Spencer in the late 1940s. She embarked on a legal career after graduating from Southwestern Law School in 1952, and practiced for nine years before thengovernor Pat Brown appointed her to the Municipal Court bench in 1961, the first African American woman to hold a judgeship in California. She was elevated to the Superior Court in 1976 by thenGovernor Jerry Brown, who went on to name her as presiding justice of Division One of the Second Appellate District Court of Appeal in 1980, making her the first Black woman to sit on a California appeals court. Justice Spencer believed in the concept of ‘‘lift as you climb’’ and worked to create opportunities for women and people of color, especially in the legal profession. She founded the Black Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles in 1974 to provide support to those already in the profession, and to assist others with scholarships, mentoring and guidance. The very next year, she joined with another Appeals Court Justice to coordinate efforts in support of women nominated to federal and state supreme courts. That collaboration grew into the National Association of Women Judges, which aimed to increase the number of women in the judiciary and to address the gender bias problems experienced by the few women who were on the bench. President Jimmy Carter met with NAWJ in 1980, having appointed nearly four times the women to the federal bench (38) than had ever been appointed by all of his predecessors. In remarks later, she said: ‘‘We have been warmly greeted [everywhere], and we’ve gotten tremendous support, even from local judges who were openly resentful of our organizing initially. They have come around to be quite supportive. . . .’’ She served one of the longest tenures on the bench in California history, retiring in 2007. I salute the life and legacy of Justice Spencer, a legacy of service to the legal profession, to the state of California and to the nation. f 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to rise and recognize the Cypress Baptist Church of Benton, Louisiana. For over thirty years, Cypress Baptist has blessed the lives of many in our region. Most recently, God has blessed Cypress Baptist Church with the means to expand their sanctuary to grow their ministry. Their mission, ‘‘to help people come to know Christ and to grow in Christ,’’ has been modeled by the church’s faithful congregation and their commitment to the Lord is unwavering. Because of their continued stewardship, more and more people are answering the call of God by being baptized and carrying out critical mission work. Over the past two years the communities of Benton and Bossier City and surrounding areas have come together to help Cypress Baptist in its mission. This church has touched the lives of so many, and is growing exponentially, and it is only fitting that God rewards them with the blessing of more space to carry out their service. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, I am privileged to recognize Cypress Baptist Church and congratulate this pillar of our community on its continued dedication to the Kingdom. Their new sanctuary will be a true blessing to the people of our community. My wife, Kelly and I pray that the Spirit of the Lord continue to bless the congregation of Cypress Baptist Church. 
URGING SENATE TO REJECT NOMINATION OF SEN. JEFF SESSIONS FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD the text of an oped that was published yesterday in The Hill, entitled ‘‘When It Comes to Leading the Justice Department, the Senate Should Just Say No To Sen. Sessions,’’ whose headquarters building is named after Robert F. Kennedy, by Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE. 
[From The Hill, Feb. 8, 2017] WHENITCOMES TO LEADING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT , THE SENATE SHOULD JUSTSAY NOT O SESSIONS  (By Sheila Jackson Lee) Many people think the role of the U.S. Attorney General is simply to be the nation’s chief prosecutor. This seriously understates the responsibility, power, and moral authority of the office. The attorney general is the lawyer for the American people. He is not the president’s lawyer. The Attorney General leads the Department of Justice and justice is his client and his mission. As a member of the President’s Cabinet, it is important that the Attorney General have the trust of the President, but as the ‘‘People’s Lawyer,’’ it is essential that he or she have the trust and confidence of the American people. The nomination of U.S. Sen. Jefferson Beauregard ‘‘Jeff’’ Sessions III of Alabama to be the next Attorney General of the United States does not inspire the required trust and confidence. Many of the senator’s supporters, ranging from his Republican colleagues in the Senate to current and former staffers to home state friends and constituents, praise the senator for his modesty and courtesy and manners. The fourterm senator and former state and federal prosecutor is, we are told, learned in the law, a person of deep faith, a good man who loves his family, his state, and his country. We can, as the lawyers say, stipulate that these assertions are true. But that does not make him an appropriate and deserving candidate to be Attorney General of the United States. And that is because the office of Attorney General and the Department of Justice he or she leads is different in a very fundamental way from every other Cabinet department. Unlike, say, the secretary of Transportation or Commerce or Education, or even the secretary of Defense or State, the Attorney General leads a department that is charged with administering the laws and enforcing the Constitutional guarantees and protections that directly affect every American, all 320 million of us. Sen. Sessions may be a courtly and courteous Southern gentleman but those qualities, charming and desirable as they may be in a senator, simply are not nearly enough to make one fit to serve as Attorney General of the United States of America. The position of Attorney General is unique because he or she is the only Cabinet officer who owes a stronger allegiance to the American people than to the president who nominated him or her. This is not true even for the secretaries of State, of Defense, or of the Treasury because while they are all charged with upholding the Constitution, their views regarding the fundamental rights and civil liberties of the American people are not essential to the execution of their governmental duties. One of the major reasons why the nomination of a sitting fourterm senator to be Attorney General is unprecedented is that the role of a senator is to be a partisan advocate for specific legislative outcomes while the role of the Attorney General is to enforce the law. It is dangerous to combine this partisan zeal with the power and discretion vested in the Attorney General to shape legal policy in the federal judiciary. As Attorney General, Sen. Sessions will have an 
outsized role in determining which cases will be brought and what position the United States will take in cases decided by the Supreme Court. An alarming case in point is the Executive Order issued by the president banning Muslims from predominately Muslim countries from entering the United States, which has been denounced by leading national security and foreign policy experts, deemed unconstitutional by scores of law professors and other scholars, sparked peaceful mass demonstrations across the nation, and is opposed by a majority of the American public. The president’s ban on Muslims entering the United States was deemed such a clear and egregious violation of the Constitution that then Acting Attorney General Sally Yates announced that she could not, consistent with her oath, defend the order in court. Sen. Sessions, however, appears not be troubled in the slightest by the cavalier rejection of the principle of religious liberty implicit in the executive order. This is hardly surprising since Sen. Sessions was one of the earliest, most influential, and enthusiastic backers of the Trump presidential campaign and its unconscionable and unconstitutional immigration policies, including the ‘‘total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States’’ announced by candidate Trump in December 2015. As Sen. Sessions told ABC News in May 2016: ‘‘I don’t think Trump has gone too far, . . . we should have a temporary ban on entry of people into the country from the Muslim world, but that’s because we have an ineffective screening process . . . so I think we’re moving in the right direction.’’ As noted by the more than 1,000 State Department employees who have registered their dissent to the executive order, because there has been a virtual absence of terror attacks committed in recent years by Syrian, Iraqi, Irani, Libyan, Somalia, Sudanese, and Yemeni nationals living in the United States, the president’s Muslim ban will have little practical effect in improving public safety. What it will do, however, is despoil our relations with these countries, and much of the Muslim world, which sees the ban, rightly, as religiouslymotivated. So instead of strengthening relations with countries that should be our allies and partners in the fight against terrorism, we alienate them, inflame sentiment against the United States among their citizens, and deprive ourselves of vital intelligence and resources needed to fight the root causes of terror. Adoption of this wrongheaded policy appears to mean to Sen. Sessions that ‘‘we’re moving in the right direction.’’ That any member of the President’s Cabinet could hold these views is very troubling. That such views are held by the person who could be the Attorney General is frightening and disqualifying. After all, the U.S. Attorney General and Justice Department is not only the instrument of justice but also the living symbol of the Constitution’s promise of equal justice under law. The nation’s greatest Attorney Generals conveyed this commitment to equal justice by their prior experience, their words and deeds, and their character. Think Herbert Brownell, Attorney General for Republican President Eisenhower, who oversaw the integration of Little Rock’s Central High School. Think Robert Jackson, Attorney General for Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt, who led the prosecution team at the Nazi War Crimes trial in Nuremburg, Germany. Think Robert F. Kennedy, for whom the Main Justice Building is named, bringing to bear the instruments of federal power to protect Mississippi Freedom Riders and to stare down Gov. George Wallace in the successful effort to integrate the University of Alabama. Think Elliot Richardson, Attorney General under Republican President Richard Nixon, who stood for fidelity to the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law in the infamous ‘Saturday Night Massacre’ during the Watergate scandal. Those who argue the Sessions’ nomination is no different than those of Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch are simply wrong. The difference is stark—Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch came to the office of Attorney General as career professionals with no history or record of partisan political advocacy. Unlike Sen. Sessions, neither of them ever served in a legislative body or voted to pass or defeat the legislation the Department of Justice is charged with administering. Nothing in Sen. Sessions’ 70 years inspires any confidence that he possesses the qualities of any of our distinguished former Attorneys General and there is less reason for optimism that he will grow in office. As a U.S. senator from Alabama, the state from which the infamous Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder originated, Sen. Sessions has failed to play a constructive role in repairing the damage to the Voting Rights Act caused by that decision. He was one of the leading opponents of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. Sen. Sessions’s record in support of efforts to bring needed reform to the nation’s criminal justice system is virtually nonexistent. And his Senate voting record and rhetoric has endeared him to white nationalist websites and organizations like Breitbart and Stormfront. Sen. Sessions was the first federal prosecutor in the country to bring charges against civil rights activists for voter fraud and has called the landmark Voting Rights Act ‘‘a piece of intrusive legislation.’’ He is one of the Senate’s most hostile opponents of comprehensive immigration reform and was a principal architect of the draconian and incendiary immigration policy advocated by the current president during the 2016 campaign. When it comes to the effort to diversify the federal judiciary in his home state of Alabama and the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Sen. Sessions has at best been missing in action. As Attorney General of the state of Alabama, Sen. Sessions fought to continue practices that harmed schools predominantly attended by AfricanAmerican students, including leading the fight to uphold the state of Alabama’s inequitable school funding mechanism after it had been deemed unconstitutional by the Alabama circuit court. Although Sen. Sessions has publicly taken credit for desegregation efforts in the state of Alabama, there is no evidence of his participation in the desegregation of Alabama schools or any school desegregation lawsuits filed by thenAttorney General Sessions. Sen. Session’s lengthy public record makes it difficult to place much faith in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. After staunchly opposing the Violence Against Women Act, the repeal of ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’’ the expansion of antihate legislation to include sexual orientation, and fighting the removal of the Confederate flag from public buildings, the longtime opponent of voluntary desegregation in Alabama now claims to be committed to the cause of equal opportunity for all Americans. The proponent of overruling Roe v. Wade now presents himself as a defender and protector of a woman’s right to choose. The outspoken advocate of unfettered Second Amendment rights now says he can be trusted to enforce the nation’s gun violence prevention laws. Actions speak louder than words, and in the case of Sen. Sessions his 30year record of intense opposition on so many critical issues involving civil rights, women’s rights, voting rights, criminal justice and immigration reform, and equal educational opportunity is the most compelling and powerful evidence that he should not be confirmed by the Senate to be the nation’s 84th Attorney General. f 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Polish Legion Motorcycle Riding Club. Since 2011 this organization has brought together members of our community of all ages who share a passion for riding motorcycles. I would like to give special recognition to the group’s President, Szymon Moskal. Millions of citizens in the United States own and ride motorcycles, making ridership an American tradition. The Polish Legion Motorcycle Riding Club continues the proud tradition of motorcycle ridership and enthusiasm found in my district, and across our great nation. It is my privilege to assist them during their trip to our nation’s capital. 
Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably absent in the House chamber for roll call vote 85 Tuesday, February 7, 2017. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘Nay’’ on roll call vote 85. 
PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RELATING TO ACCOUNTABILITY AND STATE PLANS 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 57, the CRA Resolution for Disapproval of the Rule Submitted by the Department of Education Relating to Accountability and State Plans under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). I oppose this legislation because the regulation Republicans seek to rescind is intended to reduce educational opportunities in student achievement, quality of instruction, college readiness and other important outcomes. ESEA, the national education law, represents a longstanding commitment to equal opportunity for all students. ESEA authorizes staterun programs for eligible schools and districts eager to raise the 
academic achievement of struggling learners and address the complex challenges that arise for students who live with disability, mobility problems, learning difficulties, poverty, or transience, or who need to learn English. The original goal of the law, which remains today, was to improve educational equity for students from lowerincome families by providing federal funds to school districts serving poor students. Typically, these school districts receive less state and local funding than those serving more affluent children. Local property taxes are typically the primary funding source for schools, and property values are much lower in poorer areas, making the funds critical to children demonstrating greater educational need. ESEA is the single largest source of federal spending on elementary and secondary education. ESEA demands accountability in state plans addressing deficiencies in high needs educational policy in return for the taxpayer dollars. Because of this regulation states and districts must now show that they are working to meet the needs and providing a quality education to all of their students. When education policy folks talk about accountability, this is what they mean. Recognizing the continuing vital need for this landmark legislation, the 50yearold Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 was reauthorized as the Every Student Succeeds Act, with strong bipartisan majorities and it was signed by President Obama on December 10, 2015. The joint resolution before us today, would nullify the rule finalized by the Department of Education on November 29, 2016, relating to accountability and state plans under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. H.J. Res. 57 is the latest Republican attempt to dismantle the oversight and enforcement authority of the Department of Education and undermine public education. Thus far: The Trump Administration nominated Betsy DeVos, a candidate for Secretary of Education with no practical education experience who pledges to redirect $20 billion in federal funding to private school voucher programs; Administration sources leaked plans to eliminate the Under Secretary position and outsource higher education policy to a task force headed by the controversial Jerry Falwell, Jr., the President of Liberty University; The Department removed all Every Student Succeeds Act technical assistance resources to the states from the public domain; and Republicans have filed two joint resolutions of disapproval to block and prevent reregulation of key equity protections for students and educators—this bill and H.J. Res. 58, the Congressional Review Act (CRA) Resolution for Disapproval of the Rule Submitted by the Department of Education Relating to Teacher Preparation Issues. Mr. Speaker, current education law and policy builds on key areas of progress in recent years, made possible by the efforts of educators, communities, parents, and students across the country. Today, high school graduation rates are at alltime highs: Graduation rate of U.S. public high schools: 83.2 percent for the 2014–15 school year, an alltime high; preObama: 75 percent By race and ethnicity: African Americans: 73 percent; preObama: 61 percent Hispanics: 76 percent; preObama: 64 percent Whites: 87 percent; preObama: 81 percent American Indian/Alaska Native: 70 percent: preObama: 64 percent Asian/Pacific Islander: 89 percent; pre Obama: 91 percent Dropout rates are at historic lows. And more students are going to college than ever before. These achievements provide a firm foundation for further work to expand educational opportunity and improve student outcomes under ESSA. ESSA includes provisions that will help to ensure success for students and schools. Below are just a few benefits provided by the ESSA: 1) Advances equity by upholding critical protections for America’s disadvantaged and highneed students. 2) Require—for the first time, that all students in America be taught to high academic standards that will prepare them to succeed in college and careers. 3) Ensures that vital information is provided to educators, families, students, and communities through annual statewide assessments that measure students’ progress toward those high standards. 4) Helps to support and grow local innovation including evidencebased and place based interventions developed by local leaders and educator, consistent with our Investing in Innovation and Promise Neighborhoods. 5) Sustains and expands this administration’s historic investments in increasing access to highquality preschool. 6) Maintains an expectation that there will be accountability, and action to effect positive change in our lowestperforming schools, where groups of students are not making progress, and where graduation rates are low over extended periods of time. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) passed as a cornerstone of President Lyndon. B. Johnson’s War on Poverty was signed into law on April 9, 1965. This law brought education into the forefront of the national assault on poverty and represented a landmark commitment to equal access to quality education. The ESEA is a comprehensive statute that funds primary and secondary education, emphasizing high standards and accountability. As mandated in the Act, funds are authorized for professional development, instructional materials, resources to support educational programs, and the promotion of parental involvement. The government has reauthorized the Act every five years since its enactment. President Johnson believed that full educational opportunity should be our first national goal. From its inception, ESEA was a civil rights law. ESEA offered new grants to districts serving lowincome students, federal grants for textbooks and library books, funding for special education centers, and scholarships for lowincome college students. Additionally, the law provided federal grants to state educational agencies to improve the quality of elementary and secondary education. The previous version of the law, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, was enacted in 2002. NCLB represented a significant step forward for our nation’s children in many respects, particularly as it shined a light on where students were making progress and where they needed additional support, regardless of race, income, zip code, disability, home language, or background. NCLB put in place measures that exposed achievement gaps among traditionally underserved students and their peers and spurred an important national dialogue on education improvement. This focus on accountability has been critical in ensuring a quality education for all children, yet also revealed challenges in the effective implementation of this goal. The law was scheduled for revision in 2007, and, over time, NCLB’s prescriptive requirements became increasingly unworkable for schools and educators. Parents, educators, and elected officials across the country recognized that a strong, updated law was necessary to expand opportunity to all students; support schools, teachers, and principals; and to strengthen our education system and economy. Recognizing this fact, in 2010, the Obama Administration joined a call from educators and families to create a better law that focused on the clear goal of fully preparing all students for success in college and careers. Congress has responded to that call allowing the Every Student Succeeds Act to reflect many of the priorities previously debated. Additionally, in 2012, the Obama Administration began granting flexibility to states regarding specific requirements of NCLB in exchange for rigorous and comprehensive state developed plans designed to close achievement gaps, increase equity, improve the quality of instruction, and increase outcomes for all students. The law today, offers flexibility to states 
from some of the previously more cumbersome provisions. In order to qualify for this flexibility, states have to demonstrate that they have adopted college and careerready standards and assessments, implemented school accountability systems that focused on the lowestperforming schools and those with the largest achievement gaps, and ensured that districts were implementing teacher and principal evaluation and support systems. These efforts should not be compromised. H.J. Res. 57 however, puts politics before America’s 50 million public school students. It takes an axe to a consensusdriven ESSA rule that was developed with, and supported by, the broader education community, including states, districts, civil rights groups, parents, and teachers. Republicans want blanket deregulation of federal education programs in an attempt to stall implementation of equityfocused provisions and allow states and districts the ultimate flexibility to ignore laws and federal requirements intended to protect disadvantaged students. The CRA has been used only once in Congress’ history. Using it to block regulatory action to support and improve public education is extreme and a gross abuse of power. Resolutions introduced by Republicans in the last week, including H.J. Res. 57, set a 
dangerous precedent by permanently undermining the Department of Education and all federal agencies. ESSA was passed in December of 2015 with overwhelming bipartisan and bicameral support, and H.J. Res. 57 is a political power play that would undo enforcement of key equity protections in this bipartisan civil rights law. States are currently drafting plans to implement this very regulation. ESSA affords states and districts unprecedented flexibility. H.J. Res. 57 would pull the rug out from under states and districts that are working hard to ensure the civil rights legacy of the law, leaving them without the clarity and direction needed to fully use new flexibilities and meet federal requirements. H.J. Res. 57 strikes at the heart of ESSA. Blocking implementation and reregulation of ESSA’s core requirements in accountability, state plans, and data and reporting will leave States in limbo and jeopardize protections for vulnerable students that Democrats championed in reauthorization. If unhappy with the final rule, the Trump Administration should use administrative tools at its disposal to amend and revise the regulation. Use of CRA is a political gimmick that harms students, teachers, and taxpayers. I urge you to oppose this Republican scare tactic of a bill. 
CONGRATULATING THE HON. MP VIAN DAKHIL ON RECEIVING THE 2016 LANTOS HUMAN RIGHTS PRIZE 
Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Honorable MP Vian Dakhil on receiving the 2016 Lantos Human Rights Prize. I was very appreciative of the Lantos Foundation for inviting me to participate in today’s ceremony conferring the award. For decades, Congressman Tom Lantos championed human rights in the U.S. House of Representatives, and I was very privileged to have served alongside him. Today, the Commission and the Foundation that bear his name continue his vital work, fighting for human dignity for all people. MP Dakhil first captured the world’s attention in August 2014 as she pleaded with the Iraqi parliament to help her people, the Yazidi, besieged on Mount Sinjar. Since then, she has spent the last two and a half years rescuing girls and young women enslaved by the Islamic State, coordinating rescue missions into ISIS territory to bring girls and women out of bondage. Even as she continues to represent her people in the Iraqi parliament, she works tirelessly to support survivors and children orphaned by the genocide. In taking a stand for the Yazidi people, MP Dakhil has embodied the very definition of heroism. Her bravery and moral clarity make her as fitting a recipient of the 2016 Lantos Human Rights Prize as any I can think of. The Yazidi people have suffered a grave injustice at the hands of the Islamic State. ISIS has kidnapped and indoctrinated young boys into child soldiers. Thousands of men and women have been killed. Among the most savage of their crimes, the Islamic State has kidnapped thousands of Yazidi girls and women to sell on the market, creating a structured system of organized kidnapping, rape, and sexual slavery. The horrific nature of these crimes is beyond condemnation. Today, between 3,000–4,000 Yazidi women and girls are still held captive by ISIS, the ‘‘bleeding wound of Iraq,’’ as MP Dakhil describes. As we gather here, we must recognize that the international community, the United States included, has in large part failed to act. We continue to fail to exercise our moral leadership to bring aid to those in need, even as crimes against humanity occur on a daily basis. Just two weeks ago, the world observed International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Many of us have heard the affirmation of ‘‘never again’’ in relation to the Holocaust. When I think of the Yazidi people, and the Shabak, the Turkmen, Shias, Sunnis, Christians, the Rohinga, and the Darfuri, I ask myself if the true meaning of this proclamation is, in fact, losing its meaning. Each of us has a responsibility to fight against injustice no matter where we find it in the world. In Congress, I have introduced H.R. 379, the Justice for Yazidis Act, a proposal that would establish and fund vital programming for the Yazidi people and other religious minorities. My bill establishes a healthcare and psychosocial support program that places an emphasis on providing trauma therapy for children and survivors of sexual slavery, as well as a psychologist, physical therapist, and social worker training program to provide training to psychologists and social workers who speak Kurmanji or the Shengali dialect of Kurmanji. MP Dakhil already works tirelessly to support these types of programs. The United States can, and should, do more to assist in these noble and just efforts. Congressman Lantos used to say that; ‘‘the veneer of civilization is paper thin. We are its guardians. We can never rest.’’ I am proud to honor MP Dakhil as one of the world’s guardians. 
PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RELATING TO TEACHER PREPARATION ISSUES 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 58, the Congressional Review Act (CRA) Resolution for Disapproval of the Rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to Teacher Preparation Issues, because the regulation Republicans seek to rescind will have the effect of reducing educational opportunities in student achievement, quality of instruction, college readiness and other important outcomes. Teaching is a very noble profession that shapes the character, caliber, and future of an individual and for many of our nation’s children, a teacher affects eternity; he or she can never tell where his influence stops. Teachers cannot however succeed in shaping the lives of our children if we as a society fail to equip them with the tools necessary to master and hone the craft they pass along to our youth. This joint resolution would nullify the Teacher Preparation Issues rule finalized by the Department of Education on October 31, 2016, tying the hands of any and all future administrations in improving the transparency and quality of teacher preparation programs until the Higher Education Act (HEA) is successfully reauthorized. The Teacher Preparation Issues rule established indicators that States must use to report on teacher preparation program performance, to help ensure that the quality of teacher preparation programs is judged on reliable and valid indicators of program performance. Section 205 of the HEA requires States and institutions of higher education (IHEs) annually to report on various characteristics of their teacher preparation programs, including an assessment of program performance. Under the rule that this menacing legislation would obliterate requirements in the collection and dissemination of more meaningful data on teacher preparation program quality. These reporting requirements exist in part to ensure that members of the public, prospective teachers and employers (districts and schools), and the States, IHEs, and programs themselves have accurate information on the quality of these teacher preparation programs. These requirements also provide an impetus to States and IHEs to make improvements where they are needed. The Department’s existing title II reporting system framework has not, however, ensured sufficient quality feedback to various stakeholders on program performance. A U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that some States are not assessing whether teacher preparation programs are lowperforming, as required by law, and so prospective teachers may have difficulty identifying lowperforming teacher preparation programs, possibly resulting in teachers who are not fully prepared to educate children. In addition, struggling teacher preparation programs may not receive the technical assistance they need and, like the teaching candidates themselves, school districts, and other stakeholders, will not be able to make informed decisions. The final regulations also link assessments of program performance under HEA title II to eligibility for the Federal TEACH Grant program. The TEACH Grant program, authorized by the HEA, provides grants to eligible IHEs, which, in turn, use the funds to provide grants of up to $4,000 annually to eligible teacher preparation candidates who agree to serve as fulltime teachers in highneed fields at lowincome schools for not less than four academic years within eight years after completing their courses of study. Thousands of novice teachers enter the profession every year and their students deserve to have wellprepared teachers. Current educational policy is committed to ensuring that the measures by which States judge the quality of teacher preparation programs reflect the true quality of the programs 
and provide information that facilitates program improvement and, by extension, improvement in student achievement. H.J. Res. 58 is just another step in Republicans’ plan to dismantle the oversight and enforcement authority of the Department of Education and undermine public education. H.J. Res. 58 flies in the face of Congressional intent, removing any sense of transparency related to teacher preparation program quality, and leaving these important equity provisions without checks and balances indefinitely. H.J. Res 58 would ensure that there are no serious attempts to improve the quality of teacher preparation programs, since the CRA prevents future Departments of Education from regulating on a similar issue. If unhappy with the final rule, the Trump Administration should use administrative tools at its disposal to amend and revise the regulation. Use of CRA is a political gimmick that harms students, teachers, and taxpayers. Republicans want blanket deregulation of federal education programs in an attempt to stall implementation of equityfocused provisions and allow states and districts the ultimate flexibility to ignore laws and federal requirements intended to protect disadvantaged students. The CRA has been used only once in Congressional history. Using it to block regulatory action to improve teacher preparation program quality is extreme and a gross abuse of power. When we fail our teachers, we rob our children of long fought for opportunities to expand their horizons in classrooms and achieve in life the hope we have vested in them for the future. I urge you to oppose this bill.
