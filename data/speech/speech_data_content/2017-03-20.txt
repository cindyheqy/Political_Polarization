Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, after 7 years of railing against the Affordable Care Act, a little less than 2 weeks ago we finally got an opportunity to see what the Republican repealandreplace plan actually looks like. President Trump described it on March 7, again, a little less than 2 weeks ago, as our wonderful new healthcare bill. The new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, solemnly promised that no one will be worse off financially as part of this bill known as the American Health Care Act. Well, Mr. Speaker, as President John Adams once said a long time ago, facts are stubborn things; and over the last 2 weeks, we have had an opportunity to see what the Congressional Budget Office says about the American Health Care Act. Again, this is the neutral body that advises the Congress and the Nation with budgetary analysis both in terms of taxes and spending and also in terms of healthcare coverage. What it has told us is that 24 million Americans will lose their health coverage between now and 2024. In fact, it will go up by 14 million just in the first couple of years under this bill, which, again, after 7 years, we never got a chance to see it, but now we are finally getting that opportunity. Mr. Speaker, sometimes it is a little sort of too much to talk about these large numbers and topline numbers. What I want to share with you and my colleagues and also anyone watching this speech is that the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is, again, one of the most respected healthcare, nonprofit, educational institutions in our country, has produced an interactive website which basically gives any American the opportunity to scroll across a map of America, find the county where you live, punch in what their income level and age is, and then compare the existing law with the American Health Care Act. Again, that website is kff.org/interactive/taxcredits. Again, kff.org. I had an opportunity to use that website for my district in eastern Connecticut, a district I proudly represent, the home of the UConn Women Huskies and the home of the Groton submarine base, the oldest submarine base in America. What it showed is that, for people living in New London County, in Windham County, in Tolland County, in Middlesex County, if you are 60 years old and you are making $50,000 a year, you lose $3,230—in terms of premium tax credits compared to existing law—in the proposal which, again, was finally unveiled 2 weeks ago. If you make only $30,000 a year and you are 60 years old, you lose $5,850, a 59 percent reduction in terms of your income assistance to buy health coverage. Again, the prior number was 45 percent. Unlike what Mr. Price said, this, in fact, is much worse off financially for people in those age groups and where they live. It is far worse off financially in terms of where they stand. In fact, it makes it impossible for people to afford health insurance. That is why the Congressional Budget Office, looking at that kind of data, has made the conclusion that, if we pass this bill—and the vote is scheduled on Thursday—we will see, again, millions of Americans who will basically be priced out of the opportunity to buy health insurance. And when you are 60 years old—as someone who is 63, I can tell you—that is not a good place to be in terms of your health status and the risk that you carry when you get older in life in terms of the need to be able to access healthcare coverage. Mr. Speaker, it is that reason why, when you look at what the stakeholders that deliver health care in America—the American Nurses Association, the American Hospital Association, the AARP, and, finally, the American Medical Association—who have looked at this bill over the last 2 weeks, they have universally pleaded with Congress to block this measure, to slow down the rush to judgment which is going to deprive people of one of the most elemental, basic needs that all of us share. We are not immortal. We are not immune to getting illness and disease. It 
is something that affects every single American. To pass a bill which will wreak that kind of havoc, again, is irresponsible and takes this country in the absolute wrong direction. So, again, I would plead with Members and I would ask anybody watching this speech, go to the Kaiser Foundation website, find where you live, think about your uncle or your children or people that you know in your neighborhood, and really plug in that data and information and think about what, in fact, we are being told is, in fact, a wonderful healthcare bill and something that won’t hurt people and won’t make them worse off financially. Again, the opposite is true. CBO is telling us this, the doctors are telling us this, the nurses are telling us this, the hospitals are telling us this, those who advocate for older Americans are telling us this. Again, it is not too late. This vote is coming up on Thursday. It is time to listen to the people who are closest to the system and stop this rush to harming millions of Americans. 
NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, in recognition of National Agriculture Day, I rise to honor and thank the men and women who feed our Nation. Agriculture is one of the most important sectors in our economy. It is cultivated and maintained by our Nation’s farmers who rise before the sun every day and work long hours 7 days a week so that Americans can have safe, quality food to feed their families. It is not an easy job, but it is certainly an important one. In order to fully honor and appreciate our farmers and their devotion to the agriculture industry, we must do more than recognize their hard work 1 day a year. We must also invest in and work to better the agriculture industry every day of the year. That is why, for as long as I serve in Congress, I will continue to meet with, work for, and advocate on behalf of our farmers. Happy National Agriculture Day, and a huge thankyou to every American farmer. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Jeff Amacher of Circle Pines, Minnesota, for more than 20 years of service with the Centennial Fire District. Fighting fires and protecting Minnesotans is not an easy job, but it is one that is absolutely crucial to our community and the safety of our citizens. It takes a special kind of person to rush into a burning building and to put themselves in harm’s way to save the life of another. I commend Jeff for exuding such bravery over the past 20 years. I not only would like to thank Jeff for his commitment to our community, but I want to congratulate him for being recognized for his brave work by the Circle Pines City Council. Jeff, we wish you a happy and peaceful retirement spent with your family and friends. After a life of service, you deserve it. RECOGNIZING U .S. BANCORP  
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate U.S. Bancorp on being recently named the World’s Most Admired Superregional Bank by Fortune Magazine. This is the seventh consecutive year they have received this honor, which is no small feat by any means. U.S. Bancorp has also been recognized by Fortune Magazine for ranking among the top ten companies spanning across all industries for upholding four of Fortune’s nine key characteristics of reputation. The characteristics that U.S. Bancorp has maintained include: quality of management, longterm investment value, use of corporate assets, and financial soundness. Minnesotans can be proud of a Minnesotabased company that ranks as one of the world’s best performers. This honor is undoubtedly due to the excellent work of the employees, as well as the extraordinary vision and leadership of those who run this fine company. Congratulations on your incredible accomplishment. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Thrivent Financial for this amazing organization’s work to help Minnesota families acquire a home. Thrivent Financial is a longtime partner of Habitat for Humanity. During the partnership, they have given more than $2 million in grants to build quality lowincome housing so that 24 families in our community could afford to buy a home. This year, Thrivent has given another $66,000, which will be used to build the 25th home, this time for a family right here in St. Cloud, Minnesota. As a result of their service to Minnesota families, Thrivent has been inducted into the Habitat for Humanity’s Business Partner Hall of Fame. I want to commend both Habitat for Humanity and Thrivent Financial on this excellent partnership, and thank them for their generous service to the residents of Minnesota. 
RECOGNIZING RAY YOUNG AND CHARLES ‘‘BUCK’’ VANDERSTEEN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two of my constituents, Ray Young of Wisner and Charles ‘‘Buck’’ Vandersteen of Alexandria, for their recent induction into the Louisiana Agriculture Hall of Distinction. Since growing up on his family farm, Ray Young has dedicated his life and career to farming. After earning a degree in agriculture from Louisiana Tech and a master’s in entomology from LSU, Ray went on to pioneer the stale seedbed conservation tillage system, known today as notill, used across the South to enhance crop production. In 1989, Ray presented to Congress an application to charter the Federal Land Bank of North Louisiana. He has served on the board of directors for the Federal Land Bank, as a board chairman of the Louisiana Land Bank, and as a leader of numerous State and Federal agricultural organizations. Ray and his family still farm cotton, soybeans, sweet potatoes, Irish potatoes, corn, vegetables, cattle, hay, wheat, and pine trees. He is a tremendous example of a Louisiana farmer making his life and a living off his land. His insight is always valuable to me when I am working on agricultural policy for our Nation. Buck Vandersteen has spent 34 years presiding over the 4,000plus members of the Louisiana Forestry Association, is a past president of the Southern Forest Heritage Museum and a past president of the National Council of Forestry executives. During that time, Buck has helped pass the Forest Productivity Program to get part of the State’s severance taxes distributed to forest landowners as cost share for replanting. It is recognized as one of the top programs in the Nation. He has been instrumental in advocating forestry education at the technical school and university levels so that we can have sustainable and productive working forests. Buck continues to serve the forest industry today, and I look forward to working with him in my role on the Working Forest Caucus on behalf of foresters across the country. Mr. Speaker, Louisiana is one of the top agricultural States in the Nation, and I am proud to serve on the Agriculture Committee here in Washington to represent our State’s farmers, foresters, and ranchers. But the real contributions to our State agricultural prowess can be traced back to folks like Ray Young and Buck Vandersteen, men who have spent their lives enhancing the industry that is so vital to Louisiana. Congratulations once again for being inducted into the Louisiana Agricultural Hall of Distinction. It is an honor that is well deserved. f 
AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. SMITH of Nebraska) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Eternal God, we thank You for giving us another day. Send Your spirit upon the Members of this people’s House to encourage them in their official tasks. As the Members approach the votes they are making in the days to come, may they be imbued with courage and leadership that looks to the health and vibrancy of our great Nation. Assure them that, in the fulfillment of their responsibilities, You provide the grace to enable them to be faithful in their duties and the wisdom to be conscious of their obligations, and fulfill them with integrity. May we be faithful stewards not only of Your creation, but also Your desire that all people would be free from whatever inhibits them to be fully alive. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
HONORING SHAWN T. ANDERSON (Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a saddened heart for my friend and comrade Sergeant Shawn T. Anderson, a veteran and highly decorated police officer, who was shot dead on Saturday evening as he attempted to arrest a rape suspect. Sergeant Anderson died as he lived: in honorable service to the people of his State, Louisiana, and his city, Baton Rouge, wearing the uniform of my comrade and friend Sheriff Sid Gautreaux of the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Office. Mr. Speaker, there are 435 Members of this esteemed body. We wear a small badge upon our lapel to acknowledge our service to the citizens of the country we love. One million of us across the country wear another badge, resembling this one, of various shapes and colors. We are the thin blue line. When we lose a brethren or sistren, we place a mourning band upon our badge. Over the course of the last decade, it has been difficult to remove my mourning badge because we wear them for 7 days, and I find myself never quite able to get the mourning band removed from the badge that I wear. My soul and my heart delivers unto my lips constant prayer for the family of my brother Sergeant Anderson, for his fellow deputies, his community, and, indeed, for our Nation. Our job begins with an oath. That oath is not an oath of allegiance to a sheriff or a chief or a marshal. It is an oath of allegiance to the institutional principles that our badges represent. Sergeant Anderson gave his last life’s blood in service to all of us. I thank the Speaker for allowing me to honor my fallen comrade. f 
RECOGNIZING MAJOR ERIKA PERRY (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on February 12, an historic change of command ceremony was held for the South Carolina National Guard 51st Military Police Battalion. Lexington High School math teacher Major Erika Perry became the first female commander of this battalion. Major Perry comes from a military family, with both her father and grandfather serving in the United States military. She was commissioned as a military police officer in 2001 and became a platoon leader in the 133rd Military Police Company in 2003, being deployed to Iraq. A recent article in Cola Daily, edited by Terry Ward, detailed: ‘‘During her years in the National Guard, Perry served in Iraq and Afghanistan and on the home front during times of crisis, like Hurricane Matthew. She appreciates the LHS administration’s support of her military career throughout her 19 years at the school.’’ Congratulations to the University of South Carolina men’s and women’s basketball teams on their victories last night, securing their place in the NCAA’s Sweet 16 as one of the few universities to have teams in both tournaments simultaneously. Go, Gamecocks. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. KIM JONGUN IS A TERRORIST (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, incorrigible little Kim and his minions are rattling their sabers once again. While U.S.South Korean exercises were underway, North Korea launched four landbased missiles. The missiles traveled over 600 miles. North Korean Army bases are purposely positioned to strike U.S. bases in Japan and South Korea. It is time to put an end to North Korea’s mischiefmaking. The United States’ hopeless appeasement policy with North Korea has not worked. In 2008, the administration removed the warmonger from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list with little Kim’s promise to stop their nuclear weapons program. Well, guess what? Kim Jong un lied. We must return North Korea to where it belongs: the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Senator CRUZ and I have filed legislation to do just that. Then real sanctions and blocking of financial transactions are necessary. The United States cannot underestimate the warprone lunacy of Kim Jongun. He needs a clear message from America to leave us alone and leave our allies alone. And that is just the way it is. 
NATIONAL AGRICULTURE WEEK (Mr. SMITH of Nebraska asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Agriculture Week and the farmers and ranchers who have made Nebraska’s Third District the top producing agriculture district in the country. One in four Nebraska jobs is tied to agriculture. The hard work and innovative practices of our producers have made our State a leader in feeding the world. For too long the heavy hand of the Federal Government has threatened agriculture’s future. Thankfully, we have seen important victories under the Trump administration, including the beginning of the end for the EPA’s dangerous waters of the U.S. rule, or WOTUS. Nebraska’s farmers and ranchers are committed stewards of our natural resources and take many steps to keep our water resources clean. President Trump ordered a reset on WOTUS, agreeing farmers and ranchers deserve better than to have Washington bureaucrats controlling the water puddles and irrigation ditches on their land. As founder and cochairman of the Modern Agriculture Caucus, I will continue to promote policies designed to get the government out of the way and 
open more markets around the world for Nebraska producers. 
b1532 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. CHENEY ) at 3 o’clock and 32 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 1029, the Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act of 2017. Once again, Madam Speaker, I stand before you to urge the passage of H.R. 1029. As we know, the Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for regulating the sale, use, and distribution of pesticides. To facilitate and expedite that pesticide approval process, pesticide manufacturers have long supplemented the EPA’s annual budget. This system allows the products to be reviewed in a timely manner, without sacrificing environmental and safety protections. It is truly a winwin for both manufacturers and consumers, and, as you heard Mr. DAVIS speak about, it is a clear example of government at its best. It is exactly why I enjoy working on the Committee on Agriculture. It is exactly why I enjoy working with people such as RODNEY  DAVIS. We have a bipartisan, effective, publicprivate legislative solution for a more predictable pesticide evaluation process that literally helps everybody. The Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act, H.R. 1029, is an exceptional piece of legislation not only because it is supported by a unique coalition of pesticide registrants, environmental groups, and agricultural labor representatives, but H.R. 1029 provides a more effective, predictable, and transparent pesticide evaluation process. It promotes shorter review periods for reducedrisk pesticides and enhances scientific and regulatory activities related to farmworker protection. My district on the central coast of California is not only bountiful in its agriculture, it is absolutely beautiful with its environment. Therefore, we on the central coast work hard to find that balance of being known as the salad bowl of the world and one of the most scenic places in the world. That is why our agriculture producers are the most thoughtful stewards of the land and recognize the need to protect the environment and the natural resources. This legislation facilitates that balance. This legislation provides a unique coalition building and encourages the agriculture industry to work with environmentalists. Thus, H.R. 1029 helps all of us who live and work in our community and, ultimately, our country. That is why I am absolutely honored to speak in this debate, humbled to share the floor with Representative DAVIS, and why I urge all my colleagues to support this bill. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Madam Speaker, this is exactly why we are here today in a bipartisan way. The gentleman from California (Mr. PANETTA ) said it right: this affects his industry, and it affects his home area. As he likes to say, it is the salad bowl of America. I have been there, and I have seen the crops they grow. The crops I grow are much different in central Illinois, the crops that are grown by the farmers that I am proud to represent, but they all have to have a successful PRIA reauthorization to be able to grow those foods that we here in America continue to feed the world with and that we see in our grocery stores and on our supermarket shelves. Madam Speaker, I want to say thank you because this bill is essential, as we in central Illinois go out and take care of things such as making sure the weeds don’t pop up in our yards. Every single small business that decides to put down product and pesticides to ensure that lawns in central Illinois continue to prosper as the spring and summer unfold, this is essential to their success. This is essential to our farmers, who are looking to get their fields ready to go plant, the stewards of the land, the best stewards of the land, as Congressman PANETTA said. It assures them that they are going to be able to get that seed into the ground and, with the hope and prayers of rain and moisture, that it is going to grow and that we are still going to have a marketplace for those products. The risk that our farmers take every single year, when they risk and leverage their family incomes in many cases, in hopes that a seed is going to grow and a plant is going to grow, and they are going to be able to sell that, they need the certainty that this bill will actually give them. That is why I am proud to be here as the author, proud to stand with my colleagues. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEYDAVIS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1029, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
100 YEARS OF WOMEN IN CONGRESS ACT Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 382) to amend the Department of Agriculture program for research and extension grants to increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to redesignate the program as the ‘‘Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 382 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘100 Years of Women in Congress Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) and the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT  ROCHESTER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am glad to stand here with the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT  ROCHESTER ), another one of our new colleagues on the House Committee on Agriculture, in support of H.R. 382, the 100 Years of Women in Congress Act. This legislation would honor a true pioneer of American politics by naming an important agricultural research program at the U.S. Department of Agriculture as the Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program. This competitive research grant program is designed to increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities from rural areas in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. I can think of no better person to identify with this important program than former Representative Rankin, who was the first woman to serve in this great institution, the United States House of Representatives, an achievement made even more significant by the fact that Ms. Rankin was elected to Congress several years prior to the ratification of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE , SPACE , AND TECHNOLOGY , Washington, DC, March 16, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL CONAWAY , Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : I am writing concerning H.R. 382, the ‘‘100 Years of Women in Congress Act,’’ which was introduced on January 9, 2017.

In order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees, or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding, and would request that you include a copy of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, LAMAR SMITH, Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE , Washington, DC, March 16, 2017. Hon. LAMAR S. S MITH, Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 382, the ‘‘100 Years of Women in Congress Act.’’ I agree that the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology has a valid jurisdictional claim to provisions in this legislation, and I am most appreciative of your decision not to request a referral in the interest of expediting consideration of the bill. I agree that by foregoing a sequential referral, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology is not waiving its jurisdiction. Further, I will include a copy of our exchange in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration. Sincerely, K. MICHAEL CONAWAY , Chairman. 
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my distinguished colleague from the State of New York (Ms. MENG), the sponsor of this legislation. b1545 Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I am so pleased to be here today to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women serving in Congress. I thank the Speaker for allowing this legislation to come to the floor. And I thank my good friend and former colleague, Secretary Zinke, for authoring this legislation with me. His support has been instrumental in ensuring the consideration of this bill, and I am deeply grateful to him. One hundred years ago, Jeannette Rankin was sworn in as a Member of the United States House of Representatives. She was the first woman elected to Congress, and was elected before passage of the 19th amendment which granted women the right to vote. Jeannette Rankin was a trailblazer her entire life. In 1902, she graduated from the University of Montana with a degree in biology. Afterward, she became active in the women’s suffrage movement, moving to New York City and assisting in the founding of the New York Women’s Suffrage Party and working for the National American Woman Suffrage Association. Rankin would eventually return to her home State of Montana, and was elected to office in the congressional election of 1916. Upon winning, she declared: ‘‘I may be the first woman Member of Congress, but I won’t be the last.’’ I am happy to say that she was right. In recognition of Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin’s many accomplishments, and in celebration of the centennial anniversary of her service in Congress, Secretary Zinke and I introduced the 100 Years of Women in Congress Act. Because Jeannette Rankin was a woman of science more than 100 years before our current push to have more women enter STEM fields, we felt it appropriate to rename the Department of Agriculture’s Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program after her. This program currently supports collaborative research projects at institutions of higher education, and seeks to increase the participation of women and minorities from rural areas in STEM fields. It will continue to do so in the future, but now it will also recognize the many contributions Jeannette Rankin made to American life. Madam Speaker, thank you again for allowing this legislation to the floor today, and thank you again to Secretary Zinke for partnering with me on it. I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 382, the 100 Years of Women in Congress Act. This bipartisan legislation will recognize the work that Jeannette Rankin, the first woman elected to Congress in 1916, accomplished fighting for women’s rights. It will rename the USDA’s Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program to the Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Grant Program. In our time, it is critical that we encourage more women to enter STEM fields across this country. In receiving a bachelor’s degree in biology before women even had the right to vote, she set an example for those who followed her to follow their passions for science and to achieve impactful leadership roles. As I travel through Delaware, one of the consistent messages that I hear from businesses and universities is the need for more engineers. We have a wealth of knowledge in our young girls who are demanding rigorous programs that put them in place for rewarding careers. These types of programs match the boundless enthusiasm with concrete steps towards achieving meaningful career goals that benefit our entire country. My sister, Thea, demonstrates the impact of successful STEM education from organizations like the Forum to Advance Minority Engineers—FAME— for schoolchildren in Delaware, to her attending an HBCU as an engineering major, and in her career spent serving our country as an engineer with the Army. My late husband Charles received undergraduate and graduate degrees in mechanical and aerospace engineering. Those degrees gave him the opportunity to travel the world as an engineer and give back to the energy sector. However, my family and I know that the answer doesn’t simply end with STEM. It is also about incorporating the arts into one’s education in the form of STEAM, where we can see the balance that a quality education provides. In my experiences, as the first woman elected to Congress from Delaware, I understand the challenges that come with trying to break through barriers. That is why this legislation and the impact of getting more young women to pursue STEM and STEAM careers is so deeply personal to me. 
As Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin said before taking her oath of office in 1917—nearly 4 years before women had even gained the right to vote through the 19th Amendment—as you heard before, she said: ‘‘I may be the first woman to be a Member of Congress, but I won’t be the last.’’ I am honored to serve as one of the more than 300 women to follow her lead. When we look to history to guide us in challenging moments, we will look to people like Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin, and I am confident she would be honored to have her name associated with this legislation and its aims. I thank the sponsors, and I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for this bipartisan work. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I would be remiss if I didn’t thank my colleague, who I was sworn in with in January of 2013 when she raised her right hand, as I did, on this floor to join this great institution, my colleague, GRACE MENG, for being the sponsor of this piece of legislation. I thank GRACE for her leadership, and also Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER , the first woman elected to serve in this institution from the State of Delaware. It is humbling and an honor for me to be able to stand here and help manage this piece of legislation. She should be very proud of what she is doing today. Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in support of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam Speaker, I urge all Members as well to support passage of H.R. 382, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEYDAVIS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 382. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
TSA ADMINISTRATOR MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1309) to streamline the office and term of the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1309 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Miss RICE) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask the House to support H.R. 1309, the TSA Administrator Modernization Act of 2017. TSA was created within the Department of Transportation in 2001 to address the security vulnerabilities that were exposed in the attacks of 9/11. At that time, the administrator was given a 5year term. However, when TSA and its functions transferred to the Department of Homeland Security a year later, the 5year term officially terminated by statute. Many of the issues and bureaucratic challenges that TSA faces today stem from a lack of consistent leadership at the top. Since I came to Congress in January 2015, TSA has had no less than five different individual administrators, both as appointees and as acting administrators. This is a staggering number in such a brief period of time. A revolving door of leadership has further exacerbated the numerous problems that plague this young agency. It is unacceptable that this has gone on for more than a decade. The American people deserve better, and that is why we are here today with this bill. This bill addresses these issues by reestablishing the administrator’s position, level, and 5year term, just as Congress originally intended when it created TSA in the wake of 9/11. Additionally, this bill updates Federal statute to reflect current policy by clarifying TSA’s proper role within the Department of Homeland Security. While this is only one step in addressing the many challenges at TSA, this legislation will provide for more consistent leadership at such a critical security agency. Ensuring the effectiveness of Federal agencies and the security of the American people is a bipartisan task, and one of which I am happy to be part of. I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for coming together to support this bill. This is exactly what the American people expect from us. I especially want to thank Chairman MCCAULand Ranking Member T HOMP SON for moving this bill swiftly through committee to the floor today. I also thank Congresswoman RICE, who is supporting this bill as well. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Miss RICE of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 1309, the TSA Administrator Modernization Act of 2017. When the Transportation Security Administration was created after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress intended for the administrator to serve a 5year term, like the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. However, since TSA moved from the Department of Transportation to the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, there has been a lack of clarity about the length of the administrator’s term. The measure before us today clarifies Congress’ expectation that TSA administrators serve for 5 years. In TSA’s short history, it has had six Senateconfirmed administrators. None has served more than 4 years. The last TSA administrator, Peter Neffenger, served just 2 years. Stability at the top is critically important as we push TSA to improve its performance and address ongoing challenges. For example, after recent covert testing carried out by the Department’s inspector general revealed alarming weaknesses in checkpoint screening operations, Administrator Neffenger focused TSA’s attention on addressing its detection rate failures, improving training, and reducing vulnerabilities associated with commercial aviation screening. At the same time, Administrator Neffenger worked with Congress to increase TSA staffing levels in response to long wait times at security checkpoints during the peak travel season last summer. Under his leadership, TSA successfully reduced wait times that had reached as long as 3 hours at some airplanes, without compromising the effectiveness of security measures. And while confronting those urgent shortterm challenges, Administrator Neffenger was also focused on addressing TSA’s longerterm challenges related to employee recruitment, retention, and morale. I regret, as I know my colleague, Mr. KATKO , does, that Administrator Neffenger did not have the opportunity to stay on and continue making progress within the administration. But I think we can all agree that TSA needs steady leadership in order to continue to evolve and fulfill its mission to protect the traveling public. We can help ensure that TSA will have that stability and sustained focus at the top by passing this bill today. I thank my colleague from New York, Representative KATKO , for introducing this bipartisan legislation, and I urge all of our colleagues to give it their full support. Madam Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 1309. This bill was unanimously approved by the Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month. Enacting H.R. 1309 will provide TSA with stable, sustained leadership the administration needs to chart a more consistent course and overcome its longstanding challenges. I would also like to commend my colleague, Mr. KATKO , who has been absolutely dogged in his support of TSA and ensuring that it has the support and the resources that it needs. I thank him for his work on this bill. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to recognize Congresswoman RICE’s comments. I thought they were excellent, and not just because they were nice for me. Her comments about Admiral Neffenger, in particular, were very poignant because he was doing a great job at TSA and he was only there 2 
years. What he did in 2 years really made a big difference in the trajectory of that agency. Much like other Federal agencies that are empowered to do very important things, like the FBI who has a longterm tenure, I think the same thing needs to be done here. Admiral Neffenger and people like him should be in control of the agency for extended periods of time because then, and only then, can we make the true changes that we are going to need. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1600 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1309. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
TRANSPARENCY IN TECHNOLOGICAL ACQUISITIONS ACT OF 2017 Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1353) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require certain additional information to be submitted to Congress regarding the strategic 5year technology investment plan of the Transportation Security Administration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1353 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Transparency in Technological Acquisitions Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Miss RICE) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1353, the Transparency in Technological Acquisitions Act of 2017. I commend the gentlewoman from New York (Miss RICE) for introducing this very important bill. Over the course of the last Congress, the Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee conducted rigorous oversight of TSA’s technology and equipment acquisition process, and they found it fraught with waste and inefficiencies. The committee also found that TSA fails to effectively communicate its procurement needs with the private sector. Our government relies upon private sector innovation to develop security technologies. However, that innovation comes with a price tag, and we cannot reasonably expect the private sector to spend millions of dollars in research and development of new emerging technologies without greater transparency and communication, both with the TSA and the Department of Homeland Security, as to exactly what their future needs and technology investments will be in the future. This bill will provide greater transparency into TSA’s acquisition plan, allowing for industry to better meet emerging needs, and enable better congressional oversight. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 1353, the Transparency in Technological Acquisitions Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, last Congress, I served as the ranking member of the Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee, and we held multiple hearings on TSA’s acquisition processes. In the course of conducting oversight and engaging with stakeholders, we learned that deficiencies in TSA’s planning for technology investments were causing serious issues for technology companies who produce products to meet the Agency’s needs. Under the Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act, TSA was required to develop a 5year technology investment plan. Stakeholders widely supported this strategy and welcomed the release of TSA’s first 5year plan in August of 2015, but that support eroded when the budget request for the same year did not align with the acquisition schedule in the 5year plan. The purpose of the plan was to give businesses the time and certainty they need to align their resources and planning to meet TSA’s technology needs. Security technology manufacturers looked at the plan and invested significant resources in the technology that TSA planned to acquire, but then they saw the budget request and found that TSA had shifted direction and no longer planned to procure that technology. That lost investment of time and resources hurts all technology manufacturers, but it can completely destroy small businesses and discourage small business owners from working with the Federal Government. My bill, H.R. 1353, will help solve this problem by requiring TSA to report to Congress on their 5year plan annually instead of biennially, and it will require TSA to notify Congress and all relevant stakeholders of any changes or updates to the plan. These commonsense steps will help ensure that there is ongoing engagement between TSA and industry stakeholders so that manufacturers of all sizes can continue to meet TSA’s technological needs and continue to innovate and address security vulnerabilities. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation. I want to thank Subcommittee Ranking Member BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN , Congressman KEATING , and Subcommittee Chairman JOHN KATKO for 
being original cosponsors of this bipartisan legislation. H.R. 1353 was unanimously approved by the full Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month. Enacting my bill will ensure that TSA’s technology objectives are more closely aligned with the industry’s stakeholders that produce technologies to help TSA meet those objectives. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair for his support, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I first want to congratulate my colleague, Miss RICE, for what I think is a great bill that is going to bring some accountability to TSA. Once again, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security I rise in support of H.R. 1353, the ‘‘Transparency in Technological Acquisitions Act.’’ This bipartisan bill requires the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to provide more frequent and detailed updates on its strategy to invest in security technology. The fiveyear investment plan includes information such as: 1. Transportation security risks and gaps that could be addressed by technology 2. Current and expected trends in domestic and international travel 3. Opportunities for publicprivate partnerships and collaboration with small and disadvantaged companies, other government agencies, university centers of excellence and national laboratories 4. Resources required to protect technology from cyber theft, diversion, sabotage or attack 5. Potential effects on commercial airline passengers. This bill would require the updates to be submitted annually and to include information on acquisitions made during the previous fiscal year. Requiring TSA to provide annual updates on the acquisition plan and to notify Congress and industry stakeholders about any changes to the plan which will provide muchneeded clarity, certainty, and transparency. In 2015, TSA screened more than 708 million passengers, which is more than 1.9 million per day. Of the 2,653 firearms discovered in carryon bags, 82.8 percent were loaded. Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport ranked 3rd among airports with the most firearms discovered in 2015. This last January, Esteban Santiago shot and killed five people inside Fort Lauderdale airport using a firearm stored in his luggage. Terrorism and cyberattacks are likely to remain a reality for the transportation industry for the foreseeable future. It is absolutely critical that we invest in minimizing transportation safety security risks to keep our citizens safe. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1353. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1353. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. f 
REDUCING DHS ACQUISITION COST GROWTH ACT Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1294) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide for congressional notification regarding major acquisition program breaches, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1294 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Reducing DHS Acquisition Cost Growth Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Miss RICE) each will control 20 minutes. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials in the RECORD on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1294, the Reducing DHS Acquisition Cost Growth Act. The Department of Homeland Security, DHS, spends over $7 billion, annually, on major acquisition programs. These programs secure our borders, protect our shores, safeguard our airports, and defend our cyber networks, among other critical missions. Unfortunately, the Government Accountability Office has reported that DHS acquisition management is on its high risk list, since 2003, of areas most susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. Recent watchdog reports have revealed alarming findings regarding DHS’ acquisition efforts. For example, in just 2016 alone, 8 out of 25 major acquisition programs experienced cost growth, schedule slips, or both. These program cost estimates increased by $1.7 billion, and their schedules slipped by an average of 11 months. Given the enormous threats that are facing our homeland, it is unacceptable to make our frontline operators wait for the tools that they need to secure the homeland. My bill will require muchneeded oversight of DHS’ acquisition programs to safeguard tax dollars and hold program managers accountable. When programs incur significant cost, schedule, or requirement problems, my bill requires that DHS leadership be informed. These programs will be required to put a remediation plan in place that corrects the problem and also analyzes the root causes of why the problems occurred in the first place. The Homeland Security Committee in Congress must also be informed of such significant problems. No longer will the people’s representatives in Congress be kept in the dark. These requirements are similar to those used in the Department of Defense and will help DHS better safeguard tax dollars and more effectively secure our homeland. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1294, the Reducing DHS Acquisition Cost Growth Act. Since the Department began its operations in 2002, it has spent tens of billions of dollars to procure goods, services, and supplies in support of DHS’ national security efforts. The agency’s major acquisitions investments, those that cost at least $300 million, represent a significant portion of such purchasing. The Department has worked to improve its acquisition programs in recent years, but DHS still struggles when it comes to major acquisitions. Take, for example, the SBInet—a southwest border infrastructure project—that ballooned in cost to about $1 billion before it was canceled in 2011, after GAO found that it was ineffective. More recently, there is the case of the Electronic Immigration System, an automated immigration benefits processing system. According to the Department’s inspector general, this U.S. citizenship immigration services program is now on course to be completed 4 years later than originally estimated and at a cost of $1 billion more than estimated. The importance and complexity of DHS’ mission demands effective oversight of the Department’s investments, particularly its major acquisitions. H.R. 1294 seeks to ensure greater congressional oversight of such acquisition programs by requiring the Department to report to Congress when cost, schedule, and performance requirements are not met. Additionally, when such requirements are not met, this bill requires DHS to provide Congress with an analysis explaining the root cause of the failures as well as a remediation plan to mitigate the problems. The Committee on Homeland Security unanimously approved this measure earlier this month, and similar language was approved by the House in October 2015 as a part of comprehensive DHS acquisition legislation. 
I commend my colleague from Florida for his work on this bill. Mr. Speaker, effective oversight of the Department’s acquisitions programs is essential to ensuring optimal program performance. Given DHS’ limited budgetary resources and the gravity of its mission, it is critically important that DHS get its major acquisitions right. Enacting this legislation would require a greater level of accountability from DHS and give Congress a greater level of oversight to intercede before programs go off the rails. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 1294, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, once again, I just urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1294. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. EMMER ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1294. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1615 QUADRENNIAL HOMELAND SECURITY REVIEW TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2017 Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1297) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make technical corrections to the requirement that the Secretary of Homeland Security submit quadrennial homeland security reviews, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1297 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSONCOLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1297, the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2017. Congress mandated through the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/ 11 Commission Act of 2007 that the Department of Homeland Security conduct a quadrennial Homeland Security review every 4 years. This review is intended to outline DHS’ vision and strategy to effectively implement its mission to protect the homeland. Given the threats that we face from terrorists, it is vital that DHS has a sound strategy to help keep the American public safe. Last year, the Government Accountability Office reported on opportunities for DHS to improve the QHSR process, and the GAO made four recommendations for executive action. This legislation leverages GAO’s findings to enhance the QHSR and make it better. Specifically, this legislation requires DHS to conduct a risk assessment to 
better inform the QHSR, and the bill also mandates that the DHS maintain a paper trail of communications related to the QHSR. This should allow Congress and watchdogs to conduct more effective oversight of DHS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for introducing this legislation, and I urge all Members to join me in supporting this commonsense legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 1297. The Department of Homeland Security’s mission is complex and diverse. Not only is DHS charged with preventing terrorism, but it is the lead Federal agency for immigration enforcement, emergency management, cybersecurity, and border, maritime, and transportation security. Given the breadth of DHS’ responsibilities, it is essential that its limited resources be aligned with its mission to meet the everchanging threat landscape. As such, the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, which DHS undertakes every 4 years, is a critical tool to ensure that the Department is positioned to effectively carry out its multifaceted mission. To date, DHS has issued two such reviews and is expected to release its third such review in 2018. My legislation seeks to make refinements to the law to address weaknesses identified by the Government Accountability Office in the prior reviews. Specifically, my bill seeks to ensure more robust consultation with Homeland Security stakeholders, including State and local governments and academic institutions. It also seeks to ensure that DHS undertakes and documents our risk analysis to inform its policy positions. GAO emphasized that documentation of the review process, including the risk analysis, is essential to ensuring the repeatability of the review process. Last Congress, this House unanimously approved this measure in July 2016; however, the Senate did not act on the bill. Last week the Committee on Homeland Security, on a bipartisan basis, voted to favorably report this measure to the House. My legislation is intended to ensure that the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review is a driving vision for the Department of Homeland Security. By enacting this legislation, Congress can guard against it becoming a paperwork exercise that fails to influence the Department’s policies, programs, and priorities. Given the criticalness of the DHS mission and the increasingly scarce availability of resources, it is essential that DHS produce a riskinformed review that takes into account the diverse views of its Homeland Security partners. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 1297, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Mrs. WATSON  COLEMAN on a very commonsensical bill here that is really going to help protect tax dollars and help keep our country safe. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 1297, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1297. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
DHS MULTIYEAR ACQUISITION STRATEGY ACT OF 2017 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1249) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require a multiyear acquisition strategy of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1249 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘DHS Multiyear Acquisition Strategy Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1249, the DHS Multiyear Acquisition Strategy Act of 2017. The Department of Homeland Security spends billions of taxpayer dollars annually on a variety of systems to secure our borders, protect our aviation system, safeguard our shores, and shield our cyberspace, among other critical missions. Unfortunately, watchdogs at the Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office of Inspector General have found longstanding problems with how DHS has managed these programs. DHS continues to be on GAO’s highrisk list for acquisition management, meaning these programs are susceptible to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. In addition, the Department has failed to have a strategic vision for its major purposes. The result has been wasted effort and taxpayer money gone, with little to show for it. Look at the TSA puffer machines from a few years ago as a past example. Without a comprehensive strategy, industry also does not have the needed information to best support DHS in making smart investments in executing its mission. My bill will require DHS to establish this muchneeded strategy to ensure taxpayer dollars are safeguarded and frontline operators receive the tools they need to successfully protect Americans. My bill will also ensure that DHS works collaboratively with the private sector to fully leverage their innovative solutions. As a former FBI agent, I know how important it is to get critical tools out to the field to help agents and officers secure our Nation. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1249, the DHS Multiyear Acquisition Strategy Act of 2017, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Safeguarding our country and the American people is the Department of Homeland Security’s most solemn responsibility. Today, Homeland Security threats are multidimensional and changing at an unprecedented pace. As such, it is critical that DHS’ acquisition programs be targeted to meet the demands of an everevolving threat environment. To ensure longterm strategic planning, H.R. 1249 directs DHS to develop a multiyear acquisition strategy as is currently required at the Transportation Security Administration. The bill is intended to foster a more strategic approach to how DHS executes and manages procurement. Specifically, it directs DHS, in consultation with industry stakeholders and academia, to develop a prioritized list of major acquisitions together with information on the expected security and economic benefits of these programs. To guard against wasteful spending on redundant programs, it also directs DHS to work towards developing a DHSwide inventory of investments and real property. Once DHS has such an inventory, I believe it will find areas for greater efficiency and be able to redirect limited Homeland Security resources to vital programs. One of the critical features of the strategy is the requirement that DHS have a plan to address funding gaps that may exist in major acquisition programs. Given that the Trump administration’s 2018 budget prioritizes funding the border wall that the President promised during the campaign and amplifying immigration enforcement, there is a real concern that important programs that are desperately needed within DHS will get short shrift. H.R. 1249 was approved unanimously by the Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month, and similar legislation was approved by a voice vote by the House in October of 2015. Mr. Speaker, the establishment of the Departmentwide acquisition strategy, as H.R. 1249 requires, has the potential of helping the Department achieve economies of scale that result in cost savings and better use of limited Homeland Security resources. I am particularly pleased that the legislation directs the Department to assess ways it can better test and acquire innovative technologies. Some of the most vexing Homeland Security challenges can only be fully addressed when DHS partners with innovators, particularly small businesses. I want to congratulate the gentleman, my colleague from Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would urge the support of H.R. 1249, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1249, and I want to thank my colleague from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSONCOLEMAN ) for her bipartisan leadership on a bill that will surely help keep our country safe. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1249, the DHS Multiyear Acquisition Strategy Act of 2017. I thank Representative FITZPATRICK for his leadership in championing this important legislation. I also want to commend the other Committee Members, especially the freshmen, on their key bipartisan legislation being considered today. We are in dangerous times and our homeland faces significant threats. The tools we provide our frontline personnel securing our borders, protecting our airports, and defending our cyber networks need to be delivered on time and properly designed to meet their needs. Far too often, DHS has mismanaged major acquisition programs and the result has been systems that are late, do less, and cost more to the taxpayer. Representative FITZPATRICK ’s bill, along with Representatives RUTHERFORD  and HIGGINS ’ bills, is critical in ensuring that DHS better manages these vital acquisition programs. These bills put important safeguards into place to guard against waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. As we move forward with our Committee’s work to reauthorize DHS for the first time ever, we will continue our focus on draining the waste from the Department to ensure our homeland is secured efficiently and effectively. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1249. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security I rise in support of H.R. 1249, the ‘‘DHS Multiyear Acquisition Strategy Act of 2017’’, which requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop a multiyear acquisition strategy. H.R. 1249 seeks to streamline the Department of Homeland Security’s acquisition process to promote strategic investment as well as cost savings for taxpayers. DHS would be required to provide Congress with the new strategy which needs to include: 1. A prioritized list of major acquisition programs 2. An inventory of investments and real estate assets 3. A plan to address funding gaps, prevent wasteful purchases, achieve efficiency, align prices for similar items, and use purchase timing and economies of scale 4. An identification of tests to support the acquisition of technology, leverage emerging trends and incorporate technology into DHS’s operating doctrine 5. An assessment of how DHS could encourage appropriate risktaking and minimize cost overruns, including when the department identifies needs, Develops cost assessments, Secures funding, Demonstrates technology maturity, and establishes its workforce 6. An assessment to improve collaboration with industry, small and disadvantaged businesses, intragovernment offices, university centers of excellence, certification organizations, and national laboratories Although the DHS has taken measures to improve acquisition management, DHS programs still cost taxpayers over $7 billion per year. In its 2017 list of ‘‘highrisk’’ areas, GAO reported DHS needed to improve the affordability of its major acquisition programs and address staffing shortfalls. DHS acquisition programs may continue to be at high risk for waste, fraud, and abuse. This bill will assist oversight committees in better preparing men and women on the frontlines securing our borders, protecting our airports, and defending our shores by making sure we know what works and what is needed before taxpayer dollars are spent. Efficient use of resources within the Department of Homeland Security is crucial to the safety of all Texans, and all Americans especially in regards to border security. The TexasMexico border makes up 1,254 miles of the 1,900milelong U.S.Mexico border. The more money wasted on unnecessary overhead costs, the less resources the Department has to fulfill its key mission of protecting our border and our homeland. By passing this bipartisan measure, we can ensure that the DHS operates in a more efficient manner and can better stay ahead of threats to our country. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1249. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1249, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1630 DHS ACQUISITION AUTHORITIES ACT OF 2017 Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1252) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide for certain acquisition authorities for the Under Secretary of Management of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1252 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘DHS Acquisition Authorities Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON  COLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana. 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1252, the Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Authorities Act of 2017. The Department of Homeland Security has been routinely criticized over the years by watchdogs at the Government Accountability Office and DHS Office of Inspector General for failing to responsibly manage its major acquisition programs. These programs, which secure our borders, safeguard our cyber networks, protect air travelers, defend our shores, among other critical missions, and cost taxpayers billions of dollars every year. Watchdogs have previously reported how DHS leadership has failed to hold programs accountable to its own acquisition policies. In some cases, these programs have spent billions of dollars of American treasure without having to show what they will ultimately cost, when they will be complete, and what benefits they will deliver to frontline operators. DHS’ Under Secretary for Management has not had the force of law to hold these programs accountable until now. My bill establishes a top cop in the Under Secretary for Management as Chief Acquisitions Officer to oversee these billiondollar programs. It requires thoughtful management of major acquisition programs based on private sector best practices. My bill requires strong accountability measures to oversee major acquisition programs so that these critical tools get into the hands of those defending our homeland on time and on budget. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE , SPACE , AND TEHCNOLOGY , Washington, DC, March 10, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : I am writing concerning H.R. 1252, the ‘‘DHS Acquisition Authorities Act of 2017,’’ which your Committee ordered reported on March 8, 2017. H.R. 1252 contains provisions within the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology’s Rule X jurisdiction. In order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees, or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding, and would request that you include a copy of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, LAMAR SMITH, Chairman. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, March 10, 2017. Hon. LAMAR SMITH, Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN SMITH: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 1252, the ‘‘DHS Acquisition Authorities Act of 2017.’’ I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will not seek a sequential referral on the bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral of this bill at this time, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support a request by the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology for conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman. 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 1252, the DHS Acquisition Authorities Act of 2017. The Department of Homeland Security has limited acquisition resources and must be effective stewards of taxpayer dollars. As such, DHS’ procurement practices must be sound, effective, and adhered to throughout the organization. Although DHS has come a long way since its inception in 2002, acquisition management remains a challenge for the Department. In fact, a 2015 assessment by the GAO of DHS’ largest acquisition programs determined that only 2 of the 22 reviewed programs were on track to meet their initial schedule and cost parameters. Responsibility for addressing weaknesses in acquisitions management and increasing effectiveness of DHS’ major acquisitions begins at the top, with the DHS leadership. To that end, H.R. 1252 codifies that acquisition decision authority rests with the Under Secretary for Management as the Department’s Chief Acquisition Officer. H.R. 1252 authorizes the Under Secretary for Management to mandate acquisition policies, establishes the Under Secretary as lead of the Department’s acquisition oversight body, and charges the Under Secretary with advising the Secretary regarding acquisition management activities. To ensure greater oversight of the Department’s procurement activities, H.R. 1252 also establishes acquisition management functions for DHS’ Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer, and the Program Accountability and Risk Management Office. This legislation is intended to clarify roles and responsibilities within DHS acquisition management activities and increase accountability of the Department’s procedures, particularly those classified as underperforming. H.R. 1252 was approved by the House in October 2015, and was approved unanimously by the Committee on Homeland Security just a few weeks ago. Given the complexity of the organization, it is incumbent upon the Department to tackle its diverse procurement challenges from the top down. H.R. 1252 codifies the acquisition management roles within the Department and supports enhanced accountability in management of DHS’ acquisitions. By passing this legislation, Congress can take another important step toward increasing efficiency and improving outcomes of DHS’ major acquisition programs. I join in congratulating the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS ) on the good work that he has done here. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 1252, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey. I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1252, as amended. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1252, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1830 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. WOMACK ) at 6 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m. 
with Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, and it has been reported that members of President Trump’s inner circle were in contact with senior Russian officials throughout the 2016 campaign; Whereas, General Michael Flynn, former national security adviser of President Trump, received almost $68,000 in fees and expenses from Russian entities in 2015, including by an entity recognized by U.S. intelligence agencies as an arm of the Russian Government; Whereas, FBI Director Comey stated in the Select Intelligence Committee hearing on the Russian interference with the November 2016 election that ‘‘there is no information to support those tweets,’’ relating to President’s Trump allegations that President Obama illegally wiretapped the Trump campaign; Whereas, distracting investigators with deadend leads and outrageous statements is a common tactic from those with a guilty conscience or in a deliberate effort to throw off investigators; Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in companies located in the United States and around the world; Whereas, according to The Washington Post, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., has hired a ‘‘director of diplomatic sales’’ to generate highpriced business among foreign leaders and diplomatic delegations; Whereas, the chairman on the Ways and Means Committee, Joint Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee have the authority to request the President’s tax returns under section 6103 of the tax code; Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103 authority in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers; Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to international affairs, tax reform, government contracts, or otherwise: Now, therefore, be it resolved, that the House of Representatives shall: One, immediately request the tax return information of Donald J. Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as provided under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and vote to report the information therein to the full House of Representatives; Two, support transparency in government and the longstanding tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates disclosing their tax returns. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under rule IX, a resolution offered from the floor by a Member other than the majority leader or the minority leader as a question of the privileges of the House has immediate precedence only at a time designated by the Chair within 2 legislative days after the resolution is properly noticed. Pending that designation, the form of the resolution noticed by the gentleman from Colorado will appear in the RECORD at this point. The Chair will not at this point determine whether the resolution constitutes a question of privilege. That determination will be made at the time designated for consideration of the resolution. 
Mr. POLIS. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, previous motions by Ms. ESHOO , Mr. P ASCRELL , and Mr. CROWLEY were ruled upon immediately. What is different about today’s resolution? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will inform the gentleman of the scheduling, as stated earlier, within the limits of rule IX. Mr. POLIS. Further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, does today’s hearing of the Select Committee on Intelligence provide additional relevant information to the Speaker in order to make this decision? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The leadership will give the gentleman timely notice of the scheduling of his resolution. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, one additional parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, does delaying consideration of this resolution mean that we won’t even vote on whether we can find out if the President has financial ties to a foreign entity for 2 more days? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Recognition for a parliamentary inquiry is within the discretion of the Chair. The gentleman is no longer recognized. The Chair is prepared to resume proceedings on votes postponed earlier today.

RECOGNIZING VIZCAYA, A SOUTH FLORIDA NATIONAL TREASURE (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Vizcaya, an accredited museum and national historic landmark, located in my congressional district and the legacy of visionary James Deering, who created this south Florida gem 100 years ago. With the help of Deering’s nieces, public officials, and private citizens, Vizcaya has been serving as a public resource for more than 60 years now. Today, it is at the origins of modern Miami’s interest in art, international culture and innovation, and welcomes over 275,000 guests each year. Vizcaya will restore several historic village buildings and the surrounding landscape, which will enable them to tell the full story of the estate, including the legacy of its workers, and to accommodate new programs for students and families, including those on urban farming. Vizcaya’s future will be rooted in its history, but directed toward the demands of 21st century Miami. For 100 years, Mr. Speaker, Vizcaya has been a place for people to gather, to learn, to engage in social activity, and to find inspiration. Its continued evolution will cement its role as Miami’s cultural hub. f 
INVEST IN THE HEALTH OF BOTH OUR PEOPLE AND OUR ECONOMY (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, the GOP’s American Health Care Act would turn back the clock on health care for the American people while driving States toward bankruptcy and devastating our economy. Under the Affordable Care Act, 1 million people in Illinois gained health insurance. Under this plan, over 1 million would lose it. Millions more across our country currently receiving coverage through their jobs would lose their health care as well. State and local budgets would face cuts in Federal aid, forcing a choice between cutting coverage and raising taxes. My home State of Illinois alone would lose $40 billion over the next decade. And this bill would wreak havoc on the American economy. The American Health Care Act would kill nearly 2 million jobs, while eliminating billions in healthcare funding that would otherwise support hospitals, community health services, and the development of new cures. We need to invest in the health of both our people and our economy. Unfortunately, this plan does neither. 
SPRING CREEK TROUT UNLIMITED CHAPTER (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Spring Creek Trout Unlimited Chapter located in Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District for receiving the National 2016 Gold Trout Award as the Nation’s most outstanding Trout Unlimited chapter. The Spring Creek Chapter’s conservation and angler science activities this year are world class, with more than 1.5 miles of riparian habitat planted, 13 instream structures built, water quality monitoring, redd count and angler surveys totaling more than 4,500 hours. These volunteer efforts are valued at more than $210,000. Beyond this outstanding conservation activity, the chapter reaches into the community, hosting events and activities. The Veterans Service Partnership program serves hundreds of veterans, with the power of healing and a sense of community. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to joining the members of the Spring Creek Trout Unlimited Chapter this Saturday for the 44th annual dinner to celebrate the chapter’s gold trout award. It is just 1 of 400 Trout Unlimited chapters across the country. This outstanding achievement shows the power, dedication, and teamwork from local Trout Unlimited members. f 
QUESTIONING MR. COMEY (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, in a methodical questioning of Mr. Comey today in the Intelligence Committee, let me recount for you and my colleagues the responses of Mr. Comey. Mr. Trump’s tweet, March 4, 2017: Terrible. Just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism. Mr. Comey said: No, it did not happen. March 4, 2017: Is it legal for a sitting President to be wiretapping a race for President prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A new low. Mr. Comey said: No, it did not happen. Mr. Comey, the FBI director. Again on March 4, 2017: I bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to election. Again, Mr. Comey said: No. And then again on March 4, 2017, Mr. Trump said: How low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad, or sick, guy. Mr. Comey, the FBI director, said: No. Definitively, Mr. Trump did not tell the truth. More investigations deliberatively to determine the status of the actions of the President of the United States accusing a former President of a criminal felony which did not happen. It did not happen. 
CALIFORNIA’S FIRST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT TOWNHALL MEETINGS (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this past Saturday, in my own First Congressional District of California, we had the first of our series of townhall meetings—this one in Nevada County at the Grass Valley fairgrounds. It was a good meeting. A bit raucous at times. There was disagreement, and there was some agreement as well. But I think it was a good dialogue to get started with the dialogue we need to have in northern California on the very important issues that we are working on here in Congress. 
There was agreement and disagreement on where we should go with the ACA treatment and where we should go with the funding of EPA. But what I am happiest about is that at least we were able to come together, 1,400 people and me and my staff, and have a dialogue that, again, at times was a little loud, a little raucous, but also people looking forward to being able to hear each other and listen to each other on the issues that are important as we go forward in this Congress. I commend people in Nevada County for reaching out and for helping us get started with our outreach that we are going to have in northern California. Upcoming next will be Butte County, Shasta County, and the farther reaches a little bit later. Mr. Speaker, this is a good dialogue I need to have. 
DEFENDING PUBLIC BROADCASTING (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend public broadcasting and honor the late Fred Rogers, whose birthday is today, March 20. Known fondly by millions simply as Mr. Rogers, his wonderful, beloved presence has reached millions of homes across our Nation captivating generations of children, and even adults. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a vital part of America, including cities, but small towns as well. NPR and PBS stations will be disproportionately impacted by President Trump’s proposed budget zeroing out public broadcasting. It is not right. President Trump’s travel bill to Mar aLago and the growing security that the American people are paying for over at his Trump Tower in New York, which reports show to already be in the tens of millions of dollars, will soon swamp the $200 million America dedicates to public broadcasting annually. We have been here before. In 1969, President Richard Nixon threatened to slash funding for PBS. Mr. Rogers went before the Senate to defend public broadcasting and its value to our children, especially for learning. I know I am not alone in wishing Mr. Rogers were with us once again to make the case for America’s children and public broadcasting. I hope President Trump and my colleagues will join me in supporting programming that boosts kids’ confidence and helps children enjoy learning and the wonder of math, science, and books. 
HONORING THE LATE ANTONIO CLAUDIO MARTINEZ (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to pay tribute to a community leader, a pioneer, and a humanitarian. Mr. Antonio C. Martinez was one of the first DominicanAmerican members of the New York State Bar. He was born in Santiago, Dominican Republic, in 1926, and immigrated to the United States with his mother through Ellis Island. He passed away on December 16, 1999, leaving behind a great legacy. Antonio attended Hunter College in Manhattan and graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1956. And when the call to duty came during World War II, Antonio selflessly enlisted in the U.S. Army and served honorably in the Pacific theater. Antonio dedicated his 43 years of legal career to immigration, assisting thousands of families through the process of legally entering the United States. His efforts and the cases he argued helped improve the law. I am privileged to speak from my heart about Antonio’s great work in the legal field, because my family and I were fortunate enough to have Antonio represent us when we needed to navigate the immigration system here in the United States. Antonio’s dedication to our legal system played an important role. I am proud to say that, as the first DominicanAmerican Congressman, my family and I are very proud of the work he did. Today, his professional legacy lives on. His son is here in the gallery. I am happy to recognize Antonio’s work of many years. f 
CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order hour. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands? There was no objection. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, for the next 60 minutes, it is with great honor that I rise to coanchor this CBC Special Order hour. For the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the American people on the issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus, to Congress, and to constituents who represent all Americans. At this time, Mr. Speaker, we would like to use this time to talk about the Affordable Care Act. What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose, Mr. Speaker? Such was President Trump’s constant refrain to the AfricanAmerican community when rallying for their support of his administration’s various policies. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to say that with critical elements of the American healthcare policy on the chopping block, AfricanAmericans have a lot to lose, possibly even their lives. b1930 There is as much at stake if President Trump and the Republicancontrolled Congress healthcare policies take shape in their current form. By illustration, I want to address the impact on lowincome families and individuals in the Virgin Islands who rely on Medicaid, and, presently, Medicaid is capped in the Virgin Islands. You can look at our territory as an example of what will happen when there is a cap on services, which could compromise a State or local government’s ability to administer those most in need. Since its inception, Medicaid has been an openended program that was intended to expand and contract with need, especially when States and localities face crippling economic downturns of both manmade and natural origins. Medicaid covers one in five Americans, and of those, the majority of enrollees are children and individuals with disabilities. Under the Affordable Care Act, widely known as ObamaCare, millions of African Americans finally gained access to healthcare coverage. In 2015, approximately 11.2 million African Americans became eligible for Medicaid through the expansion, health care that they previously did not receive and which would have cost this country much more if that earlywarning health care was not taken care of. President Trump and Republicans in Congress propose converting Medicaid from a shared payment program between States and Federal Government to an arrangement much like a block grant, where the Federal Government puts a cap on its payment assistance, creating a huge cost shift to the States. If you want to know what you have to lose if caps on Medicaid are enacted nationwide, look no further than my home, the Virgin Islands. It is a grim outlook. Federal caps on Medicaid programs in the Virgin Islands are set on a per enrollee basis. Unlike States in the mainland where Federal Medicaid spending is openended depending on the needs of the people, the Virgin Islands can only access Federal dollars up to an annual ceiling. Beyond that cap, the Virgin Islands’ government is responsible for the remaining costs. That means many Virgin Islanders who would qualify in other States and in other circumstances don’t get the healthcare coverage that they need now. Under the proposed fiscal arrangement, spending caps don’t take into account the cost of providing services or unpredictable changes in a community—such as the closure of a major employer or a natural disasters—forcing a cost obligation for critical support services onto the already strained budgets of the territory. 
As a result, States and local governments, increasingly, would have to make tough choices to either reduce services for recipients of Medicaid or restrict eligibility and enrollment of additional people who may need it. Those are the choices that Virgin Islanders must make. So the most vulnerable of our constituents—in this case, children—who need the safety net that Medicaid, by definition, is supposed to provide have that final option cut out from under them. When it comes to Medicaid coverage, the Virgin Islands struggles to provide lowincome families with Medicaid services for three major reasons: First, while the Affordable Care Act raised the territory’s Federal Medicaid assistance percentage up to 83 percent for newly eligible enrollees, this increase in Federal match funding did not apply to those previously enrolled, which the Federal Government only matched at 55 percent in the Virgin Islands, requiring that the remaining costs be covered by the Virgin Islands government, a government already strained to meet basic needs. The Virgin Islands and the smaller territories are not included in the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital, DSH, program, which would shoulder the unanticipated costs our hospitals must take on to provide adequate care for individuals who use hospitals for basic services since they have no insurance. Three, With no Affordable Care Act exchange and no Federal subsidies to create our own health exchange, many Virgin Islanders were only able to obtain coverage through the Medicaid expansion if they met the already strenuous requirements. That means that 30 percent of Virgin Islanders presently have no health insurance. This is what the rest of the States are going to have if this American Health Care Act, as it stands, is passed. A cap on Medicaid is a cap on medical services that our constituents just can’t do without; and in poor communities, it is going to be even more impactful. When ObamaCare provided increased funding to expand Medicaid, the island of Saint Croix was able to start a monthly homeless clinic at the Frederiksted Health Care Center about 15 months ago. That clinic has been able to serve many people, providing them with medical care, showers, meals, and transportation. On St. Thomas, with the East End health clinic, they were able to expand their services and increase dental services to people who were sorely in need of that. If this funding decreases or is lost altogether, it is highly unlikely that this initiative can be continued. Our current healthcare struggle is set to become a future hardship for mainland American States that provide Medicaid to a significant number of their population should the current proposals to cap Medicaid nationwide become law. How do we avoid this? Do not place a cap on Medicaid. Too many in the AfricanAmerican community have everything to lose if healthcare policy goes in this direction. At this time, I yield to my colleague, the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS ). Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, my good colleague and good friend. I thank her sincerely. Last summer when speaking to the AfricanAmerican community at a rally in Philadelphia, President Trump asked the question: What do you have to lose? Yes, he asked that question: What do you have to lose? President Trump, what don’t we have to lose? The programs the President wants to cut is the Community Development Block Grant, Meals on Wheels, and funding for Medicaid. There are programs that help combat poverty by providing the resources for better schools and food nutritional programs. These are the programs that help provide for the most vulnerable Americans who are fighting every day to try to get ahead. What do we have to lose? Look at what the Republicans are trying to do with the Affordable Care Act. They say they want to cut costs and cover more Americans, but their plan doesn’t do that. It does the opposite. Take, for example, how they want to change the core structure of Medicare. They want to shift the Medicare from an openended entitlement program to one with a limited lens that does not take into account individual needs on a casebycase basis. What do we have to lose? All of the investments we have made to try to stabilize our cities, the budget cuts will have a direct impact. Take, for example, Temple University Hospital in the heart of the Second Congressional District. Temple University Hospital stands to lose $45 million in funding. This translates into less jobs for our city and reduces the capacity of quality patient care. The President’s proposal takes our city backwards. It unravels all of our hard work to make our communities more stable. What do we have to lose? Everything that builds a brighter future for our neighborhoods, block by block. It is time step up, speak up, and speak out to hold our President accountable. President Trump, we have a lot to lose. We are going to make sure you hear our message and our voice. Ms. PLASKETT. Thank you so much to my distinguished colleague from Philadelphia (Mr. EVANS ) and for the information you have shared with us. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Chicago, Congresswoman ROBIN KELLY , who is also the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, so she can expound upon this question: What do we have to lose? Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you to my distinguished colleague from the Virgin Islands. It is an honor to be with you this evening, and thank you for your hard work and helping us to keep families healthy. Thank you also to CBC Chairman RICHMOND for organizing this important Special Order. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out for more than 975,000 residents of Illinois, including nearly 240,000 children that my Republican colleagues are plotting to strip of their health insurance. This bill, the socalled American Health Care Act, ends the guarantee of quality, affordable, and accessible health care. This bill puts politics before people. But it isn’t the politics that matters. Mrs. Johnson affording her cancer treatment matters. A 5yearold dying because her parents can’t afford a transplant matters. Keeping our neighbors healthy no matter what street they live on or what their ZIP Code is will keep us all healthy. So I must ask: What are my Republican colleagues thinking? This bill was introduced at night, but the cover of darkness cannot hide the fact that this bill will kill tens of thousands of Americans every year. The dark of night cannot hide the reality that, because of this bad bill, more Americans will die of cancer, nor can it conceal the fact that millions of older Americans will be punished by the Republican’s new ‘‘age tax.’’ Conversely, the Affordable Care Act protects older Americans from insurance companies who want to use their age as a reason to charge thousands and thousands more. While this bill from my Republican colleagues was written to empower insurance executives, the Affordable Care Act protects everyone. It includes unprecedented healthcare access safeguards for America’s elderly, people living with disabilities, children, and young adults. Meanwhile, the GOP’s American Health Care Act reduces consumer protections. The American people will be left with more expensive healthcare coverage plans, and 24 million will lose their healthcare insurance completely, 14 million next year. A disproportionate number of those losing insurance will come from AfricanAmerican, Latino, AsianAmerican, and Pacific Islander communities. They will be women and children or older Americans, especially those living on the edge. As chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, I am working to close the gap in healthcare disparities that is plaguing these communities. This bill will make these disparities even worse. And for the record, the ACA more than halved the uninsured rate in the AfricanAmerican community and halved the national uninsured rate. But the recent Congressional Budget Office report makes it clear that this will not continue in a positive way. In less than 10 years, 52 million Americans will be uninsured under the GPO’s 
plan. The majority of these will be our grandmothers, grandfathers, great aunts, and greatuncles. Under the Speaker’s plan, my State, Illinois, will have to cut Medicare eligibility. More than 53,000 constituents will lose their health care just because of this provision. The GOP also plans to defund Planned Parenthood, a decision that means 60,000 residents of Illinois will go without lifesaving cancer and STI screenings. The list of the not very good, very bad things from the Republican healthcare bill go on and on and on. It will make us sicker. It also raises the national debt, and it kills at least 1.2 million American jobs. And it stops us from reaching what should be our ultimate goal: the ability of every American to live a long, healthy life. Mr. Speaker, can we finally get serious and call this bill, your GOP healthcare bill, what it really is: the Trump don’t care bill. Well, the Congressional Black Caucus cares. The House Democrats—and hopefully some House Republicans— care, and they will care enough to do the right thing and will oppose this bill. Ms. PLASKETT. Thank you so much, Congresswoman KELLY , for that information that you are sharing and for the work of the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust and for the information that you are giving in the seminars and the groups, the different experiences that you have had throughout the country. I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ) so that she can tell us about some of the places that the Congressional Black Caucus Braintrust has had workshops or townhalls when sharing information with Americans. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Besides the District of Columbia, we have been to South Carolina. We have been to a couple of places in Los Angeles as well as Oakland to deal with the issue of AIDS. Also, of course, in my town of Chicago, we have had healthcare seminars; and, actually, we have had big health fairs so we can make sure that people get backtoschool checks, mental health checks, and AIDS checks. We gave food to people that might be in food deserts. So we really tried to be wellrounded and also tried to educate people. And going forward this week, we do plan to be on a call with ministers all across the United States so they know exactly what is going on and how they can help their constituents in this fight against this new healthcare bill. b1945 Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I know the work that the gentlewoman from Illinois has done in health disparities that African Americans face. We disproportionately are struck with hypertension, high blood pressure, and diabetes, which are some of the things that we are concerned about. Lapse in coverage under the Affordable Care Act will affect African Americans in a large way because then those will become preexisting conditions, which are not covered under this healthcare plan. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ). Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, actually, of the top 10 diseases African Americans die from, African Americans die more from 8 out of the top 10. So this new bill is not going to send us in a better direction, and we don’t want to keep those statistics. We want to do better, and we were doing better, especially around the area of cancer. We want to keep going in the positive direction, not the negative direction. So we don’t want to see this bill passed, and we want to educate as many people as possible and encourage them to call their Congressperson and Senator. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for the information and for being with us. I also thank Chairman RICHMOND for providing this opportunity for the Congressional Black Caucus to speak before all of you and let you know. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ), my distinguished co chair, who has some great information to share with us about what do we have to lose under the new Health Care Act that is being considered by the Republicans at this time. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands. And I always enjoy hearing from the gentlewoman from the Chicago area, and I appreciate everything that she is doing as well. It is interesting the President posed that question: What do you have to lose? What he was referencing to was the AfricanAmerican community. Instead of offering anything of substance, he just put out that very simple question. I have got to tell you that it is pretty evident what we have to lose now. It is not only a lot of the gains that were made under the Obama Administration, but something that is near and dear to all of us, and that is health care. I think about the district that I represent, and 40,000 people or more have actually been covered because of the Affordable Care Act. They will probably lose that insurance if TrumpCare were to become law. And if you represent lowincome families and workers out there, that is a scary prospect. It is already bad enough that the State of Texas made probably what is considered one of the biggest policy blunders in Texas State legislative history when they decided not to expand Medicaid, which left so many others statewide, including in the district I represent, again, off of the insurance rolls. What do you have to lose? God, there are so many ways and so many areas that I can sort of describe what you would have to lose. The first thing I think about is, in the Dallas/ Fort Worth area, if you lose your insurance, of course, that means that the burden is going to fall back on John Peter Smith Hospital, which is one of our county hospitals in the north Texas area, and Parkland Hospital in Dallas. So instead of people having insurance that they pay into, that they have where they can go and see a doctor, they will end up back in the county hospital rolls and, of course, that will end up costing the taxpayers more money. During President Trump’s first 50 days, the Republicans introduced this legislation that, again, will just decimate the progress that so many people around the country have seen under the Affordable Care Act. This Thursday, as we actually mark the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act, the House is set to vote on the Republicans’ healthcare replacement. Ironically, on a day that we should be celebrating the tremendous progress our country has made since this landmark law’s passage, we will be defending the merits in our continued battle to fight its repeal. So what does the Black community have to lose? Again, we pose that question. The Congressional Budget Office—and there is a Republican appointee that runs that office, by the way—says that 24 million people are going to lose their healthcare insurance. Of those 24 million who are set to be kicked off of their healthcare plan and sent out to nowhere, African Americans are going to be hit the hardest. The ACA boosted the AfricanAmerican insured rate from 79 percent to 88 percent, just slightly below the 91 percent national figure. Some of those gains stem from Medicaid expansion under the ACA, where nearly 15 million of the nearly 40 million African Americans gained coverage. That is what I was talking about a little bit earlier, Representative PLASKETT . In Texas, we did not get to benefit from that. That would have been a huge benefit to us. Again, it is really considered one of the biggest policy blunders in the country. As you see, Republican governors are actually afraid right now that the Medicaid expansion that has benefited their States that they are going to lose out on that because of this repeal that is going to take place. They are pushing back. They are saying this whole TrumpCare and RyanCare plan is a hot mess and that they absolutely want nothing to do with it. It is also important to remember, under the Republican plan, the decision to cut $880 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years will translate into millions of African Americans potentially losing health care. While these numbers are alarming, it is the human impact that cannot be lost on GOP colleagues. 
I have heard directly from constituents that I serve how the ACA has improved or saved their lives, and I would like to actually share some of those stories with you today. One of the constituents that I serve worked for the same company for 35 years but was forced to retire because of declining health before he was eligible for Medicare. He faces drug costs of over $500 per day and requires a lifesaving procedure four times a year that costs $14,000 per treatment. You can imagine what $14,000 per treatment would do, and that is four times a year. Overall, his medical costs per month is $15,000. With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, he had access to quality care that helped ease his financial burden. Under the Republican plan, this hardworking man, this taxpayer, this person that has worked hard, that worked for one company for 35 years—that used to mean so much in this country when people would give 35 years to one company and expected to be treated right—under the Republican plan, this hardworking man would pay thousands of dollars in outofpocket medical expenses for lifesaving care that would not be covered by this disastrous plan that we are actually going to have to take a vote on on Thursday. It is stories like that that I think are really sad and why we need to tap the brakes and see what we can do to help make the current healthcare plan that we have, the ACA, stronger and better, to help out people like this gentleman who are going to be left out in the cold. You have to really be wondering what our Republican colleagues are thinking, because it is not just the constituents that I represent. It is many of the constituents that they represent, too. I can tell you that out in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, while I do represent largely urban areas—Dallas, Fort Worth, Irving, Grand Prairie, Arlington—I know that there are a lot of people that live out in these rural areas, that live outside of Dallas and Fort Worth, that live outside of Dallas County and Tarrant County. They consider themselves conservatives, and I can tell you that they cannot afford $14,000 per treatment; but if the Republicans pass their plan, that is what they are going to be left with and they are not going to be able to afford it. They are not going to get the care that they need, and that is what they need to understand tonight and that is what the Republicans need to understand tonight. The only thing that they can guarantee individuals, like I just talked about, is that they are going to be paying a whole lot more for a lot less coverage. I think that is really a shame. Another constituent was forced to pay $100 per month for medically necessary birth control pills after her husband lost his job in 2010. Luckily, the Affordable Care Act provided access to health care, and now her birth control that she needs is covered in full. And that is important, too. We have actually seen teen pregnancy rates in this country drop all over the country, which is good. Because when people can afford to start a family when they are ready, when they are financially ready to start a family, those kids are more likely to do better in school. They are more likely to be in a stable household. They are more likely to get the education that they need to be able to achieve the things they want to achieve when they leave the house. So there are a lot of these initiatives around the country where we have really seen teen pregnancy rates drop 20, 30 percent or more. It has been great. I can tell you that in Dallas County, while the teen pregnancy rate is dropping all over the country, we have actually seen it rise at an alarming rate. So what does that tell me? That tells me that if you see the teen pregnancy rate going up and that you are going to kick all these people off their health care, that is going to be more of a strain on the social service system. Republicans used to pretend like they were for people to have an opportunity to get off the system. But once you take people’s birth control away and not give them the options that they need for family planning, you are increasing the social services. The Republican CBO report actually points that out, and they are still going ahead with this. So I think that that is really what is sad. I think overall what we want to get at tonight is that the Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for African Americans and AfricanAmerican families. The full repeal will snatch the safety net out from under the Black community. Despite the lies that our colleagues across the aisle and in the White House want to spread about the ACA, my colleagues and I will continue to defend it to the very end because it turns out that the Black community has a lot to lose under the Republican healthcare plan. I am so glad that so many of our colleagues came out tonight. I am glad that you are here helping lead this hour because we need to get the word out. We can stop something really devastating from happening here. The thing about it is that we really need to try to stop something devastating from happening on a bipartisan basis, such as people losing their health care, getting left out in the cold, being kicked off of their health insurance; trying to figure out, if they have a preexisting condition, how they are going to afford being pushed back into a highrisk pool. What is this going to do to so many Americans? We are here focusing on the AfricanAmerican community tonight with the Congressional Black Caucus, but what is this going to do to all Americans? It is going to hurt them. It is going to hurt their bottom line. It is going to hurt their families. It is going to leave them in financial disrepair. I think it is going to be a sad day for our country. Instead of trying to destroy something, we need to be trying to work together to try to strengthen the current system and make sure that all Americans have the opportunity to be covered. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I agree very much with everything that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ) has said. I thank him for the stories of individuals because it is individuals that the Affordable Care Act was meant to cover, not groups of people, but everyday Americans, children, disabled, our elderly. Some of the reports say that TrumpCare would be the largest transfer of wealth from working families to the rich in our Nation’s history; that the Republicans are handing $600 billion in tax breaks to rich and big corporations through this bill while taking money away from those Americans who have been able to have their healthcare needs taken care of in an affordable manner. You have families that are going to be paying more for less under TrumpCare. Deductibles and outof pocket costs are going to skyrocket, leaving sick people unable to afford the care that they need. Premiums will soar and quality coverage is going to be priced out of reach for many families. We also heard earlier about the middleaged American paying an age tax that is going to come from this, that older Americans are going to be forced to pay premiums five times higher than what others pay for healthcare coverage. I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS ), the distinguished freshman Congresswoman from the 10th District of Florida, so she can explain to us how TrumpCare and the new Health Care Act is going to affect her constituents and all Americans and, particularly, African Americans in this country. Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ), Mr. R ICHMOND , and all of the distinguished members of the Congressional Black Caucus for leading this very important and critical conversation and discussion this evening. President Trump said it couldn’t get any worse for the AfricanAmerican community. He asked the question: What did we have to lose by supporting him? b2000 Well, it is even clearer now that we have everything to lose, starting with health care. Marian Wright Edelman said: ‘‘The question is not whether we can afford to invest in every child, but it is whether we can afford not to.’’ Health care, we all know, is one of the most important investments we 
can make in our children. Nearly 12 million African Americans are insured through Medicaid. In Florida, 41 percent of children, in my home State of Florida are covered through Medicaid. This GOP healthcare plan guts Medicaid, cutting funding by $880 billion over the next 10 years. It also eliminates Medicaid expansion, which covers 1.5 million African Americans. So what do we have to lose? Families, children, will lose their health care. For those who do not lose health care, they will be forced to pay higher premiums. That, for some families, could mean the difference between a doctor’s visit and food on the table. Since the ACA was signed into law 7 years ago this Thursday, our community has seen its insured rate increase to the highest number in recent history. For a community that has long faced increased barriers to healthcare access and delayed doctor visits because of the cost, the ACA has meant the difference between life and death. There is no question, we can make the Affordable Care Act more affordable for all Americans, but this bill doesn’t do that. So what do we have to lose? President Trump, and to my GOP colleagues, I tell you the stakes could not be higher. Progress will be lost— progress that took many years to make, progress could be lost—by repealing the ACA. The most vulnerable of people, the people we really should be taking care of in a country that we say is the greatest country in the world—I do believe that to be true—people that we should be taking care of, including our children, will be hurt the hardest. Florida has the Nation’s highest enrollment number in the ACA, at 1.67 million signups for 2017. But not only does repeal hurt children, but, in my home State of Florida, it also hurts millions of seniors. A recent analysis from AARP shows that Florida will be ‘‘Ground Zero’’ for the Republicans’ health plan’s effects. They found that nearly a half a million Floridians between the ages of 50 and 64 would face higher premiums under the GOP plan, more than any other State; the people affected the most, lowincome seniors. So here is what is at risk in Florida’s 10th Congressional District. The district’s uninsured rate has gone from 22 percent to 15 percent since the ACA was implemented. 343,000 individuals in the district who now have health insurance that covers preventative services like cancer screenings and flu shots, without any copays, coinsurance or deductibles, stand to lose this access if the Republican Congress eliminates the ACA provisions requiring health insurance to cover important preventative services without costsharing. 392,000 individuals in the district with employersponsored health insurance are at risk of losing important consumer protections. 64,000 individuals in the district who have purchased highquality marketplace coverage now stand to lose their coverage if the Republican Congress dismantles the marketplaces. Over 60,000 individuals in the district who received financial assistance to purchase marketplace coverage in 2016 are now at risk of coverage becoming unaffordable if the Republican Congress eliminates the premium tax credits. So what do we have to lose? The evidence could not be clearer. Ms. PLASKETT. Congresswoman DEMINGS , in fact, you do have a lot to lose. We see how Florida, with its elders, its senior citizens, will really take a major hit if this law is passed. And our colleagues have been giving us examples all the time. I am always trying to let them know that the Virgin Islands stands as an example of what it will look like if the Affordable Care Act is repealed because the Virgin Islands doesn’t have the expansion. We were not put in the mandate for the exchange, and that has led to 30 percent of Virgin Islanders having absolutely no health insurance, which then means that our hospitals are strained because the hospitals have to pick up costs for individuals who are without health care. Listen, if your child is ill or sick, or you are dying, you are going to go to the hospital whether you can take care of it or not, whether you can pay the bill or not; and that has put a tremendous burden on our hospitals for them to meet the costs of those 30 percent of individuals living in the Virgin Islands who do not have health insurance, are not covered by either the government group insurance for the local government or by the Medicaid money that we utilized because we did not have the expansion. And even that is scheduled to leave after the fiscal year 2019, and we are going to have to make choices of removing people from Medicaid, of removing care from children, removing care from elderly and from individuals with disabilities. That is not a choice that Americans should have to make in this day and age, that individuals do not receive health care. I know, Congressman VEASEY , that you are hearing from people in your own district who are giving you these same stories: What is going to happen if I don’t have healthcare coverage? What is going to happen to my children if they are not able—they have asthma, they have juvenile diabetes, they have these issues, and I am not going to be able to take care of them because I am not going to have this insurance. Or the Medicaid is going to have to be pulled back in our State because we are going to have it capped; and our State is not a wealthy State and is not going to be able to make up the difference. I know that the gentleman has examples from other Members who have come and given statements for us to bring to the RECORD about what is going to happen. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. VEASEY. Absolutely, Representative PLASKETT . And one of our colleagues, who also happens to be my neighbor, EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON , you can easily make the argument that she knows something about health care, considering that she worked in the healthcare arena before she came to Congress. And not only did she work in the healthcare arena, she has a lot of people that were uninsured that live in her district that are now insured because of the Affordable Care Act. So, again, not only does she have that healthcare experience, she has been out in the community and has met with people for many years now on health care, even before she came to the Congress, when she was in the State Senate; so she has sat down and she has talked to people. She understands why it is important for people to have health care. She understands why it can be financially hard on people when they are hit by a catastrophic illness. She gave a speech on the House floor—or she has a speech that she is going to submit—where she talks about the fact that the district that she represents, the uninsured rate dropped 27.3, all the way down to 20.8 percent; and that was a huge benefit for the constituents that she serves on a daily basis. I mentioned Parkland Hospital a little bit earlier. Parkland Hospital is a Dallas County public hospital. Parkland Hospital provided $1 billion in uncompensated care in 2015—$1 billion. And if this RyanCareTrumpCare bill were to become law, you can imagine what a large system like Parkland, that already provides so much in uncompensated care, what they are going to be hit with. It is going to be absolutely devastating. I already talked about the fact also that Texas—and Representative JOHNSONmentions Medicaid in her letter. I have already talked about the fact that Texas made a big public policy blunder and decided not to take the money that the Federal Government was going to give them to help expand Medicaid coverage. They just prefer to just leave all those people uninsured. So now one of the things that will happen under this GOP bill that the Congresswoman points out is that the money will be sent to people in a block grant; and you can imagine the shortfalls that that would create, particularly in a large State like Texas, because there are going to be shortcomings. So hospital systems like Parkland, like John Peter Smith, they are really going to be hit with a hammer were this ever to pass and become law just because they are already being pushed so much. Again, what just doesn’t make any sense is that the Republicans so prided themselves for so many years about being the party that was about selfempowerment and helping people out, so 
now they want to kick people off of their insurance and leave them out in the cold and have them start going back to Parkland, start going back to John Peter Smith because they are not going to be able to afford their insurance anymore under this. It doesn’t make any sense. Ms. PLASKETT. From our experience in the Virgin Islands, that is what you do not want to happen. People talk about: Who is on Medicaid? Who are these types of individuals? Why don’t they get jobs? I mean, in the Virgin Islands, when we had our largest employer, Hovensa, an oil refinery, close, of course, then our unemployment rate went up. And these are families in need, families who need the support. With a cap on Medicaid, we were only able to have 55 percent of individuals who would qualify for Medicaid with that cap, with that ceiling that was in place from the Federal Government. It means that a tremendous amount of children, homeless individuals, people, families that are out of work for a period of time, are not covered. That, then, creates this huge burden on a hospital for those families to be taken care of, for individual care and individual need. Particularly in the AfricanAmerican community, when you have things like diabetes, hypertension, all of these diseases which need constant monitoring and primary care physicians to take care of and to ensure that they do not become lifethreatening, and come to a place where then they are coming to the hospital, it is in the millions of dollars that you are going to need support and care for the servicing of individuals with these diseases. So I know that we are pushing that there be an expansion of Medicaid, that the cap not be put on Medicaid services, not because we want to coddle people who are poor, but because we know it is necessary. And the cost of not taking care of them on the front end of health care, with Medicaid, is an astronomical cost on the back end when they have diseases that have just gone out of control because they have not been able to go to primary care physicians and get the health care that they need. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. VEASEY. All of those are absolutely good points, and I was talking about the uncompensated costs there for public hospitals. The one thing that I did not mention—and everybody knows this—is that if you don’t have insurance and you do find yourself having to depend on the county hospital system or the public hospital system in your area, and those lines get longer and longer, which is what would happen if this bill were repealed—people have to remember that if someone is having an emergency and they know that the lines at the county hospital are just out of control and long, they are going to go to the private hospital. b2015 They are going to go to the nonprofit hospital like in Dallas County that could be Baylor, that could be Huguley, and those hospitals are going to take on uncompensated costs. That is what is going to end up happening. They can’t get a regular appointment there without insurance, but if they go to the hospital emergency room, they can’t be turned away. Not only is it going to be a burden on our county hospital system, it is going to be a burden on our nonpublic providers as well. Again, one thing to remember is that, before the Affordable Care Act, we had over 1 million people in Dallas Fort Worth that did not have insurance. Just in the congressional district, alone, that I represent, I have the largest uninsured rate out of any congressional district in the entire country. That surprises a lot of people just because of the growth and the opportunities that the DallasFort Worth area have been blessed with. But I actually have the largest uninsured rate out of any congressional Member in the country. So when you think about the district that I represent and then you expand that across the DallasFort Worth metroplex, you are talking about 1 million people in a very prosperous area that still find themselves without insurance. That is scary. I mentioned a little bit earlier the district I represent, the uninsured rate has gone from 37.9 percent to 31.4 percent since ACA was implemented; 2,003 individuals in the district now have health insurance that covers preventive services like cancer screenings and flu shots. When you start talking about kidney dialysis, for instance, I visited a kidney dialysis center in Dallas County shortly after I was first sworn in. I was taking a tour of the kidney dialysis center, and I asked the doctor who was in charge of the center, I said: Wow, there are a lot of younger people in here. About 60 percent of the patients were African American. About 40 percent were Hispanic. There was one White patient that was in there. The lady said: It doesn’t matter where you go. If you go to visit any of our clinics or any of our kidney dialysis centers, this is what a typical day looks like. I asked her: Is it hereditary? What is going on? I don’t understand what the problem is here. She said: No. A lot of it is because they weren’t receiving the care that they needed. The sad part about that, she went on to explain to me, is sometimes it can be a person who has high blood pressure issues, and if they had just gotten those high blood pressure issues addressed, it could have been the difference between them taking some high blood pressure medicine instead of them basically having to give up their careers and go and sit in a chair to receive dialysis treatment 3, 4 days a week, 2 to 3 hours each time. That is sad. She also talked about diabetes and how some people have diabetes, and they don’t get that diabetes treated in time. Maybe they didn’t even know they had diabetes. Again, type 2 diabetes is something very treatable. You can imagine the difference between treating somebody, giving them a prescription to treat their type 2 diabetes or their high blood pressure versus your earning capacity being greatly diminished by you having to go sit in a chair 2, 3, or more times 3 or 4 days a week versus if they had just been able to go see a primary care physician. That is the type of thing that the Affordable Care Act is doing, giving people the opportunity to go and get those things treated before they become more costly to the system. That is something that is being missed. The other thing that I think scares everybody—and it doesn’t matter if you, again, live in my district or you live in the one of many districts in the DallasFort Worth metroplex, when you start talking about people who have preexisting conditions and you start talking about the fact that people are going to lose consumer protections that have been put in place under the Affordable Care Act and that they are going to see those consumer protections killed—like the prohibition on annual and lifetime limits, protection against unfair policy rescissions and coverage of preexisting conditions— again, if you see the ACA repealed, it is people like that who, for the first time, didn’t have to worry about those limits, and they are going to see that snatched away from them. That is just really one of the tragedies. Mr. Speaker, 27,000 people in the district that I represent, again, received financial assistance to purchase marketplace coverage in 2016. Now they are going to risk being uninsured again, and the insurance is going to be unaffordable under the Republican plan. There are just so many stories like that. One of the things that I didn’t point out about some of the people that are going to lose some of these consumer protections is that some of those people have worked really hard on their jobs, they are still working on their jobs, and they are going to be hit with those lifetime limits. It is going to be completely unfair to them while they are out there working hard every day. It was something they didn’t have to worry about before, or at least when the ACA was put in place. If the ACA is repealed, they are going to be subject to that, too. I think the narrative that has been put out there by the Republicans is that, no, it is just people that are taking advantage of the system. But understand, there are people that fall into these categories that we are talking about right now that get up and they 
go and work hard every day—every single day—and they have health insurance on their jobs, and they are going to be greatly impacted by this. Speaking of people who go and work hard on their job every day, one of the things that I know that a lot of Democrats would like to see put in place— and even some Republicans have said they would like to see put in place—is they want to see the Cadillac tax repealed. That is not happening under this Republican plan. That is completely out of it. So, again, there are a lot of problems with this and a lot of unfairness about this, about the people that are going to be harmed and affected. I hope that we can work in a bipartisan manner to really stop this from happening. And again, like we are here talking about tonight, the AfricanAmerican community, in particular, will really be hit very, very hard. Ms. PLASKETT. I thank the gentleman for all of the examples that he has given, realworld, realpeople examples. I think it is important that all of us, as Members of Congress, really take to heart the words that we are hearing from Americans that are going to be affected by this. Particularly in the AfricanAmerican community, this is going to have a devastating affect on them to have this Affordable Care Act be repealed and this replacement. It does not take into account the lives that people are really living. This is really a tax break bill. That is what this boils down to in many respects, because the individuals who are going to be displaced from this are those individuals who are the poor. I just want to thank Congressman VEASEY for the time that he has given us this evening and all of our colleagues who are here and spoke about the Affordable Care Act and what the AfricanAmerican community and what many Americans have to lose from this bill. At this time, I conclude this CBC Special Order hour. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the American Health Care Act. As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, I would like to answer President Trump’s repeated question to the black community; ‘‘what do we have to lose?’’ Our healthcare, Mr. President. The Affordable Care Act has been working. The Affordable Care Act brought my district’s uninsured rate from 27.3 percent down to 20.8 percent, and insured 265,600 individuals who didn’t have health insurance before. While the main safety net provider in my district, Parkland Hospital, provided $1 billion in uncompensated care in 2015, Parkland and the other safety net providers faces severe financial burdens in the House GOP proposal. One of my main concerns with this bill is that it punishes people who get their coverage through Medicaid by capping and slashing the program. With 70 million Americans and 5.2 million Texans who currently rely on Medicaid, per capita caps on the program would not meet the needs of the population and people would suffer. Under the Republican proposal, millions of Americans will lose their coverage and families will pay more for fewer protections. To put this into exact numbers, according to a Congressional Budget Office report, 24 million people would lose coverage by 2026, and 7 million people would lose employerbased coverage. This bill includes an $880 billion cut to Medicaid, then cuts and caps the program so that it cannot expand and contract as needed. Medicaid covers 1 in 5 Americans and in 2015, Medicaid covered 11.2 million African Americans. This is a 25 percent cut to the program and it is harmful and unsustainable. This piece of legislation forces Americans to pay more and get less. The average subsidy under the American Health Care Act will likely be about 60 percent of the average subsidy under current law. Deductibles and outof pocket spending in the individual market will have to increase due to the elimination of requirements that insurance plans cover a certain value. Americans will pay more for their premiums, more for their care, more on outof pocket expenses and deductibles; all the while giving tax breaks to the wealthy and the tanning industry. I urge my colleagues to consider the harmful effects of this bill. Your constituents are asking you to work with Democrats to repair the Affordable Care Act. We are ready to work. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first let me thank Congressman VEASEY for his tireless work to protect healthcare for all people. Also to Congresswoman PLASKETT , I thank the gentlewoman for continuing to speak out, to organize us, and for her stellar representation of her district. Let me also thank Congressman RICHMOND , Chair of the CBC, for his steadfast leadership on so many issues. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago Republicans unveiled their dangerous plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act. A plan the CBO confirmed would rip healthcare away from 24 million Americans. This week—on the 7th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act—their terrible plan will make it to the House Floor. Mr. Speaker, one thing is clear: the proposal Republicans wrote in secret backrooms would be a disaster for struggling families, seniors, and people with disabilities. Their proposal would mean 24 million fewer people with health insurance and 2 million jobs lost. Their plan defunds Planned Parenthood and rations healthcare for lowincome Americans. It would make working people sicker, in order to provide a $600 billion tax giveaway for billionaires. We know who this plan will devastate the most: communities of color, especially African Americans. By ending Medicaid as we know it, at least 1.5 million lowincome African Americans could lose their coverage. And millions more would lose access to highquality healthcare with the elimination of the ACA’s marketplace. Mr. Speaker, this is outrageous. We know that African Americans already suffer from shocking health disparities, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. And sadly, these disparities are all too often fatal. Mr. Speaker, when we wrote the ACA, we worked hard to ensure that our healthcare bill would help end these disparities. I was Chair of the CBC at the time and addressing harmful health disparities—especially for African Americans—was at the top of our priorities in drafting the ACA. The final legislation was a huge step forward for underserved families—particularly communities of color. Through the exchanges and Medicaid expansion, millions of African Americans gained the insurance that they needed and they deserved, including those living with preexisting conditions. Take the issue of HIV/AIDS for example. Although they represent only 12% of the population, African Americans disproportionately account for 44% of new HIV cases and 40% of those living with HIV in the U.S. Before the ACA, many African Americans living with HIV didn’t have any insurance at all. Through the exchanges and Medicaid expansion, millions of African Americans gained the insurance that they needed and they deserved. Let me be clear: For people living with HIV in this country—repealing the ACA could mean a death sentence. Without the Affordable Care Act, people living with HIV are at risk of losing access to the medicine and doctors that keep them healthy. Clearly, health insurance is critical to keeping people healthy and reducing health disparities. Mr. Speaker, we know that the ACA works. It has provided healthcare for over 20 million Americans—7 8 million of whom are African American—since it was signed into law. And because of this bill, young people, working class people, and people of color now have highquality, affordable healthcare. But Republicans don’t seem to care. They are on a rampage to make America sick again—and we must stand in their way. Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans are making their voices heard in protests, in town halls and in the streets. And their message is simple: ‘‘Keep your hands off of our healthcare.’’ I’m standing with the millions of Americans who are in opposition to this disastrous healthcare bill. The fight to protect affordable healthcare is on. We will not rest until Republicans and Trump end their cruel campaign to kick American families off their healthcare. 
HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of the Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. I thank the Speaker for the recognition. Mr. Speaker, October of last year, October of 2016, Bill Clinton, speaking in front of a group of people in Michigan, said: 
So you have got this crazy system. There are all these people out there who are busting it sometimes 60 hours a week, and they wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It is the craziest thing in the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t often agree with former President Bill Clinton, but that quote pretty much sums up why we are here doing what we are doing this week with trying to fix the problems inherent in the Affordable Care Act. Now, sometimes people turning in and watching these hours must wonder how can it be we are talking about the same thing where one side says it is good and one side says it is not. Mr. Speaker, it may help to set some of the historical context. I would like to do that tonight. I would like to talk about the beginnings of what we now know as the Affordable Care Act. Some people refer to it as ObamaCare. This is a bill that was signed into law 7 years ago this month, but it didn’t just spring forth. There was a lot of work involved in bringing it forward and getting it heard and getting it voted on on the floor of this House. I was part of the Energy and Commerce Committee that summer, as I still am today. The Energy and Commerce Committee did hear what was then H.R. 3100, several hours of markup in the committee, several days of markup. Other committees marked it up, and H.R. 3100 was a 1,000page bill that left our committee. I didn’t vote for the bill. I didn’t think it was a good idea, but it did have Republican amendments at the end of that process. That bill then went to the Speaker’s Office—not to the Budget Committee, but to the Speaker’s Office. Speaker PELOSI put it together, and when it emerged, it was a 2,000page bill that really didn’t have much to do with the bill that was marked up in the committee. But, nevertheless, the bill came to the floor of this House; and in November of 2009, after a significant amount of debate, a significant amount of anxiety expressed on the Republican side and even some on the Democratic side, the bill was passed by a very slim majority. The bill went over to the Senate, and that was the end of that bill. What happened next was there were— it was not exactly a bill—several drafts of several ideas that people had over on the Senate side; and the Senate took up a bill that the House had previously passed, H.R. 3590 was the number of that bill, and the Senate debated and passed that bill on Christmas Eve of 2009. You may remember there was a snowstorm that was descending upon Washington, kind of a familiar story, a snowstorm that was coming to town. The Senators wanted to get home before the snowstorm hit, and they passed H.R. 3590. Remember, back in those days, the Democrats had a 60vote majority in the Senate. They were able to cut off debate and pass the bill on a partyline vote with 60 Democratic Senators voting in favor of that bill. Then something strange happened. The Democrats actually lost a Senate seat in a special election in the State of Massachusetts that they weren’t expecting to lose. As a consequence of losing that Senate seat, now, instead of a 60vote majority, they had a 59vote majority, so they actually could not cut off debate. It was not a filibuster proof majority. Harry Reid told NANCY PELOSI , who was then the Speaker of the House: Well, I have done everything I can do. You are just going to have to pass our bill as it is. I can’t make any changes to it. Speaker PELOSI wisely said—I am paraphrasing here because I don’t remember the exact quote—but I think she said: I haven’t got 100 votes for that thing over here in the House. I think she was right. But they worked on it, and President Obama worked on it, and 3 months later, in March of 2010, indeed, they did bring that vote up in the House, passed exactly what had passed in the Senate. As a consequence, since the Senate bill was actually an amendment to a House bill that didn’t have anything to do with health care in the first place, but since it was only an amendment to a House bill that had passed the House, so many as are in favor agree with the amendment to the Senate bill, the number being 218, that bill went down to the President for a signing ceremony that very same week. Thus was born the Affordable Care Act. Now, what has led us to the point where former President Bill Clinton would say that it is a crazy system? Well, there is a lot of discussion back and forth. Certainly, Republicans took the majority shortly after that bill was signed into law. I would submit that because that bill was signed into law, Republicans regained the majority in the House of Representatives in 2011 and since that time have had a number of votes either trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act or improve the Affordable Care Act. A number of those votes have, indeed, been bipartisan votes, that is, Democrats have voted with Republicans. b2030 I think the total count is there have been 47 Democratic votes to either repeal, replace, reform, or repair the Affordable Care Act. It really has been a bipartisan effort these past 7 years. We are where we are today because of the problems that exist in the bill. Despite the talk that we heard in the last hour, people are suffering under this. There is a gentleman back home in my district. I think he is a plumber by profession. He has previously been diagnosed with bladder cancer. He says, under his Affordable Care Act policy, he gets to go see his primary care doctor once a year. His primary care doctor says, Well, you need to go to a urologist to have your cystoscopy, but his deductible is so high, he doesn’t do it. He has got access to insurance, but he doesn’t really have access to the kind of care that he needs that could be lifesaving and could prevent him from having a much greater problem down the road. We can all bring our individual stories out, but the fact of the matter is, access to coverage is not the same thing as access to care. During the course of the campaign this last fall—and I remember this very specifically because November 1 was the day that the new rates came out— the open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act opened up on November 1, and people got a glimpse of what their marketplace rates were. As a consequence of those marketplace rates, people started to pay attention. There was still another week to go before election day, and people started to pay a significant amount of attention to what the rates were. It isn’t just the rates. It is the access. Onethird of U.S. counties have only one insurer willing to sell in marketplace in those counties. I think the number is either five or seven States that have entire States with only one insurance company. That is not really choice. That is not really access. That, in fact, is a monopoly. 2017 was a year marked by a sharp rise in premium increases across the country. Seven States saw premium increases of more than 50 percent. Texas was about 25 percent. Some States went up over 100 percent. The individual mandate, which was part and parcel of the Affordable Care Act, the most coercive Federal legislation passed since the income tax passed 100 years ago—the individual mandate is the reason that the Affordable Care Act has never achieved widespread popularity. But even with the individual mandate—that is, we are going to send the Internal Revenue Service out and make them make you buy health insurance—over 19 million taxpayers elected to pay the mandate penalty or claim a hardship exemption. There were 6.5 million individuals who paid the penalty and over 12.5 million people claimed a hardship exemption, according to the Internal Revenue Service’s own files. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that 10.5 million individuals enrolled in an exchange plan through the first half of 2016. More than twice that number chose to either exempt themselves through a hardship waiver or just simply pay the fine and walk away from the obligation to purchase insurance. I am firmly of the belief that the individual mandate has no place in a free society. The one central thesis of the 
Affordable Care Act that I long to see repealed is the repeal of the individual mandate. While we are at it, we might as well take care of the employer mandate. By the way, President Obama delayed the employer mandate for 2 full years, not by a House passed bill, but by administrative fiat. He simply decided, prior to the Fourth of July in 2013: You know what? The employer mandate is going to cause trouble in the next congressional election, so I will just suspend it. In a blog post put up by Valerie Jarrett on the evening of July 2, 2013, the employer mandate was simply suspended for a couple of years because it was felt to be too onerous and because of the effect that they feared it would have on the midterm elections in 2014. Time after time, the Obama administration took it upon themselves to delay or turn back a portion of their own law, and there were multiple times where there were votes taken on this floor. I think of the 1099, the paperwork that was going to be required in the businesstobusiness transactions; the 1099 forms that were required under ObamaCare that were repealed by this House in a bipartisan fashion because it did pass in the Senate, and the Senate was controlled by Democrats at the time. Also, the CLASS Act, a particularly onerous part of the community living access ostensibly to provide some help with longterm care, except it really didn’t. It was in an actuarial death spiral even before it was enacted. It was one of those things in the Affordable Care Act where you paid for 10 years of taxes and got 6 years of benefits. When they got finished collecting the taxes, it was decided they better do away with the benefit because, in fact, there was no benefit there at all. Time after time, in a bipartisan fashion, this House has taken action to restrict or remodel or repair or repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act. We are now coming up on a time where significant change is going to occur in the issuance of health care in this country. The change is going to be tough. We always knew it would be, but it is the right change. The Energy and Commerce Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, and the Budget Committee have put together legislation that we will be hearing up in the Rules Committee later this week; the American Health Care Act, which will come to the floor before the end of this week. Let me just make a prediction: it will pass the floor of this House. I see that I am joined by a colleague this evening. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ) to talk on this issue or any issue that may come to his mind. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding, my good friend, Representative BURGESS from Texas. We are very blessed to have Representative BURGESS ’ leadership on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee, as he chairs the Health Subcommittee and brings his years of experience. I want to thank him for his leadership and for holding this tonight. Mr. Speaker, every day, I hear stories from folks all across my district in the First Congressional District of Georgia, in southeast Georgia, who have been forced to choose. They have been forced to choose between paying their monthly insurance premium or buying other essentials for their families. I want to give you an example of someone who I am talking about—a real life example, someone who has experienced this. Consider the case of Bob Joiner. Bob Joiner is an independent adviser in south Georgia. His wife, Kim, is an audiologist who works in a small practice that does not provide healthcare benefits. Bob and Kim exercise regularly. They watch their nutrition. They are fortunate to have no health problems. They also have a 28yearold son, Wesley. In 2016, Bob’s monthly healthcare premium increased 134 percent, and his son’s healthcare insurance climbed to an astonishing 190 percent. In total, their 2016 annual premiums were $4,285 for their son Wesley, and for them it was $19,026. The Joiners should have been hopeful that in 2017 they could change their plan for something more affordable. But thanks to ObamaCare, that wasn’t the case. You see, what ObamaCare has done is to limit choices. In 2017, there was only one ObamaCarecompliant plan that was accessible to the Joiners on the healthcare.gov website. An additional policy featuring a higher deductible with lower premiums was available; however, the plan was not ObamaCare compliant, leaving the Joiners subjected to the penalty. Before ObamaCare, the Joiner family’s annual premium was $7,400. At the time, they had access to multiple providers and dozens of plan designs. Unfortunately, ObamaCare has brought chaos into the healthcare system. The Joiners are not alone. This is just one example of many throughout my district and throughout America of what ObamaCare has done. ObamaCare has done, essentially, three things. First of all, it has taken away choice. It has limited choices. Representative BURGESS mentioned the fact that a third of the counties in America right now only have one provider. Only one provider. That is not a choice. Five States only have one provider. That is not a choice. Sixteen counties in Tennessee have no provider. No one. That is not sustainable. We have a situation that faced us here in the majority party, the Republican Party. We had to decide: What are we going to do? Should we even touch health care or should we just leave it alone? We did the right thing. We said: We need to rescue the healthcare system here in America. We have got to act, and we have got to act now. ObamaCare is imploding. We know that. Premiums have gone up, on average this year, 25 percent. In seven States, they have gone up over 50 percent. It is simply not sustainable. It has decreased choices and increased cost. It has also caused much red tape and many obstacles between patients and their healthcare providers, between patients and physicians, between patients and pharmacists. That is not the way health care is supposed to be in America. I am a strong believer in health care. I am the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress. My professional career, like Representative BURGESS , has been dedicated to health care. I am just not going to sit around and watch the greatest healthcare system in the world be ruined. That is why we have passed out of three committees thus far the American Health Care Act. Representative BURGESS mentioned the fact that it has been through the Energy and Commerce Committee, it has been through the Ways and Means Committee, it has been through the Budget Committee. Now it will be on the floor this week. Thursday will be a historical day for our country. It will be a historical day for health care in America. What are we going to be offering? We are going to be offering a plan that increases choices, that increases accessibility, that cuts red tape, that removes barriers between patients and healthcare professionals, that empowers people. It empowers citizens to be able to make their own healthcare choices. Instead of having Washington, D.C., in their infinite wisdom, infinite knowledge, tell you what you need to have, you now will decide what you need to have, what is best for you, what is best for your family. That is what it is all about. That is one of the many reasons it is so good. This plan offers so many good things in it. Health savings accounts. To be able to put more into a health savings account, to be able to roll it over from year to year, to be able to increase the amount in there, and even pass it on to survivors. We utilize tax credits to make sure that, no, unlike ObamaCare, you are not penalized for not having insurance, but instead, you are rewarded for having insurance. That is what we are going to do. Of all the bad things that I think ObamaCare has done to the healthcare system in America, first of all, it has taken the free market out of health care. No more competition, as we noted earlier. But the second thing has been this Medicaid expansion. That really is something that I take offense to. Medicaid is a great program. It is a program that is necessary. It is a safety net program. It is intended to take care of the aged, the blind, the disabled, children and mothers. It was 
never intended to be for ablebodied adults. This is not what a safety net program is about. Under ObamaCare, I hear the other party say: Well, we have added 20 million people onto the insurance roles. Well, let’s look at that. 14.5 million of those people were added on to Medicaid expansion. We shouldn’t be calling this ObamaCare. We should be calling it ObamaCaid. Ablebodied adults added on to a safety net program. We are revising Medicaid. We are reforming Medicaid. b2045 Medicaid is going to be even better for those people who need it. Instead of diluting that program, we are going to make sure that those people who truly need it—the aged, the blind, the disabled, children, mothers—have more access to it, as they should. We promised three things among many things, but we promised, hey, we are going to keep a couple of things in here. We are going to make sure that parents can continue to have their children up to age 26 on their insurance. We promised that we were going to make sure that preexisting conditions were going to be included and that you would not be kicked off of your health insurance. We promised that we were going to have a stable transition. We are doing just that. We are delivering on those promises. We are making sure—I often get asked: What about that 100 to 138 percent of the Federal poverty level? What are you doing for them? Well, we came up with a refundable tax credit that is actually going to pay their insurance. That will go directly to pay their insurance. The American Health Care Act delivers on what we promised. What we promised is that we would have more choices. What we promised is that we would have more accessibility. What we promised is that we would empower patients. We are doing that. We are empowering people. We are rescuing health care in America. I intend to vote for this plan Thursday night, and I am going to be very proud to vote for it. We are going to rescue the healthcare system that I practiced in for over 30 years. I have seen how competition works in the healthcare system. I practiced in it. I have competed in it. I have seen how it lowers costs, and it will lower costs. People now will be empowered to have the ability to choose their own insurance instead of being mandated from Washington, D.C., what kind of insurance they should have. I thank leadership for what they have done to pull this together. I thank the President. The President is behind this. President Trump made it one of his campaign promises: We are going to repeal and we are going to replace ObamaCare. You know, it amazes me the media seems to—I get asked quite often: Can you believe he is doing this? Can you believe he is doing that? I just think: Didn’t he tell you he was going to do this? Didn’t he tell you he was going to do that? I think they are just amazed that we actually have somebody in the White House who is delivering on promises that he made, and he is doing just that. This is a historical week in Congress. Thursday will be a historical day. We are rescuing health care. I am going to be proud to vote for this bill. Again, I thank leadership. I thank the White House. I thank Representative BURGESS, who has been a great leader through all this and has had a big part in this. I thank him for his part in this as well. Mr. BURGESS. Well, as the gentleman knows, he and I spent—what was it—27
1⁄2hours in a committee markup 2 weeks ago getting us to this point. So the gentleman from Texas thanks the gentleman from Georgia for his part and his participation. That was a very long markup, but he stayed attentive and asked good questions and offered good insights all the way to the end. We were very fortunate to have him on the committee. I have been on the committee a few more years, but it was certainly one of the nights on that committee that I will long remember. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Again, I thank the gentleman from Texas for leading this Special Order here tonight, and I thank everyone who has been involved in this. Mr. BURGESS. Will the gentleman maintain his position for just a moment so perhaps we can engage in a brief colloquy? Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Absolutely. Mr. BURGESS. Of course, the gentleman was not here in 2009–2010 when this thing came down the pike, but you may remember the townhall meetings from that summer, that August of 2009, and they were pretty intense. We hear a lot about townhall meetings today, but I promise you they were every bit, if not more so, intense during August of 2009. When I look back on that, Mr. CARTER, what I remember is really two things that people were asking. Yes, it wasn’t nearly as long as what the Affordable Care Act ended up being, but still a thousandpage bill, people have to dig through it, have to understand it. And the two things that I took away from those townhall meetings back in the district were people were telling us, number one: Don’t mess up what we have got. We have something, and it may be imperfect, but by golly, it is working for us and our families right now, so don’t hurt that. The other thing they would ask is: If you are going to do anything at all, could you please help us with cost, because we are concerned about the cost of these products and we are concerned what the trajectory may be for the costs going up over time? I will just ask the gentleman from Georgia—since he was a citizen at that time, how does the gentleman from Georgia think we did with those two requests that were coming to us from our constituents? I use the term ‘‘we’’ advisedly. Obviously, I voted against that bill. But as things turned out with the Affordable Care Act, how did that turn out for the American healthcare consumer? Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Well, as we say in south Georgia, the proof is in the pudding, and the proof is right here. Premiums have gone up this year. Look, one thing that amazes me is we have almost created two new classes of uninsured. First of all, through ObamaCare, it has mandated that people have insurance. So you have got a class who have insurance, but their deductibles are so high they can’t afford to use it. So there you have a new class of literally uninsured. Then you have another class of people who were able to afford insurance before, but now it has gotten so expensive, they just pay the penalty. They cannot even afford it. I think it has done just the opposite of what it was intended to do. I have heard this same argument, that we had to do something, that costs were rising. I will agree that we have to address healthcare costs. We do. We are. In fact, we are doing it this week. Remember, this is the first phase. As you pointed out, what we vote on this week is only the first phase. We have got two more phases to go. In those two phases, we intend to do a lot that is going to help control healthcare costs. I like to give the example, if you will indulge me for just a minute, when I was still practicing pharmacy—and I tell you this to explain just how competition works. When I was still practicing pharmacy, I still had my pharmacy, and I still owned it at the time. This drugstore opened down the street, a tiny company. I am trying to remember the name. Oh, yeah, it was Walmart. They decided they wanted to be a player in the healthcare system, in the pharmacy system, in the pharmacy market. So they came out with this idea that they were going to sell a 30 day supply of generics for $4. I thought to myself, they must be crazy, I can’t even buy it for that much. I bowed my back and I said: I am not going to do that. I am not going to do that. Well, guess what. A week later, I was doing it. I had people leaving my store. And I called my supplier up and I said: You have got to do something here, you have got to help me. That is the way competition in health care works. When you have got choices, when you have got competition, prices go down, quality goes up. Sometimes we get caught up too much in the numbers game, thinking, oh, we 
have got all these lives covered. Coverage does not necessarily equate quality health care, as you well understand. We have to be very careful with that. Now, we want people to have coverage, and we want them more so to have quality health care. This plan addresses that. It addresses it by increasing choices, by increasing competition, by increasing accessibility, and by empowering people. I am very proud. I am going to be very proud to vote for this bill on Thursday. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for participating this evening. It means a lot to me individually that he was willing to come up and stay up late with us tonight yet one more night dealing with the Affordable Care Act. But the gentleman is quite direct. The journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step. It is a threepart program. This was the first part, the first phase that will happen on Thursday night. This deals with some of the more egregious aspects of the Affordable Care Act, those things that can be tackled through Senate rules of reconciliation that only require 51 Senators to get passed. So that is one part of this. Another part is the administrative part. And our former colleague from Georgia, Tom Price, a physician, who is now Secretary Tom Price for the Department of Health and Human Services, he has an administrative part that is actually already underway. We don’t have to wait for that to happen. It is already occurring. Then there is the third part, the so called regular order part, the part that will require 60 votes on the Senate side, the part that is, by its very nature, going to be bipartisan. We have reported two rules out of the Committee on Rules tonight, one on the McCarran Ferguson changes that I think the gentleman is well aware of. There are already additional bills that will be coming to the floor of the House that are separate and apart from this reconciliation bill, which is just the first step in repealing the Affordable Care Act. I do want to point out that Secretary Price sent a letter to the Governors last week or a week and a half ago now talking about some of the waivers that he is bringing forward right now, the 1332 waivers, which are waivers for parts of the Affordable Care Act. Quoting from his letter here: ‘‘Under Section 1332 of the ACA, states can apply for State Innovation Waivers and pursue innovative strategies to adapt many of the law’s requirements to suit the state’s specific needs.’’ So many details to receive approval, what a State has to do, but he really stresses in this letter and in one of the last paragraphs: ‘‘We encourage states interested in applying for Section 1332 waivers to reach out to the Departments promptly for assistance in formulating an approach that meets the requirements of Section 1332.’’ I know the gentleman hasn’t served here that long, but I will just tell you, that is a sea change of difference from the Federal agency which time after time told our Governors: No. Stop. Go back to go. Do not collect $200. You can’t do that. Now we have a Secretary at the agency who is reaching out to the Governors: Governor, we want to help you make this work for you. We are going to provide the flexibility that you need. One of the things that I think is perhaps most promising is the hybrid, highrisk pool, Stateoperated reinsurance programs that have been proven in several States already. States that were in a socalled death spiral because of guaranteed issue community rating, the premiums were going up, people were dropping their coverage. And now these States have expanding coverage even without the things that we are providing in the American Health Care Act that we are going to be doing later this week. But already by providing that flexibility at the agency level, States are able to provide some relief for their citizens. Then, finally, the part three of this. There are going to be some mustpass healthcare bills that will be coming up through our committee. We will have an opportunity to work on those things. We are going to work on the Food and Drug Administration user fee agreement reauthorization. So we will have that, which can happen as a bipartisan exercise in our committee. I will just stress, the Committee on Energy and Commerce has a history of doing things in a bipartisan fashion. One of the reasons why I enjoy serving on that committee is it is a thoughtful committee and it does do things in a bipartisan fashion. Generally, that is one of the strengths of the committee as it brings legislation to the floor. This is an important first step. It is a necessary first step. This is the key that gets us through the door of actually making a meaningful impact on cost and coverage in these United States. It has been 7 long years, but I am anxious and eager to get started on the next part of the process. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for joining me here this evening. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
REPLACING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, yes, this is an important week. There are a lot of things we are bringing up, but nothing is more important than the bill that is supposed to address the Affordable Care Act, as it was called. But it is kind of tough to call it that since it has been completely unaffordable for so many. So many lost their health insurance and lost their doctor. Some lost medication that they were taking before. It is now no longer approved under their new policy. So it has been a very difficult period of time as ObamaCare has been foisted on the country. It came so close to not passing. b2100 And every Republican that I am aware of has promised: You give us the majority in both Houses and the President and we will repeal it. I believe Majority Leader MCCONNELL said we will repeal it and rip it out root and branch. Republican leaders, I believe, mentioned lock, stock, and barrel. And I have great respect for my friends who were just speaking here, but I have got a real problem with the bill. We are told there will be three phases, three buckets, three stages, whatever you want to call it. The first will be to pass this bill. It leaves in place the parts of ObamaCare that caused insurance to skyrocket. It is leaving in place the part of ObamaCare that caused deductibles to rise from very little to thousands and thousands of dollars, beyond so many Americans’ ability to ever reach. So the insurance, they are paying them money every month, but they realize: I don’t have $5,000, $6,000, $7,000, $8,000 to pay the deductible; therefore, I am really paying for nothing. Especially young people have found this. We are told that it is because the Senate has what they refer to as the Byrd rule that would not allow us to take the part that is not currently in the bill regarding all of the regulations. We are told that the Byrd rule— and we have looked into it, apparently—if a bill is moving under reconciliation, as this is, then in the Senate, in essence, it must do more than affect the budget incidentally; it must materially affect the budget. And yet we know that if we repeal all of the part that is being put off for stage 2 or 3, but particularly stage 2, the regulations that were put in place by the Obama administration, the regulatory authority that was given to them, by putting that off, it means the prices that dramatically skyrocketed, they are not going to skyrocket down. We are told, well, they may go up some, but we think there is a good chance they will come down 10 percent. But for my constituents, so many of whom either lost their insurance or are now paying for skyrocketing prices two, three, four times or more than what they used to pay, a 10 percent drop will not be a help at all. Their deductibles will not be coming down anytime soon. We are told, though, with the regulatory reform that my good friend Secretary Tom Price will do, that will be the phase, the stage, the bucket, that will drop the prices. But when I read through—and I know some people said 2,700 pages, my two part. And I have 
gotten two copies, and they are both around 2,500 pages. So unless there are 200 pages I never found, I did read the bill more than once. And someone said 1,400 times. I don’t know. I know it is a lot. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is given wide discretion in putting in place rules and regulations to implement the act. We have heard that there will, no doubt, be, immediately, litigation filed, lawsuits filed, to try to overturn the regulations that are put in place by Secretary Price. Well, since I have had experience in litigation, including Federal litigation, Federal appeals, what would be the issue? Well, the issue would be whether or not the Secretary of Health and Human Services has authority to create regulations that will, in effect, completely destroy the bill so that eventually the prices will come back down, the deductibles eventually will come back down. That is what we are told. And I trust Secretary Price will do everything within his power to make this happen. So Secretary Price will come forward with regulations that will emasculate the bill, emasculate ObamaCare. Litigation is filed. Ultimately, at some point, it will come back to a judge, an appellate judge. As a State district judge, I handled cases and matters that I knew were going to be appealed. As a chief justice of an appellate court, I made those decisions and sat in on discussions with other justices, and so it seems I am in a good position to potentially analyze what would happen on appeal. We know the Secretary has wide discretion promulgating the regulations, the rules, to bring about the implementation and the intent of the ACA, ObamaCare. But the question will be, on appeal: Does the Secretary of Health and Human Services have the authority, under the bill, to render it meaningless? Now, I am not aware of justices at the appellate level who are a great deal more conservative than I was, but I believed in following the law even though I, at times, didn’t like the law. I would not legislate from the bench. And in a case such as this, you would look, well, yes, the Secretary should have wide discretion to implement the intention of the bill and see that it is carried out. But it would certainly seem the more powerful argument—perhaps, most likely, the winning argument—will be, yes, but he doesn’t have discretion to kill the bill. He has discretion, wide discretion, to implement the bill and carry out the intent of the bill. I just can’t help but think, again, back to words from my late friend, Justice Scalia. We weren’t talking about a specific case, because he never betrayed the trust that he had as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. We were talking about things in general. He said at times it bothered him that Congress had the power to end some bill, to change some law, and yet we seem to put a rubber stamp and encourage people to go file a lawsuit to get the law struck down instead of just winning the vote in the House and Senate and repealing the law. The words that really come back are: If you guys in Congress don’t have the guts to do what needs to be done, that you have the power to do and you are supposed to do, don’t come running to us over at the Supreme Court expecting us to do your job for you. He was right. This body, along with the Senate, has the power to do exactly what we have promised for 7 years we would do if we got the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. We would repeal ObamaCare. Now, I don’t know how many there are of us that cannot vote for a bill that will leave in place the regulations and the parts that made our insurance skyrocket, that caused me to lose my insurance. And I wouldn’t take the subsidy for 3 years until we got insurance through other means. The law is very clear that, as Members of Congress, we weren’t supposed to get that, so I went without insurance for a few years. But we promised our constituents we would repeal ObamaCare. So what about, we are told, this part that can’t make it through the Byrd rule in the Senate? Well, for one thing, 51 votes could change the Byrd rule. For another, there is nothing that is going to more materially affect the budget, in this reconciliation or any other, than bringing the price of health insurance and health care down dramatically. That is more appropriate under the Byrd rule than the whole other part that we are told will make it through the Byrd rule in the Senate. The most important part is the part being left out. That will bring the prices down. That will give control back to the patients and the doctors. That will allow the States to come up with new ideas and new ways to provide health care and to get it to those who need it. But more important than anything, it restores freedom in America that has been lacking since that bill passed. When the government is in charge of every Americans’ health care, the government has every right to tell people how to live. Those claims from years past—we don’t want the government in our bedroom—became rather hollow when ObamaCare passed and the government came into your bedroom, your dining room, everywhere in the house. It has got to be repealed. As MITCH MCCONNELL has said previously, rip it out root and branch. Who is going to make the decision on what seems so clear should allow all of ObamaCare to be repealed? Who is going to make that decision in the Senate? Well, we know the Vice President can come right on down to the Capitol, come down Pennsylvania Avenue and come into the Senate Chamber. He is the President of the Senate, and I couldn’t be more thrilled that he is. If he is unable to come, then the majority leader could sit in the chair, or he could appoint someone to sit in the chair pro tem. But it will be a Republican who decides whether or not all of ObamaCare can be repealed, but especially the part that is left out right now. Mr. Speaker, I know the President is coming, and I am so glad that we have this chance because he is President. But I believe that the President of the United States who has been sold this bill that won’t bring down prices— maybe 10 percent, we are told, some day—he deserves better. He does not deserve to be slapped in the face with a midterm election when prices have not come down, as people pushing this bill know they won’t—maybe 10 percent. That is not going to change votes of those who know we promised a full repeal. We have the power to do a full repeal, and we should do a full repeal. b2115 Let’s get freedom back to a doctor patient relationship. And from what I am told—they certainly haven’t called me—I am told that the health insurance lobbyists have been very active, and people in our leadership are listening. But if that is true, these are the same people with Big Pharma that signed off on ObamaCare. It meant they would make billions more than they ever had in the short term, but in the long term, they signed their own death warrant. We owe it to the American people to make sure that insurance is viable for the future, and the only way to do that is to repeal ObamaCare, rip it out, root and branch. I like MITCH MCCONNELL ’s expression. That is what needs to happen. And for those of my colleagues who are getting nervous about having pressure from the White House, pressure from the House leaders, pressure from the Senate leaders, it is nothing like the pressure you will get from your constituents when they find out you didn’t really do anything to make their lives better because the prices are not coming down; the regulations that require all of those parts and policies that people don’t want that they should have the freedom to choose, they are still there; and in the meantime, the new regulations by the great Secretary of Health and Human Services, in whom I have great faith, they will be tied up in litigation. Maybe they get to the Supreme Court in 2 years. Maybe they don’t. Maybe it is longer. And the American people continue to suffer because we didn’t have the guts to do what we should do, what we promised we would do, and that is: Repeal ObamaCare. I would like to keep the Senate majority in 2018, and I am convinced that the only way we do that is if enough of us endure the name calling in the short term, and stand up and say no on this bill that doesn’t keep our promises. It has got some good stuff in it, no question, but it doesn’t keep our promises. 
And if enough of us will do that, then maybe we can get the Senate and the House leadership to agree to do what we promised. Then the President will be hailed in 2018, as prices of insurance actually come down, people are given their freedom back to choose their doctor, their health insurance, and the short stint of the name calling now ends up paying dividends in a glorious future. So, Mr. Speaker, thank you for recognizing me. We will see how the week plays out. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
