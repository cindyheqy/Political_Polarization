Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. GARAMENDI led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, Randi Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers spoke recently on valuing the input of parents in building great public schools, but the actions of one AFT affiliate stand in stark contrast to that vision. As Chicago resident Michael Hendershot explained in The Wall Street Journal, his daughter’s elementary school was forced to lay off its librarian last year. Fortunately, parents stepped up and volunteered their time to keep the library open. Unfortunately, the Chicago Teachers Union shut down the parents’ plan and the library along with it. It seems anything that weakens union control over the school must be stopped, even if it denies students access to their library. How shameful. If we want to build great public schools, then we must work with parents, not against them. So let’s work together—Congress, the new administration, and the American public—to empower parents and help all children receive an excellent education. f 
MORE FLOOD PROTECTION NEEDED ACROSS THE COUNTRY (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, feast or famine. California, for 5 years, had a water famine, and now we have a feast. I want to shout out to the Army Corps of Engineers, to the local flood control districts in my district, in Sacramento, the Sutter Butte District I share with Mr. LAMALFA , and also other flood control districts. Despite the heavy water flows, the levees have held. 
I ask all of my colleagues here in the House and over in the Senate to keep in mind that we need more flood protection all across this Nation; otherwise, there will be great suffering. 
NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this week many people and leaders from the USA and all around the world converged on Washington, D.C., for the National Prayer Breakfast. Its tradition started 65 years ago under President Eisenhower and with partners in the Congress to take a little time to come together as leaders and a people in prayer and fellowship. It is a bipartisan effort—indeed, ideally, a nonpartisan coming together. Some might say a bunch of politicians coming together, well, but some very powerful testimonies come from this time together. This year, from right here in this building, Senate Chaplain Barry Black, who also served as a Navy admiral, gave a strong message on the power of prayer, that our prayers are, indeed, heard in Heaven. Two years ago, an amazing, humble, personal testimony delivered by NASCAR race driver Darrell Waltrip had everyone talking later. I would recommend anyone to find this video and enjoy that moving personal message of the lows and the highs, the lows and the highs of fame and celebrity and that you need God in your life. This can also happen, and does, in local communities as tens of thousands of prayer breakfasts happen on the National Day of Prayer, which this year will be May 4, as it is always the first Thursday of May, as proclaimed by President Reagan. I urge you as Americans, if you don’t have one in your community, start one. If you do have one, please participate. 
MUSLIM BAN IS AGAINST OUR FUNDAMENTAL VALUES (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against President Trump’s Muslim ban, an executive order that emboldens our enemies, undermines our alliances, and offends our American values. This ban has, among other things, blocked visas for interpreters from the Middle East, people who risk their lives to save American lives. When I was deployed to Afghanistan as an intelligence officer, I worked with many interpreters; and at first, I realized they not only provided accurate information, they kept us safe. As time went along and I got to know them, what I came to realize is that they were the ones who were unsafe. They were the ones who were risking their lives to save our lives. When I got to know them, I would ask them: Why are you taking this risk? Why are you doing this? And the reason they gave me was similar to the one my grandfather gave me, my Italian immigrant grandfather, as to why he came here to America back in 1921, and that is they came here to give their children a better life. Mr. Speaker, to me, that is the definition of the American Dream. President Trump’s executive order not only makes us unsafe, it is against our fundamental values. If people are willing to take risks to live the American Dream, we don’t stop them; we welcome them. That is why my family is here. That is why I am here. f 
TRIBUTE TO DAN HALLIBURTON (Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a stalwart public servant. Dan Halliburton started his public service career as a law enforcement officer, eventually retiring in 2009 from the Ohio State Highway Patrol with over 32 years of service. But he didn’t stop there. He felt the call to serve more, and in 2010, Dan joined my team, tasked with representing the largest geographical and most rural district in the State of Ohio. Very quickly, Dan distinguished himself as a man of and for the people. He expertly managed my transportation so that we could be out amongst the people I represent. He built lasting relationships with local elected officials, law enforcement, and business owners. But what set Dan apart, was his genuine care and concern for the people of Appalachia. It was reflected in the high level of service he provided them. So on behalf of the hardworking people of eastern and southeastern Ohio, Godspeed to Dan Halliburton and his family as he begins his welldeserved retirement. 
GI INTERNSHIP PROGRAM ACT (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, too many of our veterans struggle to find a job despite their unique leadership abilities and proven skill sets. At the same time, I hear from small businesses that our economy skills gap is widening. Manufacturers want to hire, but positions sit unfilled because they cannot find qualified workers. That is why I am proud to introduce, this week, the GI Internship Program Act. The bill brings together these two sides, veterans and our small businesses, to bridge the skills gap and expand the job opportunities available to those who served our Nation. Since 1944, we have committed to providing our returning military men and women a quality education, but not every lesson is best learned in the classroom. This legislation allows veterans to receive their post9/11 GI Bill benefit as a stipend while participating in a qualifying 6month to 1year internship or apprenticeship, at no additional cost to taxpayers. I am proud to introduce this bipartisan bill with my colleague from Florida, Congressman TEDYOHO. I encourage our colleagues to join us in support of our veterans and manufacturers on this winwin commonsense legislation. 
IN MEMORY OF SERGEANT FIRST CLASS SEAN COOLEY (Mr. KELLY of Mississippi asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I am humbled to rise in memory of Army Sergeant First Class Sean Cooley. Sean was my friend, and on this day in 2005, he paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect our country. It was a privilege to serve with him during our deployment to Iraq and Operation Iraqi Freedom III. SFC Cooley was assigned to the Mississippi Army National Guard’s Company B, 150th Combat Engineer Battalion, headquartered in Lucedale, Mississippi. SFC Cooley gave his life when an IED detonated near him on February 3, 2005, while on a combat mission in the Babil province, Iraq. SFC Cooley was the first 155th soldier from the Dixie Thunder Brigade to sacrifice his life in Iraq and was the 21st soldier with Mississippi ties to die in the war on terror. SFC Cooley followed in the footsteps of both of his grandfathers by serving in the U.S. Navy. He joined the Seabees in 1991 and later joined the Mississippi National Guard in 1997. SFC Cooley was a platoon sergeant in B Company, 150th Engineer Battalion of the 155th Brigade Combat team that included 3,500 Mississippians. SFC Cooley was a great NCO, a great leader, and a great soldier, both on and off the battlefield. While serving in the Mississippi Guard, SFC Cooley obtained a degree in nursing and became an RN in 1996. His commitment to care for the needs of others will always be remembered, as remembered by Lieutenant Colonel Robinson, his commander, who said he was sick and down at one time during a training incident, and SFC Cooley gave him both medicine and water and made sure that he took care of him. SFC Cooley will forever be remembered for his random acts of kindness. Sergeant First Class Cooley’s mother, Kathryn, says her husband, Jerry; their son, Patrick; and Sergeant First Class Cooley’s wife, Laura, could not be 
more proud of his devotion to the military service and this Nation. Sean Cooley embodied the characteristics that made him a great leader, soldier, and American. 
OPPOSING THE BAN ON REFUGEES (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to President Trump’s ban on the entry of refugees from around the world as well as the ban on refugees and citizens from seven select countries. This ban, whether temporary or not, is shameful, and wholly unAmerican. There are better ways to protect our Nation, ways that are effective and stay true to our American values. For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, thousands of my constituents fled the horrors of war and genocide in Vietnam and in Cambodia as refugees. Today, these immigrants and their children are doctors, lawyers, teachers, parents, students, all integral to the success of our Nation. America has long endured as the shining beacon on the Hill. Sadly, that light was dimmed by the President’s immigration executive order. Our Nation is great because it has been built by refugees and immigrants from every part of the world. 
b0915 REMEMBERING EMILY HART (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember Mrs. Emily Hart, who passed away on Monday, January, 23, 2017. She was 82 years of age. Mrs. Hart was born in 1934 to her parents, Emily and Edwin Tribble, in Washington, D.C., where her father worked as an editor of the old Washington Star newspaper for nearly 40 years. She spent her early education in Washington, D.C., before she moved on to Vassar College in New York City, where she studied political science. No matter where she was, Mrs. Hart dedicated her time and energy to bettering the community. In Washington, she was a proud member of the National Cathedral Foundation and the National Preservation Historical Society. In St. Simons, she joined the Coastal Georgia Historical Society; was a devout member of the Christ Church Frederica; and worked with the St. Simons Land Trust, which works to preserve the island’s natural beauty and improve the quality of life in the community. Although she was always aiding the community, her greatest joy came from her family, which included her husband—retired U.S. Marine Colonel Nick Hart—her three children, and her seven grandchildren. Her sharp wit, passion for learning, and detailed stories of the past are what will be remembered most dearly. I express my condolences to Mrs. Hart’s family for their loss. She will be missed. f 
SUPPORT SCIENCE FUNDING (Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I have spoken on the House floor on specific science topics ranging from twin primes to measuring atmospheric carbon. Modern society depends on science. Farmers are able to feed much of the world’s current population because of science. Without science, we would further strip our forests and pollute even more of our precious water supplies; and our Nation has the strongest military in the world because of science. But science allows for far more than just furthering our survival as it provides leisure, communications, and all things Internet. Today we depend on the science of yesterday, and, tomorrow, society will depend on the science of today. If we care about the short and longterm future, then we need to support scientific research. We need to encourage collaboration with the scientists of other nations; we need an open and competitive science environment; and we need to make sure that all Americans have a basic understanding of science. Science is a part of our Nation’s critical infrastructure, and I ask my colleagues to continue to support science funding to keep America great. 
PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A FINAL RULE OF THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 74, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 36) providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the final rule of the Bureau of Land Management relating to ‘‘Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation’’, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HULTGREN ). Pursuant to House Resolution 74, the joint resolution is considered read. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: 
H.J. R ES. 36 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Bureau of Land Management relating to ‘‘Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation’’ (published at 81 Fed. Reg. 83008 (November 18, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force or effect. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. LOWENTHAL ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. 
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on H.J. Res. 36. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. For the last decade, there has been an ongoing renaissance in the United States in energy production. It has changed our geopolitics; our economy has been strengthened; our security has been enhanced; and there have been thousands of new, goodpaying jobs that have been created from it. This energy boom, according to a 2015 survey, has saved the American family around $1,000 a year, and this growth of the last decade has come in spite of consistent antienergy policies of the previous administration’s. It has especially hit those of us in the West very hard—those who are public land States in the West—who use our resources to fund our infrastructure and to pay for our schools and our essential government services. This rule, which is allegedly to help the environment, actually is designed to stop production; therefore, it becomes a prime candidate for a repeal under the Congressional Review Act, which was passed into law in 1996 and signed by President Clinton. At that time, Clinton said that this was a great way for Congress to be held accountable, and it truly is in that any rule is subject to this rule if it has one of three criteria: one, excessive costs; two, it was done beyond the particular agency’s statutory authority; or, three, it is duplicative or unnecessary or redundant. With this particular rule, we have the trifecta because it is not just one of those criteria—it offends all of those criteria. The Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency, in its working with States, the authority to develop issues and regulations that address air quality. The Bureau of Land Management does not, and they are the ones who instituted this particular rule. In fact, the contortions the BLM went through to say they have the legal authority is almost embarrassing. The contortions they went through would qualify for an opening act on the Las Vegas Strip. Instead, it reminds us of when the BLM came up with the hydraulic fracturing rule only for them to 
be rebuked by the courts for simply doing what they did outside their delegated authority. This is the same thing. This is an illegal rule, and it is a costly one. Our effort to educate our children, to build infrastructure, to provide essential government services—in other words, to make people’s lives better—depends on our ability to deal with our resources. This is a costly rule. On Friday, it was estimated by one source that it could cost the industry up to $20 billion; it was estimated to cost States up to $6 billion; and it was estimated to cost the Federal Government in lost royalties up to $600 million a year. It is a costly rule and is a totally unnecessary rule. Without this rule, the American energy industry will continue to do what they have done for well over a decade— reduce methane emissions on their own by investing in technology that not only helps the environment, but that helps them grow their business, which will lead to more jobs for Americans and more funding for State education programs and infrastructure. Since 2005, methane emissions have actually decreased even as production has increased, and there is absolutely no reason to believe that this progress will suddenly stop because we strike this unnecessary rule, this illegal rule, this totally redundant rule. There are some who will say: Well, we need this rule to protect the taxpayers because we are burning up the royalty payments. Oh, really? If one looks at the BLM’s actions—their management on sage grouse, their lease cancellations, pulling acreage out of lease sales at the last minute, their constant barrage of revenuereducing agency actions—you will realize that saving taxpayers money is not the real goal here. Look, there are only three things you can do with the methane. You can build pipelines to capture it and take it away where it can be used for the benefit of mankind. Unfortunately, the agencies in the last administration refused to do that. Even though, legally, they had to make decisions on pipelines within 60 days, there is not a single BLM office anywhere in the Nation that was meeting that legal deadline. Instead, it was open for months afterwards when nothing was happening. If you can’t have the pipelines to move it away, you have to burn it. So, if they won’t give the pipelines and if now they are trying to stop the burning of it, the only other option is not to drill at all. Our policy should be to fund and make sure those pipelines and those rights of ways are approved so that we can actually capture the methane and use it for productive purposes. Unfortunately, this rule’s real goal is to do the third element—simply stop the production. That is counterproductive. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution because it will help people and it will support people. This rule’s repeal is a vote for people and making sure that their lives are better, not worse. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong opposition to this resolution, which would waste resources, waste money, pollute our air, and worsen the impacts of climate change. When it comes to regulations that we should keep on the books, the BLM Methane Waste Prevention Rule is a nobrainer. Currently, oil and gas companies are venting, flaring, or leaking hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of natural gas each and every year. People who are sitting at home may wonder: Why would a company simply waste or burn off such a valuable resource? The answer is simple: They want the oil, and they want it now. To them, the natural gas that goes along with the oil is just a nuisance; so they burn it off or they don’t make the effort that is required to ensure that their equipment isn’t leaking. The problem is, when they are operating on public lands, this isn’t their natural gas to waste. They cannot waste this. This belongs to the American people. So when that gas is simply burned off or is allowed to escape, the royalties that are owed to the American people are gone with the wind; and instead of generating electricity or heating our homes, this wasted resource generates pollution and heats our planet. For people who live near oil and gas wells, this is not just a climate problem. Methane contributes to lowlevel ozone, which causes a number of health problems, such as shortness of breath, more frequent asthma attacks, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. When the methane leaks, you also get leaks of benzene, which is a known carcinogen, and of other volatile organic chemicals that further contribute to ozone and smog and can contribute to liver and kidney damage, nausea, and other health problems. Now, my colleagues on the other side say that this is exactly the problem— the Bureau of Land Management is trying to regulate air pollution, and that is the job of the Environmental Protection Agency. The fact is, though, that the Bureau of Land Management has very clearly written a waste prevention rule, as they are authorized and required. I will state that again—as they are authorized and required to do under the Mineral Leasing Act. Section 30 of the Mineral Leasing Act reads: 
Each lease shall contain provisions for the purpose of insuring the exercise of reasonable diligence, skill, and care in the operation of said property; a provision that such rules for the safety and welfare of the miners and for the prevention of undue waste as may be prescribed by said Secretary shall be observed. 
The BLM simply did its job by writing this rule, and now that they have done the job that Congress required of them, the majority is attempting to argue that Congress never gave the BLM that job in the first place. If you look at the statute, that claim is clearly an alternative fact. Just because preventing the waste of methane helps keep our air clean and moderates the severity of climate change, it doesn’t mean the BLM is doing anything outside of their authority. The BLM is not regulating the quality of the air around oil and gas sites. It is just trying to make sure that methane stays out of the atmosphere and gets into the marketplace. Another argument you have heard from the majority is that this is an effort to shut down oil and gas production on Federal lands. It is just another salvo in their war, which they claim is the Obama war on energy, except that that is simply not true. I am almost tired of having to say this, but the production of Federal onshore oil went up, not a little bit—it went way up under President Obama—but by 71 percent, as a matter of fact, between 2009 and 2015. Now, would this Methane Waste Prevention Rule hurt production? Would it drive operators off Federal lands? To answer that, let’s just take a look at one of our States—Colorado, which, in early 2014, enacted methane venting and flaring regulations that the BLM used as a model in writing its own rule. I want to state this really clearly: after Colorado enacted their methane regulations, their production went up 47 percent from 2013 to 2014 and another 32 percent in 2015. Colorado’s oil production from Federal lands has been up 28 percent over the past 5 years also. Clearly, strong methane waste regulations do not scare away oil and gas companies. What about the claim that companies have to burn off natural gas because the BLM takes too long to process pipeline applications? If we look at a recent report from the Government Accountability Office just from last year, they found that only 9 percent of flaring was due to the lack of pipelines and that 91 percent had nothing to do with pipelines. b0930 How about the point that is made at the oil and gas companies’ insistence that they are making great strides in reducing their own methane emissions so they don’t need additional oversight? Members, that is a myth as well. Oil and gas producers in the field emitted 45 percent more methane in 2014 than they did in 1990. In fact, methane emissions from oil and gas producers went up 21 percent in the past 24 years. The majority also says this is a power grab, an effort by BLM to take power away from the States, except that the BLM has regulated venting and flaring since the Carter administration. And this has not stopped States from setting their own regulations, as I have just said that Colorado 
has done, which they will still be free to do under this rule. In fact, despite all the complaints about onesizefits all regulations, companies still have to follow State regulations when they operate on Federal land. Mr. Speaker, none of these arguments against the regulation hold any water, but the benefits of this regulation would be huge: enough gas saved to supply up to 740,000 households each year; the reduction of an estimated 185,000 tons of methane emissions, which would have the same impact as taking nearly 1 million cars off the road; and up to $14 million each year to the American taxpayer from additional royalties, and that number could be even larger if the price of natural gas increases, which the majority is trying to do by expediting natural gas exports. The BLM methane waste prevention rule is a win for the taxpayer, a win for the environment, a win for the climate, and a win for common sense. That is why it is supported by over 80 percent of voters in Western States, including both Democrats and Republicans, according to a poll just released this week. If my colleagues have not seen that poll, I would be happy to share it with them. Unfortunately, the Republican antiregulatory, antitaxpayer, antihealth, antienvironment machine must be continually fed. Earlier this week, they voted to strip clean water and transparency regulations. Today, they are going after clean air. I ask my colleagues to stand up and put a stop to this, to speak for the ordinary Americans who don’t own oil and gas or coal companies, which those companies donate immense sums of money to politicians. The industry has to do its share and not simply demand that the farmers, the ranchers, the sportsmen, the conservationists, and all the rest of us have to put up with their waste in the name of higher profits. I ask my colleagues to do this by voting ‘‘no’’ on H.J. Res. 36. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ), who knows exactly what this means to his State and his State’s economy. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, New Mexico gets 40 percent of its State’s revenues from oil and gas, that is, 40 percent of our teachers’ pay, 40 percent of our government institutions, law enforcement, hospitals—40 percent. So when the Federal Government begins to adjust the rules, we in New Mexico take an interest because it provides our jobs and it provides the way we educate our children. Now, we have two points of view being postulated on this argument nationwide. One says that the government is suddenly becoming the model of efficiency. I wonder where that efficiency is with regard to the $200 billion of fraud in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The government hasn’t suddenly gotten efficient about that. Or just your local post office, has it suddenly gotten efficient about that? Or you could listen to the argument that the government is suddenly interested in the environment and we are going to make it clean. The BLM did not say a word when the Gold King Mine spill not only was allowed, but mandated to be turned loose by the EPA. The heavy metals ran down across those public lands and currently sit in the streambeds in New Mexico, and our friends say that the government is suddenly all worried about the environment. When you look specifically at the venting and flaring rule, we are told that oil and gas production went up dramatically in the last years. The truth is, when you dissect it down, oil and gas production on private lands went up dramatically. Oil and gas on public lands, the government lands owned by the BLM and other agencies, went down dramatically. So when the BLM decided to go in and control the venting and flaring of gasses, then we in New Mexico looked and said, is the government suddenly being more concerned about us or is it one more wink and nod to the special interests who want to kill the industries? They have already succeeding in killing the timber industry in this country. They have the coal industry on its back, and they want to kill the oil and gas industry that provides the jobs in New Mexico. Yes, we have an opinion about that. Oil and gas production, again, educates our kids. Oil and gas production provides our jobs. It provides the way of life that we in this country are looking for. We contribute heavily to that, but we don’t stand silently when the government suddenly decides our best interests are at stake. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from New Mexico. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, we could go through all of the examples. The truth is many reports say that over threequarters of the marginal wells— those are the ones in New Mexico; we have the stripper wells, the marginal wells—will be shut in by this action. You are going to take money away from our State government. You are going to take jobs away from the people. I support the resolution. We should back this regulation off, cut the red tape that is starving America’s jobs out of this country. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. TSONGAS ). Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution and efforts to roll back important protections for not only our environment, but for American taxpayers. Our Nation’s public lands belong to all Americans, and they are managed to balance many competing uses: recreation; responsible economic development; sustainable resource extraction; yes, renewable energy; military purposes; and conservation of historic American landscapes, just to name a few. As such, they should be subject to strong national standards that protect our shared water, shared lands, wildlife, and the multiple uses they support. It is also critical to remember that use of our public lands is a privilege, not a right; and companies seeking to exercise that privilege, whether they be fossil fuel companies or clean energy companies developing wind, solar, and geothermal projects, should be held to a very high standard to preserve and protect resources that belong to all of the American people. We must also make sure that the taxpayers get a fair return for the use and development of our commonly shared resources. The Mineral Leasing Act, as written by Congress, calls upon the Secretary of the Interior to prevent the waste of oil and gas resources on public lands. The Bureau of Land Management’s methane waste rule achieves all of these shared goals: the rule prevents the waste of resources that belong to all American people, which, by law, it is required to do; it reduces the amount of greenhouse gas pollution coming off our public lands; and it increases royalty payments to Federal taxpayers and the States. The methane waste rule also supports job creation and American innovation in new technologies. The methane mitigation industry is a growing and emerging field that uses modern technologies to identify and capture wasteful emissions. In fact, a 2014 report commissioned by the Environmental Defense Fund found that methane mitigation companies provide jobs in 46 States and support 102 manufacturing and assembly locations, with 59 percent of all companies across the industry being small businesses. If Republicans had brought this resolution before the House Natural Resources Committee, we could have more thoroughly examined its negative impacts on job creation. Instead, it was rushed to the House floor with only this 1 hour of debate. I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, perhaps no aspect of America’s economy has been as overregulated as energy under the Obama administration; so this week, the House has already acted to repeal two of the most damaging energy regulations. This morning we continue the fight to reduce the unnecessary regulatory costs that are passed along to all Americans by repealing the Bureau of Land Management’s venting and flaring rule. Some estimates show that this rule could inflict staggering costs 
of $1.26 billion on national, State, and local economies, while generating less than $4 million in new royalties. In addition, the legal basis for this rule is tenuous at best. The Clean Air Act authorizes the EPA, not BLM, working in conjunction with States, to make rules affecting air quality. The BLM’s venting and flaring rule’s extreme compliance cost will force many companies to shut in their wells rather than to continue to operate them. This will be particularly true for marginal wells that are often run by familyowned businesses. And beyond the loss of jobs in Colorado and elsewhere, State and Federal Governments would lose up to $114 million in tax receipts. This is money that States like Colorado depend on for funding education and other critical services. The increase in natural gas production is to the benefit of everyday Americans. The U.S. energy boom saved drivers $550 in fuel costs each year and saved American households over $1,000 last year alone. Affordable, environmentally responsible energy development is critical to the U.S. economy, but this rule is a needless burden on American families. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the joint resolution of disapproval. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to be very clear about the situation on public lands because there are a lot of misleading statements that are being thrown about. We heard that the majority insists that oil and gas production on Federal lands is down. To support this, they often show misleading charts that compare apples to oranges or use visual tricks to hide the facts. The facts are Federal onshore oil production was up 71 percent between 2009 and 2015. All the panic that we have heard for years that President Obama is trying to shut down oil and gas was based on as much reality as the claim that he was coming to get everyone’s guns. I will say it again: there was a 71 percent increase in oil production on onshore Federal lands under President Obama’s watch. And it is the oil producers that are wasting and leaking methane at a faster and faster rate since it is not a product they care about. They just want the oil. With an unfortunate likely return to a drillatallcost mentality under President Trump, we need the BLM methane waste prevention rule more than ever. I urge my colleagues to defeat H.J. Res. 36 and support cutting down on methane waste. I reserve the balance of my time. b0945 Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ), who also understands this issue because it is part of the livelihood of his constituency. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I know I, and many of my colleagues, share concern about a Federal regulatory code that has become so bloated with redundant, ineffective, and unnecessary rules that the sheer bulk of it threatens to suffocate American economic recovery and longterm prosperity. The Bureau of Land Management’s rule to reduce venting and flaring from existing oil and natural gas operations is one such example of duplicative and unnecessary regulation. Aside from the fact that the authority to regulate air quality does not rest with the BLM, we certainly don’t need the BLM rule in addition to the EPA methane rule and State regulations, which our colleagues on the other side have noted and lauded that have come out of the State of Colorado. For all of the costs this rule would impose on industry, the supposed benefits of the rule would be emission reductions in the neighborhood of less than one onehundredth of a percent of global greenhouse emissions. That is the definition of an ineffectual rule. Methane is a marketable resource, and the oil and gas industry would prefer to economically capture and sell that resource, rather than vent or flare it, which is a necessary safety procedure in the absence of other viable options. Instead of using its authority to take actions that would effectively facilitate capture versus venting or flaring, like processing pipeline rightofway permits in a timely manner, the agency has once again issued a rule that unnecessarily burdens energy development. There are costeffective strategies available that will achieve emission reductions, and it is those strategies that we should focus our efforts on, rather than duplicative regulations. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California has 151⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Utah has 17
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot from Members from Colorado about how this onerous methane rule will hurt industry in Colorado. I would like to read from a couple of Colorado editorials that came out this past week in support of maintaining the BLM methane rule. On Saturday, The Denver Post posted an editorial entitled ‘‘Congress shouldn’t butcher federal methane rules.’’ In it, they say: ‘‘Congress is getting ready to use an ax where it needs a scalpel. . . .’’ Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Review Act is an ax. It is an ax being swung blindfolded after several shots of whiskey. It shows a complete lack of seriousness on the issue, and it could have serious, long term consequences. That is why The Denver Post editorial board asks Republicans to be surgeons and not butchers, and to avoid repealing what they call a thoughtful regulation. This past week, another editorial was published on Wednesday by the Grand Junction, Colorado Daily Sentinel entitled, ‘‘Stop methane leaks.’’ Referring to their State’s own methane waste rules, they say: ‘‘We’re fortunate to have the rule in Colorado. But if the federal rule isn’t enforced, the results can undermine our own gains.’’ Air quality does not recognize State lines. Underregulated drilling in Utah produces bad air that blows into the western slope communities. These editorial boards have seen firsthand that methane waste prevention rules work, and they know that it is in everyone’s interest to keep the BLM rule in place. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ). Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the measure for congressional disapproval of the BLM’s methane rule under this Congressional Review Act. This egregious rule passed in the last few days of the previous administration is yet another regulatory blow to responsible energy development on lands held by the Federal Government for the American people. I think the American people have a right to expect that their Federal Government is not only holding these lands, but that it is utilizing this asset, an asset that can gain income to the Federal Government on their behalf to maintain more lands, and also to utilize the energy at low cost from domestically produced energy that comes from their lands, instead of importing it from somewhere else, et cetera. It goes without question that producing it here in this country is a giant benefit to the U.S. and its economy. As a strong proponent of an allof theabove energy approach, I believe natural gas will continue to significantly transform and modernize our Nation’s energy infrastructure. Domestically produced energy has so many positive effects it should be a no brainer. The BLM claims that this rule helps capture methane waste, resulting in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Let’s face some facts. According to a report by the EPA, methane emissions from natural gas production have decreased by 38 percent in the last 10 years, while gas production on Federal lands has increased by 33 percent. Believe it or not, this reduction was done through voluntary action on behalf of industry, without changes to Federal regulations, in capturing and utilizing this asset. Even in my home State of California, the oil and gas industry has created 
tremendous opportunity for our workforce. A recent report shows that total economic contribution of oil and gas in California, in 2013, resulted in the creation of 455,000 jobs and $72 billion in value added to the State economy, approximately 3.4 percent of State GDP; indeed, no small numbers when the State of California is in big trouble fiscally, as it pursues more things like high speed rail and other nonsense. Stifling this vibrant and booming economic driver in my State and others would be detrimental to the U.S. economy as a whole, while making us more reliant upon energy from unstable regions of the globe and the higher costs to consumers at home and in their workplace. Furthermore, the BLM falsely claims it has authority under existing law to regulate oil and gas emissions. Such authority already belongs to the EPA and the States under the Clean Air Act, not the BLM. Indeed, the BLM needs to get its priorities and its jurisdiction in order. The agency spends valuable taxpayer resources developing a rule to prevent methane flaring, yet denies rightsof way permitting for pipelines, which would help eliminate these kinds of releases altogether. That is one of the important benefits of the Congressional Review Act is accountability by an elected Congress over a bureaucracy. Failure to reverse this rule would result in a net loss in royalties that would negatively impact not just the Federal Government but Indian tribes as well which rely on energy revenue to meet their health care, housing, and other needs of their members on their lands. The abuses and overreach by a previous Obama administration have gone long enough. It is time we put an end to the senseless, counterproductive regulations, and restore commonsense solutions to energy development on the people’s Federal lands. The administration taking credit for increased gas production is disingenuous, as most of it occurred on private lands, leaving our public assets and potential unused. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. LAMALFA. Indeed, it would be a loss for the American public to continue along that path. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the efforts in bringing this forward and the opportunity to have a Congressional Review Act for the accountability. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to reinforce a point that I made in my opening statement. Oil and gas companies and the industry would like to say they have done a tremendous job cutting methane emissions on their own. In fact, just this week, the Western Energy Alliance spearheaded a letter saying: ‘‘Methane emissions from oil and gas production have declined by 15 percent since 1990, without any Federal regulations.’’ What we have been hearing today, and my friends on the other side, is continually using some variation of this reduction that they say occurs. The problem is, and I repeat that the problem is, is that claim is just flat out false. That is the definition of an alternative fact. Methane reduction, since 1990, has come entirely from natural gas storage, from the distribution and the transmission of natural gas. Out in the field, however, what we are talking about, out in the field, where companies are actually drilling, methane emissions are up. For natural gas production, methane in the field, methane emissions are up by 31 percent. For oil production, emissions are up a staggering 76 percent. Mr. Speaker, the industry has not fixed this problem on their own, and they are not going to fix this problem on their own. Only strong rules and oversight are going to hold companies accountable to reduce methane waste and, for that reason, we must defeat this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. CRAMER ), who lives in an area where he clearly understands what this issue is about. Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, BLM’s Methane and Waste Prevention rule really is an overreach of authority that is already held by the EPA and the States. In fact, in North Dakota, the Department of Mineral Resources has waste prevention or conservation rules in place and is the first in the Nation to set gas capture requirements and goals. Requiring operators to meet yet another set of rules, in addition to States’ permits, results in substantial increases in both time and cost without any additional benefit to the public or to the environment, and that would also subject operators to conflicting rules, which actually could have the adverse effect that this rule aims at. Just in North Dakota alone, it is estimated this rule would cost $24 million in lost tax revenue, and $240 million per year would be lost in production, but $39 million, most importantly, would be lost in royalty revenues, not to big, rich oil companies who make large contributions, as our friends on the other side like to talk about, but to regular people, farmers and ranchers and landowners who own the royalty, who get the royalty. These are the very people the Democrats love to talk about but don’t seem to know how to talk to. Methane leaks are wasteful, but there is a natural incentive to capture it. Methane is not a waste product, it is a commodity. The overall, bestcase scenario impact of this rule would be a reduction of 0.06 percent. Now, if the BLM really wants to do something, they could streamline the permitting of the infrastructure that would capture it. I know of two pipeline projects in North Dakota alone that, had they been allowed to move forward, at no expense to the government, had they been allowed to move forward by the BLM, without its heavy hand of regulation, would have reduced emissions 6 percent; 6 percent with the natural incentive, stopped by the BLM, rather than this rule, which would, perhaps in the best case scenario, reduce it 0.06 percent. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. CRAMER. In wrapping up, I thank the chairman for the time and for his leadership. Let’s pass this CRA and overturn this egregious, unproductive BLM rule and return the authority where it belongs, back to the States. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As I have mentioned before, Mr. Speaker, this rule will not just reduce waste and increase taxpayer revenues, it will also reduce air pollution and improve public health. In support of that, we received a letter this week from 13 medical and public health groups, including the American Lung Association, the American Public Health Association, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, the Public Health Institute, and many more, pointing out the importance of the BLM methane waste prevention rule for cutting down on harmful methane emissions. They write: ‘‘. . . we strongly urge you to oppose any Congressional Review Act resolution of disapprov al . . .’’ for the BLM rule. They point to the volatile organic compounds that also pollute the air when natural gas leaks, saying that these chemicals ‘‘include benzene, a known carcinogen; ethylbenzene, a probable carcinogen; and toluene, a neurotoxin that may also cause miscarriages and birth defects.’’ b1000 Also, these chemicals are ‘‘precursors to the formation of groundlevel ozone, a dangerous air pollutant that causes permanent lung damage. By limiting emissions of volatile organic chemicals, oil and natural gas limits will reduce the risk of ozone formation in the air and, thus, the risk of ozonerelated health effects, including asthma attacks, hospital admissions, and, unfortunately, premature deaths.’’ These health impacts are just one more set of reasons why repealing the BLM Methane Waste Prevention Rule is the wrong way to go. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN ). 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, American workers and American businesses are the most innovative and productive in the world. This is no more evident than in our oil and gas fields— the ones in my district, in my State, across our country, and offshore. Mr. Speaker, in spite of the Obama administration’s war on energy, our producers made huge gains in technology, production, and productivity to meet the needs and lower energy costs. The gentleman from California is correct, energy production has increased during the Obama administration. According to this 2016 CBO report, both oil and gas production has increased on State and private lands both onshore and offshore. However, during the same time, under the heavy hand of the Obama administration, production on Federal lands has decreased. The Energy Information Administration reported that oil production on nonFederal lands has increased 89 percent while it has decreased 10 percent on Federal lands, while gas production has increased 37 percent on nonFederal lands and decreased 37 percent on Federal lands. The Bureau of Land Management’s venting and flaring rule is an overreach of the Obama administration. This is not about the environment. It is about extending the war on energy to private and State lands. The rule increases costs on producers, which are then passed on to customers, stifling job growth and hurting the economy. The BLM, as it has already been said, does not even have the legal authority to regulate air quality. It is an authority expressly provided to the EPA by the Clean Air Act. Methane emissions are already on the decline, dropping 21 percent since 1990 to 2014. This drop occurred despite the rise in natural gas production by nearly 47 percent. If the venting and flaring rule goes into full effect, it will cost nearly $1 billion by 2025. The result of overregulation is a decrease in domestic energy production, lost jobs, a battered economy, and an increased dependence on foreign energy sources. A repeal of the venting and flaring rule is necessary to protect our economy, the Constitution, and the American people. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it may no longer be Groundhog Day, but it feels like we have been here doing the same thing over and over again. Once again, Republicans are doing the bidding of wealthy fossil fuel companies at the expense of ordinary Americans. On Wednesday, we were here so our majority could strip away clean water protections from coal mining. Later on that day, the majority gave our new Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, a gift by repealing the requirement for oil and gas companies to tell the public how much money they paid to foreign governments. Now, today we are here to shower more goodies onto the oil and gas industry by repealing a rule designed to keep them from wasting—and I urge you to hear that term, ‘‘wasting’’—natural gas and also polluting our air. Really, Mr. Speaker? Less than 2 weeks into the new allRepublican government and they are already handing out early Valentine’s Day gifts to their wealthy donors. Instead of chocolates and flowers, they are giving their oil and coal executives the right to pollute our air, dump waste into our water, and do it all under the cover of darkness. Republicans are using the Congressional Review Act so fast that I doubt they even know what they are repealing from day to day. It’s Friday, so I guess it must be air pollution day. Let me warn everyone that is watching this telecast that they are not going to stop at trying to destroy clean air, clean water, and transparency. Dozens of health, safety, transparency, and consumer protections are on the chopping block, and Republicans are more than happy to swing the ax. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to protect the BLM Methane Waste Prevention Rule and defeat this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to close, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I include in the RECORD two letters opposing this resolution and supporting the BLM Methane Waste Prevention Rule. The first is from 78 environmental, conservation, public interest, and sportsmen’s groups urging a ‘‘no’’ vote on this resolution. The second is a letter from 13 public health and medical organizations strongly urging a ‘‘no’’ vote on this resolution because of the damage that it will do to public health. 
JANUARY 31, 2017. DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS : On behalf of our millions of members and supporters, we write to urge you to oppose any effort to use the Congressional Review Act to overturn the Bureau of Land Management’s Methane and Natural Gas Waste Rule. We rely on laws and regulations to protect taxpayer resources and to keep our air and water clean and healthy. While we oppose the use of the CRA for any rule, the BLM rule is one of the anticipated targets to be considered under a Congressional Review Act Resolution. The BLM rule is a common sense policy that requires the oil and gas industry to reduce venting, flaring, and leaks at industry operations on public and tribal lands by deploying methane mitigation technology. Currently, more than $330 million worth of natural gas is wasted on public and tribal lands each year, meaning that taxpayers could lose out on $800 million in royalties over the next decade due to venting and flaring of this gas. Repealing this rule would harm public health and reduce revenue to the federal government and Western states. The BLM estimates the rule’s net benefits range from $46 to $204 million per year. And economic studies have found the technologies and practices included in this rule to be very cost effective since the gas captured can be sold to the benefit of industry and taxpayers. Leaked natural gas contains volatile organic compounds, an asthma irritant; benzene; and other hazardous air pollutants that are known. carcinogens. After Colorado implemented a similar rule, natural gas production increased, and the standard has been popular. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) is a blunt instrument that seeks to undermine the federal rulemaking process. It allows Congress to overturn a recently finalized rule—major or otherwise—through an expedited process called a Resolution of Disapproval. In the Senate, a Resolution of Disapproval requires only a simple majority vote, may circumvent the committee process and cannot be filibustered. If the resolution passes and is signed by the President, the rule becomes void and the promulgating agency is prevented from issuing a rule that is ‘‘substantially the same’’ in the future without an act of Congress. By essentially voiding the rulemaking process and mandating that substantially similar rules not be pursued in the future, the CRA on the BLM’s Methane Rule wastes taxpayer money and defies the public interest. We request that you vote in opposition to this attack on commonsense standards which limit wasted resources and protect the American taxpayer, public health, and the environment. Vote no on the BLM Methane CRA Resolution.

FEBRUARY 1, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the tens of thousands of members of the undersigned medical and public health organizations, and the communities we serve, we strongly urge you to oppose any Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval that would block air pollution limits that address the leakage of methane, including the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Methane and Waste Prevention Rule. The Congressional Review Act is a blunt tool that would permanently block actions by BLM to reduce dangerous and wasteful methane leaks from the oil and gas industries. Use of the Congressional Review Act would not only block current actions to solve manageable problems; it would also prevent BLM from moving forward with substantially similar actions in the future. Methane fugitive emissions (leaks) occur from oil and gas wells, drillingrelated infrastructure and natural gas pipelines. Estimates of the amount of methane lost to leakage range from 9.3 percent to about 12 percent. Not only are these leaks wasteful, but they also create dangerous threats to health. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), gases recognized as hazardous air pollutants, accompany the methane extracted from deep underground wells. VOCs include benzene, a known human carcinogen; ethylbenzene, a probable carcinogen; and toluene, a neurotoxin (affecting the nervous system) that may also cause miscarriages and birth defects. Comprehensive methane limits would immediately reduce emissions of these lifethreatening substances. VOCs are also precursors to the formation of groundlevel ozone, a dangerous air pollutant that causes permanent lung damage. By limiting emissions of VOCs, oil and natural gas limits will reduce the risk of ozone formation in the air and, thus, the risk of ozonerelated health effects, including asthma attacks, hospital admissions and premature deaths. Finally, methane itself is a highly potent driver of climate change, one of the greatest threats to public health in our time. Methane is an extremely powerful heattrapping gas; over its first 20 years in the atmosphere, it is 84 times more effective at retaining heat than is carbon dioxide . . . The resulting higher temperatures mean longer and hotter heat waves and more groundlevel ozone; these in turn contribute to asthma attacks, cardiovascular disease, heart attacks and premature death. Climate change also increases the frequency and intensity of storms, droughts, wildfires and flooding; these are associated with accidental deaths, crop losses, air pollution, water contamination, and the spread of diseasecausing pathogens. If we as health and medical organizations are to protect the public’s health, it is vital that our nation make progress in the fight against climate change. The Congressional Review Act, if applied to BLM’s Methane and Waste Prevention Rule, would block feasible, affordable steps to reduce methane leakage. It would deprive Americans of vital protections from carcinogenic and neurotoxic substances and from climate change. Please make the health of your constituents your priority and reject the use of Congressional Review Act resolutions on actions that would protect our health and our current and future wellbeing. Sincerely, Alergy & Asthma Network, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, American Lung Association, American Public Health Association, American Thoracic Society, Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, Center for Climate Change & Health, Health Care Without Harm, National Association of County & City Health Officials, National Environmental Health Association, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Public Health Institute, Trust for America’s Health. 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Much has been said about what Colorado has been able to do as a State on this particular issue, and that’s good because Colorado, as a State, has the legal responsibility and legal authorization to work with the EPA on this particular issue. Naturally, industry would be liking that because the States are far more effective in dealing with industry than the BLM ever is, which still does not have statutory authority in this particular area. In fact, even Colorado has its limits. When they were cut out of the process on the stream buffer rule that we talked about earlier, they also joined the lawsuit against the EPA and against the Federal Government for that particular issue. It is simply hypocritical for BLM to pretend that this is about waste when they refuse to actually solve the problem by pipeline approval and rightsofway approval, which is the total solution. So what we come down to is that simply this is a rule that violates all three of the criteria set forth in the Congressional Review Act. It is a rule that is terribly expensive; it is a rule that is redundant; and it is a rule that exceeds the statutory authority of the entity that is making that particular rule, a prime candidate for use of the Congressional Review Act, which is our responsibility. It’s a congressional responsibility to establish these standards, not the executive branch agencies. If someone has decided not to vote for this resolution, to actually support this rule, I could ask: What is the deciding factor that pushed them over into accepting that position? Was it simply because this rule is redundant and unnecessary? That without this rule, emissions were being lowered and they were lowered before this rule was implemented and they will be lowered after this rule is decimated at the same time? Is it because of the redundancy? Did they decide to vote against this particular rule because, well, of the cost increase that it will bring? The idea that affordable energy is being harmed by this particular rule is real, and that means that any person is going to feel an increased cost in their energy consumption. Whether it is trying to heat his or her home or every time they turn on a lightbulb, this rule raises that cost. Once again, it hurts the people who are at the bottom of our economic level who are the most vulnerable to these kinds of increases. Is that what decided you to vote against this resolution or tipped you in the balance of trying to support the rule? Or is it simply the fact that it is an illegal rule? Is that the defining issue, that it simply is an illegal rule where they have no statutory authority to do what they did? If those criteria are not good enough, then I ask you and urge you to do something that actually helps people and helps reduce the cost of energy and make sure that we have affordable energy so this economic and energy renaissance that we have had in the last decade can continue not just on State and private lands, but it can continue on Federal lands as well, which it has not done. We need to do this to support people. We need to do this so that States can fund their infrastructure and States can actually fund their education system and people can turn on the lightbulb without having to take out a loan at the local bank to do so. This rule repeal is the right thing to do. You should vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution because it helps people. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res 36, expressing disapproval of the Methane Waste Rule submitted by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management. The Methane Waste Rule is a critical update to decades old regulation that provides clear and established requirements for the responsible extraction of methane gas ensuring that public health is not put at risk from these harmful emissions. The rule, crafted in an extensive and transparent public process in line with the Bureau of Land Management’s mandate to capture wasted methane, includes reasonable reforms to avoid and minimize waste of natural gas from flaring, venting and leaking from oil and gas production operations. Grounded in peer reviewed, scientific evidence, the rule updates 37year old regulations to keep pace with modern technological advancements. It promotes the replacement of older technology, with new, modern equipment that is cost effective, and, when combined with a broader scientific understanding of the deleterious effects caused by these activities both to public health and the environment, works to better protect the American people from these harmful emissions. With methane emissions increasing by 45 percent since 1990 and a 319 percent increase in flaring from 2009, the United States must act swiftly to not only protect public health, but the environment too. When these natural gases are released, they emit ozone destroying volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which are 86 times more destructive to the protective ozone in our atmosphere than carbon emissions. During the development of this critical rule, the Department of Interior received over 200,000 public comments, hosted public meetings, and engaged in broad outreach to stake 
holders nationwide over a 3year period. This rule was carefully developed and thoroughly considered. Furthermore, it is important that tax payers understand that this is also a costsavings rule, mitigating the over $330 million worth of natural gas wasted every year as a result of flaring, venting, and leaking. Ultimately, repealing the Methane Waste Rule would undermine the health, wellbeing, and economic prosperity of the American public and do nothing to combat the growing concern of climate change. I strongly urge my colleagues to reject H.J. Res 36. Any effort to undermine this important health, economic, and environmental protection results in a loselose situation for the American public and I oppose it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the joint resolution. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint resolution. The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The unfinished business is the question on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal, which the Chair will put de novo. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), the majority leader and my friend, for the purposes of inquiring of the schedule for the week to come. (Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morninghour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morninghour and noon for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected during the evening hours on Tuesday. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business today. Mr. Speaker, the House will also continue our work under the Congressional Review Act to undo onerous Obama administration regulations through three more joint resolutions. The first, sponsored by Representative BRETT GUTHRIE , will stop a rule that significantly expands the Federal Government’s involvement in teacher education. b1045 Without our action this could result in fewer teachers serving some of our 
Nation’s most vulnerable children, and it could make it harder for schools to recruit the best teachers. That is the exact opposite of what Americans want for their children. The second, sponsored by Representative TODD ROKITA , would address how the accountability provisions of the Every Student Succeeds Act are being implemented. This bipartisan law empowered States to hold schools accountable, but somehow, when the regulation came out, there was an expanded Federal role. This was not what Congress intended nor what is best for our students. And the third, Mr. Speaker, sponsored by Representative LIZCHENEY , addresses how the Department of the Interior regulates resource management plans. These plans guide how BLM manages all Federal lands. But the rule only addresses how BLM must deal with the public, as well as State and tribal governments. We are rightfully concerned that there is no process or procedure for local governments in these new rules. Finally, my friend may notice that a familiar face is not sitting next to me today, but Ben Howard is up in the gallery today. After serving 8 years on Capitol Hill, the last 6 in my office, our friend Ben has left the job. He is now working in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. Ben was one of the first people we hired when I was elected majority whip. It was here that most people around the Hill got to know Ben through his always witty floor updates and always constant Penn State football commentary. When I was elected majority leader, I asked Ben to be the floor director, a position in which he has served well for the past 2plus years. My friend would be happy to know that Ben is from Maryland. He was born and raised and currently resides in Olney with his wife, Amy, and their two young sons, John and Daniel. So on behalf of myself, our entire team, and the entire Republican Conference, I want to thank Ben for his years of service and for his hard work, and wish him many years of happiness. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the schedule of regulations to come. I am sure we will have some discussions about that next week. In fact, we are going to have some discussions about all of these regulations which we believe reduce the protections, according to the American people, by a number of the regulations that are sought to be repealed. However, first, Mr. Speaker, let me note that, first of all, we have another Ben in Maryland. He is the senior Senator, a former colleague of ours, BEN CARDIN . He had a TV ad which ended with ‘‘My Friend, Ben.’’ I want to say hi to my friend Ben, who has—indeed, as all of you know, I think the staff that serve with us make such an extraordinarily positive difference, and they sometimes—or most of the time—rise above what might be the partisan confrontation that Members have and continue to try to reach consensus so that this institution will run positively and well for the American people. Ben Howard has been one of those people. I know that Shuwanza Goff, who sits next to me and is my floor director, has worked very positively with Ben through the years and appreciates very much his working with us. Kelly also falls into that category. But Ben, we are going to miss you. I am sure that wherever you go, you are going to advantage the enterprise that you associate with. Olney, Maryland, is one of our thriving communities in Maryland. We are always proud of our Marylanders, and they always do a good job. So I will say to him, Godspeed. I don’t want to wish Penn State a lot of success, but, nevertheless, I do want to wish you a lot of success, Ben. Thank you very much for your service. Now let me move on to, perhaps, some subjects that we might not have as much agreement on as we do have on Ben Howard and his quality and the service he has given this institution. One of the first acts of Congress, of course, as you know, Mr. Leader, which was the plan, was to begin the reconciliation process to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The budget resolution set a deadline of January 27 for committees to report legislation repealing the law. It is now the 3rd of February, and after voting 65 times to repeal the ACA, House and Senate Republicans, Mr. Speaker, do not have, as far as I know, and don’t appear to have, a replacement and are, as I read in the papers, Mr. Speaker, divided on the path forward. Repealing the ACA without replacing it immediately will not only cause 30 million Americans to lose their coverage, but it would increase the cost for tens of millions more and would, I suggest, disadvantage everybody who has insurance, and clearly those who do not and would not have access. MARK MEADOWS , who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, said: ‘‘We need to slow down the process so we can understand a little bit more the specifics and the timetable of replacement votes and reconciliation instructions. . . .’’ That was in Politico on January 9 of this year. Senator BOBCORKER , in the Senate, said: ‘‘There’s more and more concerns about not doing’’ repeal and replace ‘‘simultaneously. You would think after 6 years, we would have a pretty good sense of what we would like to do.’’ We have not seen a repeal and replace bill. The President said it ought to be done contemporaneously. BOBCORKER  and others have said it ought to be done contemporaneously. We haven’t seen it. So my question, Mr. Majority Leader, is: Does the gentleman expect that if repeal does move forward, that a replacement bill would be considered simultaneously? I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am not sure if, in the beginning of your question, you want us to speed up or slow down, but I thank the gentleman for the question. Mr. HOYER. I can clarify that for the gentleman. Mr. MCCARTHY. I heard your question. Your question asked it both ways. Regardless of who won the election, the simple fact is ObamaCare is a failure. Regardless of who won the election, we would both be sitting here today having the same conversation about what we would replace it with. Let’s just simply talk about the facts. There were 23 coops created in ObamaCare. They were given $2 billion. As of today, 18 of them have failed. There are roughly a little more than 3,000 counties in America; 1,022 of those counties, roughly onethird, now only have one insurance company. Five States only have one insurance company, thanks to ObamaCare. All of America knows the old quotes: if you like your health plan, you can keep it—we know that is no longer true—or if you like your doctor, you can keep it—that is no longer true. When the President said that our premiums would go down by $2,500, now we know that is not true. So, yes, we would have this discussion regardless of who won this election. ObamaCare has failed. So, yes, we are going to work together, just as, after the last election, I put a letter out to every Governor, Republican or Democrat, every insurance commissioner, Republican or Democrat, to provide us with their ideas. We welcome every idea on the other side of the aisle, too, because we will do this differently. We welcome your ideas as well. If you noticed in the Energy and Commerce Committee, they have the hearing schedule. We will begin, and it will be an open process. We welcome your participation because we want a system that works, we do not want a system that has failed, and I believe we have the ideas to make it work correctly. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. We are not in agreement, Mr. Speaker. What we will be doing would be 180 degrees different. We would not be pretending that we are going to repeal an Affordable Care Act that has been a success. We do not agree, Mr. Speaker, that having 30 million Americans insured that were not insured before the Affordable Care Act is a failure. We do not agree that people with preexisting conditions who can now get insurance is a failure. We do not agree that people who are 26 or younger being on their family’s policy when they don’t have a job or alternative insurance is a failure. We do not agree that Americans having the security that their insurance will not be canceled because 
they reached an annual limit is a failure. We do not agree that Americans having no lifetime limit so that if they have a catastrophic illness they will still have coverage—that is not a failure. What is a failure is to have pretended for the last 6 years that they wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and have no replacement as of this time. That was a failure. The President says, Mr. Speaker, that his plan is going to make sure that everybody is insured, comprehensive coverage, and that costs will come down. He, of course, Mr. Speaker, has now offered a bill to effect that objective. We would welcome such a bill so that we can consider it. No, Mr. Speaker, had the 3 million additional people who voted for Hillary Clinton more so than voted for Donald Trump prevailed—the Electoral College prevailed, but the majority of the American people that voted, the plurality, voted for policies to keep the Affordable Care Act as Mrs. Clinton said she would do if she were elected. So, Mr. Speaker, the majority leader is in deep error on we would be having the same debate. But he is right; we had an outcome of a party and a President who said they were going to repeal the Affordable Care Act. GOP Conference Chair CATHY  MCMORRIS RODGERS stated: ‘‘Let me be clear: no one who has coverage because of ObamaCare today will lose that coverage.’’ The majority leader said something about the President saying, if you like your policy, you can keep it. In fact, the President was substantially right on that. Yes. Were there minimum coverages so that people weren’t scammed by insurance companies saying you got insurance, but, oh, by the way, we don’t cover that, by the way, we don’t cover that? Have you seen those ads about, I bought a new car and I had a wreck a day later and, guess what, the insurance company wants to give me 80 percent, 90 percent, 70 percent less? That is what the insurance companies were doing. People thought they had insurance for something, and they didn’t have it. So CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS says you are not going to lose anything. Well, I don’t know. If it was so bad, why don’t you repeal it? Why don’t you offer a bill to repeal it and to undermine all those factors of the Affordable Care Act that are now available to the Americans that I suggested? President Trump—I said this, but I want to repeat it—said last month that Republicans were nearing completion of an ACA replacement that would provide insurance for everybody. Bring it on. Bring it on. Insurance for everybody. Let’s see it. He went on to say his plan would have lower numbers, much lower deductibles. God bless him. Bring it on. Let us see it. Let’s vote on it. It is not on the floor, and I am not sure when it will be on the floor, but perhaps the majority leader could tell us. My question to you is: When do you expect such a bill consistent with the President’s representation to the American people of everybody having insurance and at lower cost and lower deductibles? When do we expect a bill like that on the floor? I yield to the majority leader. Mr. MCCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Since ObamaCare has passed and now that we know what was in it, you would know that there are 1,400 pages in there that give a great deal, amount of power to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Unfortunately, today, that Secretary has not been confirmed. That Secretary has not been confirmed simply because of politics. It is not on my side of the aisle. It is on the Democrats’ side of the aisle over in the Senate. b1100 Do you know how far they have gone? How much do they really want to work on health care when you actually said it needed to be reformed? They wouldn’t even show up in committee. So how much do they really care about Americans? They don’t even show up in committee to ask the questions. They wanted to run and hide. So how much do they really want to work? If we want to go quote by quote, when we go back to what President Obama said when the premiums were going to lower by $2,500, what do we say to Arizona when they went up 116 percent or to Tennessee by 63 percent and then threequarters of Tennessee counties only have one provider or to Minnesota by 59 percent or to Oklahoma by 59 percent or to Alabama, 58, or to Pennsylvania, 53, or to Nebraska, 51? Can we stop this rhetoric, and can we now get to work? Because I will tell you this: next month is when we begin because I am hopeful that we will no longer put up with the political games on the Senate side and that we will confirm the new Secretary because you have to have a Secretary in place if you want to reform ObamaCare, because you gave so much power to the Secretary. We all know that. So let’s work together on behalf of the American people and end this pain. I will tell you this: the unfortunate reality, in today’s system, is that coverage does not always mean care. The deductibles are so high that many people don’t even go to their doctors. I can tell you that in States, prior to ObamaCare, their highrisk pools were cheaper then for their care than now in just buying ObamaCare. We all know it is a failure. So let’s stop playing the political games, and let’s put the people before politics, and let’s put a system in that works. Our door is open, and the committee is open for all ideas. Let’s work together to solve it. Mr. HOYER. I thank the majority leader for his comments. I don’t think he wants me to delve very deeply into why we do not have a Secretary of Health and Human Services. It is because the Republicans have not produced nor has the nominee produced full disclosure, as the gentleman knows, of his financial dealings with respect to legislation that he introduced and supported. They want full information so that they can make a considered judgment. I won’t go further into that deep well, however. I will say to the gentleman that you don’t need a Secretary to bring legislation to the floor, and this is not an issue that is new this year or that is as a result of the November election of last year. It is, frankly, after 65 votes on this floor, to repeal the Affordable Care Act without having an alternative. I will tell my friend, the majority leader, with great respect, you have had 6 years. You can catalog all of the things that you think are bad. Obviously, you don’t mention any of the things that are good except so many in your caucus—perhaps the overwhelming majority of the caucus—say we are going to keep preexisting conditions, and we are going to keep 26. Of course, we are not going to eliminate annual limits, because that will hurt people and force them into bankruptcy. I don’t hear that discussion going on. But the fact of the matter is, Mr. Leader, you cannot get away from the fact that 6 years have gone by since we adopted the Affordable Care Act—6 years of complaining about how awful it is. By the way, as the gentleman knows, the majority of people now have made it very clear they do not want to repeal the Affordable Care Act unless they see a replacement on the table that they can consider and look to for alternatives. And that, as you know, Mr. Leader, is the first time in the 6 years because people said, ‘‘yes, we don’t like the Affordable Care Act’’ in a vacuum, but now, when it really may be repealed, they are looking at it much more closely, and they don’t know what is going to replace it, and they are concerned. I have, I will tell you, family after family after family—I had somebody come up to me in the grocery store two nights ago, at Harris Teeter—with tears in his eyes—who said: Don’t let them repeal the Affordable Care Act. I have a son who has a dire illness; and but for the fact of the Affordable Care Act, he would not be covered, and we couldn’t keep him alive—with tears in his eyes. So, when I hear you cataloging some of the things, those cases aren’t mentioned. The 30 million aren’t mentioned. The preexisting condition isn’t mentioned. I will say to my friend that you don’t need a Secretary of Health and Human Services to bring a bill forward. Mr. MCCARTHY. Yes, you do. Mr. HOYER. Going to go to another subject, Mr. Leader, obviously, we are very concerned about the Affordable Care Act, but we are also very concerned—as we talked about executive 
orders on this refugee ban that were issued, according to almost everybody, without much consultation with anybody other than within the White House—of an order banning Muslim refugees from coming into this country even after very strong vetting. I know that the position is, oh, this is not a ban. The complication you have to that representation is the President keeps mentioning it as a ban, as he said he was going to do in the election, and he referred to it as a ban just a few days ago. But I would point out to you, Mr. Leader—and I am sure you know this—not a single terrorist act—not one—has been perpetrated by a refugee coming into this country from any one of the seven nations mentioned in the ban. We believe this is not only contrary to the Constitution but that it is contrary to our principles. Let me make it clear, Mr. Leader, so that there is no confusion: nobody on this side of the aisle doesn’t want to make America’s borders secure, America’s land and assets safe, and the American people safe. Every one of us on this side of the aisle wants to make sure that that happens, and we certainly want to make sure that the vetting is appropriate. As the majority leader knows, the vetting today is a very long and very careful process. We believe this ban alienates our allies and emboldens terrorists who are now saying: See, this really is a war on Islam. That will not be consistent with the safety of our men and women whom we have at the point of the spear and will not be consistent to the safety and security of our allies in the Middle East. Senators MCCAINand G RAHAM have said exactly that. They pointed out: ‘‘Our government has a responsibility to defend our borders, but we must do so in a way that makes us safer and upholds all that is decent and exceptional about our nation.’’ This is JOHN MCCAINand L INDSEY GRAHAM . ‘‘It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump’s executive order was not properly vetted.’’ Senator GRAHAM and Senator MCCAIN, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the gentleman from South Carolina. They go on: ‘‘We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. Such a hasty process risks harmful results.’’ This continues to be a quote by Senator MCCAINand Senator G RAHAM . ‘‘Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a selfinflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.’’ Senator MCCAIN knows something about increased risk. He went on to say, along with Senator GRAHAM : ‘‘This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.’’ They said that on the 29th of January, just 4 days ago. At least four times this week, Mr. Leader, we asked for the consideration of H.R. 724, which rescinds and defunds the refugee ban. The Speaker said, when he took office initially—and he repeated this year—that we were going to have an open, transparent process and that we would consider the important issues of the day on this floor, with an opportunity for every Member of this House to offer alternatives. I know the committee would not report it out, but this is a critical issue to our country, to our safety, and to our values; and I ask the gentleman: Is there a possibility that you would bring to the floor next week or the week thereafter—preferably next week—H.R. 724 so that the Members of this House—the people’s Representatives—could speak to this critically important issue consistent with the observations of Senator MCCAINand Senator GRAHAM ? I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I listened to the Speaker when he took office, too, and he also said ‘‘regular order.’’ In the schedule for next week, it is not on the list. The executive order signed by the President, really, as you know, is based on legislation that passed this House with overwhelming bipartisan support. It was following the attacks over the past 2 years. It was the SAFE Act that passed this House 289–137, and the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act that passed by 407–19. I will point out that these two bills received vetoproof majorities, and President Obama signed the visa waiver bill into law. President Trump’s actions are temporary pauses and reassess our vetting procedures to keep our country safe. While there was, certainly, some confusion with how this was implemented over the weekend, the Secretary of Homeland Security is effectively addressing key issues to ensure legal permanent residents who are returning to our country are allowed entry unless our security services have a compelling reason to suggest otherwise. America remains a place of refuge for those seeking peace, freedom, and opportunity across the world. Now, my friend knows, because we have been in meetings this week, that our rhetoric matters. Other people listen to what we say. In these types of situations, especially with a new administration, I have always told my children: at any time in a situation, let’s take a deep breath; let’s not lose our heads. Especially with a brand new administration, I try to give them the benefit of the doubt. They don’t have their Cabinet there yet. Let’s let them get their footing. It is not a ban—it is a pause. It is based upon two pieces of legislation that passed this House. You love to quote people; so if I may: ‘‘House Democrats and House Republicans have no greater priority than keeping Americans safe. This is neither a partisan issue nor is it a partisan difference. Many Americans are frustrated with the pace of progress against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. I want to see the administration and Congress working together to protect our Nation. The reforms in this bill are an excellent start. ‘‘This legislation will make it easier for law enforcement to vet those visitors who are coming from Visa Waiver countries, such as in Europe, to ensure that we are not admitting those who have traveled to places like Iraq and Syria and link up with ISIS.’’ That was said by you. Mr. HOYER. I think that is an excellent quote, which I still agree with. Mr. MCCARTHY. So you know the importance. What I would say to the gentleman is: let’s work with this administration. As we sat in our meeting this week with leaders of other countries, I thought their advice to us was good advice: let’s not say what this is not, because we may get political points with one another, but it puts them in harm’s way, and they know what the truth of this is. I think you and I agree on a lot of different things, and we are cordial with one another when we disagree, and I think this is an area in which sometimes we may disagree, but sometimes we have shown we could agree. b1115 I know you want to keep America safe, and I know we want to keep America safe. I also know it is a brand new administration. I also know that when I go down to that White House—you have been there with me—there is not a lot of staff there. I know there are going to be a few hiccups along the way. I am going to work with them. I am going to help them, and I want you to help us help them as well. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, may I ask the gentleman from California to do something? The advice that the gentleman gives to his children about taking a breath, perhaps before they tweet—— Mr. MCCARTHY. My kids don’t tweet. Mr. HOYER. That is good advice as well. Would you give that advice to the President of the United States and tell him to take a breath before he makes policy or before he offends our allies or before he creates great fear in those who hear what he has to say off the cuff? Yes, I understand that rhetoric counts. You might talk to him about that as well. He is the one that calls this a ban. I know that everybody else is trying to clean it up, and I hope that 
is the case. In fact, I have seen the head of Homeland Security, Secretary Kelly, trying to clean it up. It is a darn shame that it wasn’t cleaned up before. It was a darned shame that the time was not taken to do an order that would make sure that vetting was appropriate, as my quote and our legislation that you talked about urged. It is good advice to your children and good advice to this President: Take a breath. Just don’t, as immediately it comes to mind, tweet it and have the impact not known to you, your staff, or to the country. Almost invariably, we have seen this has a negative effect. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, President Obama said that he was rooting for President Trump’s success. I would also give the advice, let’s not root against him. He still doesn’t have his own Cabinet. When I watched and listened to what some on the other side of their own leadership say about some there, I could see where the rhetoric continues to rise. I think we should put that down. The election is over, and now is the time to govern. There are big problems out there. We can score as many political points as we want back and forth, but there are challenges. You and I have worked together on so many issues out here, from opioids, from the visa waiver so many different times. And we have disagreed others times. I think it would behoove us and the American public that we can show the leadership to do that, and I look forward to working with you on these issues. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comment. I think we have demonstrated over the years that we ascribe to that concept. My point to you is, in the first 10 or 12 days of this administration, that concept has been put at great risk. I think the gentleman’s advice is good, and we have pursued that. I simply urge the gentleman from California to suggest to the President of the United States that he adopt that concept as well. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, it is good to have these colloquies back. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 2017, TO MONDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2017 Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, February 6, 2017, when it shall convene at noon for morninghour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BERGMAN ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO GARY ANDRES (Mr. UPTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a very good friend, certainly a trusted adviser and, by everyone’s account, one of the very best staff directors ever on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Gary Andres. I first met Gary when he was a young staffer working in the White House for President Bush 41. Over the years, I became so close with both Gary and his wonderful wife, Sue. Gary came on board day one for my committee chairmanship, and we assembled an allstar staff of the most professional, talented, and kind people on Capitol Hill. In Gary, we got a trusted counselor with a strategic mind second to none. Gary also understands that sometimes you can’t change the direction of the winds, but you can adjust your sails so that you are always going to reach that destination. Nowhere was this more important than during our herculean, bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act effort. For more than 3 years, Gary was our five star general; and thanks to his tireless leadership, we got the job done for patients and families across the country. What drove us more than anything else was that the clock was ticking for folks with terrible diseases, and we couldn’t waste a day to get this bipartisan bill to the President for him to sign into law. It ended up being what many say was the most significant legislation enacted in the 114th Congress. But it went beyond the 21st Century Cures Act. There were 562 hearings, 354 measures through the House, 200 signed into law in the last 6 years, substantial legislative wins. Whether it be the doc fix, saving Medicare, pipeline safety, health reforms, opioids, so many more, Gary was with us at the table. Gary understands how important this institution is. He has a reverence for the people’s House. But Gary was also quick with a smile, a witty insight, or a laugh. He never lost his perspective, his temper, or eagerness to engage on an issue. I know I speak for all of the Members and staff on both sides of the aisle when we say: Thank you, Gary. We are going to miss you, but we know that we are going to continue to lean on you for advice no matter what the issue is. As Gary moves on to that next venture, I wish him the very best. To his wonderful wife, Sue, who is in the gallery today, it has been an honor to work with this distinguished gentleman. HONORING GARY ANDRES (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I second and reiterate what my colleague from Michigan (Mr. U PTON ) just said about Gary Andres. I actually remember, when I was first elected to Congress in 1988 and when the first President Bush was President, being outside of the Capitol, outside the House Chambers and talking to Gary. He was, I believe, the White House congressional liaison at the time. I was a young Member and didn’t really know what was going on around here with a Republican President; and Gary was so warm, so helpful, trying to help me out, even though I was of the other party, even though I was a freshman Member. And that continued on so many occasions, both under President Bush and, of course, afterwards and most recently, with the Energy and Commerce Committee as a staff director. What Representative UPTON said is absolutely true, Gary was always the fighter for the Republicans, for the majority; but at the same time, he always wanted to work with Democrats. Gary, like Congressman UPTON , believed very strongly that if we were going to accomplish anything, it had to be done on a bipartisan basis. I know Congressman UPTON mentioned in particular the 21st Century Cures Act, but it was true with everything. One of the reasons that we were so successful, I think, in the last session in doing so many pieces of legislation that were important to the country was not only because of Congressman UPTON and his leadership, but also because of Gary and his working with Jeff Carroll, who is our minority staff director. So I wish Gary well. There are very few people that I can say, over the last 29 years that I have been here, who was always trying to reach out and do the right thing. I think that is so important. So congratulations and good luck in the future, Gary. 
IN APPRECIATION OF GARY ANDRES (Mr. WALDEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, as the new chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I, too, want to join in showing my appreciation and affection for Gary. He has given our committee and, dare I say, our country incredible service for many years. I am grateful for his friendship, I am grateful for his guidance, his counsel and, as we have gone through this transition, his advice, a steady hand, incredible intellect, a curiosity about how to get policy done. 
From his start on Capitol Hill working in both Bush administrations and then leading the Energy and Commerce Committee staff effort, he has this passion for public service. He is relentless in his devotion to serving the American people and to driving the committee over time and really putting together a great team. As you have heard, because of his leadership, the committee successfully shepherded through dozens of pieces of really important bipartisan legislation for the American people that have made their lives better, such as the 21st Century Cures Act, modernizing our chemical safety laws, improving pipeline safety, among many others. We are fortunate to have had such a gifted adviser, exceptional leader, tireless advocate at the helm of this committee staff for the last 6 years. It has been a real honor, Gary, to work with you. I wish you, Sue, and your whole family the very best in the years ahead. You have given this country incredible service, and we appreciate you for that. God bless you and Godspeed. 
BABY FATEMEH (Ms. BONAMICI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, this is Fatemeh. She is not a terrorist. She is a 4monthold baby girl who is in immediate need of open heart surgery. Her parents desperately want the best care for her, so they planned to bring her from their home in Iran to Portland, Oregon, to one of the best hospitals for pediatric heart surgery. That is where Fatemeh’s uncle and grandparents all live. They are U.S. citizens. Then President Trump hastily issued the executive order, and the family’s plans were brought to a halt. The order is supposed to expire in 90 days, but Fatemeh’s family does not know if she can wait that long. Now, I don’t know what the President had in mind when he signed that order, but it probably wasn’t baby Fatemeh. Keeping 4monthold babies out of our country does not make us safer. It puts her life in danger and it diminishes the United States in the eyes of the world. My office has reached out to Fatemeh’s family in Oregon to be of assistance, but it is heartbreaking and disgraceful that this even happened. I hope the courts invalidate this unconstitutional executive order soon, and I hope it is in time for baby Fatemeh. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF MENTORING (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the importance and impact of mentoring in our society. I recently heard from a constituent, Karissa, who works with the Boys & Girls Club in my district in Bryant, Arkansas. One of her mentees was struggling, having trouble in school, finding it difficult to build friendships with her fellow students. Karissa’s guidance and encouragement helped build confidence, which led to participation in the school’s JROTC program and improving her camaraderie with her fellow cadets. Atrisk youth face many difficult challenges, and life is infinitely more challenging without the support of caring adults. With mentors, atrisk youth are less likely than their peers to skip school or use drugs and are more likely to go to college, play sports, and volunteer in our communities. Whether it is through a mentoring organization like Scouting or the Boys & Girls Clubs, a nonprofit, a religious institution, or school, being a positive influence for our young people goes a long way in strengthening our communities and serving the best interest of our children. f 
b1130 DON’T REPEAL ACA WITHOUT A REPLACEMENT (Mr. HECK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, Shirley is from my district, and I heard from her this past December when she told me about her daughter, Sarah. Sarah has had health problems all of her life and, unfortunately, because it has been too expensive, she has not been able to afford health insurance, but she was finally able to be covered under the Affordable Care Act because of the historic Medicaid expansion. It made a big difference in her life because just 2 years ago, she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Now, Sarah may be just a statistic to some, and, indeed, she is 1 of 601,000 Washingtonians who have been covered under the Medicaid expansion; 20,000 of whom have been treated for cancer. But to Sarah’s mother, Sarah can’t just be boiled down to an ACA statistic. To Shirley, Sarah is her daughter who will lose this coverage if Congress repeals the healthcare law without a comparable replacement. It would put Sarah, in her fight against thyroid cancer, back to square one. Friends and colleagues, I plead with you, go to your districts. Talk to the Shirleys; talk to the Sarahs. Listen to them. Their stories matter because they matter. 
THE MENACE OF THE DESERT— WARMONGER (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Ayatollah, the menace of the desert, had defied yet another U.N. resolution prohibiting missile tests. No surprise. Iran just can’t follow the rules. Time and time again, Iran has tested ballistic missiles with no consequences. The last time, they launched two missiles with ‘‘Israel must be wiped off the Earth’’ written on them in Hebrew. Also, the Ayatollah has clearly stated numerous times he wants to destroy the United States. Even worse, Mr. Speaker, we are paying him to do it. Yes, that is right. Obama slipped the rogue tyrant $150 billion hoping that appeasement would make the Ayatollah be nice. Well, guess what? Obama was wrong, and the U.S. is less safe. The Ayatollah, in my opinion, is using our money to build weapons to destroy us. Mr. Speaker, there must be clear consequences for the dictator of Iran and his mullah cronies for warmongering. The people of Iran need to change this regime, and the menace of the desert just needs to go. And that is just the way it is. f 
CONDEMNING ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE BY RUSSIAN BACKED SEPARATISTS (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I strongly condemn the escalation of violence in eastern Ukraine by Russianbacked separatists and call for an immediate withdrawal of heavy weapons. I am deeply concerned about the loss of life and deteriorating humanitarian conditions that exist there. There has been an ‘‘uncountable’’ amount of violations of the Minsk agreement according to the OSCE. Russian separatist forces must immediately honor the ceasefire to allow for humanitarian assistance. I call on this administration to step up and see this through. Thousands have already died in this conflict, including at least eight in just the last 5 days. Seventeen thousand civilians, including 2,500 children, do not have access to water, electricity, or heat during the height of winter. I urge Secretary Tillerson to provide Ukraine with defensive weapons—as Congress has already approved—and to provide meaningful support to our Ukranian allies against Putin’s aggression. When it comes to Russia, we must see this administration’s true colors. 
CELEBRATING CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today marks the conclusion of the annual Catholic Schools 
Week in America, and I rise today to celebrate these quality educational institutions. This year, the theme celebrated was ‘‘Catholic Schools: Communities of Faith, Knowledge and Service.’’ Schools across the country observe the week with masses, open houses, and other activities for students, families, parishioners, and community members. Through these events, schools focus on the value Catholic education provides to young people and contributions to their church, communities, and to our Nation. Mr. Speaker, Catholic schools provide an excellent education to Catholics and nonCatholics alike. These schools offer academic excellence and faithfilled education for students nationwide. National test scores, high school graduation rates, college attendance, and other data show Catholic schools frequently outperform schools in both the public and private sectors. While there have been challenges to enrollment in some areas, the good news is that there is a strong demand and enthusiasm for the rigorous and quality education Catholic schools provide. Nearly 30 percent of the schools have waiting lists for admission, and new schools are opening across the country. Congratulations to all involved in Catholic Schools Week and your efforts to educate the next generation. 
ISIS AND FORCES OF DARKNESS (Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, as many have explained on this floor, Trump’s executive order, his Muslim ban, repudiates our values and violates our Constitution. After 20 years on the Foreign Affairs Committee, I think it is important to come to this floor and explain how that executive order is harmful to our national security. Trump’s executive order plays right into the ISIS narrative. It says that there is a clash of civilizations and that all Islam is our enemy. ISIS, which has, perhaps, a few hundred thousand followers, dreams of convincing all of Islam—dreams of convincing 1.5 billion Muslims—that they are at war with America and the West. We do not have a clash of civilizations. We have a clash between civilization and the forces of darkness bent on destroying civilization, whether they reside in Raqqa or at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 
IN MEMORY OF GRANT RONNEBECK (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of a young man who would have been my constituent. Two years ago last week, 21yearold Grant Ronnebeck was manning the counter at a Mesa, Arizona convenience store. An illegal alien walked into the store and shot Grant in the head, killing him, over a pack of cigarettes that the man did not want to pay for. The illegal immigrant, Apolinar Altamirano, had been out on bond awaiting deportation due to a violent criminal history. Grant had his whole life ahead of him, but lost it because of the failure of his government to protect him from criminally violent, illegal immigrants. I have introduced H.R. 486, otherwise known as Grant’s Law. This bill would end the practice of releasing illegal aliens guilty of deportable crimes so they are no longer a danger to innocent American citizens. I was emboldened last week when President Donald Trump invited Grant’s father, Steve, to the White House to witness the signing of an executive order administratively ending this dangerous policy. I am thankful for a President that protects Americans and seeks the rule of law. However, if Congress fails to pass H.R. 486, this policy remains a temporary Presidential order and does not carry the permanent force of law. We must make sure that Grant’s fate never again happens to any young man or woman. We must pass Grant’s Law. f 
THE WEEK IN REVIEW The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, here it is, Friday. It has been a good week in Washington. We have gotten some of President Trump’s nominees approved and through the Senate. Call them like you see them, I think. Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL  has done a great job this week. I applaud his efforts. And as a result of what President Trump has been doing—and actually part of it is just his getting elected—has done for our economy because people know—at least a lot of people know—he is going to keep his word. He is already showing he is doing that, and he has repealed some of the executive orders that have been doing so much damage to our economy. And when we say economy, what we mean is, the rank and file people, the backbone of America who have been struggling, who have made less money than they did 8 years ago when adjusted for inflation. Those are the people we are talking about; those who have been out of work, the 94 or 95 million who have become so desperate, they pulled out of even applying for work. I enjoyed, to an extent, the exchange between my friend, KEVIN MCCARTHY  and my friend across the aisle Leader HOYER . And I get amused when I hear Democrats quoting Senator MCCAIN and Senator GRAHAM —wonderful people. LINDSEY GRAHAM , it is a real joy to be around talking to LINDSEY GRAHAM . But if you look at positions they have taken, it would make you think twice about quoting them as positions you wanted to have supporting yours. I mean, nothing stands taller than the 30 million of the 90 million or so living in Egypt, when they rose up that June because a Muslim brother named Morsi was seizing power. He was on his way to becoming the Chavez in North Africa, and the people rose up. It was not only the largest peaceful demonstration in the history of the world, it was the largest demonstration in the history of the world. All over Egypt, moderate Muslims, Christians, Jews, secularists, they all rose up, went to the streets and demanded the removal of the man who would be king, the Muslim brother named Morsi. The difference in this king is, as many of the Egyptians have pointed out when I have been in Cairo and other places, he wasn’t just going to be king. He was going to be the puppet of the spiritual leader of Islam in Egypt. Some of my Egyptian friends, when I have been over there, say: yeah, we have seen video of him taking his orders from the spiritual imam, and he followed his leadership. So if that is true, then he wasn’t just going to be king. He was going to be a king puppet. But the Muslim brother was removed as a result of 30 million people rising up peacefully. Morsi only, allegedly, got around 13 million to claim the win and made clear his opponent knew—for the original Presidential election—that if he raised a stink about any votes being fraudulent, they would burn the country down—that was some of his supporters. Because the Muslim Brotherhood, if you go back and check, when churches are burned, it is normally the Muslim Brotherhood over there. In Egypt, they had been anathema to representative government, to civilized government, to nonsectarian government. They want a new caliphate to start with basically the old Ottoman Empire and Erdogan in Turkey; he is undoing all of the great reforms made by the great Ataturk nearly 100 years ago, and he is undoing them. b1145 There are those in Turkey who would like to see a caliphate—a new Ottoman Empire—and it have its leadership in Turkey. They long for the days when they ruled an expansive caliphate. I had a reporter say: Why would you say that? I said: Go look at a map. I know you weren’t ever taught what the Ottoman Empire was. Go look at a map and look at the countries where our President is supporting an uprising that eventually, if we don’t stop it, will become anarchy or it will become part of the caliphate. 
The new jobs report that is just out: 227,000 new jobs. And from what I’m hearing from constituents, these aren’t just the parttime jobs or the minimum wage jobs that the previous President bragged about. He had to brag about it because he didn’t have anything else to talk about. People lost their fulltime jobs and could only acquire parttime jobs, and this administration bragged about those. If they got two parttime jobs to make up for losing their full time job, this Administration bragged: We created two jobs. I would submit that when you are creating two jobs by causing a person to lose all of their benefits and full time employment, you haven’t done such a good thing. Fortunately, the people of Egypt did not listen to Senator MCCAINand Senator GRAHAM when they flew to Cairo and begged for the people of Egypt to return the Muslim ‘‘brother who would be king’’ back into his royal kingship. I know they weren’t intentionally supporting an evil ruler; it is just they didn’t know. So, hopefully, they will become more aware that it is not a good thing to support the Muslim Brotherhood. With regard to Australia and the alleged news about President Trump getting into it with the leader of Australia, well, to whom is the leader of Australia accountable? To whom does the leader of Australia owe his allegiance? It is the people of Australia. So when he calls or talks to President Trump and begs or demands Trump to take these refugees that the Prime Minister in Australia knows are a threat to the safety of the Australian people, when he wants them out of Australia, there is a reason—because his allegiance is not to the people of the United States—his allegiance is to the people of Australia. So, naturally, being allegiant to the people of Australia, he wants the dangerous refugees out of Australia. President Obama, basically by his actions, in effect, was saying: Give us not your tired, your poor, the people yearning to be free, but give us your people that yearn to destroy America because we’re going to bring them in. We’re not going to vet them properly because we have got no information to properly vet them. That’s how we have been able to let people in who had their fingerprints on IEDs that killed Americans, and maimed Americans because we are not properly vetting them. Oh, yeah, we compare any information we have against what we’ve got. But don’t forget, as Phil Haney, the whistleblower from Homeland Security, pointed out, he was personally required to delete massive pages of information about terrorist ties of people coming into the United States because they did not want those terrorist ties in the Homeland Security database. Then he also, of course, was on his computer when he saw somebody above his pay grade deleting things that he personally put in about terrorist ties. They were deleting them. So when Janet Napolitano talks about, We get a ping and we connect the dots, she caused massive numbers of dots to be deleted. They are not there. We don’t know who we are getting. When anyone comes from Syria— we know ISIS has taken governmental printing areas before. They can produce official Syrian passports not with the support of the Syrian Government, but just because they have the equipment to do it. So when we get information saying, I am from Syria, maybe they are, and maybe they’re not. We don’t know where they’re from. The FBI Director created one of the most incredible political stunts of any FBI Director in history last summer when he stepped up and outlined that a crime had been committed by Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. But then he goes on to say: But no reasonable prosecutor would pursue this. It is incredible the extent he went to to help Hillary Clinton. I know there were some of my Democratic friends that got mad at him when a week before the election he said that they were reopening the investigation. But if you look at the circumstances, it was information that we had FBI agents who were so upset that Comey wouldn’t reopen the investigation. When they knew some of what was in the computers that they had gotten ahold of belonged to Anthony Weiner and Hillary Clinton’s closest adviser and confidante, Huma Abedin Weiner, the word was we had FBI agents saying that: If you don’t reopen, we’re going to have a press conference, we’re going to resign, and we’re going to out you that you’re protecting Hillary Clinton. So what could he do to help Hillary Clinton but say: ‘‘I am going to reopen the investigation?’’ I commented to somebody in the media back then: 
Well, of course, it may appear to help Hillary. We will know whether that was his intent or not because you can’t examine tens of thousands of emails adequately. You can do an algorithm search, but you can’t adequately investigate them for a crime, including false statements to the FBI, within a week. So if he comes out before the election and says that there is nothing here, then we know why he came out and said that we are reopening. It was to stop FBI agents from resigning and from outing him for protecting Hillary Clinton. 
So what happens? Two days before the election, he said: Yeah, we checked it all out. He couldn’t possibly have. He said: We checked it all out, and there is nothing here to prosecute. So that same FBI Director, though, didn’t help the Obama administration. On occasion, he was calling them like he saw them; and that is: 
Yeah, we will vet these people, but when they give us information from Syria, we have no information against which to vet that. We have to accept it for what it is because, yeah, we’re technically vetting it against what we have, but we have nothing, so we don’t know who these people are. So, in the meantime, the economy is turning around. How sad is it when we have just lived through 8 years under a President’s policies that were so abysmal for the good of America that the economy, when adjusted for inflation, was slower than it was in the 4 years of Jimmy Carter? I know there are some in the media that would grab 1 month and say: See, this was a good month. Let’s look at the 8 years compared to the 4 years of President Carter, 4 of the worst years for the American economy in history since the Depression. President Obama, over 8 years, had a slower economy when adjusted for inflation. That is pretty sad. It is also sad this week to read this article from The Daily Caller: ‘‘Laura Wilkerson, whose teenage son was tortured and murdered by an illegal alien in 2010, got into an emotional confrontation with House Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at a CNN town hall event Tuesday night. ‘‘Wilkerson told Pelosi, ‘In 2010, one of the illegals slaughtered my son. He tortured him, he beat him, he tied him up like an animal, and he set him on fire. And I am not a onestory mother. This happens every day because there are no laws enforced at the border. We have to start giving American families first.’ ‘‘On the issue of Pelosi and Democrats’ support for sanctuary cities, Wilkerson asked, ‘How do you reconcile in your head about allowing people to disavow the law?’ ‘‘‘There’s nothing, I’m sure, that can compare to the grief that you have, and so I pray for you,’ Pelosi said.’’ PELOSI went on: ‘‘But I do want to say to you that in our sanctuary cities, our people are not disobeying the law. These are lawabiding citizens. It enables them to be there without being reported to ICE in case of another crime that they might bear witness to.’’ ‘‘Pelosi then asked if her son was murdered in a sanctuary city. Josh, Wilkerson’s son, was murdered just outside Houston, Texas, which is a sanctuary city.’’ So I believe in the power of prayer. I think it’s one of the greatest gifts God gave us. C.S. Lewis talked about we are here on Earth behind enemy lines, if you would. Can you imagine being behind enemy lines and getting messages from your home headquarters and you refuse to open them and read them? He says that we have a Bible. Those are messages from our home headquarters. We ought to be reading them. I do believe in the power of prayer, just like our minority leader, Ms. PELOSI ; but we need to distinguish between things that we should pray for and things that we can fix ourselves. Things that are outside our control, we 
ought to be praying about. Those things which are in our control—when it is within your control—to return to the rule of law, enforce the laws that exist, treat everybody fairly under the law, that’s something you don’t really have to pray about. You just help us do it. I have not met Tommy Nelson, a pastor in Denton, Texas, but I listened to a 12hour Bible study he did; and one of his comments on that study in Ecclesiastes was basically what so many people say: We don’t have to worry; God is in control. Tommy Nelson said: Yeah, God is in control, but just because He is in control doesn’t mean He wants us to lean on our shovel and pray for a hole. When you have got a shovel in your hand, you don’t have to pray for a hole; you just start digging. When you have got the tools to protect the American people and enforce the rule of law, you just do it. Now, you can pray for wisdom to help you as you go. I know it may have been a Freudian slip—may not have been—but when Minority Leader PELOSI was asked about illegal aliens, she referred to them as ‘‘our people.’’ I don’t know; could that be because they know when illegal aliens vote, they vote Democrat? We know that most dead people vote 100 percent Democrat. I have encouraged the Republican Party: Let’s don’t have any group that we’re not willing to recruit votes from, and traditionally dead people vote 100 percent Democrat. Perhaps it’s time that some of them started voting Republican for a change. In any event, the minority whip, Mr. HOYER , was talking about a fellow with tears in his eyes saying: Please don’t repeal ObamaCare because my son will be unable to get insurance if you repeal ObamaCare. Well, that gets to all of us when somebody with tears in their eyes comes to us and begs for help. The only reason he had tears in his eyes is because of the false information being put out by the Democratic Party, because when we repeal ObamaCare, people are not going to lose their insurance. Some Americans have a right to be skeptical because they were told by President Obama and all of the Democrats: No, no, when we pass ObamaCare, nobody loses their insurance. Well, we found out that that was a lie to millions of Americans. Some of them were able to get insurance. Some of it ended up being Medicaid. Most of the new people got Medicaid, which is not really the insurance they were hoping for, but that’s the insurance most people got. b1200 I had 17 people come to my office in Lufkin. They were looking to make a show and not so much to give information; otherwise, they would have called for an appointment. My district representative there was at a service honoring her late father at a hospice and she forgot, in her emotional state, to put a note on the door that she was running to that. Anyway, they made a big deal, here is an office not occupied. Hopefully, they will have a little sympathy for somebody in her situation. But they weren’t looking to get information to me. That is why the reporter had more information about the meeting when my office had no information about the meeting. If they want an appointment, we make appointments. I am here most of the time, so I can’t be there. I have got people to meet with them. This article, February 1, Melissa Quinn, Daily Signal: ‘‘Pamela Weldin’s experiences with ObamaCare can be boiled down to just a few numbers. Since the health care law’s implementation 3 years ago, Weldin, 60, has lost her insurance four different times’’—under ObamaCare. ‘‘And the Nebraska woman is currently enrolled in her fifth new insurance policy in four years.’’ She said: ‘‘‘Yet again, and through no fault of my own’. . . . ‘I’m just sitting here minding my own business, and here we go again.’’’ She gets thrown off another insurance policy. Anyway, she goes on to explain she has been denied coverage because of a preexisting condition related to her career as a dental hygienist. People are not going to lose their insurance. All we are going to do is create the opportunity to have far better insurance policies than you have got under ObamaCare. You are not going to get a penalty for having better insurance than what ObamaCare required. So you don’t have to pay a penalty, and you can have good insurance and you won’t be taxed for having better insurance. It is going to be a great day for America to do that. That brings me to a point I want to get to next about the wall. An article here, February 1, Virginia Hale from Breitbart, says: ‘‘Smuggling Migrants to Europe Now a Major Funding Source for Islamic State.’’ Well, it only makes sense that the Islamic State would figure that out, because we had information they consulted with the drug cartels in Mexico. As the Border Patrolmen have told me during the middle of the night the times I have been down there, there is not an inch of the Mexican border that is not controlled by some drug cartel. Nobody crosses that border illegally without paying something to the drug cartel or promising to work for them when they get to America. What a great business model. You are selling drugs, making billions of dollars getting it across the border illegally into the United States, and, unlike most businesses where you have to pay the employee, they get the employee to pay them as part of their debt repayment to get them into the United States. So, what a business model, making billions from selling drugs illegally gotten into the United States, and then the Department of Homeland Security, as one told me down on the border: They call us their logistics, in the drug cartels, because we ship people all over the country to cities where they need drug sales, prostitutes, mules. We send them there, and then they have got people selling drugs for them. If we build a wall—and I know there are areas like where the Rio Grande is so wide you don’t need a wall, you just have people guard the border—it cuts off the massive flow of drugs into the United States. It means the billions of dollars going to the drug cartels that they can use to corrupt the Mexican Government will dry up to thousands. Drug cartels know it. So I would submit, Mr. Speaker, the only Mexican leaders that object to a wall and total security of our border between Mexico are either ignorant— they don’t understand that the reason they are 60something in world economies instead of being fourth or fifth or sixth is because of the corruption that comes from the drug cartels. You dry up the billions of dollars they are making with a wall and border security, and Mexico gets in the top 10 economies. But, yes, it means the drug cartels dry up. They are either ignorant of what will really happen when we secure the border or they are in the pocket of the drug cartels. Those are the only two choices. If you are a Mexican leader and you oppose the United States enforcing our border, you are in the pocket of the drug cartels or you are just ignorant of why your economy is not one of the top 10 in the world. You have got the best location. You have got two continents north and south above you. They would be great markets. You have got two great oceans on either side to ship. You have got incredible natural resources. You have got some of the hardest working people in the world in Mexico. So why is it so far down the chain of economies? Well, drug cartels. The wall and border security will dry them up and the Mexican people will be free with a vibrant economy, and they will take their appropriate place in the great economies of the world. I have been joined by my friend from Florida, and I mean that truly. I think the world of MATTGAETZ . I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ). Mr. GAETZ. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the danger that is currently posed by the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran and its fundamentalist government pose the gravest threat to global peace, stability in the Middle East, and Israel’s existence. Iran continues to extend its dangerous hegemony through the region in places such as Lebanon, by arming and training Hezbollah; in Gaza, by arming Hamas; in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. 
Iran’s taking hostage of U.S. sailors and its continued ballistic missile tests and death threats to Israel highlights Iran’s evil intentions and the need for the United States to play a leading role in rolling back Iran’s growing influence and its push to destabilize the Middle East and the world. These issues have been exacerbated by the irresponsible and catastrophic nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1. It is obvious to anyone that the $150 billion given to Iran will be used to fund more terror and further Iran’s destructive ambitions. In addition, the nuclear deal legitimizes Iran’s ability to enrich uranium and functionally ensures Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon within 10 years. The deal is structured to mask Iran’s inevitable noncompliance. As a member of the Florida Legislature, I had supported Florida’s Iran divestment. As a Member of Congress, I very much look forward to reauthorizing the Iran Sanctions Act. I am extremely proud of President Trump and his administration for enacting appropriate sanctions against Iranian officials who have been engaged in the most recent destructive and destabilizing nuclear tests. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Americans, Israelis, and all citizens of the world who aspire to peace continue to be harmed by the reckless and irresponsible foreign policy of the past President’s administration. Former President Obama believed in a policy of appeasement toward Iran. This is not dissimilar to the policies of appeasement that Neville Chamberlain used when confronting the threats of Nazi Germany. But if President Obama was America’s Neville Chamberlain, perhaps his time has given rise to Donald Trump and the opportunity to be America’s Winston Churchill. I support President Trump’s efforts to send a message to Iran that ballistic missile testing will not be tolerated. Iran only understands strength. For the last 8 years, they have seen from this country far too much weakness and far too much willingness to accept their destructive role in the world. Mr. Speaker, the way Iran operates is through a series of franchises for terror. Whether that is Hamas or Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, we see time and time again Iran acting as a neoPersian, neoOttoman Empire. That cannot be tolerated in a peaceful world. It cannot be tolerated in the most dangerous neighborhood on Earth. It underscores the purpose of Americans speaking with resolve and with strength in condemning the most recent ballistic missile tests and in standing with our greatest ally, Israel. It was shameful that, in the waning hours of the Obama administration, President Obama was willing to allow the United Nations to take action against Israel while continuing its furtherance of appeasement toward some of the most dangerous countries on the planet Earth who do not share our values or our interests. So I am glad to see an American reset, a resurgent America again speaking to the great values that have functioned as a beacon of hope for the world for generations. That is what we must return to, and that is what President Trump is doing today. I applaud his administration. I applaud his Secretary of the Treasury for stepping forward and advancing these needed sanctions. I am hopeful that this Congress will continue to take action to show support for President Trump in this endeavor, but we must also recognize that this is but a first step. So much damage has been done to the cause of peace for the last 8 years under President Obama, and we have much work to do in this Congress, whether it is rebuilding and restoring our military so that we can be a force for peace, whether it is making sure that our allies know that we will stand with them, or whether it is making sure that our adversaries know that we are very serious and there will be serious consequences for their bad behavior. I am proud of this America that we are working toward together. I am proud of these policies. The gentleman from Texas may now wish to speak to the importance of Americans speaking with a voice of clarity for peace, prosperity, and strength throughout the Middle East and the world. Mr. GOHMERT. If the gentleman might take a question. I appreciate that clarity. It is clarity that has been missing for a long time. We have people screaming that President Trump should not have put a temporary pause that was half as long as the pause President Obama put on. I understand there is so much stress and pressure when you are President; he probably just forgot he put a 6month ban, previously, on a Muslim nation sending people in. You made so clear the case for concern about Iran, and I am with you. I am thrilled that we have a President that is not choosing to give our lunch money, figuratively speaking, to the big bully in the schoolyard. I don’t know if my friend from Florida ever got bullied in elementary school. I did. I learned early on that it doesn’t help to give bullies money. They are not going to leave you alone until you stand up to them. Maybe they whip you, but they don’t want to go through what you put them through again by standing up to them, so they leave you alone. In our case, we are strong enough to take on any bully; but instead, we paid the big bully, Iran, as you pointed out, massive amounts, billions and billions of dollars. We agreed to pay them up to $150 billion. We have got some friends here in Congress in the House and Senate that were so upset with the President having this 90day pause on seven countries. They didn’t realize—I know we get so busy here that we don’t notice a lot of other things, but they apparently hadn’t realized that those seven countries were designated by the Obama administration. One of them, Iran, a country you have talked so eloquently about, we have people here in this body that don’t think we should hold up refugees from Iran. As the gentleman was talking about, the Government of Iran has not shown any good faith at all. Would the gentleman be concerned about having people that the Iranian Government allowed to slip out of the country and come into the United States? Do you have any problem with President Obama’s pause on that refugee surge into the United States? Mr. GAETZ. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. Isn’t it refreshing to have a President of the United States who is willing to do, in office, precisely the things he said he would do on the campaign trail, notably, putting the interests of Americans and the security of Americans first in a world that even former Secretary of State George Shultz said is more dangerous and perilous today than the highest tensions of the Cold War? b1215 So to specifically answer the gentleman’s question, I am grateful that President Trump is prioritizing the security of Americans. My hope is that in the 115th Congress, we will work with the President, with his administration to ensure that, as we continue to mature these policies and advance them, we do them in a way that is easily understandable for those enforcing them and for the American people, and that it sends a message to the world that America continues to be the most generous country on the planet when it comes to welcoming individuals who share our values and who aspire to be productive and prosperous and inclusive. What we have no tolerance for are those who would want to come to the United States of America not to be part of the American experience, but to destroy it. Too often that has not just been the fear that we have felt from some who have been embedded by Daesh within refugees, but it is exactly what is preached by the Government of Iran. How silly of the United States to think that we would give hundreds of billions of dollars to a nation that calls America the Great Satan, that seeks to wipe Israel off of planet Earth, and believe that that money will be used for peaceful purposes. It won’t. Iran’s desires for expanded hegemony are not to stabilize the Middle East, they are expressly to destabilize the Middle East. This regime in Iran will never share America’s values, so America should not be funding the very destructive behavior that has done so much to harm the lives of so many people. The gentleman from Texas brings up a great point. If we hadn’t endured the 
policies of appeasement for the last 8 years, if America hadn’t withdrawn from the world stage so suddenly, then perhaps we would not have the conditions in the Middle East that have made life so difficult for people that they have wanted so badly to be refugees to Europe and to the United States. We should want countries to succeed that are willing to be stable and inclusive, but those who are our sworn enemies, those who do not share our values should receive no quarter from the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I have the great honor to serve on the House Committee on Armed Services. We received briefings this week, thanks to Chairman THORN BERRY , from General Petraeus and other national security experts. They reinforced the fact that the world is dangerous as a consequence of American withdrawal. I am grateful that the 115th Congress will stand with President Trump in his agenda to rebuild our military, to rebuild our standing, and to make very clear to the world that we will be with you if you want peace. But if you aspire to spread terror, there is no role for you on the global stage, and we will not do the things to elevate those terrible regimes to any place of prominence. This is a great time for revival and renewal in this country, and as Americans do more to rebuild the country internally and grow our economy and achieve more prosperity with lower and fairer taxes, with a regulatory climate that is more acceptable for a prosperous country, we also have to keep an eye on the world and our position on the global stage. I think that it is refreshing that that is a time of revival and restoration of American prominence, because the world is a safer place when America is the strongest country in the world. President Trump’s actions today to create sanctions against those who have been directly involved in ballistic missile tests send a clear message: We will stand with our allies, and we will stand against the enemies of peace. Mr. GOHMERT. Those are such great points. The counterargument is made often to us: ‘‘Other than the San Bernardino shootings, has there been a terrorist attack involving a nonU.S. born attacker since 9/11?’’ There was a great article in The Federalist by Kyle Shideler on January 30. He answers: Yes, but first of all, why exclude the San Bernardino killers, terrorists? Tashfeen Malik was born in Pakistan, and that attack killed 14. As Phil Haney, the whistleblower from Homeland Security, pointed out, if he had not been removed from the line, he would have been allowed to secondarily question someone like Tashfeen Malik. It is worth noting, under the Obama administration, under Jeh Johnson, and before him, Janet Napolitano, they punished people who pointed out radical Islamists rather than giving them positions where they could recognize radical Islamists. Phil Haney points out that Tashfeen Malik is actually a man’s name. The woman came, and if she had come through him, he would have asked: Well, why do you have a man’s name, and it happens to be a man who was a terrorist centuries ago? Well, to ask a question like that, you have to be well educated into the history of radical Islam. Not Islam, but radical Islam. We have spent so much money as a country and even as a Congress on countering violent extremism. We hear from Homeland Security whistleblowers—some of them don’t want to go public yet, but we hear from them that so much of that money was spent on conferences and seminars teaching our Homeland Security agents, our FBI agents, our State Department people, our intelligence people to spot Islamophobes. They would teach them the phrases to look for when someone reported a potential radical Islamist so that they would know that that is an Islamophobe. That is exactly why in San Bernardino, when someone reported this guy as a potential radical Islamist, that he was crazy, that he was going to hurt somebody, they wrote him off as just being prejudiced against Islam. It is because of the money spent by this government intimidating people into refusing to notice radical Islam and getting them punished. If they didn’t find people who they named Islamophobes, their career was over. Mr. GAETZ. Will the gentleman yield for a question? Mr. GOHMERT. I yield to the gentleman from Florida. Mr. GAETZ. I thank the gentleman for yielding. The gentleman is from Texas. I am from Florida. Both of our States have seen many of the negative economic consequences of illegal immigration, but my question relates to the negative national security consequences that result from illegal immigration. We are receiving more reports that ISIS, Daesh, other Islamic fundamentalists are exploiting America’s weakness on our southern border with Mexico for their own economic gain, as well as to smuggle people into the United States who may function as lone wolves or even as a part of a coordinated terrorist attack against Americans. So I would hope that the gentleman would speak to the interconnectivity between the need for strong border security and a wall on our southern border with Mexico and the risks posed by Islamic fundamentalism. Mr. GOHMERT. I thank the gentleman. I would also note, as this Federalist article points out, yeah, of course, when there is a terrorist attack, it also affects the economy. That is why Osama bin Laden wrote about how they had only spent a tiny amount of money to train their people from 9/ 11 and that it had clearly cost America trillions of dollars, that even if they couldn’t bring us down any other way, if they could do other attacks like that, costing relatively low amounts to them but costing us billions and trillions, they could bring us down economically. So it only makes sense, though, Iran wants to bring us down, so they ought to be one of the seven that the Obama administration named as a threat, and they were. But even just recently at Ohio State University, Abdul Razak Ali Artan ran over several students with a car before attacking them with a butcher knife. That was a refugee born in Somalia, one of the seven countries that the Obama administration named as a threat, and so President Trump took the Obama administration seriously and named them as one of seven, that we would have not a permanent ban but a temporary ban for 90 days. The guy ran over numerous students at Ohio State, but our friends on the other side of the aisle and their friends in the mass media, they refuse to notice what is going on. Look at Tsarnaev, the Tsarnaev brothers in Boston. As we know, Russia notified the United States not once but twice that the older Tsarnaev had been radicalized, and he had been to a country, and the people he hung around with were radicals, and it seemed like they probably radicalized him. So what happens? Well, they get information to our intelligence community, and, since, they have been trained for the last 8 years to only notice Islamophobes. You can tell someone is an Islamophobe if they complain about a radical Islamist, then you know you have got an Islamophobe. So of course if they want to stay in the intelligence community, they are not going to be looking. They are going to follow their training, look for Islamophobes instead of looking for radical Islamists. I am sure they looked into it, but, based on their training, they have no basis to work with. So what happens? Russia notified us again. As I understand, they notified the FBI. And as the FBI Director commented, look, we sent an FBI agent to interview him, and he said, basically, he wasn’t a terrorist, he was a good guy. Wow. Imagine that. Somebody who wants to kill Americans might also lie. Who would have ever thought? Except American juries. I have seen it as a judge. I have seen juries find that if you will lie to them, you may do a lot worse things as well. Well, the reverse is also true. Often, if you are willing to take someone’s life, you might just be willing to lie about it as well. So the FBI didn’t even stop there, taking the word. They didn’t take the word of Tsarnaev. They went to his mother, and apparently his mother said: No, my son is not a terrorist. He is a good boy. He is a good boy. There you go, full FBI investigation. Not under the old FBI. Not the way most FBI agents have ever been trained. But, of course, under the last 8 
years of training of the FBI, they were afraid to ask the tough questions. The truth is, they don’t know the questions to ask. They don’t know that you should ask about whether there has been a tremendous increase in the amount of study of the Koran and a massive increase in the memorization of the Koran, and a change in the appearance, and knowing what to look for, and asking questions like: What do you think about Qutb, the Egyptian martyr, the Muslim brother who wrote the little book ‘‘Milestones’’ that Osama bin Laden said, along with Mr. Nasif, for whom Huma Abedin worked at one time according to the masthead of the publication, he credited Nasif and also Qutb’s book ‘‘Milestones’’ to radicalizing him. If you haven’t been trained with Kim Jensen’s 700 pages, which were outlawed by the FBI for a while, because he clearly explained what FBI agents should be looking for. Mr. Jensen told me that they banned his information, they struck it, and wouldn’t allow anybody to be trained. Under incident information, they train people what to look for in a radical Islamist. But then they brought it back, but only for some of the leaders. The rank and file for so long under this administration did not get the benefit of his 700 pages that would help train. Why? Because CAIR, the Council on American Islamic Relations, who had implications in the Holy Land Foundation trial, the biggest supporter of terrorism ever prosecuted in the United States, convictions all around in November of 2008, and they should have gone on to prosecute the named coconspirators. The only reason they didn’t is because a new administration came in. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed—the mastermind of 9/11, of the brutal killing of about 3,000 Americans and other foreigners, innocent victims—has bragged about his planning. In a guilty plea where the judge went through, as I used to, to make sure they understood their rights, he bragged about that and some terrorist attacks they didn’t even know he had involvement in. He was bragging. b1230 And he says, if we have terrorized you, then praise be to Allah. And he says such things as we deserve attack, we deserve to be killed in America, anyone who is a lowlife Jew or says that God has a Son. So those of us who believe God had a Son, and He loved the world so much He sent His only begotten Son and whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life, anybody who believes that is worthy of death under the Koran, according to the brilliant teacher and mastermind of the 9/ 11 attack. And then he quotes from the Koran that anyone who tries to combine someone with Allah is worthy of death, and that means any Christian. They have explained these things. But Khalid Sheikh Mohammed went through an expansive hearing with a judge explaining what all he was involved in and why he was guilty of 9/11 and praise be to Allah for all of the people that were killed on 9/11 at the Pentagon, at the World Trade Centers. Why was he not sentenced? Because we had an election in 2008, and before the plea was made final, we had a new Attorney General named Eric Holder. At that point, all bets were off. They didn’t follow up the plea was withdrawn, and he still hasn’t been sentenced for the things he admitted to over 8 years ago. Had they simply moved forward with the guilty plea, if we had had a President for the last 8 years that made clear ‘‘you might as well plead guilty because nobody else is going to let you out,’’ then we would have finished the guilty plea, and he would have been appropriately sentenced. But instead, this administration chose to send hope to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed he might end up being one of the people they release; because, if they close Guantanamo Bay, he either gets moved to the United States or we let him go, maybe like we have for some who went to Yemen and are back in the fight, or other people like Saudi Arabia and are back in the fight. He had real hope once President Obama came in and Eric Holder became Attorney General, and Loretta Lynch after him, that he might get released even after he admitted to the most important role in the killing of 3,000 people on American soil on 9/11. He still has not been prosecuted. They didn’t follow up on his guilty plea. The plea was withdrawn. That man should not be allowed out of prison. He is a threat to the world, and he is a valuable tool in the hands of radical Islam. Well, thank God, as President Obama said, elections have consequences. We have a President who didn’t take an oath of office to protect all of the people of Australia. He made clear that our friends will know they are our friends, and I can see him working very closely with the Prime Minister of Australia in the future. But leaders around the world are now taking notice: Wait a minute. America has a President that is not coming to us and apologizing for America’s goodness and their pursuit of freedom for as many people as they can—not apologizing. He is making clear, if you are our friend, you are going to feel it. If you are our enemy, you are going to feel it. So I think Iran may have finally met their match. We don’t have an apologist to come in and apologize for America’s efforts, the blood, the treasure that has been spent on behalf of people around the world. And now even our Australian Prime Minister understands: Look, I want to work with you—President Trump feels that way; he wants to work with them, and he will work with them—but my oath is to the United States of America and I know your oath is to Australia. I know because of your oath to help and protect the people of Australia you want to get rid of those refugees, some of whom may be dangerous. I know President Obama said: Yeah, we will take the dangerous people that may hurt Australians. Never mind we have got Americans being hurt. We will take them. Well, there is a different sheriff in town here in Washington, and leaders around the world need to know that starting on January 20, the United States is no longer going to take actions that are detrimental to our own wellbeing, to the wellbeing of Americans, and to the security of the United States under our Constitution. So thank God, thank Trump, thank those that are seeing with clarity what is going on. We will look forward to working with the Mexican leaders that realize the only way Mexico ever achieves its rightful economic place in the world is if a wall is built where it can be so that our border is enforced and the drug cartels are impoverished. Then Mexico can be one of the top economies in all the world because of the best workers, some of the best workers in the world, and massive natural resources with which they have been blessed. They just, so far, have not had America be the kind of good neighbor that would help them stop the drug cartels. Instead, we would have Presidents, administrations like the past one, that would send 2,000 weapons to the drug cartels instead of stopping them. It is a new day. Thank God it is. I yield back the balance of my time.
