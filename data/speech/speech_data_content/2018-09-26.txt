Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Marc Gallaway from Selah Middle School for being named the Association of Washington School Principals Middle Level Principal of the Year. A lifelong Washingtonian, Marc Gallaway earned his bachelor’s degree from Central Washington University and his master’s degree from Heritage University in Toppenish. He worked as both a special education teacher and a baseball coach before he came to work at Selah Junior High School in 2005. Mr. Gallaway has served as principal at what is now Selah Middle School for the past 14 years. Every day, Mr. Gallaway nurtures a culture of positivity and teamwork among students and staff. Mr. Speaker, I want to honor Mr. Gallaway for empowering students and teachers to embrace the Viking Way and thank him for his positive influence that he has had on students in central Washington. This award is something that Mr. Gallaway, his students, and fellow faculty and staff should be very proud of. I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Marc Gallaway on this significant achievement. CELEBRATING NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE  
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, September is National Hispanic Heritage Month, and I am proud to represent central Washington where Hispanic heritage and culture tells the story of many of my constituents and our communities. I have witnessed firsthand how Hispanic Americans contribute to our communities through entrepreneurship, military service, and cultural diversity. I am proud to recognize my Hispanic American friends and neighbors in Washington’s Fourth Congressional District. I am also proud to support national appreciation of Hispanic American and Latino leadership and heritage as an original cosponsor of the National Museum of the American Latino Act. I support the establishment of a Smithsonian museum to recognize Latino contributions to American history, life, art, and culture. In the United States, our shared values bring us together, and we cherish our Nation’s diverse history. I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating National Hispanic Heritage Month. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Cathey Anderson for the compassion she demonstrated aboard a flight from Nevada to central Washington. Cathey did not think twice before springing into action when she noticed a man in his 70s who was traveling alone. He appeared confused and then lost consciousness. Cathey recognized the signs of a seizure, and she took the initiative to help. She and two other nurses administered medical treatment until the flight landed, and they were greeted by medical crews upon arrival in Yakima. Cathey is a registered nurse and the occupational health supervisor at Energy Northwest. She was awarded the CEO Lifesaving Award for her actions. 
To Cathey’s family and friends, her quick action was not a surprise, because it wasn’t the first time she comforted a stranger in distress. I thank Cathey for her willingness to help others around her everywhere she goes. Please join me in recognizing Cathey Anderson for receiving this prestigious award. 
PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE PATIENTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PAULSEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, thousands of unnecessary amputations are conducted each and every year as a treatment for those who have peripheral artery disease. PAD patients suffer from poor blood circulation, which often results in amputation, higher mortality rates, and the other complications that come with it. It doesn’t have to be this way. b1015 Minnesota is the epicenter for groundbreaking innovation in new PAD treatments. Dr. Osama Ibrahim of Minneapolis’ North Memorial Hospital is helping spread the word about revascularizations instead of amputations. The University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic are also at the forefront of these new procedures. I am working now with Congressman DONALD PAYNE to raise PAD awareness, increase screening for atrisk patients, and improve access to care to different therapies so patients don’t have to undergo unnecessary amputations. This means better healthcare outcomes, as well as a higher quality of life for thousands of Americans coping with PAD every year. 
Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I speak in favor of H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act, which will spur innovation by helping startups survive the first few years of their existence and access the capital they need to grow and expand. This bill also includes a key provision that I authored to help entrepreneurs not only survive, but thrive. Entrepreneurs and startups are a key source of innovation and job creation, particularly in Minnesota. But the tax code today puts them at a disadvantage. It makes it harder for them to access new capital, and it disadvantages them as they struggle through the hardest part of their existence, which is the very first few years of profitability. This bill changes that. It brings tax regulations for governing startups now into the 21st century so that entrepreneurs and capital intensive sectors, like medical devices, can make the necessary investments in research, development, and manufacturing to grow and hire more people. Ultimately, this means more jobs and more flexibility for Minnesota entrepreneurs to not just come up with the next big idea, but to actually make it a reality. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation. SUPPORT THE FAMILY SAVINGS ACT  
Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act, which includes a provision that I authored that improves 529 college savings plans. Now, we all know that 529 college savings plans are a popular saving tool to help families save for college costs tax free. But today, student loan payments are not a qualified expense. Withdrawing any funds from the 529 for any other reason results in those funds being taxed as ordinary income, as well as a 10 percent penalty. That is why I authored legislation to solve and address this problem, and it was included in the Family Savings Act. By expanding the list of 529 qualified expenses to also include student loan payments, this will allow a 529 savings plan to be used to pay up to $10,000 in student loans. It will certainly help make it easier now to pay off loans and mitigate the anxiety that comes for a new graduate who is starting a career. 
RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT COLONEL ADOLF ‘‘WES’’ WESSELHOEFT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible life of Lieutenant Colonel Adolf ‘‘Wes’’ Wesselhoeft, who, as a child, was one of 11,000 GermanAmericans placed in internment camps during World War II. You see his picture to my left. Wes was born to German immigrants in Chicago in 1936. When he was seven, his family packed what few things they could and were taken to Crystal City, Texas, to a detainment camp built there for German, Japanese, and Italian immigrants. Just a year later, in 1944, his family packed up once again and was sent to New York City to board the M.S. Gripsholm. The M.S. Gripsholm headed to Portugal where the Wesselhoeft family and 633 other German expatriates and repatriates were exchanged for American prisoners of war and then sent back to Germany. Once back in Germany, Wes and his family lived in the town of Hamburg with his grandparents. Unfortunately, Hamburg was the center of Allied bombings during World War II. Wes has vivid memories from the bombings, seeking shelter in bunkers with his family. Despite those experiences, Wes remained a true American patriot, and he was committed to coming back home to the United States of America. After the war ended, Wes and his family moved to Konstanz where he finished school and worked manual labor jobs to save money for a return to America. He stayed in touch with the American consulate in Stuttgart, riding his bike 2 days each way to meet with them until finally in 1958 the consulate informed him he could return home. He bought the cheapest passage to the United States. Upon arriving in New York, he went straight to a recruiting office to enlist in the United States Air Force. Wes served 22 years in the Air Force and flew EC–121Rs and B–52s during the Vietnam war. During his service, he was exposed to Agent Orange. He is now legally blind. Wes and his wife, Shirley, now live in Ruston, Louisiana, where I proudly represent them in Congress. Wes represents the best of America, a patriot who never gave up on his country. His service to his country, as well as the horrors he and his family suffered in Germany, will never be forgotten. America is better because of people like Wes, those willing to give up everything to serve the American cause. f 
THERE IS A CRISIS BREWING IN AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN) for 5 minutes. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, there is a crisis brewing in America. Twoandahalf million workers face the challenge of losing their pension through no fault of their own. These are the folks who get up every single day, they work hard, they play by the rules, and all they want is a fair shake, some decent healthcare, and the retirement that they earned and that they paid for. One of these people is Ed Barker, III, from Youngstown, Ohio. He worked for 45 years driving a truck. He worked 60 to 70 hours a week, 6 to 7 days a week. He now faces a 50 percent cut in his pension. He missed baseball games, he missed birthdays, and he missed family events because he was driving a truck with the promise that at the end of his career there would be a solid pension. Now he and his wife are taking care of their 96yearold father, they try to babysit for their kids when they get deployed and try to help out with the grandkids, and they try to help their kid through grad school to make a better life, all based on the promises they were given. But now they face the horrendous situation where they may lose half of their pension, cuts to healthcare, and all the rest that come with that. They did nothing wrong. Yes, this is going to cost money. But let me share with the American people, and remind some of my colleagues, that we had no problem in this Congress giving a $142 billion bailout to Bank of America, $280 billion to Citigroup, $25 billion to the auto industry, $180 billion to AIG, $400 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, $30 billion to Bear Stearns, $18 billion to the airline industry, and $300 billion to the savings and loans. 
Mr. Speaker, if we can bail out corporations that have done everything wrong, we can bail out the workers who have done everything right. 
RECOGNIZING R.J. LEONARD FOUNDATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a nonprofit organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that actively seeks to improve the lives of disadvantaged youth in our community. The R.J. Leonard Foundation, based in Doylestown, was founded in 2008 to assist adolescents who transition out of the foster care system once they turn 18. Oftentimes, many of these young people lack the resources they need to live selfsufficient lives once they have aged out of the system. That is where the R.J. Leonard Foundation comes in, awarding young adults fellowships that provide individualized grants to further their education or career. These grants assist not only with books and tuition costs, but also provide transportation support and social and cultural enrichment opportunities. To provide stability and encouragement, each fellow is matched with a mentor who provides support and guidance. I am proud of the work that the R.J. Leonard Foundation does for our community, and thank them for their 10 years of service to our community. I also commend founder Jo Leonard and executive director Caitlin Deppeler for their outstanding leadership. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an individual in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, whose decades of service to our community were recently honored with a meaningful tribute. Tom Buzby, who served the people of Hilltown Township for 46
1⁄2years, most recently as director of public works, retired earlier this year. Whether plowing the roads in winter or mowing the grass in the summer, Tom spent his career improving and beautifying our community’s infrastructure and recreational facilities. Tom’s over four decades on the job touched countless families in Bucks County. To show their appreciation, township officials recently named the baseball field at Civil Park the Thomas A. Buzby Baseball Field. This worthy dedication was officially unveiled on September 12. I would like to extend my gratitude to Tom for his years of service to Hilltown Township and our entire community. I also want to recognize township supervisor Ken Bennington and township manager Lorraine Leslie for their work as well. I wish Tom all the best in his retirement and his successor, Thomas Hess, success in his new role. RECOGNIZING JEANNE LAKAWITZ  
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an individual in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who has dedicated her career to the safety and wellbeing of our community’s children. Pennsbury School District Transportation Director Charlie Williams recently named Jeanne Lakawitz as the Pennsbury 2018 School Bus Driver of the Year. For the past 14 years, Jeanne has transported students to area schools, including Pennsbury High School, Penn Wood Middle School, William Penn Middle School, and Quarry Hill Elementary School. During this time, she cultivated strong and inspirational relationships with her students and their families. Jeanne says she treats all children on her bus as if they are her own, a statement that I think puts into context her dedication to the job. Her job driving does not stop with Pennsbury. In the summer, she also transports summer campers who participate in programs at the Lower Bucks Family YMCA, assisting our community’s families. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Jeanne on this much deserved recognition. I also thank Charlie Williams for his dedication to transportation safety in our community in Bucks County. 
CHILDHOOD CANCER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of families and children everywhere who have been affected by childhood cancer. This month, September, is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. As I think about the meaning behind this month, I realize that childhood cancer has had a significant impact on my district in west Tennessee. According to the American Childhood Cancer Organization, more than 15,000 children under the age of 21 are diagnosed with cancer each year. It is heartbreaking that any family must endure the pain caused by childhood cancer. Thanks to the countless efforts by doctors, nurses, and researchers, the childhood cancer survival rate has now reached over 80 percent. Back home, we are fortunate to have stateoftheart facilities dedicated to childhood cancer research with personnel working each and every day to see that our children are receiving the best possible care. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis provides topnotch cancer treatment to nearly 7,500 patients from all over the world each year. From medical personnel to volunteers to families sharing their testimonies, my area is filled with many who have dedicated their lives to the pursuit of an end to childhood cancer. b1030 Now, here in Congress, I have supported numerous initiatives to fight so that all children have a chance of survival. Most recently, I cosponsored and voted for the Childhood Cancer STAR Act, which was signed into law by President Trump this past summer. The great Danny Thomas, the founder of St. Jude, believed that no child should die in the dawn of life. We have come so far to increase the odds of survival and recovery. But we won’t stop there. I feel fortunate knowing that each day we are one step closer to finding cures and ensuring that every child has the chance to live. f 
RECOGNIZING 2018 ANGELS IN ADOPTION HONOREE KRISTIN HILL TAYLOR The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kristin Hill Taylor, who recently received recognition as a 2018 Angels in Adoption Honoree and whom I am honored to have with me in the gallery today. This is the second time I have had the privilege of nominating a deserving individual for their outstanding work in the adoption community. Kristin is a resident of Murray, Kentucky, along with her husband, Greg, and their three children they adopted as newborns—Cate in 2007, Ben in 2009, and Rachel in 2015. A compassionate adoptive mother, Kristin is an advocate for the adoption community and has created a great platform for sharing stories about adoption, family, and faith on her blog, kristinhilltaylor.com. She also self published her family’s story in a book entitled: ‘‘Peace in the Process: How Adoption Built My Faith & My Family.’’ Kristin’s advocacy and platform for story sharing have helped grow and empower many members of the adoption community both near and far. We have an active adoption and foster community in the district of Kentucky which I represent, and I am proud to recognize adoptive families and individuals like Kristin who pave the way for countless folks in the adoption community. On behalf of the First District of Kentucky, I congratulate Kristin on all she does for children in need of loving homes and for families who want to grow through the adoption process. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from references to occupants of the gallery. 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Hispanic Heritage Month by honoring one of our rich 
treasures of the Midwest, El Museo Latino, on the occasion of its 25th year of operation in Omaha, Nebraska. El Museo Latino opened its doors in the historic Livestock Exchange Building on May 5, 1993, as the first Latino art and history museum and cultural center in the Midwest. Today, it is one of only 17 Latino museums in the United States. Since opening, El Museo Latino has been a nonprofit organization with a mission to collect, exhibit, and interpret Latino arts of the Americas. It is committed to strengthening the artistic and creative culture of the greater Omaha area. It accomplishes this by providing direct support to local artists, increasing the visibility of Latino art forms, and fostering an appreciation of art for the benefit of a diverse audience. El Museo Latino creates and presents exhibitions yearround that feature local, national, and international Latino arts. The exhibits range from preColumbian to contemporary arts through both temporary and permanent displays. Central to El Museo Latino’s programming are the educational programs that are created for each of the exhibitions, including bilingual guided visits, lectures, presentations, films, workshops, demonstrations, and classes. The educational programs are designed for children, teens, and adults and focus on the visual and performing arts. The art classes offered throughout the year include traditional art forms and those featured in the museum’s active exhibits. El Museo Latino also highlights special traditional celebrations and community events throughout the year, including Cinco de Mayo, Family Days, Dia del Nino, Hispanic Heritage Month, and many other holiday celebrations. Other special community events include the presentation of films throughout the year as well as summer outdoor free screenings of Latino films. As the founder and executive director of El Museo Latino, Magdalena Garcia is passionate about the arts. Prior to creating El Museo Latino, she volunteered at a number of museums, including the Joslyn Art Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, and the Erie Canal Museum in Syracuse, New York. After completing her master’s of arts degree at Syracuse University, Magdalena returned to Omaha and shared her dream to create a museum for Latino culture in Omaha with the support of community leaders, including activisteducator Jim Ramirez. Through years of hard work, perseverance, and passion, her dream became a reality. The museum officially opened on May 5, 1993, with the help of many community leaders and volunteers. Ms. Garcia has received numerous honors and recognitions for her hard work and achievements. Most notably, in 2015, the Mexican Government honored her lifetime of achievement in the arts with the Ohtli Award. Over the past 25 years, El Museo Latino has presented more than 150 exhibitions. Without this special treasure, much of the local Hispanic culture and history would be lost. Thanks to the proven leadership of Ms. Garcia and her board and the many contributions to the community over the past 25 years, we look forward to many more years of Hispanic heritage and Latino culture on display at El Museo Latino. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my mom and my sister during this Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which will be in October. While my mother survived this terrible disease, my sister lost her battle at the young age of 39. I also want to recognize the millions of people every year who are affected by cancer. Breast cancer, along with ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, endometrial, colon, gastric, and melanoma cancers are all hereditary cancers that can be passed down from parents to children through their genes. Thankfully, there is testing that can make a significant and positive impact in identifying hereditary cancers before they emerge. Last month, I took a genetic test to determine if I have the genetic mutations that could develop into any of these hereditary cancers. While genetic mutations are thought to play a role in 5 to 10 percent of all cancers, the chance of inheriting the cancer causing mutation is 50 percent if one of the parents has it. Because my mom and sister had breast cancer, I decided to be tested to see if I have that mutation; because it is not only women who are victims of breast cancer, but men as well. While only 1 in 1,000 men will get breast cancer, it is still not something to ignore. The genetic markers I was tested for are called BRCA 1 and 2, and the chances of developing cancer if you have one of these genetic mutations skyrocket by as much as 87 percent. The test was simple. The staff drew my blood and collected information about cancer, my family history, including my grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins on both sides of the family, my mom and dad. That family history also included the types of cancer, treatment given, and the age of diagnosis, or as close as known. There are many organizations out there that offer information about genetic testing and cancer, including the American Cancer Society, and in my home district the Kamie K. Preston Hereditary Cancer Foundation. In fact, the founder of this organization, Brandi Preston, joined me during this test to offer support and guidance. The foundation not only provides emotional support but financial support for those whose testing may not be covered. In going public with my test, I hope to encourage others who have a history of cancers in their family to go get tested. Knowledge and early detection are two of the many tools in the fight against cancer. f 
THE SCARLETT’S SUNSHINE ON SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ) for 5 minutes. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to join me on a bipartisan basis as cosponsors of the Scarlett’s Sunshine on Sudden Unexpected Death Act. This bill is intended to help us to better understand why infants die between birth and age 4 so that we can take preventive action that is effective. Mr. Speaker, I have had the unfortunate experience of walking into the home of parents who are grieving, and that grief doesn’t just begin when their infant dies but goes on for a lifetime, wondering: Was it my fault? Could I have done something? Am I a bad parent? They never get the answers. Do you realize, Mr. Speaker, that currently we have absolutely no national guidelines for death scene investigations to follow when responding to an infant death? This means that different States and different municipalities all over the country collect inconsistent and, often, incomplete data on these unexplained sudden deaths. If we can’t even collect good and consistent data, how can we expect to reverse this trend or even to prevent it? I am ashamed to say, Mr. Speaker, that the infant mortality rate in the United States is 5.8 deaths per 1,000 live births. This is really unacceptable. When you disaggregate these numbers for Native American babies and Black and White babies, we find that Black babies die at a rate three times the national average. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that really means that over 23,000 infants have died of sudden infant death syndrome. In 2015, about 3,700 infants died suddenly and unexpectedly. Think about that: 23,000 deaths and parents who spend a lifetime in grief wondering why. This is a public health crisis when you consider that, in developed countries, we are number 19 for preventing these kinds of deaths. My bill not only provides resources to invest in the CDC and the Health Resources and Services Administration to train first responders to improve death scene investigations, to do child death reviews, and to promote safe sleep practices, but it also provides educational opportunities for parents as well. Mr. Speaker, these deaths are preventable, and we need to do everything in our power to give parents the knowledge and tools they need to achieve healthy outcomes and educate them on safe methods for handling their children. 
I encourage my colleagues to imagine how many babies’ lives we can save by simply investing in the right programs to prevent their deaths. Please join me in cosponsoring this bill and supporting its swift enactment into law. 
DAYCARE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of working families across the country who are trying to make ends meet. As a mother, a grandmother, and someone who has employed moms and dads, I know that raising a family is a great joy, but it can also be a great source of anxiety. Children are a blessing, but raising a family introduces serious challenges and costs. In Missouri, the average annual cost of centerbased infant care is estimated to be $8,632. That is $719 a month. Infant care in Missouri costs $634 more per year than instate tuition at a 4 year public college, and it is unaffordable for so very many families. According to a study published by the Economic Policy Institute, a daycare center for two children—an infant and, say, a 4yearold—costs $17,940. That is 102 percent more than the average rent in Missouri. A typical family in Missouri has to spend a shocking 30 percent of their income on daycare for their two children. In fact, it is estimated that the cost of childcare for two children exceeds annual median rent payments in every State. Paying for childcare is just plain hard for every working family I have spoken with in the State of Missouri. In the 1970s, Congress heard America’s families loud and clear and created the dependent care flexible spending accounts. These accounts allow parents to contribute pretax dollars to pay for qualified outofpocket dependent care expenses. They are not only for children. These accounts can also be used to pay for adult dependents who use adult daycare, eldercare or similar services. It is a great program, but it has not kept up with the needs of today’s families. Despite rising childcare costs, Congress has not raised the FSA contribution cap since 1986. That is why, this week, I am introducing the Child and Dependent Care Modernization Act. This bill will modernize the maximum amount a family can contribute to dependent care flexible spending accounts to track with the real costs of dependent care today. It will also index the maximum contribution limit so that the value of an FSA will increase in the future as dependent care costs increase. Another challenge that many families enrolled in an FSA experience is the ‘‘useitorloseit’’ rule. If parents don’t use the full balance in their FSA before the year ends, they forfeit their unused money, limiting the ability of parents to save for ongoing costs of care. My bill will allow unused funds to roll over into the next plan year and return a little more freedom and flexibility to America’s families. This bill is part of my legislative work to make the lives of Missouri’s families just a little easier. I look forward to introducing this legislation and working with my colleagues to make it law. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 45 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Dr. Brad Jurkovich, First Bossier, Bossier City, Louisiana, offered the following prayer: Dear God, we come before You today fully aware that we face tremendous challenges and tremendous opportunities as a nation. Your word says in Proverbs 2:6, ‘‘For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.’’ As we prepare to debate, discuss, and discern the right solutions and strategies for this great Nation, we ask You, God, to give us Your wisdom, Your knowledge, and Your understanding. I pray for every leader here today that they know the power and presence of God is real and that there are millions of Americans praying for them to be men and women of courage, character, and conviction. I pray the decisions that come from this place be those that honor You, Lord, and bless the people of this land. Help us, O God, to be a nation that stands strong for freedom for our generation and the generations to come. In Jesus’ name I pray. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. ROUZER led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING DR. BRAD JURKOVICH The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to introduce my pastor and friend, Dr. Brad Jurkovich, as our guest chaplain. He has led us in prayer this morning, and we are so grateful to have him. Pastor Brad is the senior pastor of the First Baptist Church of Bossier City, Louisiana. First Bossier is a multigenerational church dedicated to reaching families throughout north Louisiana, America, and the world. Our motto is: Every person, every family, experiencing Christ in every way. Pastor Brad received his bachelor of arts in biblical studies and his master of divinity from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, North Carolina. He received his doctor of ministry degree from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He and his lovely wife, Stephanie, have four awesome children: Cassidy, Carter, Caroline, and Catherine. Pastor Brad is a gifted speaker and a leader with a true servant’s heart who loves Jesus and seeks to share the message of salvation with everyone he meets. He is a man committed to reaching this generation with the hope of Christ. It is an honor to have him here today to ask God’s blessings over us, our work, and our Nation at this historic time. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to help me in welcoming my friend and pastor, Dr. Brad Jurkovich. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about something miraculously happening in California. For the first time in decades, we are on the verge of building new infrastructure for our water. We have been waiting since 1979 to actually build something new. Last Friday, with the signing, Shasta, a big improvement raising the spillway 630,000 new acre feet of water, and now, next week, passing the WRDA bill, which is actually the New WATER Act financing for Los Vaqueros, Sites, and Temperance Flat, it is time to build things in California and save our number one industry, agriculture. These are real solutions and real dollars. We are going to get it built. 
AFTERMATH OF HURRICANES IRMA AND MARIA (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about an important forum my colleagues and I will be hosting tomorrow. While this month of September marks the 1 year anniversary of Hurricanes Irma and Maria making landfall in the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 storm, the aftermath of the storm is still an everyday reality. According to the Hurricane Recovery and Resiliency Task Force report summary, total damage is estimated at $10.8 billion. Earlier this month, I visited local schools as they opened for the new school year, and the conditions are troubling. The Virgin Islands Board of Education reported a drop of almost 40 percent in student enrollment, and Puerto Rico’s Department of Education closed 265 schools last summer in the aftermath of the hurricanes. Only 19 of the 33 public schools throughout the territory reopened on time, and many of those are in no shape for learning: a lack of school supplies and classroom resources for students; students resorting to either standing or sitting on crates, floors, and desks; libraries with few or no books; and unfinished construction. Let’s not be fooled, however. The level of damage to the schools in the Virgin Islands is due, in part, to the continual cuts over the years to the children of the Virgin Islands’ education by funding from this body, the U.S. Congress. On Thursday, September 27, I and other congressional Democrats will host a forum to discuss the state of public education and related recovery efforts in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The forum’s most important mission will be to discuss new ideas and plans to speed up the recovery process to place our schools in a better economic state. We must do better. f 
AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE FLORENCE (Mr. ROUZER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, as everyone knows, southeastern North Carolina has experienced one of the most devastating hurricanes to hit our State in recent memory. The eye of Hurricane Florence made landfall in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, and then proceeded to slow walk down the coast before turning inland, resulting in historic flooding, massive power outages, and devastating destruction to homes, businesses, and farms. Sadly, this storm has taken the lives of at least 35 North Carolinians to date. What has transpired in my district is truly heartbreaking. But in the face of diversity, we have come together stronger than ever. I want to make special mention and thank all the first responders; linemen; emergency, military, and medical personnel; as well as the elected officials at all levels, local business leaders, the news media, and all the countless numbers of citizens who are volunteering to help our communities by opening their hearts and wallets to those who need it. I also thank President Trump and his administration for their rapid response and commitment to helping all those who have been affected. Working together, we will build our communities back stronger than ever, make no mistake about it. 
TARIFF CONSEQUENCES (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I have spoken before about how businesses in my district, large and small, are suffering under the President’s tariffs that are raising costs and increasing uncertainty. But the damage of the Trump administration’s trade policy goes beyond the business community. Here is one example. This week, I learned a public middle school in my district has to dip into its contingency funds to cover the $2 million in unbudgeted cost increases for its new addition and remodeling project, caused by President Trump’s tariffs. Let me repeat that. This school or, more precisely, local taxpayers now face $2 million in additional costs, not for new classrooms, but rather to cover the extra costs of the President’s trade war. I have also heard from seniors in my district worried about tariffs accelerating the cost of prescription drugs, including insulin, antidepressants, MRI machines, artificial joints, and pacemakers, to name just a few. Put simply, President Trump’s tariffs are not working for the American people. It is time to instead end the misguided trade war and enact sensible, enforceable trade policies that support American workers, American businesses, American intellectual property, and our environment. f 
HONORING A KOREAN AND AMERICAN HERO (Mr. BACON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to honor the passing of Major General SunHa Lim, who passed away on July 22. Throughout his life, he defended the Republic of Korea and the free world from communism. As a second lieutenant, he helped form the U.S. Korean Constabulary, a Korean government loyal to the United States. He then continued his service in the Republic of Korea’s Army. His exceptional battlefield leadership led him to be promoted to the rank of major general during the Korean conflict. He commanded the Republic of Korea’s 3rd Infantry Division, playing an instrumental role in pushing the North Korean forces back and restoring the 38th parallel. After coming to the U.S. with his family later in life, General Lim advocated for the recognition of the U.S. Korean Constabulary. General Lim was recognized on numerous occasions for his inspiring leadership. President Eisenhower honored him with the Legion of Merit in the Commander degree, the highest U.S. military honor given to foreign combatants. He was awarded with the Republic of Korea’s Order of Military Merit in the 1st Grade, which is their highest decoration for military valor. General Lim was a beloved member of the South Korean community here in Omaha, renowned by U.S. Korean war veterans in the metro area, and he was my friend. 
SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY IS IN JEOPARDY (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the soul of our country is in jeopardy and in question. It couldn’t be more directly seen than in the Senate on Thursday with the hearings for Judge Kavanaugh. The two most pressing issues that will be heard are the #MeToo movement and respect for women and their safety from sexual assault, and the 
truth and whether or not the truth is something that matters to people anymore or whether it is just spinning lies to get ratings. The man who has been nominated to the Supreme Court went on FOX News and said he didn’t drink illegally when he was 18 years old. Well, he did. The drinking age was 21. The lady who accuses him has passed a lie detector test administered by a former FBI agent and has told more than four or five different people about this incident over the last 6 years, which has been very difficult for her. She should be given respect, and there should be an attempt to find the truth. But the third person in that incident has not been subpoenaed by the Senate, because they don’t want to know the truth. They fear the truth. They are keeping the truth from the American people, and they are failing in respecting women. 
TRUMP TAX CUTS CREATE JOBS (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, due to the tax cuts of President Donald Trump and the Republican Congress, there is unprecedented growth for American families. The Hill today reported great things for the American people. CNBC reported that consumer confidence rose to its highest level in 18 years. The African American unemployment rate of 5.9 percent is the lowest on record— CNN. Median household income at historic highs—Investor’s Business Daily. Middle class income hit an alltime high last year—The Washington Post. The majority of U.S. workers are satisfied with their job, highest job level satisfaction since 2005—USA Today. Youth unemployment at a 52year low—Wall Street Journal. Smallbusiness optimism, and plans to raise wages are at record highs—Bloomberg. GDP was 4.2 percent, the best performance in 4 years—Reuters. And unemployment is at a severaldecade low— New York Times. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our prayers for Brett Kavanaugh and his family, a judge of integrity. 
b1215 BALTIMORE ORACLES (Mr. SARBANES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to declare the Baltimore Oracles, my staff’s congressional softball team, once again champions, having completed a perfect season, including an impressive 18–3 victory in the championship game. Captained by Peter Gelman, Katie Teleky, and the equipment manager, Raymond O’Mara, the team’s stalwart defense and steadfast offense was unstoppable. Yet roster depth proved to be the team’s ultimate advantage. Mike Pulver, Lucinda Lessley, Paul Kincaid, Jocelyn Kissell, Maddie Bainer, Laura Lubben, Ben Proshek, Rebecca O’Mara, Kate Durkin, Anna Killius, Shannon Frede, and Zach Weber each contributed to form a magnificent infield, while Brian Kaissi, Max Frankel, Andy Allen, Mike VanDan Huevel, James Howard, Stephen Demarais, Jaelon Moaney, and Sam Follansbee worked together to lock down the outfield, as did Jermaine Vincent, who welcomed his newborn son, Jayden, into the world just hours after lifting the trophy. Tim O’Neil, the team’s heart and soul, always kept hope alive with his insistence that the team hit ‘‘just a single,’’ while the team’s loveable mascot, Winston, wagged his tail in agreement. Mr. Speaker, the Baltimore Oracles are, once again, champions, and that is truly world class. f 
RECOGNIZING KAY YORK, 2018 ARKANSAS PRINCIPAL OF THE YEAR (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an educator from the Fourth Congressional District of Arkansas who has dedicated her life to teaching the next generation. Kay York, principal of Ashdown High School, was named the 2018 Arkansas Principal of the Year, and it is an honor that is well earned. Ms. York began her career as a kindergarten teacher and then librarian before going to Ashdown Elementary in 1989 as a school counselor. During a meeting this week, she explained how she has worked to introduce more career and technical education. Partnering with a local community college, students receive instruction in trade skills and concurrent college credit in order to be college and careerready when leaving the halls of high school. It is this innovation in the local school that is helping Ashdown students prepare for a growing economy. Mr. Speaker, Kay York is a leader in education, and I am grateful for the work she is doing in the Fourth Congressional District. 
REAL BIPARTISAN TAX REFORM (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, this week, House Republicans are rushing through yet another tax bill that gives the superwealthy and the wellconnected a big tax break at the expense of working families in my district. The first Republican tax bill already cost $2 trillion, exploding our national deficit and setting up huge cuts for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. The overwhelming number of Americans do not support these massive handouts to the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations. They have already funneled these corporations almost $1 trillion in stock buybacks to shareholders—money that is not going to workers. This week, House Republicans are just doubling down on this deeply unpopular and dangerous tax scam. This latest bill has Republicans scheming to make tax breaks for billionaires permanent, handing tens of billions of dollars to the wealthiest 1 percent. This latest bill will add to our national deficit. Mr. Speaker, Democrats support real bipartisan tax reform that would give relief to working American families. f 
CONGRATULATING JOYCE WALKER, 2018 CLERK OF THE YEAR (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Joyce Walker of Lewisville, North Carolina. Last month, the North Carolina Association of Municipal Clerks named Ms. Walker the 2018 Clerk of the Year. Ms. Walker had already retired when she entered municipal service and started a new career as Lewisville’s town clerk in 2000. During her tenure, she has received numerous designations, including North Carolina Certified Municipal Clerk, Master Municipal Clerk, and a certification from the National Association of Government Archives and Records Administrators. In addition to her duties and accomplishments, she is known by everyone for being a genuinely sweet and pleasant person, dedicated to serving the community through Lewisville’s Student Leadership Committee, the Civic Club’s Scholarship Committee, Lewisville Historical Society, and Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. Congratulations to Joyce Walker on her award of 2018 Clerk of the Year. Lewisville is fortunate to have her as a pillar of institutional knowledge and outstanding community service. 
IN MEMORY OF MICHAEL CIAFARDONI SR. (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the passing of a great man from California’s First District, Michael Ciafardoni, who died at the age of 94. He was born in Nepezzano, Italy. Michael immigrated to America in 1939. 
Although not yet even a United States citizen, he then served in the U.S. Army in World War II as a member of the 803rd tank destroyer battalion as a heavy machine gunner. He was the last surviving member of his company. He earned five Bronze Battle Stars fighting some of the most consequential battles of the war, including the Normandy invasion and the Battle of the Bulge. Michael insisted his proudest wartime experience was not one of those major engagements but, rather, the liberation of a small town in Czechoslovakia near the end of the war. Jewish prisoners were being held in the town of Volary, where they awaited transfer to a Nazi concentration camp. Fortunately, Michael and his company got there first, and they liberated them. To the people of Volary, these men were heroes. When the 803rd was leaving town a few days later, they were ambushed by German soldiers. Indeed, the last soldier killed in Europe, Private Charles Havlat, was riding a tank directly in front of the one Michael was in. The Germans unconditionally surrendered just a few hours later. To this day, the town holds an annual celebration to pay tribute to the American soldiers who risked their lives to free them. I am told that Michael’s one wish was to be honored for his wartime service in Europe. That is a wish that we are fulfilling right here today on the House floor. Mr. Speaker, he was a hero for a country that he wasn’t even yet a citizen of. In October of 1946, he earned U.S. citizenship for his service to his new country, his new home. Before he died, he asked to see his Certificate of Naturalization, which brought a proud smile to his face. Michael is as American as any of us. God bless him and his family. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 6157, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. RES. 1071, RECOGNIZING THAT ALLOWING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THE RIGHT TO VOTE DIMINISHES THE VOTING POWER OF UNITED STATES CITIZENS; AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 1077 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 1077 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider the conference report to accompany the bill (H.R. 6157) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes. All points of order against the conference report and against its consideration are waived. The conference report shall be considered as read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the conference report to its adoption without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate; and (2) one motion to recommit if applicable. SEC. 2. Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order without intervention of any point of order to consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 1071) recognizing that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens. The resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of the question except one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. SEC. 3. It shall be in order at any time on the legislative day of September 27, 2018, or September 28, 2018, for the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or his designee shall consult with the Minority Leader or her designee on the designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this section. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BACON ). The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. TORRES ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of the conference report to H.R. 6157, the Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019, and for an additional resolution, H. Res. 1071. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us represents the second of what will likely be several appropriations packages to fully fund the government for fiscal year 2019. This represents the first time in more than 10 years that Congress will send more than one final appropriations bill to the President for signature before the beginning of the fiscal year. In years past, we have relied strongly on omnibus spending bills to fund the government; but now, with the hard work done on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses of Congress, we are returning to regular order and completing spending work through the normal legislative process. Mr. Speaker, as I have so often said on this floor, the primary obligation of the Congress is to fund the American Government and keep it open and operating. The American people deserve no less. With this package under consideration today, Congress will do just that with respect to 2 of the 12 main spending bills: the Department of Defense and the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and related agencies. In addition, the bill also includes a continuing resolution extending funding for other parts of the government not covered by this bill or the appropriations bill signed by the President last week. In passing this bill, we will provide crucial funding for services across broad areas of the government and fulfill our promises to the American people: to patients, to communities, to business owners, to the military, and to Americans of all stripes. The House is already familiar with this bill from when it was passed in June, and this conference version, agreed to with the Senate, has not substantially changed with respect to Defense. However, it now reflects the combined priorities of the Members of both sides of the aisle and in both the House and the Senate. Mr. Speaker, in the Defense title of the bill, the conference report appropriates a total of $674.4 billion for the Department of Defense, including $606.5 billion in base funding, an increase of $17 billion above fiscal year 2018, and $67.9 billion in overseas contingency operations and global war on terrorism funding. This increase in funding will help begin to right the wrongs committed against our military readiness by several years of chronic underfunding. This bill provides an authorized 2.6 percent pay increase for our troops, the largest pay raise in 9 years, and it ensures we will be able to increase our ActiveDuty number of military personnel by more than 16,000 soldiers. The bill provides $148 billion for equipment procurement, including 13 new warships, a number that includes two new Virginiaclass submarines and three new littoral combat ships. It also adds 93 new F–35 aircraft, new transport aircraft, new tankers, and over 100 new helicopters. The bill also provides $96.1 billion for research and development of new defense systems and technologies, and $243.2 billion for training, maintenance, and base operations, funding that is sorely needed to increase our dwindling readiness to confront threats both at home and abroad. Mr. Speaker, in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education title, the conference report appropriates $178 billion, a $1 billion increase over fiscal year 2018. As the conference knows, I am fortunate to chair the Labor, Health and 
Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, and I am very pleased with the results of this year’s bill. We were able to increase the budget of the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion to $39 billion, thus ensuring that we will be able to direct significant new dollars to medical research, tackling vexing health problems like Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, and the opioid crisis. Indeed, across the entire bill, we are putting more than $6.6 billion into the fight against the opioid crisis. We are putting $7.9 billion into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to make sure that we will have the resources available to battle emerging public health emergencies and fight infectious disease. We did all of this while also ensuring that popular programs like Meals on Wheels, which provides meals for our vulnerable senior citizens, can continue to be funded at current levels. In the other areas of the LaborHHS title, we have provided $12.1 billion for the Department of Labor, including $3.5 billion for job training, $1.7 billion for Job Corps, and $300 million to help veterans transition into the workforce. We provided $71 billion to the Department of Education. This includes $12.4 billion for IDEA special education grants to States. We also funded TRIO at $1.06 million and GEAR UP at $360 million, both substantial increases. b1230 These programs are near and dear to my heart personally and help firstgeneration college students succeed. We increased the maximum Pell grant award to $6,195, and we provided $1.9 billion for career, technical, and adult education programs. We included significant funding for our youngest Americans, including $10.1 billion for Head Start, $5.3 billion for childcare and development block grants, and $250 million for early childhood programs. Finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill also includes a provision acting as a continuing resolution, extending some portions of government funding out to December 7. This extension, while not ideal, gives the Appropriations Committee and both Houses of Congress time to come to an agreement on legislation funding the remaining areas of our government. Such an extension fulfills our primary obligation as legislators, which is to fund the government and keep it open and operating. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a brief look at what we have accomplished and put these bills in context. Last week, the President signed into law the first package of three bills for fiscal year 2019, covering Energy and Water, Military Construction and Veteran Affairs, and the Legislative Branch titles. These bills covered just over 11 percent of total discretionary spending. Today’s bill, which covers the Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education titles, will produce the vast majority of discretionary spending, just short of 65 percent of the total discretionary spending for fiscal year 2019. What is left in the remaining seven titles amounts to just shy of 24 percent of discretionary spending. We may need to do a shortterm continuing resolution for part of the government, but with these bills today, what we will have accomplished is sending over 75 percent of the total discretionary spending to the President for his signature into law before the start of the new fiscal year. That is an amazing accomplishment, one that has not happened in Congress in over a decade. Indeed, this is the first time in more than 10 years that the Department of Defense will have its full annual funding enacted before the start of the fiscal year. This is the first time in 22 years that the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies will have been funded before the beginning of the fiscal year. As Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN has said, this is the next step on the return to regular order. Those who would reject this bill because of the presence of a continuing resolution for part of the government are, frankly, throwing the proverbial baby out with the bath water. This bill, Mr. Speaker, is a return to regular order, and we should all be proud of what we have achieved. It also represents a compromise between the two parties in this body and between this body and our counterpart on the other side of the Capitol Rotunda. Mr. Speaker, today’s conference report represents nearly a year of strong work by Congress. I applaud my colleagues for all they have accomplished. This is just the next step, and we will have many things to do before we finish our appropriations work for fiscal year 2019. But for now, I congratulate the House and the Senate for finalizing this package. I want to take a moment also, since this is the last one of these particular bills that Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN  will present, he will have others later, obviously, but he is ending his term, and I want to congratulate our chairman for the outstanding work that he has done, and also that of his strong working partner, Mrs. LOWEY of New York, for her outstanding work. Frankly, since we are dealing with the LaborH portion, I want to thank my good working partner and friend, ROSADELAURO , the gentlewoman from Connecticut, for her hard work. I also thank our superb staff, particularly our clerk, Ms. Ross, for her work in ably helping us arrive at a monumental achievement. Again, this is the first time in 22 years that the LaborH bill has gotten done in full and on time. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, if you are having deja vu right now, it is because we have been here one too many times before. Our government is on the verge of yet another government shutdown this week. After yet another district work period, we return today to this rule to consider the bills it makes in order. We are left with just one last chance to do our work and one final opportunity to send President Trump a funding bill that reflects the true value of bipartisanship, one without poison pill riders which would put so many of our constituents out of work. This rule makes in order H.R. 6157, the DOD, HHS, and Education omnibus bill; and H. Res. 1071, which is a rebuke on some localities expanding voting opportunities to immigrants. While some of my colleagues may wish to speak about H. Res. 1071, I will focus on the good work that we are accomplishing today, not a meaningless political game House Republican leadership is choosing to waste our time with to further divide this House and instead of focusing on preventing a shutdown. H.R. 6157, the second minibus to keep the government open in fiscal year 2019, is an example of how this body can still work together to reach a bipartisan consensus when we take politics out of the picture. Perhaps more important than what is included in the minibus is what is not included. This minibus rejects the proposed cuts to healthcare programs, job training, education, and access to healthcare that were in President Trump’s budget proposal. This minibus also rejects President Trump’s efforts to expand family separation at our Nation’s border. While many children remain separated from their parents, at least this minibus agreement does not include House Republican language that would have overridden the Flores settlement and authorized the indefinite detention of immigrant children. This is a very small victory, but an important one. This minibus is a fundamental statement of our values, and the United States Congress should not condone the President’s inhumane practice of family separation. In addition, let me make this clear: nothing in this legislation will pay for one foot of the President’s border wall. I hope President Trump joins this Congress and listens to the majority of the American people who don’t want to fund this wall. This Congress has repeatedly rejected funding for his misguided wall, and it is about time the President gave up on such a foolish waste of taxpayer dollars while our bridges, freeways, and streets are crumbling beneath us. That does not do anything to keep America safe. Let’s talk about the good things that this bill brings to our constituents. I am happy to report that this legislation provides a 2.6 percent pay raise for servicemembers who continue to serve our Nation around the world. As a 
mother of a veteran, I celebrate that even more. It is wonderful to hear that our servicemembers are finally being acknowledged for the hard work that they do keeping our Nation safe at home and abroad. In addition to paying our servicemembers more, this agreement will protect our men and women in uniform from one of the most common harms they encounter: shamelessly stated as sexual assault. The $5 million in additional funding we will provide will fully implement and expand the Sexual Assault Special Victims Counsel Program. The Counsel Program provides representation for survivors navigating the complicated military justice process. Hopefully, victims of sexual abuse will not have to wait years to report this crime. The conference report also provides a $35 million increase, for a total of $270 million, to construct, renovate, repair, or expand elementary and secondary public schools on military installations, giving military families an opportunity to thrive and educate their young. In other words, this increase means that we are not only helping our servicemembers, but the families that support them and who provide invaluable moral support for our soldiers. Another bipartisan achievement included in this legislation is an increase for environmental restoration by more than $13 million. One of the shortfalls of this Congress has been a failure to address the water crises we have seen ravaging our communities. In California alone, dozens of communities have experienced recent rates of childhood poisoning that surpass those in Flint, Michigan, with one locale showing rates nearly three times higher. It is unacceptable that in the richest Nation in the world, our children are being poisoned because we refuse to take the necessary actions to provide the infrastructure to deliver clean water to our communities. Securing this funding is a real step to helping invest in communities and the health of our children. That is why we included yet another investment into our communities’ health by increasing funding for the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion. This rejects the cuts proposed by the President in his administration and instead supports research into cures for lifethreatening diseases like Alzheimer’s, cancer, HIV/AIDS, influenza, and diabetes. Additionally, we are providing $4.4 billion to combat the nationwide opioid crisis. This means more prevention programs, better treatment, and training for the workforce to ensure our healthcare professionals aren’t making problems worse. Finally, the last part of this agreement that I would like to highlight is what we are doing for our workforce programs. This bill invests in students, the future of America, those looking for workforce training and working families. Included is: $10.1 billion for Head Start, which provides literacy programs to young children in working families; $5.3 billion for childcare and development block grants to provide childcare assistance to lowincome families. We celebrate that mothers will finally have the support that they need to work and deliver for their families; $160 million for apprenticeship grants to connect businesses to workers; $1.3 billion for career and technical education; and, An increase to the maximum Pell grant to help our students keep pace with the rising cost of college. This is a good bill. This is a bipartisan bill. This is a bill that should be signed into law. I urge the President to look at what a bipartisan agreement looks like and take ‘‘yes’’ for an answer. The last thing any of us want is yet another government shutdown. Let’s prevent that today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking my good friend, my colleague on the Rules Committee, for her kind words and her acknowledgment of how many accomplishments there are that both parties have worked hard to achieve in this particular legislation. That is why I am confident that once the bill comes to the floor, we will have a substantial majority of my friends on the other side of the aisle voting for it and a substantial majority of my friends from my side of the aisle joining them in that. That is a good thing. America should be exceptionally pleased with that. I also want to thank the President, because he is a participant in this. While this bill does represent a compromise, the reality is, particularly in the defense area, we essentially gave the President most of the things that he asked for and worked for, and we brought this. So I think he can take considerable pride in the achievements of restoring the military, because that was his suggestion, his proposal, and he worked to that end. b1245 There are also particular initiatives in the LaborH portion of the bill that the President deserves credit for. My friend cited the apprenticeship program, a great program. That was a Presidentiallevel proposal. A lot of the training programs are. It was this President who declared opioids as a national healthcare emergency. I am proud Congress, on both sides of the aisle, have responded. As my friend knows, there was a budget agreement last year between the administration, the Senate, and the House that actually put an emphasis on more money at the NIH, more money for opioids. I am the first to acknowledge there is good work and good praise here to go all around for everybody. My friends in the House worked very hard. I have always joked with my good friend, the ranking member, that we always start out on different sides, but for four times in a row now, we have come together for the final package and both supported the legislation that authorized Health and Human Services, Labor, Education, and related agencies. Again, that wouldn’t be possible without the leadership of the full committee. That wouldn’t be possible without friends across the rotunda. Far be it from me to overpraise the Senate of the United States, but I have to say that they deserve a lot of praise in this instance, because the leadership of Chairman SHELBY and Ranking Member LEAHY on that side was exceptionally important to us in reaching a resolution and working through some of the knotty issues. Finally, I want to thank the President of the United States. We make Presidents go first in their budget proposals, largely so then we can pick them apart later and do what Congress should do, and that is to make the final decisions in this area. But we took the President’s recommendations very, very seriously. There are many good things in this bill, both in the military side and the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education side, that began with proposals of the administration. I mentioned opioids. I mentioned apprenticeship programs. I could go on. I could mention charter schools. There are many, many proposals out of the administration that are incorporated in this. The reality is, I think this is actually what the American people want to see. All three of the legs of this stool—the House, the Senate, and the executive branch—cooperating together, compromise, found different ways. We did that within our ranks, within this body between Republicans and Democrats. We did that across the rotunda with our colleagues in the Senate. And we certainly did it working with the President of the United States. It takes all three of us to get it done. The reality is, this has already passed the Senate in, I must add, an overwhelmingly bipartisan manner, 93 to 7, if I recall the vote correctly. That makes a strong statement as to how well our friends on both sides of the aisle in the other Chamber work. I think we will have a very strong vote when we get to final legislation. That, again, is something that the leadership on both sides, and particularly in the Appropriations Committee, can take a great deal of pride in. When we send it down to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, if the President of the United States doesn’t sign it, it doesn’t become law. I believe we will get that signature, and I want to acknowledge how hard the President and his team worked with us to arrive at a solution with our friends in both Chambers. 
Mr. Speaker, with praise all around, I am going to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today we are considering a continuing resolution that will extend the Violence Against Women Act only until December 7. I am glad that we aren’t letting this important legislation expire. However, a simple extension is not enough. We need to fully reauthorize and strengthen this landmark act. Therefore, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative JACKSON LEE’s legislation, H.R. 6545, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DONOVAN ). Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California? There was no objection. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from California for her leadership, and, certainly, I rise enthusiastically on her motion. I rise in strong opposition to the rule governing debate for H.R. 6157. We must oppose this rule and defeat the previous question. The reason for such is not because we do not support the troops or our children but because defeating the previous question will enable this House to consider and pass H.R. 6545, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2018. This is an opportunity that we should not squander. This bill is a bill that we have worked on for 2 years, and a bill that I introduced with over 150 cosponsors, timely, in July 2018, after working for 2 years with all of the Nation’s women’s advocacy groups, groups that opposed and fought against domestic violence, and all other stakeholders. I would like to thank them for 2 years of tedious and hard work, ensuring that immigrant women were protected, ensuring that Native American women were protected, ensuring that those who had a domestic abuse warrant could not have a gun without having a lockbox. I want to say to them that we will never give up. The Violence Against Women Act is a landmark piece of legislation, passed in 1994 following the Anita Hill moment that opened our eyes to the then overwhelming problems faced by victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It is now even more evident with the Justice Kavanaugh confirmation hearings and the allegations that have been made by Dr. Ford and others that raise a sense of urgency for the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. It baffles me that Republicans can leave without passing the updated, reauthorized legislation and not just a mere extension. By passing VAWA, we can stop the revictimizing, retraumatizing, and stigmatizing of sexual assault survivors. Enough is enough. Science tells us that trauma severely impacts recall, so let us do our jobs and help them. Women deserve to be respected, protected, and never neglected. As we all know very clearly, VAWA is set to expire this week, and millions of innocent lives are counting on us to get this right and reauthorize VAWA now, reauthorize it with the new provisions to increase funding; increase recognition of stalking, sexual assault, dating violence, and sexual harassment; help women, men, and children everywhere throughout our great country who have and will suffer at the hands of perpetrators who commit these violent and abusive crimes. The bill generically adds the word ‘‘people,’’ because we know that abuse is across the lines of men, women, and children. Clearly, these victims deserve more than a mere 3month expedient extension or piecemeal product to combat these challenges of monumental proportions. What will we say to them? The current climate of the #MeToo movement is a wakeup call to the Nation. Let’s not make this a partisan issue. It should not be—it was not in 1994—because crimes of violence against anyone must be addressed. I remember standing next to Senator Joe Biden, and I remember standing next to Congressman Henry Hyde, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, standing next to Republicans and Democrats to do this. Why can we not do it now? Therefore, when we ignore an extraordinary movement such as the #MeToo movement by not reauthorizing a strengthened and improved VAWA that meets today’s challenges, then we have failed the Nation. If we do not defeat this previous question, we are telling all of our constituents and all of those stakeholders and those women’s centers, like the Houston Area Women’s Center that are waiting for this to be reauthorized and are a place of refuge for women who are fleeing all kinds of violence and who rely heavily on VAWA and all of those who care about protecting women, men, and children’s rights against violence that we do not care. On July 26, 2018, I introduced H.R. 6545, VAWA 2018, which is a compromise version with modest improvements, because I am committed to passing a bipartisan reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. Hopefully, we can do more that is tailored to appeal to Members of Congress across the political spectrum. My question is, why didn’t the Republicans stand up? Where were they? This is not a bill that is out of line. It is a bill that is updated in response to needs. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an additional 2 minutes. Ms. JACKSON LEE. This is the moment for my colleagues to do the right thing, for the right reasons, to help bring H.R. 6545 to the floor for a vote. This has always been a bipartisan effort. Let us not let the current times and background noise sway us away from our pivotal duties. What is happening on the other side, the other body, does, in fact, emphasize our need to act. Let us show the American people that we care about victims of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual assault, and sexual harassment, which have been added to the VAWA 2018. H.R. 6545 has received the support of the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, women and men who are both Republicans and Democrats, which is a national collaboration comprising a large and a diverse group of national, Tribal, State, territorial, and local organizations, advocates, and individuals who focus on the development, passage, and implementation of effective public policy to address domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, the four crimes. These modest yet vital updates we have made in the existing Violence Against Women Act are based on the needs identified by direct service providers who work daily with the victims and the survivors of the four crimes. H.R. 6545 makes the following improvements and more. It makes important investments in prevention, a key priority identified not only by people who work with victims and survivors daily but also by our very own Bipartisan Women’s Caucus. It provides resources to implement evidencebased prevention programs, which will make our communities safer and, ultimately, save taxpayers money. Law enforcement officers are waiting for the resources to help them protect the community. It also safeguards important protections that ensure all victims and survivors have access to safety and justice, and provides mechanisms to hold predators who prey on Native women accountable. Moreover, it provides law enforcement with new tools to protect their community. It offers protections for survivors in Federal, public, subsidized, and assisted housing. It supports victims and survivors who need assistance rebuilding financially. It addresses the needs of underserved communities and improves the healthcare response to the four crimes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again expired. 
Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an additional 1 minute. Ms. JACKSON LEE. It closes many of the loopholes found in dating violence. And in response to the overwhelming victims in the #MeToo movement, it adds sexual harassment as part of the applicable crimes of violence. In short, the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act of 2018 is a bill that should draw wide support but provides acrosstheboard protection for those who need it. There is no reason for this not to be bipartisan and no reason for it not to be on the floor. Let’s not play politics with people’s lives. Let’s not shortchange them by slashing funding in half. Let’s not kick the can down the road while omitting funding. Let’s not dismiss their cries and pleas. Certainly, let’s not punish them because #theydidnot report. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for all of the time, and I thank the gentlewoman from California for all of her leadership. It is time to vote ‘‘no’’ in order for us to move the previous question and pass the Violence Against Women Act that is now ready to move to the floor. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by agreeing with the objective that my friends are laying out but disagreeing with the means by which they are trying to achieve it. I couldn’t agree more that passing the National Violence Against Women Act, or extending it, is the appropriate thing to do. I worked very hard the last time we did the extension. I actually helped put together a coalition of Republicans that brought down the Republican bill, because we thought the Senate Democratic bill was superior. It extended for the first time opportunities in Indian country for Tribal governments to hold non Tribal Members accountable for assault. So this is a cause that is near and dear to my heart. I don’t pretend to sit on the authorization committee, which my good friend from Texas does. I am not exactly sure where they are in the process. But as she did say, this is normally bipartisan. So I look on this as a routine extension while they continue to work through. I think, if we get the legislation to the floor, I have no doubt it will pass in a very strongly bipartisan way. I will say, if we adopt the strategy my friends recommend, we will, actually, in some ways, hurt the cause that I know she feels so passionately about. b1300 The LaborH bill actually funds the battered women shelters and the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Those are two important items in here that are actually funded in the bill. If we bring down the bill, we are going to derail the appropriations process for all Defense, for Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, a lot of these other related programs that are extremely important. So I have no doubt about the sincerity of my friend’s position, but I don’t want to, frankly, number one, disrupt funding for very, very important programs that we help, you know, sustain like, again, the National Domestic Violence Hotline and battered women’s shelters, and I certainly don’t want to defund it for the larger measures here either. So I think you have to recognize we don’t always get everything done on time. I don’t think we got VAWA done on time the last time. I know at least it was quite a difficult struggle, but we eventually got there, and we got there with substantial votes from both parties and got it through. I think we will again. I pledge to work with my friends on the other side of the aisle to achieve that objective. I just don’t think, right now, we should derail an $800 billion bill when this bill will actually extend the current legislation and give us the time to finish whatever the differences are, resolve whatever the differences are, if there are any, within the committee and eventually bring it forward. Again, I think it is a worthy objective. I look forward to working with my friends to achieve it. I just simply don’t want to derail this appropriations bill in the course of doing that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, we are just two more legislative days away from the third Republican government shutdown of 2018. However, we have done our jobs to prevent that today. H.R. 6157 is a testament that despite party differences, we can still come together to work out our differences and put the American public’s interest first. I want to be clear that I do not agree with the rule that we are considering, because this rule makes in order a wholly unrelated immigration bill. This rule fails to allow the debate on a number of amendments and marks the 98th closed rule of this Congress, an alltime record. That is why I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question and the rule. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking my friend from California. We don’t agree on every point here, but we do agree on the underlying legislation. We both, frankly, appreciate the labors of both Democrats and Republicans to come to compromises on an extraordinarily large budget item—65 percent, roughly, of the Federal budget here between Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies. I share my friend’s appreciation and admiration for all that were part of that. My friend did bring up in her close the concern about two items in a government shutdown. I will remind my friend, it was our friends who tried to shut down the government in the House on the other side of the aisle, and the Democrats in the Senate who actually did shut down the government in 2017. So I always point out both parties have done this. It is never a very good idea. Neither has ever achieved their objectives there, so we are working hard to make sure that doesn’t happen. But it wasn’t Republicans that shut down the government in 2017. I think it was actually called—well, I won’t use the name, but it was actually named after a Democratic Senator. So let’s put that aside. Let’s focus. My friend did raise an interesting point on closed rules. And I think, you know, this is something they continue to focus on, and, I think, sometimes lost in this, we ignore the structured rule amendment process that has routinely been used actually by majorities of both sides, to be fair. If we are going to use that metric for measuring openness, I want to clarify a couple of points for the RECORD . Mr. Speaker, 16 of the closed rules cited by the minority were rolling back regulations under the Congressional Review Act, which does not allow for amendments, to ensure that only a majority vote is required in the United States Senate. Another 12 closed rules were for bills where the minority put out a call for amendments but received no amendments. And if my friends from the other side of the aisle believe that open rules are the only measure of success, it is only fair to clarify for the American people the Democratic majority’s record in this regard. In the 111th Congress, under Speaker PELOSI , the majority had zero open rules. However, as we have already stated in the past, comparing open versus closed rules ignores the structured amendment process. The majority has made it a priority to make in order large numbers of amendments for floor consideration, a majority of those with a Democratic sponsor and/or cosponsor. In fact, as of September 26, 2018, Republicans in the 115th Congress have provided for consideration of over 1,650 amendments on the House floor: over 750 of those amendments were offered by my friends, the Democrats on the other side of the aisle; over 635 Republican amendments were made in order; and over 280 bipartisan amendments. So the 114th Congress, the GOP majority has actually allowed over 1,700 amendments to be considered on the House floor, and in the 113th Congress, the Republican majority allowed over 1,500 amendments to be considered on the floor. My friends, the last time they were in the majority, the 111th Congress, offered fewer than 1,000 amendments to be considered. 
So there is a case to be made on both sides of these things. I think the majority has tried to move legislation as best they can, but we certainly want the active participation of our friends from the other side, and, quite often, they are very robust in taking advantage of that opportunity. That is a good thing. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support the rule. I recognize my friends on the other side probably will not do that, and that is appropriate. The rule debate is normally a partisan divide, and I respect my friend’s efforts in that regard. But I know that many of my friends will support the underlying resolution, and, for that, I express my appreciation, and, frankly, my gratitude for the good hard work that has gone back and forth across partisan aisles. This bill, though, this rule represents the next step toward fulfilling our primary obligation as Members of Congress to fund the government. For the first time in over 10 years, we will fully fund the Department of Defense before the start of our fiscal year. We will pass a Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, providing funds for healthcare, schools, medical research, job training, and thousands of other priorities for both parties for the first time in 22 years. And we will enable that the government remains open and operating to provide needed services for our constituents. So I want to applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their hard work. I want to thank our friends in the United States Senate who have already completed their portion of this. I want to join my friend in urging the President, assuming we pass this legislation, to sign it and sign it before the end of the fiscal year. The material previously referred to by Mrs. TORRES is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 1077 O FFERED BY  MS. TORRES  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 6545) to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 6545. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SHUSTER ) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this will be one of the last Transportation and Infrastructure bills this House will consider this Congress and the last during my chairmanship. I am extremely proud to bring a bill to the floor that has bipartisan and bicameral support today. H.R. 302 includes the FAA Reauthorization Act, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act, the National Transportation Safety Board Reauthorization Act, and other priorities from multiple House committees. The FAA Reauthorization Act provides for 5 years of critical stability for our aviation programs and infrastructure. This is the first time since 1982 that we will be passing a 5year bill. Again, as I said, it brings the stability and certainty to the aviation industry that it needs to produce and perform the way it needs to. This bill cuts red tape in the certification process, which means that our manufacturers of avionics and aviation airframes will be able to move forward faster, bringing those products to market faster, quicker, and more efficiently. It encourages American innovation and improves aviation safety, and it provides longterm funding to the Airport Improvement Program. Many Members’ small and mediumsized airports are going to benefit greatly by this. This bill also includes the Disaster Recovery Reform Act. It is the largest FEMA reform package since 2006 post Katrina law. In particular, DRRA focuses on predisaster mitigation. Building better and building smarter before disasters strike is a wise use of our resources. This will save lives, will save money, and will bend the cost curve by spending a little bit of money up front to make sure these disasters don’t have the devastating effects that they possibly could have. My mother used to say that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. That is what this bill does. I want to thank the members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and other committees who worked on this bill. I especially want to thank Chairmen LOBIONDO and BARLETTA , Ranking Members D EFAZIO, LARSEN , and T ITUS, and Senators THUNE and N ELSON for their hard work on this bill. I, finally, want to thank the staff of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the legislative counsel for working tirelessly for months and late nights, often on weekends, to complete this bill. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support today’s legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, September 26, 2018. Hon. BILLSHUSTER , Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN SHUSTER : I write concerning the House Amendments to the Senate Amendments to H.R.302, the ‘‘FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018’’. I appreciate you working with me to include matters in the House Amendments that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security. Several provisions included in the House Amendments will go a long way to better protect Americans and our Homeland. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the House Amendments in the Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the ‘‘FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018’’. I look forward to working with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on additional legislative initiatives this Congress. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman. 
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND  INFRASTRUCTURE , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, September 26, 2018. Hon. MICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAUL: Thank you for your letter regarding the House Amendments to the Senate Amendments to H.R.302, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. I acknowledge your committee’s jurisdictional interest in several provisions in the House amendment and appreciate your willingness to work with us on said provisions. I will place a copy of your letter and our response in the Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. I, too, look forward to working with the Committee on Homeland Security on additional legislative initiatives this Congress. Sincerely, BILLSHUSTER , Chairman. 
Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am going to talk quickly because I have got a lot of people who want to talk, and there are a lot of important things in this bill. I want to thank the chairman—he has done an extraordinary job here— and Chairman LOBIONDO , both retiring, and we will miss them. I also want to thank my colleague Mr. LARSEN . Now, there are many provisions that are very important. I won’t get to all of them here. But flight attendants, thanks to MICHAEL CAPUANO of Massachusetts, are going to get a 10hour minimum rest period. They are safety critical professionals. In the current rules, sometimes they are only getting 4 or 5 hours a night on certain routes. That is not right. That is long overdue. We have to see whether or not we can actually meet the standard of evacuating a plane in 90 seconds as budget carriers and others cram more and more seats in that are narrower and narrower, less and less pitch. Can we still meet those standards? We are going to find out whether we can or not. A provision later in the bill inserted by another of my colleagues, STEVE  COHEN , will require the FAA, particularly if instructed by this study, to set minimum pitch width and length requirements for passenger seats. The drones—we have 100 reports of drone sightings by pilots in controlled airspace being illegally operated every month. Sooner or later, one of those things is going to take down a jetliner with passengers on board. Until now, Congress has prohibited the FAA from regulating these drones because the model aircraft people think they are going to all be grounded. They are not going to be grounded. The FAA isn’t going to go after responsible operators. You are going have to register. You are going to have to show that you understand the rules. But the model aircraft people already do. Many of these toy people, like the one who stopped firefighting in my district in August, are breaking the law; and we are going to know and be able to identify them, find them, fine them, jail them, whatever is necessary to stop these dangerous activities. So that is an incredibly important part of the bill. There are certification reforms. Our manufacturers have been waiting for years. We need to maintain our lead in 
aerospace. We are finally getting certification reform to make their production of new equipment, modern, state oftheart stuff, much easier. We are also going to require the FAA to facilitate and defend their approvals overseas. No more Chinese aviation authority blackmailing our manufacturers into giving them proprietary information so they can sell their product in China. That has got to stop. We are going to make the FAA help our manufacturers over there. We are going to have some passenger rights here. As I already talked about, STEVE COHEN with the seat pitch. There are also consumer protections. We are going to have better identification of what is going to happen. They are going to have to post online, with mass cancelations, what they are going to do with people; permanent prohibition of cellphones in flight. It did not, unfortunately, include a provision that Chairman LOBIONDO , DREWFERGUSON , and I authored to help the airline industry—or defend the airline industry—from following the cruise line model where all the crews are going to be foreign and not subject to U.S. law with flags of convenience. That is something that yet needs to be addressed. It does not allow an increase in the passenger facility charge, which hasn’t been updated in about 20 years, and yet airports do not have sufficient bonding capacity to make the improvements we need to make the airports flow more quickly and a better experience for passengers. The airlines should join me in that instead of opposing that. It also has disaster recovery reform in there. We are going to do more investment in predisaster mitigation, which will save massive amounts of money for taxpayers. We are going to require stronger building codes as we rebuild. It also has some important things for the State of Oregon that relate to earthquake early warning and mitigation regarding forest fires. Finally, we are going to take money that is being stolen from passengers. Now we have a big fight over a passenger facility charge, yet the airlines did not raise a stink when the Republican Congress diverted—raised, twice—the passenger security fee and diverted the money to nonpassenger security issues, which is delaying the deployment of new, more efficient equipment by the TSA. We are going to finally end that practice, not soon enough, but perhaps we can amend that later. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ), who is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 302. Hurricane Florence struck North and South Carolina last week, leading to the loss of many lives and incredible hardship for thousands of families. This Chamber’s thoughts are with those devastated by the storm, particularly those who lost their homes, their livelihoods, and their loved ones. My thanks to the House Appropriations Committee’s chairs, especially their dedicated appropriations staff for their quick action to provide this initial supplemental appropriation of $1.68 billion included in this legislative package. They did the same good job on behalf of the residents of the Carolinas as they did for the victims of Harvey, Irene, and Maria, whose issues and crises we addressed last year. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the bill in all aspects. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the State of Washington (Mr. LARSEN ). Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan, longterm measure to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. I want to thank Chairman SHUSTER , Chairman LOBIONDO , and Ranking Member DEFAZIO for all of the work that they have put into this bill for nearly 5 years now. I am pleased that we have come to a bipartisan and bicameral agreement to raise the bar on aviation safety, improve the experience for the traveling public, better prepare and diversify the aviation workforce, increase the global competitiveness of U.S. aerospace manufacturers, and pave the way for advanced drone operations in U.S. airspace. Many reforms included in this bill have an immediate impact and benefits in Washington State where I am from. It is a leader in U.S. aviation and aerospace. General aviation contributes an estimated $3.6 billion to our economy and supports more than 30,000 jobs a year. Improving the FAA’s certification processes for aircraft and other aviation and airspace products allows U.S. manufacturers like the smaller contractors and suppliers throughout my district to get newer and safer products to market faster. The bill’s certification reforms will better enable U.S. aviation manufacturers to compete globally. H.R. 302 also recognizes the importance of recruiting, training, and developing the next generation of aviation workforce. The bill creates a task force to develop recommendations on encouraging young people to pursue careers in aviation maintenance, manufacturing, and engineering through apprenticeships, as well as two new grant programs to support pilot education and recruitment of aviation maintenance workers. In addition, the legislation includes strong consumer protections like establishing minimum seat dimensions, prohibiting airlines from involuntarily bumping passengers who have cleared the gate, and designating nursing rooms for mothers in each terminal. I have advocated, as well, to better address the needs of passengers with disabilities while traveling. This measure makes significant improvements by requiring the FAA to study lavatory access for passengers with disabilities and increases civil penalties for damaging passengers’ wheelchairs or mobility aids. Importantly, the agreement also protects the safety of our flight attendants by mandating 10 hours of rest for flight attendants, a requirement that has not been updated in two decades and is long overdue. The bipartisan legislation lays the groundwork for the safe and swift integration of drones into the national airspace, and advanced drone operations like package delivery. If the U.S. cannot accommodate the growing drone industry, Congress has been told the innovation and economic benefits would move abroad. This long term FAA reauthorization ensures these jobs stay in the United States. Further, the bill reauthorizes the TSA. This language is particularly important to me as, less than 2 months ago, an airline employee stole an aircraft and engaged in an unauthorized flight, which could have had devastating impacts in communities in northwest Washington State. To help ensure a similar incident does not happen again, the bill requires the TSA to work with industry to evaluate security gaps and how to make industry improvements. This moment has been a long time in the making. I am proud to have worked with the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee members and the staff on this milestone. I would like to give special thanks to my retiring colleagues, Chairman BILLSHUSTER and Chairman FRANK LOBIONDO for their years of service, dedication, and, most importantly, their friendship. The longterm FAA reauthorization bill is a strong, bipartisan effort that will propel the aviation industry, ensure the safety of the traveling public, and support economic growth. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH), who is the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. b1415 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SHUSTER for yielding, and I congratulate him on successfully advancing a 5year FAA reauthorization. H.R. 302 includes the Science Committee’s research and development title, the FLIGHT R&D Act. Title 7 includes our priority that 70 percent of annual FAA research and development funding be for safety research, up from less than 60 percent today. It establishes a new FAA Associate Administrator for Research and Development. 
And it includes the Geospatial Data Act. Another provision provides for specified aircraft operations of space support vehicles licensed under the U.S. space code. Another establishes a DOT Office of Spaceports and a national spaceport policy report. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman’s work on this bill. I strongly support it. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of BILLSHUSTER . I am also supporting the bill. But I want to thank BILLfor being a person who is constructive, visionary, and works across the aisle with constructive ideas. He has made a difference in this House. His father made a difference in this House. I thank him for his service. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. It includes key changes to the Stafford Act that I have been working on with Mr. MCCARTHY and Mr. B ISHOP  for many, many months. I have advocated for over the past year to permit Federal disaster aid funding to be used to not only reconstruct what stood before, but to build to 21st century standards. Importantly, the bill puts an emphasis on predisaster mitigation. The emphasis is on actions taken to lessen the impact of future disasters. Last year, natural disasters cost the Nation a record $306 billion, eclipsing the previous record of $265 billion set in 2005. If we fail to do this, if we fail to mitigate, then we will have forsaken the lessons of Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, Maria, and now Florence, or the devastating wildfires of the West. For every dollar spent in mitigating future disasters, we save between $4 and $8 in avoided future recovery efforts. This just makes sense. Last year, when I traveled with Majority Leader MCCARTHY to Puerto Rico and to the U.S. Virgin Islands with Mr. BISHOP , the chairman of the committee, to see the aftermath of Hurricanes Maria and Irma, I saw Americans struggling without power, access to clean water, basic health services, or shelter over their heads. The majority leader and I came away from that visit determined to help these communities. Chairman BISHOP  joined with us. So I thank the committee. I want to thank Mr. DEFAZIO, too, who like Mr. SHUSTER is a constructive, positive Member who wants to make a difference for our country. My constituents thank him, and the country thanks him. I come to support a bill that was fashioned by two people who wanted to make sure that we did positive things in this House. The American people can be proud of our work today. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LOBIONDO ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation. Mr. LOBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, this is a day we should all celebrate. It is not that often we have an opportunity to have a bipartisan, bicameral bill that does so much to help America. There are a lot of thank yous to go around. You have heard about the particulars of the bill. I want to thank BILLSHUSTER , who has been a very good friend and has put his faith and trust in allowing me to chair the Aviation Subcommittee 6 years. I thank PETER DEFAZIO and R ICKLARSEN for their help. RICKhas been a partner with me on Coast Guard and aviation issues. Also, the staff doesn’t get enough thanks for the time and energy and work they put into it. I thank Holly Lyons, Naveen Rao, and Hunter Presti for all they have done over the years to make this committee move forward. And very special thanks to Geoff Gosselin, who was my legislative director for a number of years and has been a part of the major committee staff for a long time. This is really important to me. Aviation and the FAA has been a passion for me for all of my years in Congress. I have the honor of representing the Federal Aviation Administration’s crown jewel technical center, which is in my district. The technical center is the heartbeat of aviation and the FAA in America. It is, as I said, the crown jewel for safety and security, and for keeping our Nation safe with the greatest aviation system in the world. But it is not because of the sophisticated laboratories and equipment. Yes, we have all that. It is the thousands of men and women who work there who put their heart, soul, energy, and enthusiasm into the dedication of making sure that our aviation system in the United States of America is the finest and the best. This bill will give the certainty and stability for them to do their job for 5 years. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds. Mr. LOBIONDO. As you heard Chairman SHUSTER say, this has not happened since 1982. So for the men and women of the tech center, for the heart and soul that you have put into our system, God bless you and thank you for doing the great job that you do. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ), a member of the committee. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank both Chairman SHUSTER  and Ranking Member DEFAZIO for their work in crafting this compromise bill and for including some of my provisions in the bill. Mr. DEFAZIO did an excellent job of going over pros and cons in this bill, so let me talk about a few provisions I have in here. One requires the GAO to quantify the cost to passengers of every airline computer failure since 2014, including the one that just occurred last night. I am hopeful this report will spur Congress to take further action to ensure better passenger protections. Other provisions will improve transparency in ticket sales and help develop the aviation workforce’s next generation. The bill also has other wins for the traveling public, airline workers, and residents around airports. For example, the bill directs the FAA to be more responsive to community noise issues, including residents who live near airports such as Midway in my district. Finally, this bill will help our aviation system remain the gold standard for safety, including some of those things Mr. DEFAZIO talked about in regard to drones. I thank Chairman SHUSTER for his work on this bill, for all his work as chairman of the committee for 6 years, and for everything he has done in Congress. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ), the chairman of the Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management Subcommittee. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 302, which includes my bill, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act. In 2017, 8 percent of the United States population, that is 26.4 million Americans, were affected by at least one disaster. This year, we have already seen tragedy strike in our communities. For example, in July and August, Pennsylvania was devastated by widespread flooding that destroyed homes and businesses and, tragically, cost lives. In Hershey, Pennsylvania, Swatara Creek crested at over 17 feet, the second highest level since the weather service began keeping records. As we speak, the Carolinas continue to recover from Hurricane Florence, which took the lives of more than 40 Americans. It is clear that these reforms are needed now more than ever. I thank Chairman SHUSTER for his support in getting this bill over the finish line. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  an oped I coauthored with former FEMA Administrator David Paulison. 
ASMILLIONS RECOVER FROM FLORENCE , CONGRESS HAS A CHANCE TOENACT DISASTER  REFORM  (By Rep. Lou Barletta (R–Pa.) and R. David Paulison, 09/25/18) Last fall, the United States was devastated by an unprecedented string of natural disasters: hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. These stain’s now account for three of our country’s five most expensive hurricanes on record, causing a combined $265 billion in damages. Even worse, the storms tragically took the lives of countless Americans. With painful memories of these disasters still fresh, the Atlantic hurricane season is once again at its peak in 2018. Hurricane 
Florence made landfall in the MidAtlantic as a recordbreaking storm, causing destruction like we have never seen in the region. While the communities affected by Florence will undoubtedly demonstrate American resolve and bounce back, they are serving as unfortunate reminders of the need to overhaul and improve our nation’s disaster readiness. As we help those impacted by Florence continue to recover, it is more important than ever that we work to ensure that they are fully prepared for when the next disaster strikes. Over the course of our careers in and around emergency management, we have seen the direct impact predisaster mitigation can have on protecting local infrastructure, preserving property, and saving lives. Whether dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Katrina in 2005, or the increasingly costly storms from more recent years, the primary lesson from these events is that there is no substitute for predisaster mitigation and resilient infrastructure. It could not be clearer: America needs a better system that saves lives and taxpayer dollars by building smarter and stronger before disaster strikes. These lifesaving efforts can also provide massive savings to taxpayers. Expert research has consistently supported this assertion, with one recent study finding that every $1 invested up front in mitigation efforts can save as much as $8 on future costs. With the cost of these storms in the hundreds of billions, the savings predisaster mitigation can provide are invaluable. But despite the devastation caused by previous storms and the ongoing havoc of Florence, the United States continues to drag its feet when it comes to disaster preparedness. Many states still do not incentivize the use of certain safety standards, and the federal government wastes billions on reactive post disaster spending instead of focusing on proactive investment in disaster preparedness. Fortunately, there is already a solution on the table that would provide both much needed relief for Americans and an investment in a stronger future. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA), which has passed the House twice and is currently under consideration in the Senate, would go a long way toward accomplishing the goals of investing in predisaster mitigation and creating a more resilient America. Importantly, this bill would increase the amount of money available for predisaster mitigation following major disasters. By arming communities with the necessary resources to strengthen their infrastructure against hurricanes and other disasters, those affected across the country will be better equipped for the next inevitable disaster. With the DRRA, Congress has an opportunity to enact real disaster reform. Encouragingly, there have been recent signs that our national approach to disaster response, recovery, and mitigation is trending in the right direction. Earlier this year, the House of Representatives included a cost share incentive provision designed to greatly enhance state resiliency in the Bipartisan Budget Reform Act that was signed into law by President Trump. FEMA, in addition to its extraordinary work done regularly in responding to disasters, is taking steps to ensure that this law is implemented effectively and efficiently. The Trump administration has provided strength in its response to those suffering from recent disasters, with Vice President Pence telling a community wracked by Hurricane Harvey that they would work to ‘‘[rebuild] all of Texas bigger and better than ever before.’’ However, these actions are only the beginning of the required wholesale shift in our national disaster framework. It is up to Congress to continue this momentum and enact meaningful reforms that will save lives, property and taxpayer dollars. Including the recordbreaking 2017 season, disaster spending continues to be an everexpanding cost category for the United States. With another tumultuous hurricane season underway, it is time for lawmakers to act. Safer, stronger communities mean a safer, stronger country. If members of Congress are serious about serving their constituents, then senators must finish the important work the House started and pass the Disaster Recovery Reform Act now. 
Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN ), an esteemed member of the committee. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member DEFAZIO and Chairman SHUSTER for their excellent efforts to work out this compromise on the FAA reauthorization and finding consensus with our Senate counterparts. I am glad to have successfully included four important measures in the final package. Special thanks to Senator NELSON  and Ranking Member DEFAZIO for keeping in many key Democratic priorities that support labor, airports, and consumers; and, most notably, preserve the safety of the flying public. I should comment that the SEAT Act, which I am most proud of, a 3year effort that I worked on with ADAM KINZINGER , was accepted by voice vote in committee. I thank Mr. SHUSTER for that. It is a watershed moment for safety for the flying public. We have never before been forced to regulate seat sizes, but the reality is, the safety of the flying public is at risk unless we do. Representative KINZINGER and I worked on this to see to it that we put an end to the shrinking sizes of seats on airplanes through the SEAT Act, or the Safe Egress in Air Travel Act, so it would become law. Americans have become larger. Seats have become smaller. They have become more dangerous. There needs to be a study on the width and the pitch of seats to make sure that they are safe to be evacuated within the approximate 90 seconds they are supposed to be able to evacuate a plane. Flyers Rights and the National Consumers League also supported this. I would like to thank Senators BLUMENTHAL , M ARKEY , W ARNER , and WHITEHOUSE , and others. I look forward to voting for this bill, and I encourage everybody to vote for it. b1430 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES ), chairman of the Highway Subcommittee, a great ally and someone who understands the aviation industry and general aviation like nobody else in Congress. Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, as one of the only professional pilots in Congress, I rise today in strong support of the longawaited FAA reauthorization bill. I was happy to work closely with the chairman, ranking member, and all of our Senate counterparts to reach the compromise legislation that we have today. We are finally providing our aviation programs the muchneeded, longterm certainty that they desire, and I am excited about a number of policies included in the bill that I advocated for. Just quickly, I secured language to prevent new taxes targeting consumers who rent cars at the airport. My aviation workforce development bill to encourage people to pursue careers in aviation as technicians and mechanics is included. I secured fixes on how the FAA regulates Living History Flight Experience flights. We finally ended the egregious FAA fees on large aviation events, such as Sun ’n Fun and Oshkosh air shows. We extended aircraft registration from 3 to 7 years. We directed the FAA to restore the ‘‘all makes and models’’ certificate for experimental aircraft. Building an aircraft in your hangar now will be considered an aeronautical use of that hangar. There are many other things I can’t include in my limited amount of time. As we approach key milestones in the program in 2020 and beyond, my colleagues and I on the committee will remain committed to holding the FAA accountable and ensuring the goals of NextGen are achieved. Mr. Speaker, I could go on, but, obviously, time does not allow. Mr. Speaker, as one of the only professional pilots in Congress, I rise today in strong support of the long awaited FAA Reauthorization bill. I was happy to work closely with the Chairman and Ranking Member, and our Senate counterparts to reach the compromise legislation before us today. We will finally be providing our aviation programs some much needed long term certainty. I am very excited about a number of policies included in the bill that I advocated for. Just to go over them quickly: I secured language to prevent new taxes targeting consumers who rent cars at the airport; My aviation workforce development bill to encourage people to pursue careers as aviation technicians and mechanics; I secured fixes to how FAA regulates living history flight experience flights; We are finally ending the egregious FAA fees on large aviation events; We extended aircraft registration from 3 years to 7 years; Directed the FAA to restore the ‘all makes and models’ certificate for experimental aircraft; Building an aircraft in your hangar will now be considered ‘aeronautical use’ of that hangar; And many others that I can’t cover in my limited time. As we approach key milestones in the program in 2020 and beyond, my colleagues and I on the committee remain committed to holding FAA accountable and ensuring the goals of NextGen are achieved. Mr. Speaker, I could go on and on when it comes to all the aviation policy in this bill that excites me. 
But I’ll save some time for my other colleagues. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS), a member of the committee. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee today in support of this bill, which is the result of a lot of hard work over many years and includes a number of important wins for my constituents in Nevada and for users of our aviation system all around the world. As chair of the House Travel and Tourism Caucus, I am happy to see provisions to improve our airport infrastructure; protect air travelers; and support our pilots, flight attendants, and aviation professionals. In addition, I am glad the bill includes an important extension of the work being done at the Nevada UAS Test Site, which will allow critical research being carried out with NASA and FAA to advance lowaltitude air traffic management vital to the success of the commercial drone industry. As ranking member of the Economic Development Subcommittee, I am also pleased to report that the bill includes the Bipartisan Disaster Recovery and Reform Act. These critical reforms will help communities become more resilient and better prepared to deal with the impacts of global climate change. With our neighbors in the Carolinas reeling from the impacts of Hurricane Florence, our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands still rebuilding from last year’s devastating hurricanes, and numerous communities in the West facing wildfires, this can’t come soon enough. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ), who truly is an expert when it comes to emergency management and disaster recovery. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank the chairman, the ranking member, and their staff for their perseverance on this legislation. This is really an amazing accomplishment that I think is going to transform how we plan for, how we prepare for, and how we respond to and recover from disasters. Mr. Speaker, we spent more than $1.5 trillion responding to 220 disasters that have cost our Nation more than $1 billion each since 1980. We have this process in the Federal Government where we spend billions after a disaster rather than spending millions on the front end actually preparing and making our communities more resilient. This bill begins to change that. There are a number of very important lessons learned, commonsense provisions in this legislation. I want to highlight the duplication of benefits, section 1210, of this legislation that reverses this crazy Federal policy whereby it was incentivizing people to wait, to slow down recovery, while costing FEMA more dollars in temporary housing, eliminating this process whereby loans and grants were viewed as being duplicative. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), a key appropriator on these issues. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I want to rise in the wake of the devastation of Hurricane Florence to profoundly thank the bipartisan leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, of the Appropriations Committee, and of the House for working with North Carolina’s Governor and with our bipartisan congressional delegation to include $1.68 billion in Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery funding to help communities in North Carolina, South Carolina, and across the country recover from natural disasters declared in calendar year 2018. CDBGDR funding is critical for restoring housing, business, and infrastructure affected by Hurricane Florence. These funds constitute a robust down payment, and I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to complete the job once full estimates are available. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say it is very, very reassuring—it is heartening—to the people of North Carolina and South Carolina to have this commitment from the Congress of the United States as our long process of recovery begins. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), a great friend and one of the hardest working members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, this bill includes my bill, the Disaster Declaration Improvement Act, which requires FEMA to place greater consideration on the severe localized impact of damage following a disaster. I have fought for this critical disaster fairness legislation for years, and we finally have an opportunity to get it signed into law. Enacting this language will help level the playing field, help central and southern Illinois receive greater fairness when disaster happens. Thank you, Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member DEFAZIO, for working to include this provision. I urge adoption of this legislation and this bill. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON ), my friend and ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Oregon yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 302, a bill to make the Nation’s transportation system more secure. Not only does H.R. 302 give needed attention to the security of air cargo, airport perimeters, and public areas of airports, as well as mass transit facilities, but for the first time since the 9/ 11 Act, it directs TSA to put significant focus on bolstering surface transportation security. H.R. 302 also does two important things for TSA frontline workers. It directs TSA to sit down with labor representatives to collaborate on long overdue personnel reforms and authorize the TSA training academy. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to say that H.R. 302 includes every Housepassed Democratic TSA bill, as well as language to right a wrong that has resulted in billions of dollars collected from the flying public for security being diverted from TSA security operations. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their collaboration and support. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER ), a hardworking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman here, the ranking member, and so many others who have worked so hard on this legislation, which, I might add, could not be more timely for the State of North Carolina. I want to thank our leadership team in the House and so many who have worked with me and the North Carolina delegation to include the disaster relief funding specific to Hurricane Florence. This is a critical first step of additional support from this body and Congress as a whole, and I also want to commend my colleagues Senator BURR and Senator TILLIS on the other side of the Capitol for all their great work to get us to this point today as well. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ), ranking member on the Small Business Committee. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank both the chairman and the ranking member for their important work on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, a year ago, Hurricane Maria made landfall in my hometown of Yabucoa. The storm ravaged the island, and 115mileperhour winds damaged hundreds of thousands of homes. The entire island lost power, and thousands would not regain electricity until 10 months later, the longest blackout in U.S. history. Sadly, as this crisis unfolded, the President and the administration repeatedly claimed the Federal response was going well. As evidence, they pointed to an artificially low death toll that for months suggested only 64 people had perished. We know now that the true toll is closer to 3,000 lost lives. We can never again allow an artificially low death toll to disguise how the local and the Federal Government failed American citizens. That is why I am pleased this bill contains my legislation, the COUNT Act, to establish Federal guidelines for disaster death counts. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from New York an additional 30 seconds. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Death tolls shape public opinion and, in turn, influence how resources are allocated in response. This new bill will make sure Congress and the American people have a clear picture of the severity of future catastrophes. I thank the ranking member and the chairman for working to include my bill as a provision. I encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ). Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the chairman not on just this but his entire chairmanship, for getting big things done. Mr. Speaker, I want to speak on the underlying bill, the Sports Medicine Licensure Clarity Act. Currently, healthcare providers are licensed by their State. If a healthcare provider travels with a team—professional, college, high school—out of State to take care of the players that they are responsible for, they could be practicing out of the scope of their license since they are out of State. For example, this April, when our Kentucky Wildcats go to Minneapolis for the Final Four, the physicians and healthcare people who travel with them need to be practicing within their licenses. It is clearly within the Commerce Clause for us to clarify this. It is important to do. I encourage the passage of this bill, this provision, and the overall bill. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the remaining time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 3 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 9
3⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HOLDING ). Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Florence devastated North Carolina. Historic levels of rainfall have upended countless families and destroyed crops, with flooding and debris strewn about unlike anything our communities have ever witnessed. The $1.68 billion of disaster relief in this legislation is a muchneeded first step in providing relief. I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to provide for those in need. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ). Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for supporting my proposal to require the FAA to reassess the North Shore helicopter route and address the noise impact on affected communities, improve altitude enforcement, and consider alternative routes, including an allwater route over the Atlantic Ocean. The FAA will be required to hold a public hearing on the North Shore route in impacted communities and open a public comment period, both of which the FAA has refused to do while renewing the route without consulting the public. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ). Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I have a brief 1 minute to say that San Francisco International Airport is in my district. We are being hounded by noise in the middle of the night at 1, 2, and 3 a.m. in the morning. I convened a meeting with the FAA. They joined me at that meeting. They agreed to have a meeting with the airlines, and then the FAA here in Washington decided to renege. This is a message to the FAA: You owe your obligation to all the people of this country, and when a Member of Congress seeks to have you at a meeting, you show up at a meeting. When you don’t show up at a meeting, heads are going to roll. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I have no more speakers. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I already thanked my colleagues, but I also want to thank some staff, particularly some of the staff on my side of the aisle. The staff on both sides worked hard: Alex Burkett; Rachel Carr; Kathy Dedrick; Janet Erickson; David Napoliello; Luke Strimer; Mike Tien; in RICKLARSEN ’s office, Alexandra Menardy; and special thanks, because they don’t get thanked enough around here, to the people who put together legislation that actually works and do yeoman’s work behind the scenes, legislative counsel Karen Anderson, Rosemary Gallagher, and Stephen Hagenbuch. Again, this is a good bill. It shows what we can do here when we drop our partisan cloaks and work together for the good of the American people, both the flying public and the businesses that are dependent upon the aviation industry, and, also, the work we did in here on disaster mitigation, things that should have been done earlier, couldn’t get done earlier. But in a mustpass bill like this, we were able to come to consensus. This is a good day for the House of Representatives—unfortunately, a somewhat rare day. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to thank the leader of the Democrats on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for his efforts and his willingness to work with me. Mr. DEFAZIO has been a great partner over the last 4 years. I want to thank him for that. I also want to thank the chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation, Mr. LOBIONDO , and Ranking Member L ARSEN, for their hard work and bipartisan efforts on this bill. I also want to thank Chairman BARLETTA , chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic Development and Emergency Management, and Ranking Member TITUS, again, with the DRRA bill, working closely with those folks. Also, we want to mention GARRET  GRAVES , who really is a true leader and one of the true experts, not only in Congress but in the United States, when it comes to disaster recovery. I thank him for his efforts. I also want to thank the Democratic staff for their efforts in working with our staff. I know it was a lot of late hours. I thank them so much for those efforts that they put in. To my staff, T&I staff, they did an unbelievable job on a very, very complicated FAA bill, but they also were negotiating the disaster relief bill. There were many long nights. I can’t thank them enough for their hard work and their intelligence and, many times, sort of making magic happen when we went through this. So I thank those folks for that effort. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a list of all the staff whose great work got us to this point today: Matt Sturges, Chris Vieson, Geoff Gosselin, Fred Miller, Holly Woodruff Lyons, Naveen Rao, Hunter Presti, Cameron Humphrey, Max Rosen, Avery Katz, Johanna Hardy, Pam Williams, Tyler Menzler, Kathy Dedrick, Alex Burkett, David Napoliello, Rachel Carr, Michael Tien, Luke Strimer, Janet Erickson, Nick Rossi. Adrian Arnakis, Mike Reynolds, Simone Perez, Isaiah Wonnenberg, Misseye Brickell, Kim Lipsky, Christopher Day, Mohsin Syed, Tom Chapman, Christopher Mulkins, Alexia Noruk, Michael Lueptow, Barrett Percival, Karen Anderson, Rosemary Gallagher, Stephen Hagenbuch, Jaclyn Keshian, Hannah Matesic, Kathy Loden, Brittany Smith, Collin McCune. I want to mention, call out here today, Aviation staff Holly Woodruff Lyons, Naveen Rao, Hunter Presti, Cameron Humphrey, Hannah Matesic, and Avery Katz for their efforts on this FAA bill, but also Johanna Hardy, Pam Williams, and Tyler Menzler for their efforts on the Disaster Recovery and Relief Act. And on the full committee: Chris Vieson, Geoff Gosselin, Fred Miller, Kathy Loden, Brittany Smith, Jeff Urbanchuk, Justin Harclerode, and Nico Alcalde for their tireless efforts. Also, not on our staff anymore, but I need to do a shoutout for him, is Matt Sturges, who was the staff director. He has gone down to be the Deputy Administrator at the FRA. Much of the legislation that we passed over the years wouldn’t be possible without Matt’s leadership and his hard, hard work, and I want to thank him for that. b1445 Finally, I thank the leadership and their staff for working so closely with 
us to get this longterm FAA bill, this disaster bill passed. I thought this FAA bill would be the legislation that eluded me. In the last 5
1⁄2years, in a bipartisan way, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has enacted legislation on every mode of transportation, and, today, we are going to pass a 5year bill, which I mentioned earlier. It hasn’t been done since 1928. But I would be remiss if I didn’t point out and show the true competitive nature of the Shuster family. My father, Bud Shuster, the chairman in 2000, passed a 4
1⁄2year bill. So, Dad, if you are watching, I just wanted to make sure that was in the RECORD . Being chairman has been one of the great honors of my life, and I want to thank my Republican colleagues for putting their trust in me and electing me to be chairman of this committee. Most importantly, I want to thank the people of the Ninth Congressional District for putting their faith in me. I would not be chairman today if they wouldn’t have supported me as strongly as they did over the years, and I owe them this chairmanship. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. I thank my family: my brother and three sisters; my two children, Ali and Garrett, for their love, support, and for tolerating me over the years. And, finally, to my mother, who passed away 2 years ago, we passed a WRDA bill the day she passed away. I can remember the ringing in my ears of her saying, ‘‘Go to work. Do your job.’’ And I did just that. And to my father, whom I mentioned earlier, I thank him and my mother for the love, the guidance they have given me and, most importantly, for the life that they gave me. Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to support H. Res. 1082, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 302, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, as amended. For many years, aviation has been the safest form of transportation in the United States. This is by no means an accident, it is the result of a strong regulatory framework built over time, paired with an ongoing airline system safety culture that is one of the most ambitious in our nation’s history. Mr. Speaker, when this bill first came to the House floor as H.R. 4, I strongly opposed a provision that would establish a research and development program in support of singlepiloted cargo aircraft assisted with remote piloting and computer piloting, and offered an amendment striking that section. Attempts to roll back safety regulations in this manner are counterproductive and compromise safety. I am pleased to see this provision stricken from the final bill text and urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 302, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, I’d like to express my support of H.R. 302 the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2018. Maintaining the safety of our national airspace is paramount, and I am pleased that the provision for SinglePiloted Commercial Cargo Aircraft was removed. Additionally, this bill also highlights a strong focus on airline passenger safety and consumer rights by emphasizing provisions such as minimum legroom, seat width and flight attendant rest mandates. Finally, this legislation provides Hurricane Florence recovery funding, which emphasizes the importance of providing timely assistance to areas prone to natural disasters, similar to those in my home state of Texas. Above all, this bill improves the airline passenger experience, provides longterm airport funding, improves disaster recovery, and ultimately strengthens the U.S. economy and aviation workforce. Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Chairman SHUSTER and Chairman THUNE for the inclusion of the Airport Investment Partnership Program and the removal of the ‘‘flags of convenience’’ language in H.R. 302, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. Similar to Brat 150, an amendment I filed to the Rules Committee on H.R. 4, this bill will improve the Airport Privatization Pilot Program by making it permanent, eliminating the numerical limits on airport participation, and providing grants to help with predevelopment planning costs. The new program will be called the Airport Investment Partnership Program. Airports that are looking to reorganize will soon be able to utilize this program as a viable option to achieve their goals. It is my hope and belief that through these changes, more airports will have an opportunity to increase profitability, efficiency, and improve the traveler experience. In addition, I am pleased that the final language of H.R. 302 does not include socalled airline ‘‘flags of convenience’’ restrictions. The original language proposed was anticompetitive and would have threatened U.S. Open Skies agreements that have brought consumers more options and better prices. The fact is consumers want more choices, not less. That is why I introduced H.R. 5000, the Free to Fly Act. The Free to Fly Act would repeal an outdated regulation from the Great Depressionera which artificially caps foreign ownership in U.S. airlines at twentyfive percent. This regulation is among the strictest in the world, increases the cost of capital, and limits consumer choice. The Free to Fly Act would also require any foreign U.S. airline subsidiaries to be established and regulated under U.S. law, be based in the United States, and only employ American workers. The Free to Fly Act has been endorsed by a wide array of organizations, from conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks, business interests like the U.S. Travel Association, Airports Council InternationalNorth America, Travel Tech, and the Business Travel Coalition, taxpayer watchdogs like the National Taxpayers Union and Taxpayers Protection Alliance, and consumer groups such as Travelers United, FlyersRights.org, Air Travel Fairness, and Consumer Action for a Strong Economy. Both the travel industry and consumers recognize a need for such a change and for more competition. I hope Congress will turn to the free market more as a solution for financing our infrastructure needs and improving the travel experience for all Americans, and I applaud Chairman SHUSTER and Chairman T HUNE on the inclusion of the Airport Investment Partnership Program and the removal of the ‘‘flags of convenience’’ language in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SHUSTER ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 1082. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 6157, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1077, I call up the conference report on the bill (H.R. 6157) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ROUZER ). Pursuant to House Resolution 1077, the conference report is considered read. (For conference report and statement, see proceedings of the House of September 13, 2018, at page H8258.) The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELING HUYSEN ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor this afternoon to present the conference report for H.R. 6157. This conference report provides fullyear funding for the Department of Defense and for the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. It also includes a continuing resolution through December 7, 2018, for Federal Government programs and agencies not covered by the enacted appropriations legislation. Congress has no greater duty than to provide for our common defense. This legislation fulfills this constitutional responsibility. The Department of Defense is now set to receive its full funding on time for the first time in over 10 years. 
Providing this stability and predictability to our military leaders is a necessary and welcome step as we rebuild our Armed Forces. For far too long, their dedication to duty has been weakened by declining and uncertain budgets. Congress has turned that around, beginning with significant investments in last year’s omnibus and continuing this year with an additional $17 billion in base funding for the Department of Defense. In total, the conference report provides $674.4 billion for our Armed Forces, consistent with levels that are authorized. This funding ensures our troops have the resources they need to defend our Nation and succeed in their global missions. This includes funding to sustain ongoing overseas contingency operations and to support increased troop levels. It also ensures our warfighters have the training, readiness, and other resources needed to prepare for their missions, and a pay raise of 2.6 percent. This conference report also replenishes our military might, investing $148 billion in new and modernized equipment and weapons platforms and $96.1 billion for research and development to improve the lethality, effectiveness, and safety of our defense systems. In addition to this critical funding for our national defense, this legislation also includes funding for vital domestic programs. The Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill provides $178 billion for programs that protect the health, education, and labor standards that all Americans deserve. Funding is directed to programs that have wide national benefit, in particular, the National Institutes of Health, which receives a $2 billion increase to bolster its lifesaving research. Notably, funding to fight the opioid abuse epidemic receives historic funding levels, totalling $6.6 billion. This will support treatment, prevention, research, and other efforts to end this national crisis. Another top priority is increased funding to keep our children safe in schools. This includes funding for mental health and other protective measures. Lastly, the LaborHHS bill invests in our future, creating economic opportunity and helping students get ahead and be part of a welltrained 21st century workforce. In addition to these two appropriations bills I mentioned earlier, the conference report includes a continuing resolution through the remaining areas of the Federal Government not covered by this or previous bills that have already been signed into law. This will ensure that the government, indeed, stays open for business. Upon enactment of this legislation, Congress will have provided fullyear funding for threequarters of the Federal Government, but there is more work to be done on the remaining appropriations bills. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is yet another step forward to our goal of returning to what we call regular order and fully funding the Federal Government for the fiscal year. It is a product of months of hard work on the part of our conference committee, led by Chairwoman KAYGRANGER and Chairman TOMCOLE, along with Ranking Member PETER VISCLOSKY and Ranking Member ROSADELAURO . I thank them, of course, and I especially thank my counterpart, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ), my ranking member, who has worked with me through this process as well as earlier bills. We have had a friendship for well over 20 years of service jointly on the Appropriations Committee. And, yes, I thank our Senate counterparts for helping us complete this work as well. This conference report would not be on the floor today without the Appropriations Committee’s dedicated professional and associate staff. I extend to all of them my deepest gratitude for their dedication, service, and hard work. In the front office, as we call it, Nancy Fox, my staff director; Maureen Holohan; Shannon O’Keefe; Jason Gray; Tammy Hughes; Rachel Kahler; Jennifer Hing; Marta Hernandez; Parker Van de Water; and Tom Doelp; and in working closely with us in the minority, Shalanda Young and Chris Bigelow, and others. I am grateful to all these men and women for their professionalism and dedication. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the conference report, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I join Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN in strong support of this bipartisan legislation. The Defense and LaborHHSEducation bills carry out some of Congress’ most important constitutional responsibilities. We should all be pleased that we have completed our work on these bills on time. This conference report provides ample resources for our armed services and strengthens military readiness. It also upholds our commitments to our servicemembers and their families, more funding to repair Department of Defense schools, additional resources to assist victims of military sexual assault, and more support for military medical research. Turning to the LaborHHSEducation division, I am pleased that Congress has resoundingly rejected President Trump’s budget and restored $10 billion in proposed cuts that would have hurt working families. Instead, we have won increased funding for a number of important priorities. This bill boosts biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health, expands opioid abuse treatment and prevention programs, and launches new initiatives for maternal and child health. The bill increases funding for Head Start, childcare, and after school programs on which working families rely. It lifts the maximum Pell grant to help more students access postsecondary education, and it invests in the 21st century workforce with more support for registered apprenticeships and career and technical education. Finally, this bill stands up to President Trump’s cruel family separation policy, with more transparency and oversight of child and family detention. Just as important is what this bill does not include: the unnecessary partisan riders that caused House Democrats to oppose the LaborHHSEducation bill in the Appropriations Committee. And while it is unfortunate that we have no choice but to include a continuing resolution for many important Federal programs, I look forward to completing our remaining appropriation bills when Congress returns in November. I appreciate the hard work of Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , Chairwoman GRANGER , Chairman C OLE, Ranking Member VISCLOSKY , Ranking Member DELAURO , and our Senate counterparts to get us to this point. Of course, we appreciate our hardworking staff. We couldn’t get to this point without them. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and sending it to the President for him to sign. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER ), the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Defense. Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the FY19 Defense and LaborHHS Appropriations conference agreement. Congress’ number one responsibility is to provide for the defense of this Nation. This agreement enables us to fulfill that most fundamental constitutional duty. Since becoming chair, it has been my goal to ensure that this bill reflects the needs of our defense and intelligence experts so that they have the resources needed to combat the threats of today and in the future. I want to thank Members for their participation throughout this process. Their input on how we can best address the needs of our military has been invaluable. This agreement includes many of their ideas and priorities by taking into account the over 6,600 requests submitted by Members. With this agreement, we will be able to do something that has not been done in a decade: provide our military with the funding they need on time so we can rebuild our Armed Forces. This is an agreement we can all be very proud of. It provides Secretary of 
Defense Mattis with the resources he needs to implement the new National Defense Strategy and restore our military. b1500 This conference agreement includes major investments in air superiority, shipbuilding, and the ground forces, including strong support for the National Guard. This bill provides 18 C–130 aircraft, including 8 for the Air National Guard; 24 F–18 Super Hornets; 58 Black Hawk helicopters; 66 Apache helicopters; 93 F–35 Joint Strike Fighters; 13 V–22 aircraft; 13 Navy ships, including 2 VirginiaClass submarines, and 3 Littoral Combat Ships; upgrades for 135 Abrams tanks, and $1.3 billion for additional National Guard and Reserve equipment. This agreement also invests in the research and development needed to maintain our technological superiority, including critical investments in space, hypersonics, nuclear forces, and missile defense, including the Israeli cooperative programs. Finally, this agreement strongly supports our servicemembers and their families by funding the largest pay raise for our troops in 9 years; Growing the force by fully funding the authorized increase in end strength; and, Investing in the defense health program, including critical medical research. I would like to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN . This is his last defense bill, and we are thankful for his leadership on our national security. I would like to thank Ranking Member VISCLOSKY for being a great partner on this bill. I would also like to thank the members of the Defense Subcommittee, as well as the staff, for their many hours of work on this bill. On our majority staff: Jennifer Miller, Walter Hearne, Brooke Boyer, BG Wright, Allison Deters, Collin Lee, Matt Bower, Jackie Ripke, Hayden Milberg, Bill Adkins, Sherry Young, and Barry Walker. On our minority staff: Becky Leggieri, Jennifer Chartrand, and Chris Bigelow. On my personal staff: Johnnie Kaberle and Spencer Freebairn; and on Mr. VISCLOSKY ’s staff, Joe DeVooght. In closing, I, again, urge my colleagues to support this agreement and fund our national security. It is vital that we pass this agreement this week and have it signed into law. The men and women of our Armed Forces deserve no less. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. VISCLOSKY ), the ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. Fiscal year 2019 starts on October 1, and it is wonderful to be here in September considering a conference report on two additional appropriation measures. I would like to commend Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member LOWEY for bringing a semblance of order back to the appropriations process. Along with their Senate counterparts they have managed to navigate an upset political situation that has completely stymied the process for years. When this twobill package is signed into law, it will be the first time in 22 years that there have been five appropriation bills enacted before the start of the fiscal year. I actually wish we had seven more bills conferenced and ready for enactment, but it appears those will have to be deferred until December. I hope that maturity, bipartisan cooperation, and responsible governance will also apply to their consideration and prompt enactment. Timeliness is as important as final dollar determinations. I also would like to recognize and thank the Chairwoman, KAYGRANGER . She has been a joy to work with and a fine leader. She, along with every member of our subcommittee and our tremendous subcommittee staff and associate staff, have conducted themselves in a professional, bipartisan and collegial manner. As a result, this bill reflects the will of Congress. Specific to the Department of Defense, this will be the first time in a decade that our military will not begin the fiscal year under a continuing resolution. Having timely appropriations should improve and stabilize budgeting at the Department, the services, our allies, and contractors. I expect that this certainty will also allow the Department to better adhere to congressional direction, to spend the funding as appropriated, to increase transparency for budget exhibits, and to improve the quality and timeliness of communications to the committee, as has been referenced on pages 8, 9, 10, and 21 of the House Report. Again, I thank my colleagues, Chairwoman GRANGER , and her wonderful staff. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, today marks a victory in the return to regular order on the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill. I am proud of the hard work that brought this bill to us, and I want to highlight just a few of the many provisions in the Labor, Health and Human Services section of the bill that all Members can be proud of. First of all, I want to note that, while the Defense portion of the bill is up $18 billion, the LaborH portion of the bill is actually only up $1 billion. It is no secret that our friends on the other side wanted a $5.5 billion increase. Our friends in the Senate version actually got a $2.2 billion increase. In the end, the LaborH bill allocation actually only increased by $1 billion. In fact, almost threequarters of the bill in front of us is dedicated to defense. The Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education portion of the agreement boosts funding for the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion, continuing our quest to cure diseases like Alzheimer’s and cancer, and unlock the secrets of genetic conditions like Down syndrome. We have provided increases to help our Nation prepare for public health emergencies, and included $6.7 billion to fight and, hopefully, end the opioid abuse epidemic, including $1.1 billion of grants to States. I am also proud to say that the agreement includes $50 million for a new Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund. The fund will not only save American lives, it will save money too. By banking resources now that only can be used in the event of a future infectious disease public health emergency, we will provide the Secretary of Health and Human Services with immediate access to the funds to respond to a new outbreak, without waiting months for Congress to pass a costly supplemental bill. The conference agreement also increases funding for education and training programs, including a $70 million increase for career and technical education, a $60 million increase for TRIO and GEAR UP programs to help more students obtain solid workplace skills and a career of their choosing. We increased funds for Impact Aid and charter schools, and provided funds for our veterans to integrate back into the workforce. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WEBER of Texas). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield the gentleman from Oklahoma an additional 1 minute. Mr. COLE. We invested in TRIO and GEAR UP, and also in early childhood education. We have increased programs to help people with disabilities live independently, and to fund early intervention and education services for children with disabilities. We have increased school safety and mental health programs, and increased funding for graduate medical education to train more primary healthcare providers. Finally, the bill continues the existing prolife riders, including the Hyde and Weldon amendments. We didn’t give an inch on prolife matters in this bill. This is a good agreement. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, particularly Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , and my good friend, Ranking Member LOWEY . I also want to acknowledge my working partner and good friend, ROSADELAURO from Connecticut, and all the Members that participated in the process. 
But I particularly want to thank the outstanding staff that made this possible: Susan Ross, Jennifer Cama, Justin Gibbons, Kathryn Salmon, and Karyn Richman and Lori Bias on the majority staff; and minority staff Stephen Steigleder and Robin Juliano for their diligence in bringing this across the finish line for the first time in 22 years. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield the gentleman from Oklahoma an additional 15 seconds. Mr. COLE. So I look forward to the floor passage and the President’s signature. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ), the distinguished ranking member of the LaborHHS Subcommittee. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report which includes the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education appropriations bill. The LaborH funding bill for 2019 makes important investments in health, education, and in our families. It is a $1 billion increase over 2018, leaving us to deliberate $178.1 billion. Especially when I view that the Trump administration is pursuing the fundamental hollowing out of our Federal agencies, we secured critical investments in Democratic priorities that boost the middle class. First, let me talk about health. This bill includes an increase of $2 billion for NIH research. It also includes increases across the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health Resources and Services Administration, particularly to address health threats to pregnant women and babies. We also secured increases for our country’s youngest children and their families, including an increase of $50 million for childcare and $200 million for Head Start, including $50 million more for Early Head Start. Turning to education, we won an increase for afterschool programs and a raise in the maximum Pell grant, $100 for $6,195, to help students afford the rising cost of a college degree. The bill also eliminates two longstanding riders. They had prohibited school districts from using education funding for transportation to address segregated schools. So, from health, to childcare, to education, we achieved several great wins for the American people. Importantly, the bill before us maintains the bipartisan amendments that House Democrats introduced to condemn the administration’s policy of separating families, to demand a reunification plan, and to ensure that HHS upholds the highest standards of care for children in our custody. I am proud of what we included. I am also proud of what we kept out. We held the line and kept out harmful ideological riders that would have sabotaged the Affordable Care Act, undermined women’s health, and overturned the Flores settlement to allow the administration to keep kids in cages indefinitely. All that being said, the bill is not perfect. For example, I am disappointed we missed an opportunity to say, once and for all, that the authors of the Every Student Succeeds Act never intended for Federal dollars to arm teachers, which, as I understand, is current law. And I believe the LaborHHS bill continues to be shortchanged. Based on the overall increase of $18 billion for nondefense discretionary spending, this bill should be receiving an increase of $5.5 billion. Nevertheless, on the whole, this bipartisan, bicameral compromise is a positive result that helped provide the American people a better chance at a better life, and I urge my colleagues to support it. I also take this opportunity to say a thank you to my working partner and good friend, Chairman COLE. I also want to say a thank you to the ranking member of the full Appropriations Committee, my colleague, Congresswoman NITALOWEY , and to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, RODNEY FRELINGHUYSEN . I thank him for the great work on this effort, and we know you will not be joining us again next year, so thank you for helping us get this across the finish line. For the Democratic staff: Stephen Steigleder, Robin Juliano; to my staff: Leticia Mederos, Liz Albertine, Caitlin Peruccio, Will Serio, Kris Fetterman; to the majority staff: Susan Ross, Jennifer Cama, Justin Gibbons, Kathryn Salmon, Karyn Richman, and Lori Bias. Mr. Speaker, our names appear on the doors of the congressional offices, but it is the labor every single day of these outstanding staff people that help us put these bills together on behalf of the American people. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS), chairman of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee, my predecessor. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I simply want to add my appreciation and thanks to the chairman and ranking members that you have just heard from for this momentous agreement before us today. And I would like to especially commend our big chairman, FRELINGHUYSEN , for the work he has done on this bill, but, more importantly, the work he has done throughout his career in this body. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN , you are a great friend, a great Member of this body, a great leader, and you will be missed. b1515 Once again, we are demonstrating that the Appropriations Committee can and will do everything in our power to get the job done. I especially appreciate the committee’s continued commitment to address the addiction crisis. This bill maintains a comprehensive focus on prevention, treatment, and education, following the holistic model of Operation UNITE in my congressional district, and it provides a record $6.6 billion toward those programs. You have all heard me talk endlessly, if you will, about the devastation brought by opioid abuse touching so many lives around the country over the last 20 years. Chairman COLEhas been a truly incredible leader and partner in combating this epidemic, and I am confident that this bill will bring substantial relief to our communities in need. I would also like to thank the conference committee for their work to ensure that the Department of Defense not only receives the funding it needs, but that its funding is finalized before the beginning of the fiscal year to allow them to plan. For too long, some say 22 years, we in Congress have not delivered this bill in time to allow the Department to operate as it should with its full allotment of funding on October 1. When combined with the Energy and Water and MILCONVA bills that are already law, this bill does exactly that and provides the Department of Defense with the funds it needs to defend American interests and values around the world, including a welldeserved pay raise for the men and women in uniform who serve bravely under our flag. Thank you again for your collective leadership. This is a great agreement, and I urge its support. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM), the ranking member of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Committee. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for his service in the U.S. Congress. He will be greatly missed by me and by many of us. I would like to thank Ranking Member LOWEY and the subcommittee chairs and the ranking members and all of their staffs for their hard work on this bipartisan legislation. This bill makes robust investments in the Department of Defense, improving the readiness of our troops and, as has been pointed out, providing them with a welldeserved pay raise. I am also pleased with this bill’s commitment to the environmental cleanup of Defense Superfund sites, providing $184 million over the request for defense cleanup efforts. This is much needed. The LaborHealth and Human Services portion of this package provides vital resources that will impact the lives of every American. A $2 billion increase to the National Institutes of 
Health will give our researchers the tools they need to find the cures for diseases such as Alzheimer’s and diabetes. The community service block grants, however, did not receive the House level of funding but still got an increase. This is very important for families and communities that can use some of this funding, as they have come up with proven programs on how to make opioid recovery successful. I am particularly proud of the inclusion of my amendment to allow individuals diagnosed with cancer to defer payments on their public student loans while they undergo lifesaving treatments. I would like to thank Representative ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN and Representative PERLMUTTER , as well as Chairman COLE and Ranking Member D ELAURO , for their bipartisan leadership on this important issue. With more than 70,000 young adults diagnosed with cancer each year, they will now be able to focus on what is more important: beating cancer and getting healthy, not worrying about making their student loan payments while receiving chemotherapy. I support this spending package, and I look forward to the fact that we have a continuing resolution included in here so that the government doesn’t shut down. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ), the chairman of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the fiscal year 2019 Defense Appropriations and LaborHealth and Human Services Appropriations conference report. First, I would like to take a minute to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , who has led the effort to return the Appropriations Committee to regular order. He knows too well the crippling impacts of a CR on the Department of Defense, and today he delivers on a promise to ensure our men and women in uniform are provided funding on time. Personally, I am grateful to the chairman for the many years of friendship. His steady leadership will be greatly missed. I also want to commend Chairwoman GRANGER for her good work in getting this bill here today and, certainly, PETEVISCLOSKY , the ranking member, for his work in getting this bill here today, and also Ranking Member LOWEY , the full committee ranking member, for her great work. We are all here today, together, in a rare moment of bipartisanship to fund our military and to fund LaborHuman Services, which hasn’t been passed here for some time. I served on the House Appropriations Committee for many years, and providing for our men and women in uniform is a privilege and one of the most important things that we do. This conference report provides vital funding for the armed services, including a 2.6 percent pay raise. This bill is an investment in our future superiority on land, air, and sea. I might point out that, yesterday, Secretary Mattis made comments at VMI that, when he took the helm of the Department, he asked for the strategy, and he was told there was none. Well, thankfully, under General Mattis’ leadership, not only does the Department have a clear strategy, but the roadmap to achieve that strategy as well. It requires Congress to do our part, which we are going to do today. We are in a unique time in history that depends on U.S. leadership throughout the world. A strong U.S. military with our allies creates stability. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman from California. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, the security of our Nation and the peace of the world depend on a strong U.S. military, and I urge my colleagues to support the conference report. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ ), the ranking member of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I, too, join my colleagues in commending Ranking Member LOWEY and Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for their stewardship of the appropriations process in the House. We are moving in the right direction. We have partial regular order, and, hopefully, with every passing fiscal year, it will get better and better. But, truly, it is an accomplishment. I also want to commend Subcommittee Chairwoman GRANGER and Ranking Member VISCLOSKY for producing a Defense Appropriations bill that provides the resources necessary for our armed services to perform the critical role of securing our Nation. Additionally, I thank Subcommittee Ranking Member DELAURO and Chairman COLE, my dear friends, for their hard work on the LaborHealth and Human ServicesEducation funding bill. The bill before us funds both the assets our armed services need and invests in our servicemembers. It provides for a muchneeded 2.6 percent increase in military pay. The bill also includes over $1.4 billion for congressionally directed medical research programs, including $130 million for breast cancer research, a personal issue to me. I am proud to say this bill retains my language protecting access to lifesaving mammograms, particularly for women between 40 and 50 years old, and provides $5 million for my ongoing initiative, the Breast Cancer Education and Awareness Requires Learning Young Act, or the EARLY Act, which will continue to help increase the quality and quantity of life for young women with breast cancer. The bill increases funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by $125 million and funds programs that fight the spread of the Zika virus, as well as combats the use of tobacco. It also provides vital funding that will benefit seniors, and it includes $5 million to help Holocaust survivors and their families. Mr. Speaker, I represent one of the largest Holocaust survivor populations in the United States, and with every passing day, they are getting extremely elderly, and we are losing more and more of them each and every day. Honoring them and allowing them to live with dignity in the last years of their lives is critical. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that this bill will help us shine a light on an inhumane family separation policy perpetrated by this administration. This legislation—and I very much appreciate this—includes my amendment to allow Members of Congress immediate access to immigration detention centers. We must remain committed to seeking justice for families that have been needlessly torn apart at our borders. The administration, actually, repeatedly stopped Members of Congress from being able to immediately access these detention centers to conduct our proper oversight role, and this amendment, when it is signed into law by the President, will allow us to conduct that oversight as a coequal branch of our government. Mr. Speaker, more importantly, before yielding back, I just want to take a moment to thank Chairman RODNEY  FRELINGHUYSEN . It has really been an honor to serve with this gentleman, in the truest sense of the word. He has done a remarkable job serving his constituents. It has been fun being a member of the Appropriations Committee both while he was a chairman, a ranking member, and now the chairman of the full committee. We will miss him, and I know his constituents will miss his service. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this appropriations bill. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CARTER ), the chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this conference report. I have been honored to be able to serve on the Defense Appropriations Committee and also to represent Fort Hood, the great place, the tip of the spear of our United States Army land forces. I am very proud of what we are doing for those men and women who stand in 
harm’s way on our behalf. We are giving them a 2.6 percent pay raise for all of our troops, wherever they may be. And they have earned this money because they stand in harm’s way on our behalf. We are taking care of our military families that are just as important a part of the fight as our warriors, and this is a long time coming. This is the largest pay raise in 9 years. This bill contains accelerated efforts to modernize our armored brigade combat teams, including modernizing a significant number of Abrams tanks and Strykers so they can meet the needs of future war. They are the tip of the spear. This is good for us and good for those who stand in harm’s way on our behalf. We are particularly proud of the fact that we have stood up the Army Futures Command in Austin, Texas, which is just south of my home, and we are going to learn about how to fight the next generations of wars through the Futures Command. I am very proud that we have support for General Mattis’ goal of ensuring our military is ready to fight the next fight—and fight it tonight, if necessary. Critically, this bill provides this funding on time, ensuring money can be spent in its most efficient, effective way and that we are able to accomplish our goals accordingly. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank everyone both in the majority and the minority who were involved in this bill and this conference, and I thank them on behalf of the men and women who stand in harm’s way on our behalf and who live in my district. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR ), a member of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member LOWEY for yielding, and I want to thank her for her leadership that she provides in the Appropriations Committee. I also want to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN . As Ms. W ASSERMAN  SCHULTZ said, we are going to miss you. We appreciate your leadership, and we thank you. You are a decent human being, and we really appreciate your friendship. I also want to thank the staff and the Members on both sides of the aisle who have worked in a very bipartisan way to address these issues that are important. Every year, we have to pass the appropriations bill. It is the train that has to pass every year. And I certainly want to thank Mrs. LOWEY , the chairman, and the folks responsible for making this happen. First of all, let me talk about defense. I certainly agree with the Members that this provides billions of dollars to make sure that we restore critical military readiness programs. We have to make sure we have a strong military, and with this funding, we will. I certainly appreciate the sacrifice that the men and women make to protect our country, and this is what this appropriation bill does. We also fully fund the 2.6 percent pay raise for our military families because, again, we have to make sure that we support them because they are under very difficult times. There are a lot of other things in the Defense Appropriations bill, whether it is the assistance that provides $50 million for specialized counseling programs to meet the unique needs of military children or whether it is the National Guard’s counterdrug program to help reduce the illegal drugs from coming into the United States. Those are areas that are strong for our military. b1530 Let me move over to the LaborHHS bill. There are so many things that both Chairman COLEand Ms. D ELAURO  also provided that they worked so hard on; let me just highlight a couple of them. The Pell grant is so important because we increased the amount by an extra $100. Now the maximum amount is $6,195. You have to have Pell grants so that we can have our young students go off to college. $10 billion for Head Start. There was a $200 million increase. I want to thank our folks for adding that money. The Federal TRIO program and the GEAR UP program are moneys that we added. I certainly want to say thank you also for the $907 million for senior nutrition programs to help our seniors. The title I grants for school districts, $15.9 billion that we added. And the last thing I want to talk about is the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, we have increased the funding to provide that type of assistance. So, again, I want to say thank you to the chairman, to our ranking member, Mrs. LOWEY , and all of the staff on both sides, I thank them for a job well done. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to thank both the chairman and chairwoman of the full committee and all of the chairs and ranking members for their outstanding job, particularly on bringing us to this point, though much work needs to be done. I am going to speak as fast as I can, but I am very grateful for the $7.9 billion in the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, which will include many of us who have suffered from Hurricane Harvey in 2017, but, more particularly, will help those who are suffering with much devastation after Hurricane Florence. I am grateful for the 2.6 percent raise of our military personnel, and the $40 million for the historically Black colleges and universities that we have worked on, and minority serving institutions for basic research programs. And then I worked on the issue dealing with triplenegative breast cancer, and I am pleased with $374 million for cancer research and $130 million for breast cancer research, being a breast cancer survivor. And particularly, though, I would have wanted the Violence Against Women Act to be on the floor and pass the full bill. I am glad for the $35 million for continued implementation expansion of the Sexual Assault Special Victims Counsel Program under Defense. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. And I am grateful for the death gratuities for troops in the case of a government shutdown. And the funds prohibited to use outside of the War Powers Resolution in Syria and Iraq. But, most importantly, my constituents are suffering from a lack of healthcare because of the undermining of the Affordable Care Act that we are still fighting for. So I am very grateful for the $39.1 billion for the National Institutes of Health; $4.4 billion for programs that respond to the opioid crisis; $7.9 billion for the Centers for Disease Control, and, of course, what is so important to our constituents in Houston and Texas is that our community health centers that are our first line of defense to those who don’t have healthcare; $678 million for a maternal and child health block grant—we have some of the largest numbers of maternal death in Houston among African American women; $10 billion for Head Start; and then specifically I want to talk about the unaccompanied children, $1.3 billion, but I am grateful for the language that demands of this administration to tell us who is there that has not been reunited with their families, and then the 12,000 that are in the jurisdiction of HHS. We have got to get those individuals united with their families and we have got to be able to have ICE arrest the sponsors. Finally, Mr. Speaker, $10.3 million for a domestic violence hotline. In any event, this bill speaks to education and healthcare, and I want to ask my colleagues to recognize that more work has to be done. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ). Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from New York for her leadership. I also thank Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN for his leadership, and I wish him well in the next chapter of his career. While this combination of a CR and a minibus is a halfmeasure by definition, I certainly urge its adoption in 
order to avert what would be the third government shutdown just this year. As a representative of northern Virginia, I do not share the President’s idea that there is ever such a thing as a good government shutdown. I look forward to working with the committee to complete the rest of the appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019 in order to address pressing issues, especially providing our hardworking Federal employees with a raise. Again, I thank Chairwoman GRANGER  and Ranking Member VISCLOSKY for including in the defense appropriations bill an authorization for the Secretary of Defense in the event of a government shutdown to make military death gratuity payments to families of fallen servicemembers. I have made this a cause of mine for a number of Congresses now. I am so glad this is finally going to be enshrined in law, and I thank the Appropriations Subcommittee and full committee for their cooperation in including this provision. I commend the committee for including this overdue provision, and I know the families of the fallen appreciate it. It was shameful that Congress would ever allow the government to shut down and allow grieving military families who made the ultimate sacrifice to go without this small, but very important, measure of the country’s gratitude and recognition of their loved one’s ultimate sacrifice. Again, I thank the leadership of the committee, the subcommittee, and their staffs for providing this bipartisan bill. I certainly urge its passage and look forward to supporting it. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE), a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, I thank our ranking member for yielding, but also for her tireless work, day and night, to really help shape this bill to be, in many ways, a bipartisan bill, but also, each and every day, looking out for the American people and making sure that the American Dream is real for everyone in this country. So I thank again Congresswoman LOWEY . Also, to all of our ranking members and to Leader PELOSI , I want to just say that the input they have received from all of us on our staff—and I want to thank our staff and the phenomenal work that they have done—it has been just amazing. As a member of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education funding subcommittee, I am pleased to see many good provisions in this bill. This bill eliminates hundreds of poison pill riders ranging from efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, eliminate teen pregnancy and title X to dismantling of critical labor and consumer protections. The bill also includes $60 million for a competitive grant, which we have been working on for years, for computer science funding for young girls, young people living below the poverty line, and people of color. I thank Mr. FLEISCHMANN and others for helping us work on this, because this truly is a bipartisan effort. We included robust increases in job training, education, and childcare, as well as for historically Black colleges and universities. Now, my State of California has the highest number of students coming to HBCUs, so I am very grateful for those increases. Even with these increases, Mr. Speaker, this conference report still falls short of what we need to just return to the funding levels before the sequester 8 years ago. Adjusted for inflation, we are still way below the 2010 levels for domestic spending. What is worse, while underfunding our needs here at home, the bill includes an increase in $19 billion in defense. This includes a $2 billion increase for the overseas contingency fund, which really I think should be part of our base budget for the Pentagon funding. We know that the Pentagon doesn’t need this excessive increase in funding to ensure our national security. A Washington Post report in 2016 exposed a report detailing $125 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse, yet we are increasing this by $19 billion, not to mention that much of this funding is dedicated to continuing the endless wars that we are waging around the world, wars that, I might add, Congress has still not debated or voted on. Put simply, the defense spending will be the single largest increase for the Pentagon since the beginning of the Bush socalled war on terror. Enough is enough, Mr. Speaker. We need to really make sure that our defense spending ensures our troop readiness and our national security, but we also need to work on the American people and stop these outrageous increases to defense funding. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time. Mr. Speaker, should the President sign this package into law, threequarters of all base discretionary spending will be enacted prior to the start of the fiscal year. While Chairman FRELING HUYSEN and I would have preferred to finish everything, we should be proud of the work that we have done—all the members of the committees working together—and it is a testament to the chairman’s leadership. For me, it has really been an honor and a privilege to work with him. I know we have a little more work to do. But I thank him again for his hard work and commitment to doing the right thing in serving the American people. I also thank the staff for their work, including Rebecca Leggieri, Jennifer Chartrand, Stephen Steigleder, and Robin Juliano of the minority staff, along with clerks Jennifer Miller, Susan Ross, and the rest of the majority staff. Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill, I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time. Mr. Speaker, I just want to correct the record. I introduced Judge CARTER  as the chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee. I want to acknowledge his former chairmanship of that committee and his able leadership of the Military Construction Subcommittee. And also I forgot to recognize my personal staff, Katie Hazlett, and the wonderful people in my office—which is I think true of all of our offices—that make us look as good as they possibly can. And lastly, as we gather here this afternoon, we recognize that so many young men and women are serving around the world, leaving their families on multiple deployments. We honor their service and sacrifice. They are truly doing the work of freedom. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the Joint Explanatory Statement to the Conference Report to accompany H.R. 6157, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019, and Senate Report 115–290 which provide an additional $30 million in funding for DefenseWide Manufacturing Science and Technology Program’s Advanced Manufacturing within the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, DefenseWide Account. These funds will allow the Department of Defense to establish a Microelectronics Cybersecurity Center. Microelectronics support nearly all Department of Defense activities, enabling capabilities such as the global positioning system, radar, command and control, and communications. Ensuring secure access to leadingedge microelectronics, however, is a challenge. The changing global semiconductor industry and the sophistication of U.S. adversaries, who might target military electronic components, require us to update our domestic microelectronics security framework. DefenseWide Manufacturing Science and Technology is an investment mechanism that allows the Department of Defense to advance stateoftheart, defenseessential, manufacturing capabilities through the development of technologies and processes necessary to produce defense systems. This funding increase will allow the United States to achieve a rapid modernization of domestic stateofthe art foundry operations, through the use of not forprofit publicprivatepartnerships, to produce trusted microelectronics. I support rapid modernization of domestic stateoftheart foundry operations that produce trusted microelectronics and thank the conference committee for all their work on the issue. Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the conferees on H.R. 6157 for rejecting a proposal by the Trump administration to use this appropriation measure to impose a new 
$700 fee for businesses in the Northern Mariana Islands that employ foreign workers under the Commonwealth Only Transitional Worker (CW) program. Working with Chairman BISHOP , Ranking Member GRIJALVA , and other colleagues here in the House of Representatives, I was recently able to enact the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act, Public Law 115– 218, including a new requirement for employment of those workers: the U.S. Department of Labor must first certify that no U.S. worker is able, willing, and available for the job that would be filled. This is the same kind of certification required prior to issuance of an H–2B visa for temporary foreign workers, but which is free for that purpose. In my view the certification should be free to employers in the Marianas, as well. I can understand that the Department may face new costs in standing up and operating this service for the Marianas CW program. The Department, however, had the opportunity during the drafting of the U.S. Workforce Act to ask for the authority to levy a fee. They did not nor is it likely I would have agreed. Nevertheless, it is in the interest of our businesses and the Marianas economy that the new certification requirement be initiated without delay. The conferees have ensured that will be the case by providing in Section 118 of H.R. 6157 for the rescission of $8.25 million in unobligated funds from the H–1B Nonimmigrant Petitioner Account to be used in fiscal year 2019 for processing applications for foreign labor certifications, including activities related to wage determinations and associated tasks, submitted by Marianas employers. Again, I thank the conferees for adopting this winwin solution. I wish also to record my support for extension of the Violence Against Women Act in the Continuing Resolution through December 7, although, of course, a reauthorization for a multiyear period is still wanting. I was an original cosponsor of the reauthorization in 2013 and included a provision in Section 201 that doubled funding allocated to the Northern Mariana Islands for the Sexual Assault Service Program. And Section 809 allowed women who petition for status as victims of human trafficking or violence to count the time lived in the Northern Marianas as time present in the United States, so they can more quickly adjust to a permanent immigrant status. I am also an original cosponsor of reauthorization of VAWA in this Congress, H.R. 6545. Lastly, I strongly support the 2.6 percent pay increase for our uniformed services, mandated in H.R. 6157. Our country asks so much of these brave men and women and we owe them, at the very least, a wage that keeps pace with costs. Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 6157, the Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Appropriations Act for FY2019. I commend Ranking Members NITALOWEY , ROSA DELAURO , and P ETEVISCLOSKY , as well as Chairmen RODNEY FRELINGHUYSEN and TOMCOLE and Chairwoman K AYGRANGER  and our Senate counterparts for coming together on this bill. And I would be remiss if I did not recognize the outstanding efforts of both the majority and minority LHHS subcommittee staff—Susan Ross, Jen Cama, Kathryn Salmon, Justin Gibbons, Lori Bias, Stephen Steigleder, and Robin Juliano—for their dedication, professionalism and responsiveness to staff on both sides of the aisle throughout the entire appropriations process. While I wish the bills had come to the floor separately under regular order to give proper time to debate and discuss all the issues, I am pleased that the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies bill is getting a vote on the floor for the first time in more than 10 years. Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. It rejects the draconian cuts the Trump administration proposed and strengthens our commitment to our constituents by funding critical programs. It also ensures our national defense remains strong in a dangerous world. I am particularly pleased that HHS programs received such robust funding in this Conference agreement. The bill increases funding for three of my top legislative priorities: fighting underage drinking, supporting newborn screening, and reducing maternal mortality. At a time when this country is experiencing the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases in history, this bill restores both the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program and all Title X Family Planning dollars that help our teens gain critical access to reproductive health care and education. And as this country faces a growing demand for health care providers, the conference report reinstates the Health Careers Opportunity Program to increase workforce diversity and restores funding for the Community Health Centers and the Nursing Workforce Programs to their FY18 funding levels. As Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee, I was particularly pleased that the bill includes amendments from our markup to protect unaccompanied migrant children, including allowing Members of Congress to access facilities funded by the Office of Refugee Resettlement for oversight visits. Finally, I am glad that we were able to maintain funding to help separated children deal with trauma. Among Education and Labor programs, I am glad the maximum Pell award will get an increase, which I called for during our committee markup. I am also pleased we were able to work together to provide modest increases to Head Start and TRIO programs to serve students with the highest needs. Finally, the bill provides modest increases in funding for apprenticeships and maintains language that directs those funds to proven registered apprenticeships. In the Defense section bill, I am pleased that we maintained the 2.6 percent military pay raise and that we express support for a civilian pay raise as well. The bill also ensures that families can receive death gratuities during government shutdowns. Finally, I am grateful that we were able to continue to show bipartisan support for assisting survivors of military sexual assault. Mr. Speaker, this bill funds vital programs and ensures that our government will remain open through December. I am proud to vote in support of the bill, and I encourage my colleagues to join me so that we can safeguard the health and wellbeing of the most vulnerable in our country and keep our nation secure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 1077, the previous question is ordered. The question is on adoption of the conference report. Pursuant to clause 10 of rule XX, the yeas and nays are ordered. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question are postponed. f 
b1545 RECOGNIZING THAT ALLOWING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THE RIGHT TO VOTE DIMINISHES THE VOTING POWER OF UNITED STATES CITIZENS Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1077, I call up the resolution (H. Res. 1071) recognizing that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1077, the resolution is considered read. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. R ES. 1071 Whereas voting is fundamental to a functioning democracy; Whereas the Constitution prohibits discrimination in voting based on race, sex, poll taxes, and age; Whereas it is of paramount importance that the United States maintains the legitimacy of its elections and protects them from interference, including interference from foreign threats and illegal voting; Whereas the city of San Francisco, California, is allowing noncitizens, including illegal immigrants, to register to vote in school board elections; and Whereas Federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in elections for Federal office: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H. Res. 1071. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, which expresses the official position of the United States House of Representatives regarding the sanctity of the vote in our Federal system. The authors of America’s founding documents extolled the necessity of voting to a free society. Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the Declaration of Independence, believed that ‘‘should things go wrong at any time, the people will set them to rights by the peaceable exercise of their elective rights.’’ Jefferson also believed that ‘‘the elective franchise, if guarded as the ark of our safety, will peaceably dissipate all combinations to subvert a constitution dictated by the wisdom, and resting on the will of the people.’’ James Madison, the principal author of the Constitution and contributor to the Federalist Papers said at the Constitutional Convention that he ‘‘considered the popular election of one branch of the national legislature as essential to every plan of free government,’’ and ‘‘that the great fabric to be raised would be more stable and durable, if it should rest on the solid foundation of the people themselves.’’ Madison continued that: ‘‘Under every view of the subject, it seems indispensable that the mass of citizens should not be without a voice in making the laws which they are to obey, and in choosing the magistrates who are to administer them.’’ Alexander Hamilton, another contributor to the Federalist Papers, wrote that: ‘‘A share in the sovereignty of the state, which is exercised by the citizens at large, in voting at elections is one of the most important rights of the subject, and in a republic ought to stand foremost in the estimation of the law.’’ John Jay, the third and final contributor to the Federalist Papers believed: ‘‘The Americans are the first people whom Heaven has favored with an opportunity of deliberating upon and choosing the forms of government under which they should live.’’ The Constitution prohibits discrimination in voting based on race, sex, poll taxes, and age. The sanctity of the vote is also part of the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence on the subject. In the landmark case of Reynolds v. Sims, the Supreme Court stated: ‘‘The right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of a weight of a citizen’s vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.’’ Voting is fundamental to a functioning democracy, and it is of paramount importance that the United States maintain the legitimacy of its elections and protect them from undue interference, including foreign threats and illegal voting. While the Constitution allows States and localities to grant noncitizens the right to vote in nonFederal elections, citizenship today denotes an association with America which uniquely encourages voting in furtherance of the wellbeing of other Americans and the sovereign nation to which they owe their allegiance. Consequently, it is very concerning to me that some localities have extended to noncitizens the right to vote in certain nonFederal elections, including school board elections. Extending voting rights to those who are not lawfully present in the United States acts as another incentive for foreign nationals to come to the United States illegally and stay. Instead of helping deter illegal behavior, jurisdictions such as San Francisco continue to implement policies that encourage such behavior. They do so to the detriment of U.S. citizens and legal immigrants alike. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for introducing this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I oppose H. Res. 1071 because it is nothing more than a bald faced political stunt concocted by the majority in an attempt to stir up its political base ahead of the midterm elections. It also represents just the latest in a long and cynical line of attempts by the majority to denigrate and delegitimize our Nation’s immigrant population and to erode public trust in our electoral system, all to bolster shortterm political gains. Let me start out by saying that I can’t imagine someone in a foreign country deciding to emigrate to the United States in order to vote in a school board election. That is just absurd. But the resolution also falls short on its own merits. For example, the resolution states that it is ‘‘of paramount importance that the United States maintains the legitimacy of its elections and protects them from interference, including interference from foreign threats.’’ I agree with the statement as far as it goes, but I question why the resolution makes no mention whatsoever of the greatest foreign threat of electoral interference, namely interference by Russia in an attempt to disrupt our democracy and sow chaos in our political and governmental system. It is the consensus view of our Nation’s intelligence community that Russia interfered in the 2016 Presidential election in order to help Donald Trump become President. Indeed, senior administration officials warned just last month that Russia’s attempts to interfere in our electoral system are ongoing and threaten the integrity of both the upcoming midyear elections and the 2020 Presidential election. At a minimum, the resolution should call attention to this fact. Yet, incredibly, the resolution makes absolutely no mention of it. The resolution also disrespects States’ rights, failing to mention that the Constitution allows States and localities to permit noncitizen voting in local elections, a practice that dates to the earliest days of the Republic. For example, New York City permitted noncitizen voting in local school board elections until elections in local school boards were done away with in New York City about 20 years ago. Indeed, an earlier version of the resolution’s text, obtained by the farright Breitbart website, included the whereas clause acknowledging these facts stating: ‘‘Whereas, the Constitution allows States and localities to grant noncitizens the right to vote in nonFederal elections.’’ Yet perhaps recognizing that this was something of an admission against interest, the introduced version does not include this clause. The fact of the matter is that local governments have permitted noncitizen voting in various local elections, school board elections, and so forth, through the entire history of the Republic. So why suddenly do we have this expression of terrible concern? The resolution also speaks to the fact that ‘‘voting is fundamental to a functioning democracy.’’ Yet, it fails to address any of the real threats to voting rights that our citizens face. Five years ago, the Supreme Court effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act’s preclearance requirement, the act’s most important enforcement mechanism, in its decision in Shelby County v. Holder. The Court reached its conclusion notwithstanding Congress’ factual findings in 2006 that the act, including its preclearance provision, was still needed in the face of continuing discrimination by some States against minority voters. b1600 In response to the Court’s decision, and under Republican control, States that had been subject to the act’s preclearance requirement wasted no time in pursuing voting restrictions that once again threatened to undermine the voting rights of African Americans and other racial and ethnic minority groups. These measures included voter identification requirements, restriction or elimination of early voting or same day registration, and bans on exoffenders from voting, all of which makes it disproportionately harder for racial and ethnic minorities to vote. These restrictions, enacted by Republican legislatures, have probably deprived hundreds of thousands—or even several million—of our fellow citizens of the right to vote. They are the real threat to our democracy, not the few noncitizens who may vote in a school board election in some local government that has permitted it through the last 100 years. Members have introduced various proposals to address these continuing attempts by certain States and localities to suppress voters. For example, H.R. 12, the Voter Empowerment Act, 
which was introduced by Representative JOHN LEWIS and has 183 cosponsors, would reinforce the constitutional right to vote. The bill includes, among other things, provisions to make it easier to register to vote and to prohibit and criminally punish voter suppression tactics like caging, voter intimidation, and the provision of false and deceptive voting information. The bill would also restore voting rights for nonviolent felons after they have served their sentences. H.R. 2978, the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which was introduced by Representative Terry Sewell and has 192 cosponsors, is a direct response to the Supreme Court’s invitation to Congress articulated in the Shelby County decision to revise section 4 of the Voting Rights Act. The bill would amend the Voting Rights Act to protect voters by requiring States with a recent history of voter discrimination to seek approval from the Department of Justice before making any changes to their electoral laws. Finally, H.R. 5011, the Election Security Act, which was introduced by Representative BENNIE THOMPSON and has 122 cosponsors, would designate election infrastructure as critical infrastructure and provide financial support and enhanced security for the infrastructure to carry out elections so we are not subject to foreign invasion by hackers. These measures each address critical threats to our electoral system and the right to vote, yet none of them has received a hearing or other consideration by the House. It is a travesty that the Republicans have chosen to spend what is likely to be the last week of session before the midterm elections to consider this purely symbolic measure. They refuse to consider bills that would actually help ensure the right to vote but will consider this purely symbolic measure, one that in itself seeks to stoke the worst kinds of sentiments in the body politic, instead of devoting time to considering and passing meaningful and substantive protections for the right to vote and to protect us from foreign interference in our electoral system. I cannot support this travesty. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), the majority leader and chief author of this legislation. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution condemning San Francisco for allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections. I want you to imagine for 1 minute that you are an immigrant to this country. You came here the right way. You followed all the rules. And after years of anticipation, after improving your English, passing your citizenship test, declaring your allegiance to the United States and renouncing your allegiance to foreign powers, finally, you are naturalized as an American citizen. In that moment, you undergo a change. You have known many leaders in the past, but in that moment George Washington is your Founding Father. You have experienced many hardships, but suddenly Valley Forge is your winter. The Declaration is your inspiration, and the Constitution is your inheritance. Lincoln is your liberator. Electricity, skyscrapers, and flight are your heritage. The GIs of Dday are your heroes. Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke of your dreams. The Moon bears your flag, and our future is your future. Imagine, again, that you are this immigrant. What do you feel the first time you step into a polling place? Actually, we don’t need to imagine, because we know of so many naturalized citizens who have come here, played by the rules, and earned their citizenship. I have talked to many of these Americans. They describe casting their first vote as one of the proudest moments of their lives. In that moment, they are reminded that they have become Americans, with all the rights and responsibilities of Americans. Unfortunately, a handful of cities in our country are shortcircuiting the legal path to citizenship. In the process, they are devaluing the very concept of citizenship itself. These cities—Chicago, Cambridge, and, most recently, San Francisco— allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. That includes illegal immigrants who broke our laws when they entered our country. And not only that, noncitizen voting actually dilutes the votes and voices of lawabiding Americans, including naturalized citizens. If you are an American citizen in one of these cities, your vote in local elections counts less now than it did before. You can thank your local politicians for that. But that isn’t my ultimate concern with noncitizens voting. Ultimately, I am concerned about the message that this practice sends about American citizenship itself. Ask yourself: Does the concept of citizenship mean anything? Does it grant a person special consideration in the eyes of our government? Does it impose upon him or her special duties or obligations? Sadly, too many of our elites and even our politicians have trouble answering these questions. But for the rest of us, American citizenship still resonates as a source of significance, purpose, and identity. We know that citizenship has a meaning, that borders have a purpose, and that sovereignty is an imperative. Precisely because we believe these things, we have to look out for our fellow Americans while guarding our elections against all outside interference. That is why I have introduced a resolution condemning efforts to allow noncitizens to vote in our elections. American citizenship means something special. Just ask any naturalized citizen. They will tell you about it. I urge my colleagues to stand with me in protecting the right to vote for every American citizen of legal age and rejecting all outside and foreign interference in our elections. Citizenship means something. It means something to become an American. And today, I hope this body understands that and stands united in condemning a devaluing of citizenship. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the ranking member for his leadership and commitment to working on real voter empowerment legislation. Let me acknowledge and thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. GOODLATTE , and seek an opportunity to really work on legislation that addresses the question. I have looked at it, and I have no doubt that my friends on the other side of the aisle are sincere. I read the resolution, and I noted that one particular example was utilized, Mr. Speaker. The example happens to be in San Francisco, California. I live in Houston and my colleague lives in New York. I know that if this was a moment of crisis, we would see Members from the 50 States—at least 20 States, 35 States—bringing this to the attention of the Judiciary Committee. To date, I have had no complaint from Houston or the State of Texas. But I do know, when I engage in dialogue with my constituents, they are all aware of the Russian interference in the 2016 election and the constant pounding of emails and the leaks that occurred and the attack on the DNC. Everybody is aware of that. To my knowledge—help me, those of my colleagues who are on the floor—we have not passed one single legislative initiative or crime bill that addresses the question of preventing Russian interference. We are now at the end of the first crunch of this year of legislation. So I would ask my colleagues, if they are so concerned about voting, would they help us add back to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, in which Dr. King marched and our colleague, JOHN LEWIS, was beaten almost to his death, bleeding on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and restore section 5? Section 5 might even help with this issue, because section 5 provides preclearance to any voting procedure that any State may have that would be unfair and discriminatory. If my colleagues want to argue anything, they can argue that the main bill that they should be putting forward is a restoration of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. 
We have found throughout the States that we do have violations. We have voter ID laws that are discriminatory. We have voter suppression. We have people being purged off of lists. Interestingly enough, they happen to be poor people, African Americans and Hispanic citizens. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to this legislation. I don’t like legislation that is ‘‘gotcha’’ legislation. I have great respect for my friend from California. I, frankly, believe it is a State matter—it is really a city matter—that could be handled by those who are concerned. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an additional 30 seconds. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I see that, for the national question of voter empowerment, there is a litany of laws still waiting for this body to pass: voter security, the ballot security, the question of our voting machines, the question of the individuals with the hanging chads, the right kind of voting machines and equipment, and, again, to protect people against purging legitimate registered voters off the registration list. I have faced that in Texas. I have the Justice Department on notice. I would like to say publicly: Department of Justice, get back to me on that request that I made about being purged in Texas. For all these reasons, I think we are going in the wrong direction, Mr. Speaker, and I would like us to put back on the floor section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN ). Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Leader MCCARTHY ’s resolution recognizing that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens. I have been deeply concerned, seeing more and more municipalities around the country starting to allow noncitizens and illegal immigrants the right to vote in local elections, the most current example being San Francisco, as they have started allowing both noncitizens and illegal immigrants to register to vote in school board elections. One day it is local elections; the next, it could be statewide elections; and then, finally, the Federal elections. We can’t start down this path. But we know this is where the radical left wants to grow their electorate. For generations, brave men and women have fought and died in order to protect the fundamental right of American citizens to participate in free and fair elections. You and I can’t go and vote in the elections of other nations, nor should we. The gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ) can’t vote in New Jersey or Pennsylvania because he isn’t a citizen of New Jersey or Pennsylvania. He is a citizen of New York. Nor should he vote in those elections. When we start granting others the sacred right reserved for U.S. citizens, it puts our whole democratic process at risk and diminishes the voice of the American people. We simply can’t allow noncitizens and illegal immigrants to water down the desires and visions of the American people at the voting booth. This is dangerous, and it disrespects the importance and value of citizenship that has been fought for throughout our Nation’s history. Now more than ever, it is critical that we ensure only American citizens are casting ballots to determine our children’s future in this country. The left continues to embrace deadly sanctuary cities, more illegal immigrants at the voting booth, and open border policies that simply do not fall in line with American values. b1615 These ideas are so far out of mainstream and continue to be rejected time and time again by the American people of this country who want their voice to count. This resolution is a critical step to stand up and protect our democratic process. And while I stand here 100 percent supportive of my good friend’s resolution, I believe this is laying the groundwork for what is to come. We have work to do. I believe we must defund these communities that adopt policies like noncitizen and illegal immigrant voting. These voting policies do nothing more than foster more of the dangerous, illegal sanctuary city policies that we have seen around the country. These sanctuary policies promote illegal activity, undermine law enforcement, and suppress concerns of actual U.S. citizen voters. I encourage all Members to support the commonsense resolution to protect the integrity of the American elections and protect the value of U.S. citizen voting power. Let’s protect the voting booth. Let’s protect the rule of law. Let’s protect American values. Let’s always put America first. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. SWALWELL ), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, it appears the stated reason for this resolution, listening to my colleague who just spoke from South Carolina, is the rule of law, integrity, upholding our democracy, all things that I think people on both sides of the aisle support and can get behind. But, when you read the resolution, you would also think that we have a nationwide problem of undocumented immigrants voting and influencing our election. I would expect that, if that is the case, the sponsors of this legislation would introduce evidence that shows this widespread problem. I would hope that they are not relying upon the bogus, false claim that Donald Trump put forward that there are undocumented voters—3 million of them, he said—which has been panned and rebuked by every expert in the country. I would hope they are not relying on the voting rights commission that Donald Trump put in place after the election that could best be compared to an airplane that is still at the gate with a lot of maintenance problems and is probably never, ever going to get off the ground. There is zero evidence to support this resolution. But you know who did interfere in our last election; you know who did seek to influence the American voter? The Russians. You know who does not care about the rule of law? The Russians. Do you know who does not care about integrity at the ballot box? The Russians. Our intelligence community unanimously concluded—unanimously, across the board—that the Russians sought to interfere and influence the last election. So I thought, well, if my colleagues across the aisle are interested in addressing integrity at the ballot box, they would accept an amendment that would also condemn what the Russians did. They will not accept that amendment, and I would yield to my colleagues if they were open to accepting that amendment and showing the American people that they truly are interested in protecting the integrity of the ballot box. After this attack on our elections, I put forward legislation with ELIJAH  CUMMINGS to have an independent commission look back at our better days where, after September 11, Republicans and Democrats on the House stairs united and sang ‘‘God Bless America’’ but also came together, worked together, and used unity as an antidote against an adversary’s attack. Only two Republicans have signed on to that bill. I thought on the Intelligence Committee we could look at who was responsible, how the Russians did this, identify U.S. persons who worked with the Russians, and tell the American people how this would never happen again. Instead, that investigation has been shuttered, and we learn almost every day from new indictments from the special counsel’s investigation that there is evidence that U.S. persons worked with the Russians. I thought on the Judiciary Committee we would look at the government response to what the Russians were doing. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. SWALWELL of California. I thought on the Judiciary Committee we would look at some of these issues in our democracy. Instead, we have gone back in time and we have reopened and relitigated the Hillary Clinton emails. 
This resolution does nothing but divide Americans even further. It stokes an issue where there is no evidence of it even occurring, and it fails to address our true common enemy: any adversary, from any country who would seek to interfere in our election. Let’s not miss this opportunity now to address that threat and unite and say we are not going to tolerate it. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS). Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Leader MCCARTHY for introducing this resolution. It is important to underscore how seriously we must take the right for American citizens to vote. Several cities have granted the right to vote in local elections to those who are not citizens of the United States. San Francisco is allowing illegal aliens and other noncitizens to vote in certain local elections. It is still illegal for noncitizens to vote in Federal elections, and rightly so. Twelve States plus the District of Columbia allow illegal aliens to obtain driver’s licenses, eight of them offering voter registration at the time of getting that license, popularly called the ‘‘motor voter laws.’’ It is easy to see how illegal voting can occur. Illegal voting does not have to be widespread or number in the millions for it to make a real impact on our elections. In Ohio alone, there were 199 races or issues that were tied or decided by just 1 vote in the last 5 years. Recent incidents of illegals attempting to vote in Federal elections have been in the news. Just last month, 19 foreign nationals were indicted in North Carolina for illegally voting in the 2016 election. In Ohio, seven were indicted for illegal voting in our elections. Voter fraud is a serious crime. We have to take the integrity of our elections seriously. It is not just a matter of simple mistakes or a handful of improper votes. These elections determine the direction and policies of our cities, States, and the Nation. We must recognize the effect that allowing illegal immigrants to vote has on our right as Americans to selfdetermination. Recently, I introduced the Ensuring American Voters Act, which would shore up potential gaps in our voter registration system like States that have the motor voter laws and give illegal aliens driver licenses. Typically, when you register to vote, you have to show proof of residency. More importantly, in my legislation you would have to show proof of citizenship. Some say this isn’t a problem, but when you don’t really require proof of citizenship, how do we know the extent of the problem? As the gentleman from California, Leader MCCARTHY , rightly says, it devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of American citizens. This is a commonsense resolution that emphasizes current Federal law, barring noncitizens from voting in Federal elections. A recent poll by Rasmussen shows nearly 70 percent of American people agree. I want to thank Leader MCCARTHY  for introducing this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS ), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, let’s discuss voting in America. Mr. Speaker, 53 years ago—I believe we all know it—Congress passed the Voting Rights Act to stop discriminatory practices which denied minorities the right to vote. Poll workers would ask people of color ridiculous questions like how many jelly beans are in a jar or use humiliating literacy tests and poll taxes to take away this constitutional right from good, decent people. Now here we go again. Because the President of the United States just can’t accept the fact that he lost the popular vote, which he did, my Republican colleagues are using racial fears and dishonest words like ‘‘protecting our elections’’ to encourage Americans to turn against each other. If my GOP colleagues want to protect our elections, they should join us in restoring the Voting Rights Act, which was gutted in 2013. If my Republican colleagues want to protect our elections, they should join us in passing legislation to protect the special counsel. But obviously the GOP feels that they can’t win on their merits, so they will suppress the vote instead, change the rules, close polling places in Black and Latino communities, remove legitimate voters from voting rolls, pass laws like the one in North Carolina that targeted African Americans with—and I quote—surgical precision. Mr. Speaker, the American people are tired of the division and distractions from the White House and the GOP to turn us against our neighbors, especially along racial lines. And 53 years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the American people expect men and women of conscience to step up and refuse to repeat the mistakes of the past. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ), a member of the committee. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, this bill does not come to the floor in a vacuum. The midterms are coming, and Republicans will try to pass whatever they can before they lose and pass the gavel to the new speaker. We know more indictments and guilty pleas are coming from Robert Mueller and his team. And we know Republicans are having a hard time defending tax cuts where 83 percent of the cuts went to the richest 1 percent and the rest of America got the leftovers. Don’t forget the Republican agenda to systematically strip away healthcare coverage from American families who are struggling to make ends meet. No, the Republicans don’t want to talk about tax breaks, billionaires, or foreign Russian alliances of this President, Trump. They want to talk about San Francisco and immigrants. Republicans will do anything to beat up on immigrants so that voters forget to beat up on Republicans who hold all the power. It is the oldest political hokeydoke trick in the book: Hey, look over there. Blame them, not us. It started with immigrants are rapists and murderers. Then it was immigrants are cheats and frauds. Then they said immigrants and their children deserve to be locked up. Then the President started pushing the biggest lie of all, that immigrants are a drain on the economy. The Attorney General, despite being humiliated—I mean humiliated—on a daily basis by this President is adopting a scorched earth, antiimmigrant agenda to ensure as many deportations as he can before he gets the axe. The American people are smart enough to see through this smoke screen. They see how Republicans deal with a woman’s claim of sexual assault. They understand their taxes are going up at the same time taxes on the Republicans’ favorite people, that is to say, corporations, are going down. They get the message that the President opposes immigrant families, except when it comes to his wife and her ability to make her own family citizens of the United States of America. They understand Republicans are opposed to legal immigration, refugees, Dreamers, and TPS holders. Republicans are not interested in the kinds of immigrants or the kinds of average American families, for that matter, who wake up early every day and have to go to work. Nope. Not the people who work at MaraLago, not the people who tend to the greens at Trump golf courses, not the people who clean rooms at Trump Tower. No, Republicans are not interested in people who work at Trump Tower, only the people who can afford to live there. Well, your time is up. The American people will make that real clear in a few weeks, regardless of how many of these resolutions you pass. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to be abundantly clear that this resolution is nothing more than a political stunt steeped in hypocrisy. The resolution states that it is ‘‘of paramount importance that the United States maintains 
the legitimacy of its elections and protects them from interference, including interference from foreign threats. . . .’’ Yet, the resolution does not even mention the greatest foreign threat we face: Russian interference intended to disrupt our elections and sow chaos in our political system. The hypocrisy is breathtaking. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and others have worked all year to undermine and discredit the Mueller investigation into Russian interference with our 2016 election. b1630 To add insult to injury, House Republicans have voted to block needed funding to help States secure their election systems from the ongoing Russian and other efforts to interfere in the 2018 elections, ongoing efforts that have been confirmed by senior administration officials. In short, this resolution ignores the real threats our elections are facing and, instead, plays political games by trying to stoke the worse kinds of sentiments in the body politic, all focused on local practices that are not sudden and not new but are as old as the Republic and suddenly pose a threat. I cannot vote for this charade. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, this is a very straightforward resolution that every Member of this House can and should vote for. It simply says: ‘‘Resolved, that the House of Representatives recognizes that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens.’’ When a United States citizen registers and votes, they expect their vote to be a full vote that counts. When someone who is not lawfully present in the United States is allowed to go into a polling place and vote, they dilute the votes of the United States citizens who are voting in that same election. Why not recognize that? Why not discourage that? Why not call it exactly what it is? The House of Representatives recognizes that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens. It is a very straightforward resolution. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, this resolution is simply a divisive political stunt meant to stir up conservative voters ahead of the midterm elections and seeks to stoke the worst kinds of sentiments in the body politic. The resolution states that it is ‘‘of paramount importance that the United States maintains the legitimacy of its elections and protects them from interference, including interference from foreign threats.’’ Yet the resolution does not even mention the greatest ‘‘foreign threat’’ we face—Russian interference intended to disrupt our elections and sow chaos in our political system. The GOP hypocrisy is breathtaking. The Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and others have worked all year to undermine and discredit the Mueller investigation into the Russian interference with our 2016 election. Furthermore, House Republicans have voted to block needed funding to help states better secure their election systems from the ongoing Russian efforts to interfere in the 2018 election—ongoing efforts that have been confirmed by senior Administration officials. In short, this resolution ignores the real threats our elections are facing, and instead plays political games. The resolution also states that ‘‘voting is fundamental to a functioning democracy,’’ yet it fails to address any of the real threats to voting rights faced by U.S. citizens. After the conservative members of the Supreme Court effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act’s pre clearance requirement in Shelby County v. Holder, many states have sought to enact voting restrictions that target African Americans and other minority groups. This resolution says and does nothing about those actions. The resolution shows that Republican support for States’ rights is trumped by antiimmigrant sentiment. An earlier version of the resolution obtained by Breitbart correctly stated that ‘‘the Constitution allows States and localities to grant noncitizens the right to vote in nonFederal elections.’’ This clause is no longer in the resolution, perhaps because Republicans understood how hypocritical it made them look, especially because the resolution is focused on condemning state and local ordinances regarding voting in nonfederal elections. Putting this resolution on the floor is nothing but a political stunt, a game designed only for political advertising for the midterm elections fortythree days from today. I refuse to play that cynical game with Republicans and will cast my vote as ‘‘present’’ in recognition of the fraudulent nature of these proceedings. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 1077, the previous question is ordered on the resolution and the preamble. The question is on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6729) to allow nonprofit organizations to register with the Secretary of the Treasury and share information on activities that may involve human trafficking or money laundering with financial institutions and regulatory authorities, under a safe harbor that offers protections from liability, in order to better identify and report potential human trafficking or money laundering activities. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 6729 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Empowering Financial Institutions to Fight Human Trafficking Act of 2018’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER). Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative TIPTON . I rise today to speak on behalf of the bipartisan Empowering Financial Institutions to Fight Human Trafficking Act. The International Labor Organization estimates that, globally, over 40 million people were victims of human trafficking in 2016. It is obvious that in order to deter the criminals who enslave and sell human beings, we need to hit them where it hurts: their bank accounts. Right now, financial institutions are attempting to identify human trafficking activity, but many suspicious activity reports are based on false flags. Financial institutions are largely left alone to determine what information is valid. Without good, specific, verifiable, targeted information, financial institutions may wrongly identify people, overrespond, and overtarget, or fail to recognize criminal activity. Finding the traffickers who take advantage of our financial system can be a daunting task. We need to figure out how to do it better. This legislation is an opportunity to help financial institutions wade through the muck and locate bad actors. This summer, the Financial Action Task Force released a report that identified significant challenges in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting laundering related to human trafficking, including, ‘‘incomplete domestic information sharing among stakeholders.’’ That is why I was proud to introduce the Empowering Financial Institutions to Fight Human Trafficking Act with my colleague and fellow advocate, Congresswoman MALONEY , along with Congresswoman LOVE, Congresswoman TENNEY , and Congresswoman S INEMA . Over the past year, I have worked in the Financial Services Committee to explore how human traffickers exploit U.S. financial markets. In January, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which I chaired, held a hearing to examine how financial institutions monitor accounts and identify trafficking. We know that if traffickers can’t finance their operations, they can’t profit from their crimes. This bill creates a pathway for registered nonprofits to safely provide valuable information on trafficking crimes to financial institutions, without the threat of defamation suits that could end their organizations. Throughout the process of crafting this bill, I have found that banks are increasingly seeking actionable information from the nonprofits that specialize in gathering it. It is incredibly challenging for financial institutions to pinpoint trafficking crimes that are happening far away in mines, in fields, in factories, hotels, or boats, obscured from analysts who are trying to practice good customer due diligence. Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. This legislation instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a process that will make civil society experts more available to financial institutions and establish transparent standards for information sharing. The bill guides the Secretary to register only NGOs that have the rigor and expertise to substantiate their claims and correct any inaccurate information. I am excited that we are finding ways to connect those who have good intelligence with those who are seeking it without exposing nonprofits to devastating lawsuits they can ill afford. 
This system will target verified traffickers and reduce reliance on nonspecific information that can target innocent people. I look forward to casting my vote to prevent human traffickers from using the U.S. financial system to exploit victims around the world. Together, this Congress can disrupt the networks that make modernday slavery profitable and free vulnerable people around the world who have been enslaved. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6729 is a wellintentioned bill aimed at countering human trafficking. My first concern with the bill, however, is the lack of a deliberative process surrounding the measure, which could lead to a number of serious unintended consequences as currently drafted. The bill will give a sweeping safe harbor to nonprofits that share information with financial institutions regarding the involuntary trafficking of children, women, and men that will nullify all State and local defamation, libel, and privacy laws. This means eligible nonprofits could share personally identifiable information about any person the nonprofit merely suspects of human trafficking with any financial institution, even if their information is false or misleading. Such sharing of information could, in turn, lead financial institutions to close an individual’s account and deny them access to the financial system, even if the individual has not been arrested or indicted for a crime. Importantly, this bill also explicitly states that the Treasury Department may not impose a requirement that the nonprofits share the information in good faith. Therefore, this bill doesn’t protect against malicious or negligent reporting. In fact, the Due Process Institute has stated: ‘‘ . . . Surely not every suspicion or accusation that would come through a nonprofit will be accurate or truthful. Some suspicions or accusations might even be motivated by personal, political, ethnic, racial, cultural, or religious animus.’’ Finally, Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD two letters of opposition to the bill from two coalitions of civil liberty and privacy advocates, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Due Process Institute, Freedom Works, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Project On Government Oversight, Defending Rights and Dissent, and New America’s Open Technology Institute, among others. 
SEPTEMBER 25, 2018. DEAR REPRESENTATIVES : We urge you to vote against H.R. 6729 when the measure is considered later this week. The legislation would allow the Treasury Department to expand the surveillance and sharing of Americans’ financial records beyond what is provided for by the USA PATRIOT Act. The government has previously sought and Congress has rightly voted to reject such an expansion. Similar legislation in the 114th Congress, H.R. 5606, drew opposition from 177 members and failed on a suspension vote. The legislation has broad applicability and significantly harmful effects that go far beyond its stated purpose of allowing financial institutions to combat human trafficking. H.R. 6729 contains an overly broad provision that prohibits Treasury from requiring nonprofit organizations to show that they are sharing information in good faith and preempts liability for organizations under privacy laws. While the measure is described as allowing nonprofits to report suspicions of human trafficking or money laundering to financial institutions, it risks our privacy and raises concerns about the misuse of information. In addition, H.R. 6729 allows a wide range of institutions to communicate with each other about ‘‘suspicious’’ activities regardless of the basis for the suspicion and despite other applicable laws and consumer agreements. The concerns need not be rooted in reality. Moreover, the safe harbor provision does not merely encompass traditional financial institutions like banks and financial services providers, but extends more broadly. This legislation also fails to establish any legal recourse for negligent or malicious acts. H.R. 6729 would create the risk of financial institutions closing accounts of people they deem too risky to do business with on the basis of meritless or otherwise unsupported claims from nonprofit organizations. Every financial institution already has a legal obligation to file a ‘‘Suspicious Activity Report’’ with the government whenever it ‘‘knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that an individual, entity, or organization is involved in or may be involved in terrorist activity or money laundering.’’ It is an unfortunate fact that suspicions and accusations can be based on or motivated by personal, political, ethnic, racial, cultural, or religious animus. It is unacceptable to expand the scope of entities that can submit this information in a process that is broadly immunized from legal recourse. This legislation goes far beyond the goal of combating human trafficking and significantly expands governmental surveillance, the impact of which falls most heavily and relentlessly on those who are the least able to defend themselves. Now is not the time to rush this legislation, introduced a mere two weeks ago, through a legislative procedure intended for uncontroversial bills. Sincerely yours, American Civil Liberties Union, American Arab AntiDiscrimination Committee, Color Of Change, Defending Rights & Dissent, Demand Progress Action, Free Press Action, Freedom of the Press Foundation, Government Information Watch, New America’s Open Technology Institute, Project On Government Oversight, XLab. DUEPROCESS INSTITUTE , September 25, 2018. Re Bipartisan Concerns Regarding H.R. 6729 on Suspension Calendar Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, U.S. House of Representatives. Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY , Majority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives. Hon. STENY HOYER , Minority Whip, U.S. House of Representatives. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN, L EADER PELOSI , LEADER MCCARTHY , AND WHIPHOYER : The Due Process Institute, FreedomWorks, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), and Defending Rights and Dissent write to raise concerns with several aspects of H.R. 6729 (‘‘Empowering Financial Institutions to Fight Human Trafficking Act of 2018’’). There is an effort to put this bill, which was introduced just two weeks ago, on the suspension calendar this week even though it contains controversial expansions of regulatory power that could have serious unintended consequences for innocent people. We urge leadership to ensure this bill not be placed on the suspension calendar and instead allow deliberate consideration of the serious changes it seeks to make. We urge Members to vote NO on this bill. On its face, H.R. 6729 would protect nonprofits wishing to report suspicions of human trafficking or money laundering activities to law enforcement. Importantly, there are no known legal impediments to nonprofits who wish to engage in such reporting. Anyone can report credible suspicions of criminal activity to law enforcement. However, it is possible that a reporter could potentially face civil liability if the report was false and led to reputational damage, or if the report violated a privacy law. This bill offers a very broad ‘‘safe harbor’’ from such liability. In conflict with the principle of federalism, it would nullify any and all federal, state, or local laws that might otherwise allow someone to seek damages in the instance of damaging or malicious reporting or for otherwise invading their privacy. This powerful and allencompassing ‘‘safe harbor’’ does not require good faith on behalf of the reporting organization yet it would invalidate all defamation, libel, or privacy laws in existence. The undersigned organizations recognize the importance of preventing and appropriately investigating human trafficking related crimes but have grave concerns about aspects of this bill that go far beyond the purpose of preventing human trafficking. Importantly, H.R. 6729 does much more than provide a safe harbor from civil liability for nonprofits wishing to share information with law enforcement and it is those aspects of the bill that might not be readily apparent but cause concern. The bill also sets up a structure to encourage nonprofits to share their suspicions with ‘‘financial institutions,’’ and also creates a related structure by which financial institutions will be encouraged to then share these suspicions with each other. Importantly, the term ‘‘financial institution’’ is not confined to entities like traditional banks and financial services providers, but also applies to insurance companies, real estate firms, casinos, jewelers, and even car dealers. (Again, there is nothing that prevents such reporting but the ‘‘safe harbor’’ protection discussed above would also apply to any financial institution, thus preventing customers of a wide array of businesses who would otherwise have legal recourse under privacy laws or tort law to seek relief for the negligent or even malicious acts of others.) Importantly, the ‘‘information sharing’’ at stake in this bill is not based on provable criminal acts, or even criminal accusations brought by law enforcement. The types of information subject to this extraordinary ‘‘safe harbor’’ protection are mere suspicions that could be based on purposefully malicious information or stem from improper motivations. Unfortunately, the harm that is likely to result to innocent Americans is very real and not just because of the safe harbor provision. Current banking regulations already require financial institutions to file ‘‘Suspicious Activity Reports’’ (SARs) with the government any time it ‘‘knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that an individual, entity, or organization is involved in, or may be involved in terrorist activity or money laundering,’’ because of shared information 
it has received. Because a financial institution can face criminal prosecution for failing to investigate or file SARs after receiving such information, these institutions invariably err on the side of overfiling. This bill would add a broad swath of new suspected activity to the SARs regime, causing the overall amount of SARs to increase—despite the fact that over one million SARs are already filed each year—the vast majority of which never lead to a formal investigation of any kind. But even more importantly, one of the stated purposes for informationsharing between financial institutions is to allow these businesses to determine ‘‘whether to establish or maintain an account, or to engage in a transaction.’’ Thus, the filing of a SAR frequently leads to a person being ‘‘debanked’’ or deemed ‘‘too risky to do business with.’’ This bill would dramatically increase the number of SARs filed on the basis of unproven suspicions passed to financial institutions, not from law enforcement agencies but from nonprofits. Stories already abound regarding instances of innocent consumers having their accounts closed or transactions prohibited as a result of unproven suspicions. See Emily Flitter & Stacy Cowley, ‘‘Wells Fargo Accused of Harming Fraud Victims by Closing Accounts,’’ New York Times, Feb. 28, 2018; Rick Jones, ‘‘Closing the Door on Closing Accounts: Ending the Damaging Impact of De Banking,’’ The Champion, March 2018; and Alex Morrell, ‘‘Banks are keeping closer tabs on your reputation than ever before—and it may explain why one . . . cardholder mysteriously had his account shut down . . . .’’, Business Insider, Sept. 14, 2018. While the threat of human trafficking is real and law enforcement should continue to engage in best efforts to prevent such crimes, surely not every suspicion or accusation that would come through a nonprofit will be accurate or truthful. Some suspicions or accusations might even be motivated by personal, political, ethnic, racial, cultural, or religious animus. But by encouraging nonprofits to share their ‘‘suspicions’’ with financial institutions, and to encourage financial institutions to in turn share these suspicions with each other, lawabiding customers could be improperly debanked, preventing them from engaging in critical financial activities like home buying, investing, or even having a bank account on the basis of unproven hearsay. Another concerning aspect of H.R. 6729 is that it contains multiple authorizations for the Treasury Department to promulgate an unlimited number of additional regulations regarding the ‘‘sharing of information between financial institutions on suspected unlawful activities.’’ These incredibly broad strokes of authority—not limited to the context of the subject matter of the bill [human trafficking] but applying to any ‘‘suspected unlawful activity’’—are deeply concerning given that the regulatory state is already out of control and given previous recent attempts by the Treasury Department to increase the use of warrantless surveillance through ‘‘informationsharing’’ programs and other extraordinary powers it was previously granted only for the purposes of preventing terrorist activities. The blanket authorization in this bill would allow unelected regulators to enact changes in the law to expand surveillance and the access and sharing of Americans’ financial records under Section 314 of the USA PATRIOT Act that they have been unable to get authorized in bills such as H.R. 5606 (‘‘AntiTerrorism Information Sharing is Strength Act’’), H.R. 3439 (the ‘‘Financial Institution Security Act’’) and the November 2017 draft ‘‘Counter Terrorism and Illicit Finance Act’’—efforts that were widely opposed by a diverse group of concerned organizations. For all the reasons listed herein, we urge leadership to ensure this bill not be placed on the suspension calendar and instead be subjected to a full and fair lawmaking process that will allow for deliberate consideration of the serious changes it seeks to make and we urge Members to vote NO on this bill. Respectfully, DUEPROCESS INSTITUTE . FREEDOM WORKS . NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  CRIMINAL DEFENSE  LAWYERS (NACDL). DEFENDING RIGHTS AND  DISSENT . 
Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I remain committed to fighting against human trafficking, but this bill may result in serious unintended consequences for innocent people, including losing access to their money and to the financial system based on the mere accusation from a nonprofit. For this reason, I oppose this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. M ALONEY ). Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague from New York, who is the ranking member on Small Business, as an outstanding leader on Puerto Rico, on business, on women, and in so many areas. I rise today and join my colleague on the other side of the aisle, ANNWAGNER , in strong support of H.R. 6729, the Empowering Financial Institutions to Fight Human Trafficking Act. This bill cracks down on human traffickers and human trafficking in general, which is one of the worst crimes imaginable. This bill will save lives by cracking down on human trafficking. Human trafficking is the fastest growing criminal enterprise in the world. It already generates over $150 billion in profits every year. There are only two crimes that generate more revenue, and those are selling drugs and selling guns. But in human trafficking, you can sell the body over and over again, usually until they die. The $150 billion is an astonishing amount of money, and that is why it is so important to make sure that financial institutions have access to high quality, uptodate information on human traffickers and the companies and individuals involved in this terrible trade. This bill would ensure that financial institutions get the information they need about trafficking so that they can take appropriate action to protect both themselves and the sufferers of human trafficking. The bill would give qualified nonprofits a legal safe harbor when they share information about human trafficking with financial institutions. b1645 And it is notforprofits that have been the most successful in combating and stopping this horrible crime. The nonprofits would have to be registered with Treasury in order to qualify for the safe harbor and would have to abide by any safeguards Treasury establishes to ensure that the information they are providing is credible and accurate. So the bill would not open the door to blatantly false or malicious accusations being made. To the contrary, it would help nonprofits who are actively engaged in stopping human trafficking around the world. Without this safe harbor, these nonprofits would be afraid to share the information they have about traffickers with banks out of fear of being sued. This bill is supported by law enforcement. This bill will allow a cracking down on this terrible, terrible crime that costs the lives of thousands of our young people. It is important. This bill will save lives. That is why I support it, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. SINEMA ). Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, every day, I hear from Arizonans who are sick and tired of the dysfunction in Washington. They know that the partisan fights and namecalling keeps Congress from delivering the results that Arizona families expect from their leaders. Arizonans deserve leaders who come together and find solutions on issues that matter, like keeping our families safe, protecting our Nation, and honoring our commitment to veterans. We can still get things done for Arizona families if we would stop the political games and work across the aisle. We have an opportunity to prove that today by passing three bipartisan bills that will make a difference for Arizonans. I am lucky to have worked closely with my Republican colleagues on these three commonsense solutions that improve our ability to fight human trafficking, protect our country from weapons of mass destruction, and support Arizona veterans. We have a moral obligation to fight human trafficking, stand up for victims, and bring traffickers to justice. That is why I cosponsored the Empowering Financial Institutions to Fight Human Trafficking Act with Congresswoman WAGNER , Congresswoman MALONEY , Congresswoman L OVE, and Congresswoman TENNEY . This legislation helps nonprofits share valuable intelligence and collaborate with institutions in real time. Nonprofits are frequently on the front lines of this fight, combating trafficking and supporting victims. They see what is happening on the ground, 
and our bill ensures we can freeze money and stop those traffickers in their tracks. This is good policy that will protect families, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Keeping Arizonans safe is my top priority. We are also set to pass a bipartisan bill I introduced with Congressman TIPTON to protect America from terrorists and rogue states like North Korea and Iran. This week, the President has addressed the United Nations to call for action to stop weapons proliferation and other threats in Iran. In Congress, we are taking bipartisan action to combat these same threats. Our bill, the Improving Strategies to Counter Weapons Proliferation Act, makes it harder for America’s enemies to get their hands on the world’s most deadly weapons by helping choke off the financing of terrorist activity. This bill makes our country safer and our communities safer, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Finally, we must always ensure that our support for veterans is worthy of their sacrifice, and that is why I worked across the aisle with Congressman ZELDIN and Congresswoman TENNEY to introduce and pass the Protect Affordable Mortgages for Veterans Act. This bill fixes the law and protects veterans from higher costs to refinance their homes. Our actions help more Arizona veterans achieve the American Dream of homeownership, and, again, I would urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan fix that helps America’s heroes. These three bills show that we can get things done and deliver for everyday Arizonans if we just work together and find common ground, and I will continue to work across the aisle to keep Arizona families safe and ensure we honor our commitment to our veterans and military families. In particular, I want to thank Congresswoman WAGNER , Congressman TIPTON , and Congresswoman T ENNEY  for working together on these important bills, and I urge my colleagues to support these bipartisan bills. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ), and I ask unanimous consent that she be allowed to control that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, I would like to reiterate, despite what some have said about this piece of legislation, that this legislation requires NGOs to register with Treasury in order to create a process that protects only rigorous, credible organizations that can offer verifiable information to financial institutions. This process will safeguard innocent people and entities that may currently be targeted by the broad, general patterns that are reported to financial institutions. At present, there is no way for financial institutions to wade through all the tips and information they receive and use it to prevent traffickers from using our financial systems. We need a meaningful system that can actually identify traffickers and allow banks to verify those IDs. That is what this bill does. I would also like to make clear that this piece of legislation does not amend or touch the PATRIOT Act and does not create any new structures for banks to share information with each other. This legislation is supported by organizations, including, Mr. Speaker, Western Union, MoneyGram, and Liberty Asia. It also happens to be one of the key recommendations from Polaris’ groundbreaking new report: ‘‘A Road Map for Systems and Industries to Prevent and Disrupt Human Trafficking.’’ Mr. Speaker, I include the report in the RECORD . 
2. Pass legislation to provide safe harbor to facilitate information sharing between civil society and financial institutions NGOs that work with survivors and vulnerable populations often have access to critical information about bad actors. Regulations focused on the sharing of information between financial institutions or between financial institutions and government agencies, such as Section 314(a) and (b) of the USA Patriot Act or the regulations for filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), provide appropriate protections for such sharing. No such protections are currently available to NGOs for sharing critical information that may assist in the detection, deterrence or prevention of trafficking. While NGO’s are currently able to report tips directly to law enforcement, the information may be too limited to realistically spur law enforcement action—often because the information is obtained from confidential sources who cannot be contacted by law enforcement. However, if these leads were provided to financial institutions, the financial institutions may be able to assist in providing additional, relevant, and actionable information to law enforcement. Addressing the liability concerns of NGO’s which wish to participate in information exchanges is an important first step in actualizing this process. Legislation is required to provide these protections to NGOs. Once this barrier is removed, law enforcement, NGO’s, and financial institutions can work together to develop agreed upon processes and protocols that govern appropriate information sharing. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, Dow Jones has said that the information provided to it from NGOs like Liberty Asia and others is relevant and actionable in its antimoney laundering work. This bill enables FinCEN and financial institutions to gather hard intelligence that can be verified or disproven, rather than rely on, as I said, general, useless, or even faulty tips from nonprofits, private citizens, and other sources without technical experience that could lead to false identifications and persecution of innocent actors. It is the lack of verifiable specificity and the lack of regulated accreditation that allows for the targeting of innocent groups. This bill creates a process, run by Treasury, where responsible nonprofits that professionally analyze information and create intelligence products that help financial institutions better identify these crimes can share information without worrying about whether sharing this information is going to end their organizations. I could go on and on, but Members of this body should never forget what we are doing today is protecting the 40 million victims of trafficking around the world. Human trafficking is a horrific crime that represents $150 billion per year, and it is far too often funded by the U.S. financial system. This is preventable, and today, we are taking steps towards ending America’s financing of exploitation of our most vulnerable. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6729. The question was taken.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ) and the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD). Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for yielding. I also want to thank Chairman HENSARLING for his dedicated leadership of his committee. I appreciate all he did to bring my legislation, H.R. 5036, to the floor. I also want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. LYNCH ), my colead on the bill, for his efforts, his experience, and his knowledge. It only made the bill better, so I appreciated working with him. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bipartisan legislation, the Financial Technology Protection Act. We all know that illicit financing networks are the lynchpin of any terrorist group’s, criminal organization’s, or rogue state’s operations. As we move into an increasingly digital world, criminals and terrorists will start to use these new technologies that are available to them. That presents a problem. That problem is that we know that criminals use digital currencies through dark net markets to criminalize and to monetize cyber attacks. There is documented evidence that terrorists are increasingly using these currencies. b1800 The RAND Corporation has some good supporting evidence on this. The bottom line is that the Federal Government has to be one step ahead of the illicit actors in this new space without threatening technological innovation, and that is what H.R. 5036 will do. Specifically, my legislation will do the following things to help make sure the United States stays ahead of this problem: First, it establishes the Independent Financial Technology Task Force to Combat Terrorism and Illicit Financing, whose goal is to improve coordination between private and public sectors on digital currency terror strategy and to combat illicit use. From my perspective, industry and the Federal Government should be coming together to find best practices and solutions to stop this new terrorist funding threat. Secondly, H.R. 5036 includes language from H.R. 5227, the Preventing Rogue and Foreign Actors From Evading Sanctions Act, which was introduced by my friend MARKMEADOWS of North Carolina. This language directs the Treasury Department to develop a strategy that identifies and describes the potential uses of virtual currencies and other emerging technologies by states, nonstate actors, and terrorist organizations to evade sanctions, finance terrorism, or launder monetary instruments and threaten the United States’ national security. Again, the development of a national strategy to combat illicit use strikes me as common sense; therefore, we are 
excited to have it included in the bill and to have Mr. MEADOWS ’ support as well. Also, the BuddLynch legislation establishes a targeted rewards program for information leading to the capture of terrorists or illicit actors involved with terror digital currency networks. The government should be encouraging individuals with knowledge of illicit use of virtual currencies to come forward through the offerings of rewards for successful convictions. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, H.R. 5036 establishes the Fintech Leadership in Innovation and Financial Intelligence Program, which will be used for grants and rewards in the Fintech space for ideas and programs to combat terrorist use of digital currencies. These technologies would be open access and open source. Experts in the private sector can track illicit use of these currencies and perhaps do a better job of leveraging their talent to create tools and programs through the Fintech Leadership and Financial Intelligence Program. We need to give them the ability to try, and that is what this bill does. Here is the bottom line, Mr. Speaker. H.R. 5036 is legislation that sparks privatesector innovation to deal with terror and illicit financing when it comes to virtual currencies. I think that Congress should be promoting programs and technologies that give industry the tools they need to save their technology and industry from illicit use and, hopefully, save them from further regulation down the road. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5036, the Financial Technology Protection Act, would strengthen our efforts to deter terrorist and illicit uses of financial technology. Although financial technology has potential benefits to the economy, there are pressing concerns about the digital currencies facilitating terrorist financing and money laundering. For example, in August 2015, a Virginia man was sentenced to prison for providing material to support terrorists and admitted to using Twitter to advise others on how to use bitcoin to mask terror financing. Also, in July 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers for hacking into the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential election. The hackers used cryptocurrency to purchase the servers and other equipment necessary for the email breaches and used bitcoin to help fund their activities. This bill would establish a publicprivate sector task force, a grant program, and a reward program to counter such terrorist or illicit uses of digital currencies. Also, it would require the government to identify how state and nonstate actors and foreign terrorist organizations evade sanctions, finance terrorism, or launder money using these currencies. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman BUDD and Congressman L YNCH for introducing this bipartisan legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. LYNCH ). Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5036, the Financial Technology Protection Act. Before I begin, I would like to thank the Financial Services Committee Chair HENSARLING and Ranking Member W ATERS  for their support in helping to guide this bill through the committee process. I am very pleased that this legislation was passed through the committee unanimously when it was marked up back in July. I would also like to thank my colleague from North Carolina, Mr. BUDD, for his good work on this important legislation. This has truly been a bipartisan effort. Mr. Speaker, by a strange coincidence, I was actually elected in the Democratic primary in Massachusetts on September 11, 2001, the day of the attacks on the United States in New York, the Pentagon, and in western Pennsylvania. Since my arrival here in Washington and throughout my time in Congress, I have taken an active interest in cutting off the flow of funding to terrorists and other illicit actors. I am very pleased to say that many of my colleagues, Democratic and Republican, have likewise approached this work with the deliberate and relentless sense of purpose that has lifted us above the petty squabbling that sometimes causes us to fall short of the high expectations of the American people. Over the years, this work has taken me dozens of times to many countries in the Middle East, to Amman, Jordan, a major banking center, where members of our committee urged and assisted that nation to establish its first financial intelligence unit. It must, of course, be noted that we had the robust and earnest cooperation of King Abdullah of Jordan in that effort. He is someone who, I believe, has, over the years, been the greatest friend that freedomloving people have in the Arab world. Members of this committee also worked to expand geographic targeting orders to help the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network crack down on money laundering as part of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. Similarly, in Afghanistan, Morocco, Tunisia, and throughout the Persian Gulf, our committee has coaxed and guided our international neighbors to adopt methods that secure the legitimate banking system from terrorists and criminal exploitation. From this work it has recently become clear to Mr. BUDD and myself that terrorists and criminal actors are increasingly relying on digital currencies, including bitcoin, to fund their illicit activities. For example, in August of 2015, a Virginia man was sentenced to 11 years in prison for providing material support to ISIS. He admitted to using Twitter to provide instructions on how to use bitcoin to mask the transfer of funds to that terrorist group. Also, in December of 2017, a woman in New York was indicted for bank fraud and money laundering for supporting terrorists. She is alleged to have spent about $62,000 in digital currency to engage in a pattern of financial activity designed to ultimately benefit ISIS. I am very pleased that the legislation before us today helps address this emerging threat in multiple ways. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Massachusetts such time as he may consume. Mr. LYNCH. As my friend, Mr. BUDD, has noted, this bill establishes a public private sector task force to research terrorist and criminal uses of new financial technologies, including digital currencies, and then develops countermeasures to thwart such terrorist and illicit uses. The bill also establishes a fund to pay rewards to people who provide information leading to the conviction of an individual involved with terrorist use of digital currencies. Finally, the bill creates a grant program for the development of tools and pilot programs to detect terrorist and illicit use of digital currencies. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank the chairman and ranking member, as well as my Republican cosponsor, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important legislation. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time on this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I support the bill; I urge my colleagues to support it as well; and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for bringing forward this legislation to better protect our consumers and our neighbors from illicit financial activity and I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5036, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
IMPROVING STRATEGIES TO COUNTER WEAPONS PROLIFERATION ACT Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6332) to require the Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to submit a report to Congress on the way in which data collected pursuant to title 31 is being used, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6332 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Improving Strategies to Counter Weapons Proliferation Act’’. 
Section 310 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(e) REPORTS RELATING TO USE OF COLLECTED DATA.— ‘‘(1) IN GENERAL .—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this subsection and every year thereafter, the Director shall submit to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a report on— ‘‘(A) intelligence products created by FinCEN on finance transactions for the proliferation of weapons from filings submitted pursuant to subchapter II of chapter 53; ‘‘(B) FinCEN’s efforts to collaborate with law enforcement agencies, the intelligence community, and foreign financial intelligence units to maximize the use of data that is collected pursuant to subchapter II of chapter 53; and ‘‘(C) advisory notices issued to financial institutions (as defined under section 5312(a)) on financial activity related to the proliferation of weapons. ‘‘(2) SEPARATE PRESENTATION OF CLASSIFIED  
MATERIAL .—Any part of the report under paragraph (1) that involves information that is properly classified under criteria established by the President shall be submitted to the Congress separately in a classified annex. ‘‘(3) SUNSET .—No report is required under this subsection after the end of the 5year period beginning on the date of enactment of this subsection.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ) and the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the consideration of this important measure on the floor here today. The work of the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee on Financial Services has uncovered time and again that the activities of terrorists and criminal organizations are powered through financing and that illicit operations cannot continue if the revenue streams that fund those operations are shut off. The measure before the House today would provide greater clarity into how exactly the global financial system can cut off financial schemes that enable access to illicit nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. H.R. 6332, the Improving Strategies to Counter Weapons Proliferation Act, would study how our financial institutions, intelligence collecting agencies, and law enforcement share information regarding known weapons financing activities to better identify weapons financing schemes. To effectively prevent the spread of dangerous weapons into the hands of bad actors like terrorists, we must close the gaps that allow those bad actors to take advantage of the global financial system. The everincreasing number of threats posed by foreign adversaries and dangerous organizations make it all the more important to close those gaps now. By helping financial institutions and law enforcement better identify the signs of illicit proliferation financing through this bill, these institutions will be able to maximize the effectiveness of their information and more easily coordinate strategies that disrupt and ultimately prevent dangerous crime. In the United States, we have robust protections in place to be able to prevent financing of weapons proliferation involving suspicious activity reports that go to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and get reported over to law enforcement. By requiring FinCEN to report yearly to Congress on intelligence products it generates from suspicious activity filings on weapons finance transactions as well as how those intelligence products have informed law enforcement action, we can learn the indicators for proliferation finance and move to more effectively combat those illicit financial activities. The bill before the House of Representatives today is a good first step in making sure the financial institutions, law enforcement agencies, and Congress have the tools that they need to be able to combat financing for illicit weapons proliferation, and I urge its passage here today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6332, the Improving Strategies to Counter Weapons Proliferation Act, which aims to better inform congressional oversight of FinCEN’s counter proliferation finance efforts. With proliferation threats growing from countries like North Korea and Iran, the reports prescribed by this bill will tell Congress more about the terrorist financing and antimoney laundering work that FinCEN is doing to combat the financing of the manufacture and delivery of weapons of mass destruction. This bill will require the director to report on the intelligence FinCEN generates from the Bank Secrecy Act filings on suspected proliferation finance transactions; the agency’s efforts to maximize the use of collected data; and the advisory notices issued to financial institutions related to the financing of chemical, nuclear, and biological weapons. Prior to the Financial Services Committee vote, the ACLU expressed some concern, in part because the bill’s report doesn’t include details on the efficacy of FinCEN’s data collection or its impact on privacy and civil liberties. b1815 That said, I understand that the ACLU does not actively oppose the bill. Given the legislation is focused on how FinCEN uses the data it currently collects, it does not expand the data collection. I think that that bill is appropriately scoped, and I support it. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask for a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6332. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
FEDERAL RESERVE SUPERVISION TESTIMONY CLARIFICATION ACT Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4753) to amend the Federal Reserve Act to require the Vice Chairman for Supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to provide a written report, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4753 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federal Reserve Supervision Testimony Clarification Act’’. 
Paragraph (12) of section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 247b) is amended— (1) by redesignating such paragraph as paragraph (11); and (2) in such paragraph— (A) by striking ‘‘shall appear’’ and inserting ‘‘shall provide written testimony and appear’’; and 
(B) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘If, at the time of any appearance described in this paragraph, the position of Vice Chairman for Supervision is vacant, the Chairman or their designee shall appear instead and provide the required written testimony.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ) and the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS ). Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell my colleagues about H.R. 4753 and urge they pass it. As this body knows, Congress gave the Federal Reserve much greater regulatory authority under DoddFrank. The bill established the Vice Chair for Supervision position to oversee those efforts. But the first confirmed appointee to that position took office only last year, a full 7 years since DoddFrank. During that time, Congress received minimal testimony on regulatory issues from the Fed. Typically, other officials who didn’t oversee regulatory efforts gave testimony in this regard. But the key point is, DoddFrank requires only the Vice Chair for Supervision to give that testimony. While we are grateful that other Fed officials decided to speak to Congress on regulatory issues, they didn’t have to under the law. My bill would prevent that situation from arising ever again. Under my bill, if there is no Vice Chair for Supervision, either the Fed Chair or their designee will be required to give annual testimony on regulatory matters. It is that simple, and as a result, this bill passed unanimously out of the Financial Services Committee. Despite the simplicity, this bill is about the oversight authority of Congress and the constituents we represent. It remains vitally important that we and our Senate friends hear from these agencies. Not only that, we should hear from the officials who are very knowledgeable on the issues in their areas, particularly when these regulations have a large effect on capital and money markets. Otherwise, our constituents will become even more distrustful of government. Transparency is key. In fact, it is one of our greatest responsibilities as Members of Congress. My bill promotes that responsibility, and, thus, deserves to be passed. I thank the chairman, the ranking member, and a unanimous Financial Services Committee for supporting this bill. I hope my colleagues will follow their example and vote for the bill. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4753, the Federal Reserve Supervision Testimony Clarification Act. I thank Mr. LUCAS for this piece of legislation, which provides for the Chair of the Board or their designee to offer testimony in place of the Vice Chairman for Supervision, should the Vice Chair position be vacant. It makes good sense to codify who at the Board will testify before Congress on the status of the Fed’s supervisory efforts, regardless of whether there is a person confirmed for the Vice Chair for Supervision or not. Until Randal Quarles was confirmed, the position was vacant since its creation in 2010, so this bill is a commonsense measure. With that, I urge all my colleagues to support passage of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4753, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
PROTECT AFFORDABLE MORTGAGES FOR VETERANS ACT OF 2018 Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6737) to amend the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act to clarify seasoning requirements for certain refinanced mortgage loans, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6737 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protect Affordable Mortgages for Veterans Act of 2018’’. 
SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS FOR GINNIE MAE GUARANTEE OF SECURITIES. 
Paragraph (1) of section 306(g) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1721(g)(1)) is amended by striking the second sentence (as added by section 309(b) of Public Law 115–174) and inserting the following: ‘‘The Association is authorized to take actions to protect the integrity of its securities from practices that it deems in good faith to represent abusive refinancing activities and nothing in the Protect Affordable Mortgages for Veterans Act of 2018, the amendment made by such Act, or this title may be construed to limit such authority.’’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ) and the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ). Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge passage of my bill, H.R. 6737, the Protect Affordable Mortgages for Veterans Act, which is bipartisan legislation that passed the committee with a unanimous vote of 49–0. This legislation would provide a technical fix so that recently issued loans refinanced by the Department of Veterans Affairs can remain eligible for the secondary market. This fix is essential to prevent a liquidity crisis in the veterans home loan market and ensure that the brave men and women who have served our Nation in uniform have access to affordable mortgages. Through passage of this bill, we can ensure that VA home loans are not adversely impacted by issues in the veterans mortgage market created by the unintended consequences of S. 2155. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, S. 2155, contained some very important bipartisan reforms to protect veterans from predatory lending and deceptive marketing. These provisions of S. 2155 are now the law of the land and essential to protect the VA home market. But unclear timelines laid out in the legislation and the way the Government National Mortgage Association, also known as Ginnie Mae, chose to implement the requirements of the new law have left an estimated 2,500 or more VA home loans boxed out of the secondary market. These mortgages are now considered orphan loans, because they are no longer eligible for Ginnie Mae securitization, even though they met all Federal requirements and are backed by the VA. My bill would prevent a government triggered liquidity crisis in the VA mortgage market by fixing this problem and restoring eligibility for these orphan loans. Addressing this ensures that veteran homeowners or prospective home buyers who have earned access to the VA home loan program through their military service aren’t harmed by a fluke in S. 2155. Without this bill, potential damage to the overall VA home loan market is 
likely because VA lenders may have to sell or finance these orphan mortgages at a loss. This would have a negative impact on the brave men and women who have served our country and deserve a path to homeownership and the American Dream. If lenders aren’t able to securitize VA home loans through Ginnie Mae, closing costs and borrowing costs could go up and opportunities to borrow or refinance could go down. Mr. Speaker, veterans have some of the lowest default and foreclosure rates in the Nation, and they have earned access to VA home loans through their selfless service to our country. As I mentioned earlier, it is estimated that 2,500 or more VA home loans that were issued earlier in May or June of this year may now be boxed out of the market due to a minuscule legislative error. Even one VA home loan negatively impacted by a minor mistake is one too many when it comes to giving our veterans access to homeownership. That is why we must pass this bipartisan bill. I thank my lead bipartisan cosponsors, CLAUDIA TENNEY of New York and KYRSTEN SINEMA of Arizona. I also thank Chairman HENSARLING , Ranking Member WATERS , and Housing and Insurance Subcommittee Chairman SEAN DUFFY for supporting this important bipartisan reform. I also thank the great staff of the House Financial Services Committee for all their help throughout this process. They certainly have shown a tremendous amount of care and compassion for our Nation’s veterans with this bill and so many others. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter from Senator TILLIS and Senator WARREN expressing the need to address the issue of these orphan VA loans. I urge adoption of this important bipartisan bill. 
U.S. S ENATE , Washington, DC, June 11, 2018. J. PAULCOMPTON , Jr., General Counsel, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, DC. DEARMR. COMPTON : As you know, S. 2304— the Protecting Veterans from Predatory Lending Act of 2018 (Act)—was introduced and subsequently included in S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which President Trump signed into law on May 24, 2018. The Act was introduced to protect veterans from targeted predatory home loan practices by requiring lenders to demonstrate a material benefit to consumers when refinancing their mortgage. As such, the legislation included: (1) a fee recoupment requirement; (2) a net tangible benefit test; and (3) a loan seasoning requirement. The aforementioned actions and subsequent signature of the president were taken after witnessing some bad actors in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Home Loan space engage in the practice of ‘‘churning’’—the refinancing of a home loan over and over again to generate fees and profits for lenders at the expense of the consumer and taxpayers. Upon enactment of the legislation, questions arose surrounding whether Ginnie Mae (Ginnie) is statutorily authorized to continue to accept previously guaranteed Ginnie MortgageBacked Securities (MBS) as eligible multiclass securities collateral under its multiclass securities programs, given the requirements of the legislation—i.e. the MBS are backed by a refinanced loan that is guaranteed by the VA benefit program and do not meet the conditions required by the Act. Specifically, the Act requires that to be included as eligible collateral for a Ginnie guaranteed MBS, a VA refinance loan must be refinanced after the later of: (1) the date that is 210 days after the date on which the first monthly payment is made on the mortgage being refinanced, and (2) the date on which six full monthly payments have been made on the mortgage being refinanced. To implement the Act, Ginnie revised its MBS pooling eligibility requirements and amended its MBS Guide to specify how Ginnie MBS are affected by this Act. Ginnie delineated that securities with an issuance date of May 1, 2018 or earlier are unaffected even if they do not meet the conditions of the Act, and that Ginnie securities with an issuance dated June 1, 2018 or later will comply with the new pooling requirements and conditions of the Act. Ginnie also determined that given the abovementioned congressional reasons for enacting S. 2155, there was never an intent by Congress to impact Ginnie’s ability to continue to guaranty multiclass securities that are collateralized by Ginnie MBS guaranteed prior to the enactment of the Act that may contain VA guaranteed refinanced loans that do not meet the requirements of the Act. We recognize that there are a small number of loans that do not conform with the Act’s requirements that were either originated or in the process of being originated before the May 31st date of Ginnie’s APM regarding new seasoning requirements. It was not our intention to ‘‘orphan’’ those loans, and we urge Ginnie and the VA to work with lenders and other federal agencies to attempt to ensure that those loans are not adversely affected by the enactment of the Act. We support the steps that Ginnie has taken, and look forward to working with Ginnie and the VA to further protect veterans from loan ‘‘churning.’’ Sincerely, THOMTILLIS , United States Senate. ELIZABETH WARREN , United States Senate. 
Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, when Congress passed S. 2155, it included a section 309, a bill sponsored by Senators TILLIS and W ARREN , entitled the ‘‘Protecting Veterans from Predatory Lending Act of 2018.’’ That provision put new requirements in place to protect veteran borrowers from aggressive and deceptive marketing tactics of lenders pushing mortgage refinance deals. One of the new requirements included was a loan seasoning requirement that mandated a certain period of time before a VA borrower could refinance their loan. This new requirement was very similar to the loan seasoning requirement that Ginnie Mae had already implemented administratively prior to the passage of this law. However, slight differences between the old and new requirements, and the immediate ban on securitization of loans that did not meet the new requirements, resulted in an estimated 2,500 loans that were boxed out of Ginnie Mae securitization simply because they were in the process of being refinanced or securitized when the law became effective. The sponsors of the legislation, Senators WARREN and T ILLIS , have weighed in with Ginnie Mae, stating that it was not their intention to orphan these loans, and they have urged Ginnie Mae to address the issue. However, Ginnie Mae believes legislation is needed. I believe H.R. 6737 is a reasonable attempt to address what was clearly an unintended consequence of previous legislation, and I am pleased to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I ask for a ‘‘yes’’ vote. I support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6737, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
BANKING TRANSPARENCY FOR SANCTIONED PERSONS ACT OF 2018 Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6751) to increase transparency with respect to financial services benefitting state sponsors of terrorism, human rights abusers, and corrupt officials, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6751 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Banking Transparency for Sanctioned Persons Act of 2018’’. 
SEC. 2. REPORT ON FINANCIAL SERVICES BENEFITTING STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM, HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSERS, AND CORRUPT OFFICIALS. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter, the Secretary of the Treasury shall issue a report to the Committees on Financial Services and Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and Foreign Relations of the Senate that includes— (1) a copy of any license issued by the Secretary in the preceding 180 days that authorizes a financial institution to provide financial services benefitting a state sponsor of terrorism; and (2) a list of any foreign financial institutions that, in the preceding 180 days, knowingly conducted a significant transaction or transactions, directly or indirectly, for a sanctioned person included on the Department of the Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals And Blocked Persons List who— 
(A) is owned or controlled by, or acts on behalf of, the government of a state sponsor of terrorism; or (B) is designated pursuant to any of the following: (i) Section 404 of the Russia and Moldova JacksonVanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 (Public Law 112208). (ii) Subtitle F of title XII of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114328, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act). (iii) Executive Order 13818. (b) FORM OF REPORT .—The report required under subsection (a) shall be submitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified annex. 
The Secretary of the Treasury may waive the requirements of section 2 with respect to a foreign financial institution described in paragraph (2) of such section— (1) upon receiving credible assurances that the foreign financial institution has ceased, or will imminently cease, to knowingly conduct any significant transaction or transactions, directly or indirectly, for a person described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of such paragraph (2); or (2) upon certifying to the Committees on Financial Services and Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and Foreign Relations of the Senate that the waiver is important to the national interest of the United States, with an explanation of the reasons therefor. 
For purposes of this Act: (1) FINANCIAL INSTITUTION .—The term ‘‘financial institution’’ means a United States financial institution or a foreign financial institution. (2) FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTION .—The term ‘‘foreign financial institution’’ has the meaning given that term under section 561.308 of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations. (3) KNOWINGLY .—The term ‘‘knowingly’’ with respect to conduct, a circumstance, or a result, means that a person has actual knowledge, or should have known, of the conduct, the circumstance, or the result. (4) UNITED STATES FINANCIAL INSTITUTION .— The term ‘‘United States financial institution’’ has the meaning given the term ‘‘U.S. financial institution’’ under section 561.309 of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations. 
The reporting requirement under this Act shall terminate on the date that is the end of the 7year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ) and the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. LOVE). Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6751, the Banking Transparency for Sanctioned Persons Act, which is a commonsense reporting requirement that will allow our Congress to better oversee financial sanctions against state sponsors of terrorism, human rights abusers, and perpetrators of corruption around the world. This bill is simple but important. Every 180 days, the Treasury Department would be required to send Congress a report with two sets of information. The first is a copy of any license issued by Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control that authorizes a financial institution to provide services benefitting a state sponsor of terrorism— such as Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan—that would otherwise be prohibited. b1830 Second, Treasury would have to provide a list of any foreign banks that conduct significant transactions for persons we have sanctioned for serious human rights abuses and corruption, a group that includes Russian Government officials behind the imprisonment and death of Sergei Magnitsky, Burmese military officers responsible for ethnic cleansing, and individuals in Latin America responsible for beating and killing of peaceful protesters. Such a report would be a tremendous asset for Congress, and sharing this kind of information with Congress should be automatic, because licenses represent exemptions to our sanction programs. Some of those exemptions may be controversial, while others may enjoy broad support. The point is that congressional oversight of sanctions is limited without visibility into transactions Treasury is authorizing. As for foreign banks’ dealings with perpetrators of corruption and human rights abuses, Congress can use this information not only to better oversee existing sanctions, but to design a more effective program in the future. Some of the questions we can begin to answer by having greater awareness of sanctioned persons’ access to foreign financial services include: Are foreign banks exposing themselves to money laundering risk or facilitating activities that run counter to our national interests? And should our diplomats be exerting stronger pressure on those banks’ governments in order to cut off bad actors? Finally, I would like to note that we have been very deliberate in ensuring that the reporting required by this bill is as easy to administer as possible because we don’t want to impose reporting requirements that could keep Treasury from the daytoday work of designating bad actors. Therefore, this is a twiceayear submission that entails no analysis and no narrative. It is as straightforward as scanning licenses and assembling a list to Treasury that that they already have components of, after which we could then follow up with questions in hearings, briefings, and the like. I would like to thank the chairman for his support on this bill and thank all the members of the Financial Services Committee on both sides of the aisle for supporting this. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6751. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this legislation requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress every 6 months a list of the licenses it issues to financial institutions to provide services to countries and persons subject to certain U.S. sanctions. It also provides Congress with information about foreign financial firms that similarly provide support to those same countries and persons. I very much support the goal of this bill because I believe it is a disclosure requirement that will serve as a useful oversight tool for Congress. For example, today, when the Office of Foreign Assets Control, OFAC, issues a specific license to a company or other entity that allows them to engage in activity that otherwise would be prohibited by the U.S. sanctions, those licenses are not currently disclosed by OFAC. I also support the bill’s other reporting requirement related to foreign financial firms. These lists of foreign financial institutions can provide a useful basis around which to discuss with the administration its overall strategy with respect to its sanctions programs; and these lists can also provide Members the opportunity to press the administration to impose restrictions on these institutions to change their behavior, if warranted. The bill allows for the classification of these disclosures to Congress, which is important because I think it will be counterproductive to have this information revealed publicly. For example, OFAC licenses often contain commercially sensitive information, so if these licenses were publicly released, potential market competitors could gain an unfair competitive advantage; and if companies could no longer expect licenses to remain private, they would be less likely to apply for them, which, generally, would not be a good thing. With respect to the lists of foreign financial institutions, it is important to remember that these institutions are not bound by U.S. sanctions or other designations, and they haven’t necessarily violated any particular laws or prohibitions. While Congress should know about how these sanctions are being implemented, including how effective they are at stopping the financing of activities, I don’t think the public identification of these foreign firms would serve a useful policy purpose and could otherwise move legal activity into a shade of gray. The bill does allow for a classified annex with the reporting requirements, and, as I said, I think this is a good bill 
that will increase congressional oversight of U.S. sanction activities appropriately. Mr. Speaker, I support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6751, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
9/11 HEROES MEDAL OF VALOR ACT OF 2017 Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3834) to provide that members of public safety agencies who died of 9/11 related health conditions are eligible for the Presidential 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3834 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 2. MEMBERS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES WHO SUBSEQUENTLY DIED OF 9/11 RELATED HEALTH CONDITIONS ELIGIBLE FOR PRESIDENTIAL 9/11 HEROES MEDAL OF VALOR. 
An individual who was a public safety officer (as defined in section 5 of the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act of 2001) who— (1) participated in the response at any point during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on July 31, 2002, to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the terrorist attack on the Pentagon, or the terrorist attack that resulted in the crash of the fourth airplane in Pennsylvania; and (2) died as a result of such participation thereafter as a result of a WTCrelated health condition (which term shall have the meaning given such term in section 3312 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300mm–22) with respect to a WTC responder), shall be eligible for the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor referred to in subsection (a) of section 124 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, in the same manner and to the same extent as any individual who is otherwise eligible under such section, except that no requirement under such section pertaining to the death of that individual shall apply. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ) and the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 3834, the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor Act of 2017, introduced by our colleague from New York, Representative CROWLEY . Mr. Speaker, the terrible sights and sounds and memories of September 11, 2001, are seared into America’s memory, but none more so than the stories of incredibly brave police and fire officers who rushed into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, ignoring danger to themselves, to help others escape. 442 of those brave public safety officers died, and in recognition of their bravery and sacrifice, in 2005, Congress created the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor awarded in their memory to their families. Since then, as we now know, many more of those who rushed to help others to safety from the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, or on the attack that resulted in the crash of the fourth airplane in Pennsylvania have died as a result of their heroism because of health conditions resulting from the attacks. Mr. Speaker, they were just as brave, and many suffered terribly. We can do no less than ensure that they are eligible to receive this medal as well. Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that we make all first responders who have died as a result of their heroism eligible for the medal, whether they died on that terrible day or at some later date. I support this bill, salute those brave souls, thank Representative CROWLEY  for introducing this legislation, and urge its immediate passage. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY), the sponsor of this important legislation. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time. I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING and Ranking Member W ATERS  and all the members of the Financial Services Committee for working with me to pass this important legislation. It is something I began work on early in my tenure here in Congress, and it is important to me and to my fellow New Yorkers and, I think, our fellow Americans, as well, to see this legislation pass today. Mr. Speaker, on September 11, 2001, our Nation was rocked by the most vicious terrorist attack in our Nation’s history. The devastation and the loss of life shook the American people to their core. It shook the entire world. But that morning, we also witnessed the bright light of heroism. The world saw and heard inspiring tales of rescue by public safety officers: our police officers, our firefighters, and our EMTs. They heard heartbreaking stories of many of those heroes, their injuries and their tragic deaths, people who risked their lives to save others. There is something incredible about our public safety officers. Day in and day out, they put their lives on the line. Growing up, most of us were taught to run out of burning buildings, but they do exactly the opposite. They are trained and they are devoted to responding to just that type of situation. They run into those buildings not to protect themselves or even the property, but primarily to save lives. That is exactly what hundreds of first responders did on that fateful day in America. They ran in without pause. They climbed flights and flights of stairs, while an inferno raged above them. And as we remember all too well—the images are burned in our minds forever—those towers eventually fell, taking just about all who were living inside those towers with them. This experience affected all of us, and it still affects us all today. It personally impacted thousands of people in New York and in the New York region, I would say the quadState region and beyond. It affected people right here in our capital region and our Pentagon. It certainly affected the people in Pennsylvania and in Boston, and wherever those flights were heading that day. It was a national attack against America. Every soul in America experienced that attack. And it impacted me, personally, as well, because my dear, good friend and first cousin, Battalion Chief John Moran, was one of those brave public safety officers inside the towers that morning. His last known words were as his truck pulled up to Tower 2. He said: ‘‘Let me off here. I’m going to try to make a difference.’’ That is what all those who served that day tried to do: they tried to make a difference. So, for me, as for thousands of Americans, the effort to honor these men and women is personal. After the attacks took place, I began working on legislation to do just that. Earlier in 2001, just a few months before the attacks, Congress had created a Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor for those who went above and beyond the call of duty. But there wasn’t a way to give that award posthumously to the many who displayed extraordinary courage and who perished on September 11. But we needed to change that, and we did. In 2004, Congress finally passed our legislation, the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor Act, which established a decoration, posthumously awarded by the President of the United States, to the public safety officers who died rescuing individuals at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and elsewhere on 9/11. The following year, I attended the ceremony at the White House with 
many of the victims’ families, where thenPresident George W. Bush bestowed this honor on 442 heroes and their families. They all deserved this important recognition. But as the years went on, the Nation began to learn of the longer lasting effects of the attacks because, as we all know, the story of this tragedy did not end simply on September 11. For weeks and for months after the attacks, officers continued to work day and night, first on search and rescue missions, and then on the cleanup of the wreckage itself. The toxic dust spewing into the air, when inhaled, proved to have enduring deadly effects, particularly for our first responders. For example, according to the Uniformed Firefighters Association, more than 170 firefighters have died as a result of 9/11related injuries. b1845 Eighteen officers died in 2017 alone. Hundreds of other public safety officers have met similar fates. At the time that we passed the original 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor bill, we did not yet know that more brave public safety officers would fall ill and pass away because of their dedicated service to their country. They, too, were heroes, and they deserve to be honored as such. That is why I have worked to introduce this new 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor Act. This bill will grant the medal to public safety officers who worked at the sites of the attacks and have since died from a 9/11connected illness as defined in the Zadroga Act. It will also allow those who continue to succumb to 9/11related illnesses to receive this award. I am proud to say the legislation has the support of a wide array of public safety organizations, including the International Association of Fire Fighters, International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Volunteer Fire Council, the National Sheriffs’ Association, Major County Sheriffs of America, the FealGood Foundation, and, of course, the Sergeants Benevolent Association, the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association of the New York City Police Department, and that of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, as well. Without the tireless advocacy efforts of these organizations, we would not be here today. So I am extremely grateful for the work that they have done and are committed to continue to do to make this bill law. I look forward to the day when we finally honor the hundreds of heroes who have died since 9/11 for the outstanding work they did and what they continue to do to help our Nation recover. I want to thank, again, the chairman, Mr. HENSARLING , Ranking Member WATERS , all of my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee who cosponsored this bill from New York and around the country as well, and all of those who have helped get this long overdue bill passed here today. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to its passage by the Senate and being signed into law by the President. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly support H.R. 3834, the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor Act of 2017. This bill reestablishes the original 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor to be given to the families of those heroes—the firefighters, police officers, and EMTs—who have since died as a result of their exposure to toxic chemicals on that fateful day. Though we have honored those who passed away on September 11 with the original 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor, the casualty list has continued to rise since then as a result of the debris and chemicals that so many were exposed to. I am proud to support this piece of legislation which honors the men and women who have made such a tremendous sacrifice in serving our country. I thank my colleague, Mr. CROWLEY , for his tireless work on this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY). Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, in case the gentleman was going to yield back, I just want to thank my staff as well, both those who worked back in 2004 to help pass the original legislation, and my staff today. In particular, I want to thank my chief of staff back home in Queens, AnneMarie Anzalone, whose husband at the time was a member of the New York City Police Department, and was a part of the cleanup on the restoration after the attack in Manhattan. It was because of her thoughtfulness in terms of moving me and pushing me to pass this legislation that this bill has come to the floor today. So I want to thank her in particular for her efforts. I thank the gentleman again for yielding. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3834. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ANWAR SADAT CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION ACT Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 754) to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Anwar Sadat in recognition of his heroic achievements and courageous contributions to peace in the Middle East. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 754 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Anwar Sadat Centennial Celebration Act’’. 
Congress finds the following: (1) Anwar Sadat was born on December 25, 1918, in Mit Abu alKum, alMinufiyah, Egypt, as 1 of 13 children in a poor Egyptian family. (2) In 1938, Sadat graduated from the Royal Military Academy in Cairo and was appointed to the Signal Corps. (3) Sadat entered the Army as a second lieutenant and was posted to Sudan where he met Gamal Abdel Nasser and fellow junior officers who became the ‘‘Free Officers’’ who led the Egyptian revolution of 1952. (4) Sadat held various high positions during Nasser’s presidency, assuming the role of President of the National Assembly in 1960 and Vice President in 1964. (5) President Nasser died of a heart attack on September 28, 1970, at which point Sadat became acting President. Sadat was subsequently elected as the third President of Egypt. (6) On October 6, 1973, President Sadat, along with his Syrian counterparts, launched an offensive against Israel. A permanent ceasefire was reached on October 25, 1973. (7) In 1974, after talks facilitated by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Egypt and Israel signed an agreement allowing Egypt to formally retrieve land in the Sinai. President Sadat later wrote in his memoirs that his meetings with Kissinger ‘‘marked the beginning of a relationship of mutual understanding with the United States culminating and crystallizing in what we came to describe as a ‘peace process’. Together we started that process and the United States still supports our joint efforts to this day’’. (8) Months of diplomacy between Egypt and Israel followed the signing of this initial agreement and a second disengagement agreement, the Sinai Interim Agreement, was signed in September of 1975. (9) President Sadat addressed a joint session of Congress on November 5, 1975, during which he underscored the shared values between the United States and Egypt. In this speech, President Sadat addressed the path to peace, saying, ‘‘We are faced, together with other nations, with one of the greatest challenges of our time, namely the task of convincing this generation, and those to follow, that we can finally build a viable international system capable of meeting the demands of tomorrow and solving the problems of the coming age’’. (10) On November 19, 1977, President Sadat became the first Arab leader to visit Israel, meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister, Menachem Begin. President Sadat spoke before the Israeli Knesset in Jerusalem about his views on how to achieve comprehensive peace in the ArabIsraeli conflict. (11) Before commencing negotiations, President Sadat courageously announced to the Knesset, ‘‘I have come to you so that together we might build a durable peace based on justice, to avoid the shedding of 1 single drop of blood from an Arab or an Israeli. It is for this reason that I have proclaimed my readiness to go to the farthest corner of the world’’. President Sadat further poignantly stated that ‘‘any life lost in war is a human 
life, irrespective of its being that of an Israeli or an Arab. . . . When the bells of peace ring, there will be no hands to beat the drums of war’’. (12) On September 17, 1978, President Jimmy Carter hosted President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin at Camp David where the 3 leaders engaged in 13 days of negotiations that resulted in the ‘‘Framework for Peace in the Middle East’’ (commonly known as the ‘‘Camp David Accords’’). (13) Following negotiations, President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin signed the EgyptIsrael Peace Treaty (in this section referred to as the ‘‘Peace Treaty’’) at the White House on March 26, 1979. Addressing President Sadat at the signing of the Peace Treaty, which remains an important anchor for peace in the region today, Prime Minister Begin commended President Sadat by saying, ‘‘In the face of adversity and hostility, you have demonstrated the human value that can change history—civil courage’’. (14) The Peace Treaty featured mutual recognition of each country by the other and ultimately the cessation of the state of war that had existed between Israel and Egypt since the 1948 ArabIsraeli War. Israel completely withdrew its armed forces and civilians from the rest of the Sinai. (15) In 1978, both President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for signing the Peace Treaty, which made Egypt the first Arab country to officially recognize Israel. (16) While presenting the Nobel Peace Prize to President Sadat, Aase Lionaes, Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said, ‘‘During the 30 preceding years, the peoples of the Middle East have, on 4 separate occasions, been the victims of warfare and there seemed no prospect of peace. President Sadat’s great contribution to peace was that he had sufficient courage and foresight to break away from this vicious circle. His decision to accept Prime Minister Menachem Begin’s invitation of November 17, 1977, to attend a meeting of the Israeli parliament on November 19 was an act of great courage, both from a personal and from a political point of view. This was a dramatic break with the past and a courageous step forward into a new age’’. (17) During his Nobel lecture, President Sadat remarked, ‘‘I made my trip because I am convinced that we owe it to this generation and the generations to come not to leave a stone unturned in our pursuit of peace’’. (18) In remarks to the People’s Assembly in Cairo on March 10, 1979, President Carter praised President Sadat, telling the Assembly, ‘‘Your President has demonstrated the power of human courage and human vision to create hope where there had been only despair.’’. President Carter also said that the Peace Treaty would ‘‘strengthen cooperation between Egypt and the United States’’ and underscored the support of the United States for the agreement, saying, ‘‘I fully share and will support President Sadat’s belief that stability must be maintained in this part of the world . . . He and I recognize that the security of this vital region is being challenged. I applaud his determination to meet that challenge, and my Government will stand with him’’. (19) The signing of the Peace Treaty enraged many individuals who opposed normalized relations with Israel. President Sadat was assassinated on October 6, 1981, by Khalid Islambouli, a member of Egyptian Islamic Jihad. President Sadat was well aware of the controversy to which his actions would lead, but pushed for peace anyway. (20) Upon the death of President Sadat, President Ronald Reagan proclaimed, ‘‘President Sadat was a courageous man whose vision and wisdom brought nations and people together. In a world filled with hatred, he was a man of hope. In a world trapped in the animosities of the past, he was a man of foresight, a man who sought to improve a world tormented by malice and pettiness’’. (21) President Sadat is recognized in the United States and throughout the world as a respected leader and champion of peace whose vision provided a roadmap for the peaceful resolution of conflict that endures nearly 40 years after its inception. (22) President Sadat bravely reached out to Israel and dedicated himself to peace, furthering the national security of Egypt and the stability of the Middle East. (23) On the 30th anniversary of the Peace Treaty, President Barack Obama praised the enduring legacy of the Camp David Accords and the ‘‘courage and foresight of these leaders, who stood together in unity to change the course of our shared history’’. President Obama closed by saying, ‘‘Today, as we seek to expand the circle of peace among Arabs and Israelis, we take inspiration from what Israel and Egypt achieved 3 decades ago, knowing that the destination is worthy of the struggle’’. (24) The Camp David Accords and the Peace Treaty continue to serve the interests of the United States by preserving peace and serving as a foundation for partnership and dialogue in a region fraught with conflict and division. 
(a) A WARD AUTHORIZED .—The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the posthumous award, on behalf of Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to Anwar Sadat in recognition of his achievements and heroic actions to attain comprehensive peace in the Middle East. (b) DESIGN AND STRIKING .—For the purpose of the award referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this Act as the ‘‘Secretary’’) shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions to be determined by the Secretary. (c) PRESENTATION .— (1) IN GENERAL .—The gold medal referred to in subsection (a) shall be presented to— (A)(i) the widow of Anwar Sadat, Jehan Sadat; or (ii) if Jehan Sadat is unavailable, the next of kin of Jehan Sadat; and (B) a representative of the Government of Egypt. (2) AWARD OF MEDAL .—Following the presentation described in paragraph (1), the gold medal shall be given to— (A) Jehan Sadat; or (B) if Jehan Sadat is unavailable, the next of kin of Jehan Sadat. 
The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck under section 3 under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and the cost of the gold medal. 
(a) N ATIONAL MEDALS .—The medals struck under this Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code. (b) NUMISMATIC ITEMS .—For purposes of sections 5134 and 5136 of title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ) and the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. KIHUEN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. STEWART ). Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. TIPTON , for yielding, and it is such a great pleasure that I address the House tonight as we talk about the Anwar Sadat Centennial Celebration Act, which we will be voting on later this evening. This is actually a great time, and it is a very fitting time, to give the late President Sadat this muchdeserved recognition. Just last Monday marked the 40th anniversary of the Camp David Accords, something, of course, which he is very responsible for. Additionally, this year is the centennial of his birth. President Sadat’s historic visit to Israel in 1977 was the first ever by an Arab leader and the foundation of lasting peace between Egypt and Israel. This visit was all the more courageous given the fierce opposition and outrage he faced at the time. President Sadat fought for peace and paid the ultimate price. In honoring Mr. Sadat, we honor a man who truly embodied the statesmanship and fortitude necessary to bring peace to the Middle East, virtues that are as important today as they were then. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. MENG), the Sadat Gold Medal Commission, and the Anwar Sadat Committee for their hard work on this bill. President Anwar Sadat’s shining example of putting aside our differences and working towards peace is just as important today as it was during his tenure as President of Egypt. It is my sincere hope that we can reflect on the dream and the bravery of this visionary man and work as he did for peace, even when it seemed impossible. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 754, the Anwar Sadat Centennial Celebration Act. This legislation gives the highest civilian award bestowed by Congress to the third President of Egypt who served from 1970 until he was assassinated in 1981. Under his leadership, he established lasting peace between Israel and Egypt by expunging previous hostilities towards Israel and being the first Arab leader to recognize Israel as a nationstate. Additionally, President Sadat and former Israeli Prime Minister 
Menachem Begin negotiated the peace treaty that came to be known as the Camp David Accords in a series of meetings arranged by thenPresident Jimmy Carter at Camp David. President Sadat’s leadership and commitment to peace provided a resolution of conflict that has endured nearly 40 years after its inception. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the passage of this bill to honor President Sadat and his commitment to peace and the national security of this country, as well as the stability of the Middle East. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 754. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
IG SUBPOENA AUTHORITY ACT Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4917) to amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 to provide testimonial subpoena authority, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4917 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘IG Subpoena Authority Act’’. 
The Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.) is amended— (1) by inserting after section 6 the following new section: 
‘‘(a) T ESTIMONIAL SUBPOENA AUTHORITY .— In addition to the authority otherwise provided by this Act and in accordance with the requirements of this section, each Inspector General, in carrying out the provisions of this Act (or in the case of an Inspector General or Special Inspector General not established under this Act, the provisions of the authorizing statute), is authorized to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses as necessary in the performance of the functions assigned to the Inspector General by this Act (or in the case of an Inspector General or Special Inspector General not established under this Act, the functions assigned by the authorizing statute), which in the case of contumacy or refusal to obey, such subpoena shall be enforceable by order of any appropriate United States district court. An Inspector General may not require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of any current Federal employees, but may use other authorized procedures. ‘‘(b) NONDELEGATION .—The authority to issue a subpoena under subsection (a) may not be delegated. ‘‘(c) PANEL REVIEW BEFORE ISSUANCE .— ‘‘(1) APPROVAL REQUIRED .— ‘‘(A) REQUEST FOR APPROVAL BY SUBPOENA  
PANEL .—Before the issuance of a subpoena described in subsection (a), an Inspector General shall submit a request for approval to issue a subpoena to a panel (in this section, referred to as the ‘Subpoena Panel’), which shall be comprised of three Inspectors General of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, who shall be designated by the Inspector General serving as Chairperson of the Council. ‘‘(B) PROTECTION FROM DISCLOSURE .—The information contained in the request submitted by an Inspector General under subparagraph (A) and the identification of a witness shall be protected from disclosure to the extent permitted by law. Any request for disclosure of such information shall be submitted to the Inspector General requesting the subpoena. ‘‘(2) TIME TO RESPOND .— ‘‘(A) IN GENERAL .—Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Subpoena Panel shall approve or deny a request for approval to issue a subpoena not later than 10 days after the submission of such request. ‘‘(B) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR PANEL .— If the Subpoena Panel determines that additional information is necessary to approve or deny such request, the Subpoena Panel shall request such information and shall approve or deny such request not later than 20 days after the submission of such request. ‘‘(3) DENIAL BY PANEL .—If a majority of the Subpoena Panel denies the approval of a subpoena, that subpoena may not be issued. ‘‘(d) NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL .— ‘‘(1) IN GENERAL .—If the Subpoena Panel approves a subpoena under subsection (c), the Inspector General shall notify the Attorney General that the Inspector General intends to issue the subpoena. ‘‘(2) DENIAL FOR INTERFERENCE WITH AN ON GOING INVESTIGATION .—Not later than 10 days after the date on which the Attorney General is notified pursuant to paragraph (1), the Attorney General may object to the issuance of the subpoena because the subpoena will interfere with an ongoing investigation and the subpoena may not be issued. ‘‘(3) ISSUANCE OF SUBPOENA APPROVED .—If the Attorney General does not object to the issuance of the subpoena during the 10day period described in paragraph (2), the Inspector General may issue the subpoena. ‘‘(e) REGULATIONS .—The Chairperson of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this section. ‘‘(f) INSPECTOR GENERAL DEFINED .—For purposes of this section, the term ‘Inspector General’ includes each Inspector General established under this Act and each Inspector General or Special Inspector General not established under this Act. ‘‘(g) APPLICABILITY .—The provisions of this section shall not affect the exercise of authority by an Inspector General of testimonial subpoena authority established under another provision of law.’’; (2) in section 5(a)— (A) in paragraph (21)(B), by striking ‘‘; and’’ and inserting a semicolon; (B) in paragraph (22), by striking the period at the end and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and (C) by inserting at the end the following new paragraph: ‘‘(23) a description of the use of subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of certain witnesses authorized under section 6A.’’; and (3) in section 8G(g)(1), by inserting ‘‘6A,’’ before ‘‘and 7’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of my bill, H.R. 4917, the IG Subpoena Authority Act. H.R. 4917 would provide inspectors general the authority to subpoena contractors, grant recipients, and former Federal employees for testimony necessary for their investigations. Inspectors general perform a critical role in the performance of the Federal Government by rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse. In fiscal year 2016 alone, Federal inspectors general identified potential savings of over $45 billion. Nearly half of those savings were identified in the course of the IG’s investigative work. Congress, the American people, and the agencies themselves rely on inspectors general reviews to find areas for improved efficiency and effectiveness, but those reviews are limited by the IG’s inability to compel contractors and former employees to cooperate. The IG Subpoena Authority Act gives inspectors general a muchneeded tool to fulfill their investigative function under the Inspector General Act. To effectively identify waste, fraud, and abuse, IGs should be able to conduct a thorough and complete investigation. To conduct a thorough and complete investigation, however, IGs need to be able to talk to the people involved. Unfortunately, inspectors general haven’t always been able to obtain testimony from those key individuals. They collect testimony from Federal employees, but sometimes the employees resign or retire before the inspectors general can review them. In fact, the IG community has informed us of many cases that went cold when witnesses left the agencies or refused to testify voluntarily. This bill seeks to address these gaps in the evidentiary record by permitting IGs to subpoena the testimony of witnesses during the course of an audit or investigation. The bill establishes procedures to ensure the authority is not abused. To prevent abuse, inspectors general must get approval from a subpoena review panel that will be made up of three other inspectors general. The review panel must approve or deny the subpoena request within 10 days of the request being filed. 
Further, if a subpoena request is approved by the panel, the requesting IG must notify the Attorney General of the pending subpoena. The Attorney General is then able to review the subpoena and may object to its issuance if it will interfere with an ongoing Department of Justice investigation. An IG must complete all of these steps prior to issuing the subpoena. A version of this bill already passed the House once before. Last Congress, the committee worked on a bipartisan, bicameral basis to enact the Inspector General Empowerment Act. When it first passed the House, the Inspector General Empowerment Act included testimonial subpoena authority for IGs. Although the provision did not make it into law, I hope that changes this year. I would like to thank the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, especially the Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who chairs the Council, and Peace Corps Inspector General Kathy Buller, who chairs its Legislation Committee, for their work in support of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter from Ms. Buller supporting the legislation. 
COUNCIL OF THE INSPECTORS GENERAL ON INTEGRITY AND EFFICIENCY , June 7, 2018. Hon. TREYGOWDY , Chairman, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. ELIJAH CUMMINGS , Ranking Member, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. STEVE RUSSELL , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN GOWDY , RANKING MEMBER  CUMMINGS , AND REPRESENTATIVE RUSSELL : We appreciate your efforts to address the Inspector General (IG) community’s long standing interest in obtaining testimonial subpoena authority (TSA) for all IGs and would like to outline our views on H.R. 4917, the IG Subpoena Authority Act. For many years, the Legislation Committee of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) has included TSA among its legislative priorities. The authority in H.R. 4917 would assist government oversight by providing a critical tool to address fraud, waste, and abuse by authorizing all IGs to subpoena the attendance and testimony of certain witnesses, as necessary, to fulfill the functions of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended (IG Act). CIGIE supports the language in the bill aligning the scope of TSA with the IG’s existing documentary subpoena authority, found in Section 6(a)(4) of the IG Act. While requiring that any subpoena be necessary in the performance of IG work, the language does not limit who may be subpoenaed, other than with respect to current Federal employees (as they are already generally required to cooperate with OIGs). Congress has already granted some IGs TSA under the IG Act or through other laws. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DOD OIG) was provided TSA under Section 1042 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010, codified at Section 8(i) of the IG Act. As noted in the Congressional record, DOD OIG has used this authority judiciously and sparingly. The Department of Health and Human Services OIG also has testimonial subpoena power in certain circumstances. Moreover, IGs overseeing appropriations under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 received TSA to be exercised through the nowsunsetted Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. Following the practice of those IGs who already have or had TSA, CIGIE is committed to ensuring that the authority will be used appropriately and fairly. In short, CIGIE echoes Ranking Member Cummings’s belief that IGs would ‘‘act responsibly and use this authority only when absolutely necessary,’’ and that appropriate safeguards provide checks on potential abuse. THE NEED FOR TSA  While the current IG documentary subpoena authority under the IG Act is a powerful tool, it is a tool with inherent limitations. Most notably, Federal employees who are the subjects of IG investigations can retire or resign while being investigated. In such cases, limitations on IG documentary subpoena authority or other IG Act authorities can thwart IG investigations. For example, this could impact the ability to pursue the investigations considered under the Official Personnel File Enhancement Act. These limitations have had negative, real world effects on IG oversight and can impact Congressional initiatives. As Chairman Gowdy has recognized, ‘‘[y]ou’re only as good as your access to information and witnesses.’’ An informal survey of the IG community revealed TSA would have strengthened IG oversight throughout the Federal government as illustrated in the following examples: One agency’s OIG conducted an investigation of a senior staff member who allegedly modified official documents and impersonated an official, before retiring during the investigation. The former senior staff member was not receptive to being interviewed after retiring. Because the OIG lacked TSA, the OIG could not compel testimony from the retired senior staff member to conduct an effective investigation. In connection with an OIG’s review of alleged safety issues at an agency facility, the OIG was unable to interview the central person identified in the allegation or that person’s supervisor since both had left Federal service and declined voluntary interviews. The unavailability of those key witnesses hampered the OIG’s ability to fully investigate alleged safety issues or to address a key objective of the inspection, which was to identify factors that may have contributed to leadership being unaware of those issues. During another OIG’s investigation into a small business owner who received two Federal grants for overlapping business proposals, key individuals declined to be interviewed by the OIG. One of the employees confessed to destroying company documents and creating new ones at the request of the owner. After the confession, other individuals involved declined to be interviewed. Without TSA or the cooperation of another employee or the owner, the OIG was unable to pursue obstruction and other potential charges against the subjects. Another agency’s OIG faced obstacles when investigating fraud associated with a loan program. The loan officer was the only source of information to determine the individual associated with the borrower. The OIG was unable to effectively complete the investigation because the bank declined to make the loan officer available for an interview. A different OIG discovered a contractor was being paid for services it did not provide, and only minimal information could be collected through documentary subpoena authority. Attempts to contact the contractor were unproductive. If that OIG had TSA, the OIG could have compelled the contractor’s representative to be interviewed. An OIG was reviewing thirdparty contractors retained by the agency to provide healthcare services to eligible individuals. The OIG could not determine if the contractors provided proper notifications to individuals about their eligibility for the services. Without the ability to compel the contractors to testify, the OIG could rely only on records, which did not contain specific information on which to base conclusions. Yet another OIG was unable to effectively examine potential false and fraudulent billing after discovering an unauthorized subcontractor was performing the majority of work under a large contract. As the subcontractor was not in a direct contractual relationship with the agency, the OIG had to rely on documentary subpoenas. If that OIG had TSA, it could have fully examined the potentially false and fraudulent billing. An investigation conducted on behalf of the Integrity Committee was unable to obtain evidence from a former senior level OIG employee who had retired from Federal service and declined to speak with investigators. The investigation concluded without the former senior level OIG employee’s evidence. Another OIG encountered a significant obstacle while conducting an audit where several former government officials refused to be interviewed. Without the ability to compel their testimony, the OIG had to report their refusal to the appropriate Congressional oversight committee. Only after the OIG reported this refusal to Congress did these former government officials finally agree to be interviewed. If that OIG had TSA, it would not have needed Congressional intervention to complete its oversight work. 
SUBPOENA PANEL AND OTHER PROVISIONS  With respect to the IG subpoena panel created in the bill, and given the nature of the authority being granted, we understand the interest of Congress in putting in place an additional check on the use of TSA. While, in our view, the provision is unnecessary, we do not object to its inclusion. CIGIE requests, however, that two additional points related to the language of the legislation be reconsidered. First, the nondelegation clause in the proposed IG Act Section ‘‘6A(b)’’ may create problems for OIGs subject to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Most relevantly, it could limit longserving acting IGs from exercising the authority when the acting IG is no longer able to perform the ‘‘duties and functions’’ designated solely to the IG. To avoid this issue, we recommend that this provision be removed. Second, with respect to the proposed IG Act Section ‘‘6A(e)’’, having the CIGIE Chair issue guidelines to IGs, rather than promulgate regulations, would achieve Congress’s intent of standardizing and governing the use of TSA without requiring CIGIE to undergo a lengthy and resourceintensive rulemaking process. Moreover, it will be more economical to update or modify guidelines as needed. 
STAKEHOLDERS  The benefits of this legislation are reflected in the support expressed by government oversight stakeholders for providing IGs with TSA. Importantly, bipartisan support for providing IGs with TSA has come not just from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, but also from the unanimous consent it received in the House of Representatives last Congress. Other important government oversight stakeholders have also expressed how government oversight would benefit from OIGs 
receiving TSA. For example the Office of Special Counsel wrote to Senate leadership describing how providing IGs with this authority will enhance IG efforts to reduce government waste and abuse, and how TSA has been helpful in reprisal investigations undertaken by the Office of Special Counsel. Nongovernmental organizations emphasized in a May 2016 letter to Congress that OIGs are essential to a wellfunctioning Government, and noted that providing access to agency information, including through TSA, would allow OIGs to conduct proper oversight. As evidenced by both Congressional and stakeholder support, TSA will benefit the IG community in carrying out its oversight operations. 
CONCLUSION  CIGIE appreciates your continued support of our work and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform’s efforts to improve government oversight through H.R. 4917. In the decades since the IG Act’s passage, IGs have saved taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars and improved the programs and operations of the Federal government through their independent oversight. Testimonial subpoena authority would further improve the ability of IGs to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal operations. As Representative Russell stated, ‘‘Inspectors General are an essential partner for Congress and by extension to we the people that empower government,’’ and ‘‘we must provide Inspectors General with the tools they need to fully accomplish their mission. Testimonial subpoena authority is one such tool, and a critical one at that.’’ Thank you for your continued support of CIGIE and its member IGs. We remain available to continue to work with you and the Congress on the important issues addressed in this legislation. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, KATHY A. B ULLER , Chair, CIGIE Legislation Committee. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, lastly, I would like to thank my Democratic colleagues for their support and thoughtful dialogue, particularly the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT ), who sponsored this bill with me. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1900 Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill would give inspectors general the ability to subpoena witnesses to testify. This would be a significant new authority. Although I believe most IGs would act responsibly, it is important that we include safeguards to protect against potential abuse of this new authority. This bill includes several such safeguards. The bill would require an IG, before issuing a subpoena, to go through two reviews. The first review would be conducted by the Council of Inspectors General for Integrity and Efficiency. A panel of three council members would have to approve the subpoena before the IG could issue it. The second review would be conducted by the attorney general, who would have the opportunity to block a subpoena if it would interfere with an ongoing investigation. The bill attempts to strike a careful balance in granting IGs the authority to interview witnesses outside of the government while also providing these important checks against potential abuse. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, one of the chief complaints of the American people is that we can’t hold our government accountable. This bill goes a long way to correct that. In the future, no longer will people be able to simply walk away from agencies and duties in government without any accounting. We have built in the safeguards, and we have worked in a bipartisan way, so that we can achieve that aim. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4917. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
GUIDANCE OUT OF DARKNESS ACT Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4809) to increase access to agency guidance documents, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4809 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Guidance Out Of Darkness Act’’ or the ‘‘GOOD Act’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. R USSELL ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 4809, the Guidance Out of Darkness, or GOOD, Act, which was introduced by my colleague and friend from North Carolina, Mr. WALKER . Regulatory guidance is widely used by agencies. The guidance applies to industry and taxpayers alike. However, we really don’t know the full universe of agency guidance. Professor Nicholas Parrillo of Yale Law School, who testified before the Oversight and Government Reform Committee earlier this year said, ‘‘There is no comprehensive compilation of guidance, but everyone agrees its volume is oceanic.’’ The Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been looking into agency use of guidance over the past year, and we found this is an area of government in need of reform. H.R. 4809 introduces muchneeded elements of transparency and consistency to the process of disseminating agency guidance documents. In 2007, the Office of Management and Budget issued what is known as the ‘‘Good Guidance Bulletin.’’ This bulletin requires Federal agencies to follow certain best practices when issuing significant guidance documents, which are those that are the costliest to comply with or are otherwise exceptionally impactful. The Good Guidance Bulletin requires agencies to maintain lists of their significant guidance documents on their websites so that they can be readily found by the people and entities the documents affect. The GOOD Act expands this posting requirement to all guidance documents. Regulated entities shouldn’t have to search high and low to find out how agencies interpret the laws and regulations that affect every sector of the economy. The public deserves to have this information, and this legislation will make these policy documents more accessible to the public. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we can all agree that agencies should be transparent about what guidance is currently in effect for agency employees. During committee consideration of this legislation, Democratic members raised concerns that the bill should not be used for a purpose other than simple transparency. Unfortunately, the Senate sponsor of the companion legislation was quoted as stating that the bill could be used to eliminate guidance issued during President Barack Obama’s administration by making those guidance documents available for disapproval under the Congressional Review Act. Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority for working with minority to address the concerns expressed in committee. The majority agreed to include a provision in the bill that clarifies that this bill will not be used to influence whether guidance falls under the Congressional Review Act. The bill we are considering today states that ‘‘Nothing in this Act may be construed to affect whether a guidance document qualifies as a rule for purposes of chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code.’’ There are additional improvements I believe should be made to the bill. For example, the definition in the bill of what would be considered a guidance document remains very broad, and it is unclear about who decides what is considered a guidance document. The bill also makes no exceptions for national security or other sensitive documents. However, I do not object to this bill moving forward, but I do hope the majority will continue to work with all Members as this legislation moves through the legislative process. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ), the sponsor of this bill, my friend. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4809, the Guidance Out of Darkness, or GOOD, Act. Mr. Speaker, those who must live their lives or run their businesses according to a set of rules have a right to know what those rules are. To foster accountability and transparency in Federal regulation, Congress passed the Administrative Procedure Act in 1946, which required disclosure or publication of administrative rules. Unfortunately, the law contains an exception for what we commonly refer to as guidance documents. Guidance documents are sporadically posted on agency websites and the websites of component agencies and offices, while some are not posted at all. That inconsistency places burdens on regulated entities. Small businesses are especially harmed because they do not have the resources to hire fulltime compliance staff. Instead, smallbusiness owners have to take the time and energy away from their businesses to stay up to date on each new regulatory guidance. The GOOD Act requires transparency and consistency in the regulatory process. The public deserves to know what guidance documents are out there. They deserve to know how the agencies administering our laws interpret those laws and regulations. H.R. 4809 requires agencies to post their guidance documents online in one centralized location. Agencies create these documents and expect the guidance to be followed. They should, therefore, have no problem gathering and posting these documents for the American people to see. At the request of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, dozens of agencies have disclosed information to us on their use of guidance documents. The results have been staggering. To date, agencies have provided lists of more than 18,000 guidance documents issued just in the past decade, and that is just a portion of Federal guidance documents. There are a handful of agencies that have been unable or flat out refused to produce a list of guidance documents for the committees. I believe we would agree this is a red flag. If an agency doesn’t bother to keep track of its guidance documents, then how in the world can businesses and taxpayers be expected to comply with them? The burden should be on the agencies to make guidance documents publicly available and easy to find. That is all this bill does. It requires agencies to post information they should already have in a central location so it can be easily found. This is a small step agencies can take that will have significant benefits, alleviating burdens on regulated entities and the public. I thank the bipartisan group of my colleagues who supported H.R. 4809 during committee consideration of this bill, and I urge all Members to support this legislation. Why? Because this legislation is commonsense reform that Members of both parties can support in the name of good governance and transparency. Mr. Speaker, there is one additional item that is common sense that I believe both parties could support, and that is wishing my wife a happy birthday today. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4809, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
GRANT REPORTING EFFICIENCY AND AGREEMENTS TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2018 Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4887) to modernize Federal grant reporting, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4887 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements Transparency Act of 2018’’ or the ‘‘GREAT Act’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 4887, the GREAT Act, introduced by Congresswoman FOXX of North Carolina. The GREAT Act would amend previously enacted legislation to improve reporting on Federal grants. In 2014, Congress enacted the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act, or DATA Act. The DATA Act required the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a pilot program to alleviate reporting burdens for grant recipients. Through the pilot, it became clear that grant recipients often have to enter the same data multiple times, and there is no single location where all the data can be analyzed. This redundancy is burdensome for both the grant recipient and for those conducting oversight of Federal awards. In fiscal year 2017, the Federal Government awarded over $660 billion in grants. Congress has a fiscal responsibility to review this spending, but without standardized data, it is difficult to do. The GREAT Act fixes both of these problems by tasking the Office of Management and Budget and an executive branch agency with creating standardized reporting elements for Federal awards. The data elements must be machine readable, nonproprietary, and comply with standards in the DATA Act. The GREAT Act requires the data collected to be made publicly available within 4 years of enactment. The bill exempts personally identifying information, sensitive data, and data otherwise exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The GREAT Act increases transparency for public and private oversight, helping to ensure taxpayers get the best possible return on their $660 billion investment in Federal grants. Improved reporting processes will also ease the burden on grant recipients, so these individuals and organizations can focus on doing the work, rather than filling out duplicative information. The GREAT Act is supported by the DATA Coalition, the National Grants Management Association, and the Association of Government Accountants. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative FOXX and Representative G OMEZ for their work on this important issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking Representative FOXX for her leadership on this important piece of legislation and working closely with me. I also want to thank the staff, who spent countless hours over the past months negotiating and drafting this legislation. I know it might come as a surprise to see a working class progressive Member of Congress from Los Angeles working with a conservative Member from North Carolina. But with some common sense on both sides of the aisle, we can come together to solve problems facing working families across the country. So I hope that Congress can come together, as we have, to make progress. The GREAT Act is a straightforward bill that seeks to modernize the grant reporting process by standardizing the information reported by grant recipients. b1915 By simplifying the grant reporting process, the GREAT Act will create a more open and transparent grant process for all recipients. In Los Angeles, that means greater opportunities for organizations working to make government work better for my constituents. When signed into law, this bill will help universities, city departments, and other organizations automate their recording costs, reduce compliance costs, and focus their energy where it belongs—on maximizing millions in Federal grants to Los Angeles to make it a more prosperous city. By making grant reports machine readable and fully searchable, the GREAT Act will also improve the performance of the grants process and break down barriers to grants. Nonprofits and local groups will have better access to Federal grants so they can leverage funds to maximize their impact. This bipartisan effort represents a major step toward ensuring government works as efficiently as possible for all Americans. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with Representative FOXXand others to continue our bipartisan efforts to help government work better, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), who is a sponsor of this bill. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. RUSSELL for yielding time. Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by thanking Representative JIMMY GOMEZ  for his comments tonight and for helping all through this piece of legislation, the Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements Transparency Act, or GREAT Act. Representative GOMEZ has been an outstanding partner on this bipartisan bill to create more transparency, efficiency, and accountability in the Federal grant reporting process, and I thank him very much for his hard work. 
The GREAT Act represents bipartisan legislation to modernize the Federal grant reporting process. It would do so by mandating a standardized data structure for information that recipients report to Federal agencies. Unless the reporting requirements for Federal grants are searchable, the auditing process will continue to yield waste and inefficiency at best, allowing fraud and abuse at worst. Mr. Speaker, in 2017, the Federal Government awarded $662.7 billion in grants funding to State agencies, local and Tribal governments, agencies, nonprofits, universities, and other organizations. Roughly translated, this equates to the gross domestic product of Switzerland or more than the GDP of every country outside the G20. Within our Federal Government, there are 26 agencies awarding Federal grants, and all of them continue to rely on outdated, burdensome, document based forms to collect and track grant dollars. Society has moved into a new age of information and technology, and it is time that our government follow suit. Adopting a governmentwide open data structure for all the information grantees will report will alleviate compliance burdens; provide instant insights for grantor agencies and Congress; and enable easy access to data for oversight, analytics, and program evaluation. Digitizing and, therefore, automating the reporting process would have a twofold effect. First, it would allow greater scrutiny of how the money is being spent. Second, it allows grantees to maximize every dollar they receive from the government to ensure it goes back into communities supporting local businesses, organizations, and education. In order to fix the way Federal grants are reported, we must move from a documentcentric reporting system to a data superhighway. I urge my colleagues in the House and the Senate to support the GREAT Act and bring grant reporting into the 21st century. Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative GOMEZ for his hard work on this bipartisan bill. I would also like the thank Representative DARRELL ISSAfor his authorship of the DATA Act of 2014. It laid the foundation for the GREAT Act by applying data standardization to a pilot universe of Federal grants. And I thank him for his original cosponsorship of this bill. I would also like to thank OMB Director Mulvaney for his office’s advice on this legislation and leadership in advancing open data in the grant reporting process this year through the President’s management agenda. Lastly, I would like to thank Leader MCCARTHY for bringing this bill to the floor and for his broader leadership in pursuing an innovative agenda this Congress. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the GREAT Act, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4887, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
CORRECTING MISCALCULATIONS IN VETERANS’ PENSIONS ACT Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4431) to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for interest payments by agencies in the case of administrative error in processing certain annuity deposits for prior military service, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4431 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Correcting Miscalculations in Veterans’ Pensions Act’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 4431, the Correcting Miscalculations in Veterans’ Pensions Act, introduced by Congressman CARTER of Georgia. Civilian Federal employees earn an annuity as a part of their service to the country. Newly hired civil servants with prior Federal service, such as members of the military or the Peace Corps, can pay a deposit to count their prior service toward that annuity. This allows an individual to increase their pension upon retirement by counting previous, noncivilian service in the annuity calculation. Under Federal retirement rules, there is a set period of time in which the individual can pay the service deposit. If a deposit isn’t paid within this period of time, interest is assessed. For example, someone wishing to pay a military service deposit must do so within 2 years of starting civilian service. On the third anniversary of civilian employment, interest will begin to accrue annually until the deposit is paid in full. From time to time, agencies make mistakes that can cause an individual to be assessed interest that would not otherwise be owed. Most commonly, the problem arises when an agency provides inaccurate information about the amount or due date of the deposit. But under current law, agencies cannot fix those mistakes, meaning the civil servant has to pay the cost of the agency’s mistake. A 1996 opinion by the Government Accountability Office found the Department of Energy was prohibited from paying the interest assessed as a result of an agency’s mistake on a military service deposit without a change in the law. The agency made a mistake, and the agency wanted to pay the difference. But under the restrictions of current law, the individual had to cover the interest payments that accrued through no fault of his own. This bill fixes that problem to ensure civil servants do not pay the cost of agencies’ mistakes. Specifically, the bill authorizes Federal agencies to pay interest assessed on military service deposits, AmeriCorps service deposits, and Peace Corps service deposits, if the interest is a result of an agency error. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, my friend, Mr. CARTER , for his work on this important bill. I look forward to hearing from him in a moment. I would also like to thank Chairman HARPER from the Committee on House Administration for their support in bringing this bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC, June 26, 2018. Hon. GREGG HARPER , Chairman, Committee on House Administration, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN : On November 16, 2017, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported H.R. 4431, the Correcting Miscalculations in Veterans’ Pensions Act without amendment, by voice vote. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, with additional referral to the Committee on House Administration. I ask you allow the Committee on the House Administration to be discharged from further consideration of the bill to expedite floor consideration. This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on House Administration represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration, to memorialize our understanding. Thank you for your consideration of my request. Sincerely, TREYGOWDY . 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION , Washington, DC, June 26, 2018. Hon. TREYGOWDY , Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 4431, The Correcting Miscalculations in Veterans Pensions Act. As you know, certain provisions of the bill fall within the Jurisdiction of Committee on House Administration. I realize that discharging the Committee on House Administration from further consideration of H.R. 4431 will serve in the best interest of the House of Representatives and agree to do so. It is the understanding of the Committee on House Administration that forgoing action on H.R. 4431 will not prejudice the Committee with respect to appointment of conferees or any future jurisdictional claim. I request that your letter and this response be included in the bill report filed by your Committee, as well as in the Congressional Record. Sincerely, GREGG HARPER , Chairman. 
Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4431. This measure would authorize agencies to pay interest on military service deposits in cases in which administrative error causes interest to be due. Military servicemembers who transition to civilian service may elect to have past military service factored into their Federal pensions by making payments to the civilian retirement fund. These payments are intended to align with the contribution to the pension fund the employees would have made for their years of service in the military. Unfortunately, current law requires these payments to be paid within 2 years of starting Federal service. After this date, interest is assessed on any outstanding payments. Sometimes agencies make mistakes calculating the deposit amount that is due. In these cases, it is only fair that the agencies that made the errors should pay the accrued interest. Under current law or regulation, not all agencies have the authority to pay such accrued interest. This bill would close that loophole. I thank Representative CARTER and Chairman GOWDY for working with us after committee markup to add provisions in the bill that would make similar changes to title 5 regarding the service and deposits for VISTA and Peace Corps volunteers. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 4431, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), who is the sponsor of this bill. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4431, the Correcting Miscalculations in Veterans’ Pensions Act and urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation. I introduced this legislation after one of our veteran constituents in the First Congressional District of Georgia brought his own story to my office. In this case, he was a veteran who, after his service in the military, continued to serve our country by working in the Federal Government. Veterans who work for the Federal Government can have their Active Duty time in the military count toward their civil servant retirement pension if they pay a military service deposit. In the case of our constituent, the employing agency made a mistake in calculating his military service deposit, but the Federal Government did not notice the mistake for more than 10 years. Years later, the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, told the constituent that he must pay the miscalculated amount plus the mistakenly accrued interest on the military service deposit that the employing government agency had miscalculated. When he tried to fight the situation, the employing agency said that they had no ability to either waive the payment or pay it on behalf of the veteran employee. We have found multiple occurrences just like this one for veterans working in our Federal Government. More often than not when these situations happen, the costs balloon to tens of thousands of dollars, leaving our veterans on the hook to pay. This legislation seeks to improve this situation by clarifying that the Federal agencies, in the case 
of a miscalculation, are able to pay the interest that accrues on the military service deposit on behalf of the veteran, which, over time, ends up being the bulk of cost. Our veterans risked their lives to protect our country, and they deserve the best when they return home. It is unfortunate to me that our Federal Government cannot follow through with this commitment for even its own veteran employees. It is even more worrisome that these Federal agencies are putting off their responsibility, instead making their own employees—veteran employees—take the huge financial hit. With this legislation, we can support our veterans working in the Federal Government. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4431, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for interest payments by agencies in the case of administrative error in processing certain annuity deposits for prior military service or certain volunteer service, and for other purposes.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 5896, the Border Patrol Agent Pay Reform Amendments Act of 2018, introduced by my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HURD). b1930 The U.S. Border Patrol is vital to the Nation’s security interests. Border Patrol agents secure the international land border and the coastal waters of the United States. They protect the American public from dangerous people and dangerous materials. Previous human capital management systems at the agency resulted in uncertain hours and overtime pay abuses. In 2014, Congress passed the Border Patrol Agency Reform Act to create a new pay system. This new system was designed to help the Border Patrol meet its mission by increasing the number of hours worked by agents, providing more reliable schedules and paychecks for agents and saving taxpayers around $100 million, annually. Since enactment, several organizations have identified problems with the law’s implementation, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Office of Personnel Management, and the National Border Patrol Council. H.R. 5896 seeks to address some of these implementation changes. It gives the Border Patrol additional flexibility to meet its staffing needs at specific locations. It removes the disincentive for agents to receive advanced training by 
allowing them to incur an overtime debt in lieu of a decrease in pay and by raising the amount of training an agent can receive before the debt accrues. H.R. 5896 allows agents to apply compensatory time off accrued for travel toward the overtime debt. To prevent gaming the system, the bill retains limitations on overtime pay during an agent’s control period, which is the period of highest pay, generally just prior to retirement. However, the bill switches from the current system, where the CBP controls the agent’s schedule, to a method which lets the agent work any of these three pay levels, but with only a portion of their overtime pay computed into their retirement. The bill allows agents to take leave without pay, often used for fulfilling National Guard and Reserve training requirements, without incurring an overtime debt that they must make up, as they do under the current system. It allows Border Patrol agents at the level 2 and basic rates of pay to work compressed schedules, as they did prior to the 2014 pay system change. Agents will still work the required number of overtime hours ordered under the Border Patrol Agent Pay Reform Act. Finally, the bill makes a series of final changes resulting from OPM and CBP experiences in implementing the law. I would like to thank Representative HURD for his enormous work on this important legislation. In addition, I would like to thank the CBP, OPM, and the National Border Patrol Council for working with the committee to get the bill where it is today. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5896 would address issues that arose from implementation of the 2014 version of the bill by making technical and clarifying changes. The bill would require that newly hired workers receive the basic rate of pay until they complete initial training. It would also allow workers to elect to perform 90 or 100 hours per pay period and receive premium pay above their basic rate. This would help incentivize workers to move into these important positions. The bill would also remove the requirement that the agency limit a worker’s tour of duty to control retirement benefits. In exchange, it would limit the amount of overtime treated as retirementcredible basic pay during the period used to calculate annuities. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HURD), the sponsor of this bill. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Oklahoma yielding. Since the birth of our Nation, brave, selfless, and patriotic individuals have committed to putting their lives on the line to keep America safe, including along the border. No matter which side of the aisle you are on, there is no debating the fact that our selfless Border Patrol agents play a vital role in our national security. We, as lawmakers, owe a debt of gratitude to ensure our Border Patrol agents are treated fairly. As a Member of Congress who represents a district with over 800 miles of the southern border, I am all too aware of the daytoday dangers and obstacles our Border Patrol agents face. As a result of bureaucratic inefficiencies, many Border Patrol agents are not receiving the pay they have rightfully earned and, in some cases, are being forced to work dangerously long shifts to make up for the onerous and arcane regulations handed down to them from OPM. The purpose of the Border Patrol Agent Pay Reform Amendments Act of 2018 is to fix this broken system and allow our agents to receive the pay they have earned. I want to thank my colleagues on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee for recognizing the urgency of these problems and passing this bill with a voice vote in May. Additionally, I appreciate the willingness of Customs and Border Protection, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Border Patrol Council to sit down and work out an agreement on these pressing issues. I have to thank my colleagues MARTHA MCSALLY and F ILEMON VELA for their support and work on this piece of legislation. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5896, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
REQUIRING UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE TO ESTABLISH NEW ZIP CODES Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6846) to require the United States Postal Service to establish new ZIP codes, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6846 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
Not later than 270 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Postal Service shall designate a single, unique ZIP code for, as nearly as practicable, each of the following communities: (1) Miami Lakes, Florida. (2) Storey County, Nevada. (3) Flanders, Northampton, and Riverside in the Town of Southampton, New York. (4) Ocoee, Florida. (5) Glendale, New York. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 6846, introduced by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DIAZBALART ). The bill would require the United States Postal Service to establish new ZIP Codes in Miami Lakes, Florida; Ocoee, Florida; Storey County, Nevada; Glendale, New York; and Flanders, Northampton; and Riverside in the town of Southampton, New York. H.R. 756, the Postal Service Reform Act of 2017, which the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform reported earlier this Congress, would also have established these new ZIP Codes. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DIAZ BALART ) to tell us more about the need for a new ZIP Code in his district. Mr. DIAZBALART. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. Mr. Speaker, for nearly a decade, the town of Miami Lakes has attempted to receive a unique ZIP Code. This would help with auto insurance rates, branding, economic development, and, frankly, lead to less election confusion and census confusion. Despite this, the Postal Service has yet to take action, unfortunately. I will tell you this is an important priority for my constituents back home in Miami Lakes. In fact, just last week, Mr. Speaker, I received a call from a constituent asking about what was going on with this issue. He was asking for an update and was relaying his frustration because of his rising auto insurance rates. Thankfully, this legislation solves that problem. It grants Miami Lakes and others their own ZIP Codes. I would like to give credit and thanks to Miami Lakes Mayor Manny Cid. It has been a privilege to work with him. He has shown great perseverance and dedication, and I am glad that, together, we are able to make this happen. However, as everyone knows, the work is not finished. Last Congress, 
the House passed a nearly identical bill like this one today. Unfortunately, the Senate did not take it up. There is ample time to get this passed before the end of this Congress. So I implore my colleagues on the other side and the Senate to get this bill to the President for his signature. We will not rest until this bill gets to the President’s desk and it is signed into law. I want to again thank Chairman GOWDY for his help, and his committee staff as well. Also, I thank Speaker RYAN, Majority Leader M CCARTHY , and the whip, Mr. SCALISE , for their help. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, ZIP Codes organize the country to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of mail for millions of Americans. The postal service has the authority to establish ZIP Codes and adjust their boundaries based on changes in delivery and on volume and operational concerns. However, communities, businesses, and other local entities can also voice their concern with ZIP Code boundaries and request adjustments. This bill would require the Postal Service to establish new ZIP Codes for five communities that have each requested and been denied ZIP Code changes. These communities base their ZIP Code requests on concerns such as delay in mail delivery, emergency service response times, and the denial or inconsistent application of services to community members. These are important concerns and should be addressed accordingly. The Postal Service has worked with affected communities to find solutions, and I commend those efforts. This bill would require the ZIP Code changes requested by those communities. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ), my friend. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6846, which would create a new, unique ZIP Code for the hamlets of Flanders, Northampton, and Riverside, located in Suffolk County, New York, in my district. These three hamlets currently share the same ZIP Code with the nearby town of Riverhead, where there are at least 18 identical street names and 32 similar street names. This causes a number of issues, including the delay of mail and packages, which can hold important goods like medications. Shared street names can also delay the response for emergency and medical personnel in situations where every second counts. This could all be avoided by assigning a new and unique ZIP Code to Flanders, Northampton, and Riverside, which is why I have been working closely with committee and House leadership to ensure this important issue does not go unresolved. Last Congress, I brought thenOversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz to my district to hear from my constituents firsthand regarding how important this issue is to us. I then worked with Chairman Chaffetz to secure House passage last Congress, but, unfortunately, the Senate failed to act. I urge my colleagues in the House to pass this bill tonight, and I implore the Senate to take this bill up immediately. This legislation will have an immediate, ontheground, positive impact on the lives of so many of my constituents. I would like to thank, especially, Ron Fisher, chairman of the Flanders, Riverside, Northampton Citizens Advisory Council and president of the Flanders, Riverside, Northampton Community Association. I would also like to thank Vince Taldone and Vicki Farruggia from the Flanders, Riverside, Northampton Community Association. I thank the chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and his great staff. I appreciate their support and urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6846. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
b1945 REAL ID ACT MODIFICATION FOR FREELY ASSOCIATED STATES ACT Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3398) to amend the Real ID Act of 2005 to permit Freely Associated States to meet identification requirements under such Act, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3398 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘REAL ID Act Modification for Freely Associated States Act’’. 
(a) D EFINITION OF STATE .—Section 201(5) of the Real ID Act of 2005 (49 U.S.C. 30301 note; Public Law 109–13) is amended by striking ‘‘the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands,’’. (b) EVIDENCE OF LAWFUL STATUS .—Section 202(c)(2)(B) of the REAL ID Act of 2005 (49 U.S.C. 30301 note; Public Law 109–13) is amended— (1) in clause (viii), by striking ‘‘or’’ at the end; (2) in clause (ix), by striking the period at the end and inserting ‘‘; or’’; and (3) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(x) is a citizen of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or the Republic of Palau who has been admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant pursuant to a Compact of Free Association between the United States and the Republic or Federated States.’’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, 30 years ago, the United States solidified a unique international relationship by signing the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. Collectively, these three sovereign nations are referred to as the Freely Associated States. Under the Compact of Free Association, citizens from the Freely Associated States can live, work, and study in the United States as legal nonimmigrants without a need for a visa. In 2005, Congress enacted the Real ID Act, which enacted the 9/11 Commission’s recommendation to set Federal standards for driver’s license and other sources of identification. However, the Real ID Act of 2005 made no mention of the Freely Associated States or the compact. Instead, the law referred to ‘‘the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands,’’ a nowdefunct entity that ceased to exist in 1994. The former trusteeship predated the current self governing status of Freely Associated States as established under the Compact of Free Association. As a result of this error, citizens of the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau are often forced to settle for temporary driver’s licenses that expire after a year, costing these citizens access to work, housing, transportation, and other opportunities. Because some employers have been reluctant to hire or retain temporarylicensed carriers, many of these citizens lose access to work, housing, transportation, and other opportunities. The omission also greatly disadvantages these citizens to other nonimmigrants who are able to obtain standard licenses lasting up to 8 years, if they meet the Real ID Act eligibility requirements. H.R. 3398 corrects this drafting error in the Real ID Act. Fixing this error in 
the law clarifies the legal eligibility of the citizens of these three nations for fullterm driver’s licenses, honors the terms of our Compact of Free Association, and reaffirms our partnership with the three nations. I would like to thank Representative DONYOUNG , the gentleman from Alaska and my friend, for his work on this important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us would make a technical correction to the Real ID Act of 2005. The act incorrectly identified persons from the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau as citizens of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, an entity that has not existed since 1994. This error has caused citizens of these trust territories difficulties because they are often issued only temporary driver’s licenses. This, in turn, makes some employers reluctant to hire these citizens and makes it difficult for them to access government services. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, urge my colleagues to do so as well, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ), the sponsor of this bill. (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. RUSSELL and the minority member for their work on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3398 is a bill that should be passed. I strongly support it. I was listening to the testimony from the chairman, and he has put it so well, I probably won’t speak anymore. I do believe that what he said is all true. It is necessary. It is needed. This is something that was an oversight, because I was here when we wrote the original bill in 2005. It was an oversight, and the gentleman did a great job explaining it. This is needed for those citizens who we consider from Palau, Micronesia, and the other islands there, and we will do the work. I thank the gentleman again for his work. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. HANABUSA ). Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3398, the REAL ID Act Modification for Freely Associated States Act. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague and good friend from Alaska, Congressman DONYOUNG , for introducing this bill, which I proudly cosponsored. Through the Compact of Free Association, the United States and the Freely Associated States—the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau—agreed to the terms of our special and unique governmenttogovernment relationships. It is through these compacts that the citizens of the Freely Associated States can enter the U.S. to live, work, study, and visit indefinitely as legal nonimmigrants without visa, with guaranteed access to social and health services. In return, the U.S. has defense and certain other operating rights in the Freely Associated States, denial of access to the territory by other nations, and other agreements of strategic importance to the United States. The Freely Associated States’ citizens migrate to Hawaii and other places in the U.S. for many reasons, including but not limited to job and economic opportunities. Hawaii is one of the four recognized affected jurisdictions by the U.S. Government. Hawaii experiences the highest impact of FAS migrants. The other affected jurisdictions are Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. Based on the U.S. Census data for 2010 to 2014, the five States with the highest number of FAS citizens are Hawaii, with 17,205; Arkansas, with 3,625; Washington, with 3,430; Oregon, with 2,580; and Texas, with 2,090. Unfortunately, when Congress passed the Real ID Act in 2005, it used an obsolete reference to the Freely Associated States countries, specifically identifying them as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. As a result, when the Freely Associated States’ migrants seek to obtain a U.S. ID or license, they can only obtain a temporary license for 1 year, since they are legally noncitizens without an end date of their stay. This is extremely problematic when the migrants seek employment, and it further complicates our ability to accurately assess the size of the FAS citizen population. It is clear Congress intended to include the Freely Associated States’ citizen migrants under the Real ID Act, and I appreciate Congressman YOUNG ’s effort to correct the RECORD and end the ambiguity which keeps FAS citizens from fully and freely participating in our country and becoming selfsufficient members of our society. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to remind people why we even have these compacts. It is because the United States did do atomic bomb testing, nuclear testing, in this area. As a result, it has affected their health, their ability to retain and stay in their home countries, and the compacts give them free access. Hawaii is one of the most affected, and we carry a lot of the costs associated with the compacts, especially in the area of medical, education, and housing. So the ability to have these Real IDs, then, will facilitate the various migrants’ ability to actually seek jobs and have an equal footing in terms of economic opportunity. Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3398. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. CURTIS ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3398. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
NATIONAL RICE MONTH (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, this week, I joined rice farmers in Crowley, Louisiana, the rice capital of the world, to recognize National Rice Month. With more rice mills per square mile than anywhere else in America, the small town of Crowley was a fitting place to celebrate the beginning of the harvest for Americangrown rice. Rice is a part of our Southern culture and is a major agricultural commodity for Louisiana. There are more than 400,000 rice acres in Louisiana, generating over $700 million in economic output each year, supporting many thousands of Louisiana jobs. Rice farmers and farm families are solid Americans, and south Louisiana would not be what it is without rice. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a strong advocate of American rice, and I commend the nearly 125,000 Americans who work to provide this quality, nutritious crop to our Nation and the world. 
SUICIDE PREVENTION MONTH (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, September is Suicide Prevention Month, and almost every 12 minutes, an American dies by suicide. It is now the 10th leading cause of death in the United States of America. The Centers for Disease Control recently reported a 30 percent increase in suicide rates in the last 30 years, with nearly 45,000 Americans taking their own lives in 2016. Mr. Speaker, suicide is preventable. Increasing access to crisis resources saves lives. Mental and behavioral health research saves lives. Ending the stigma surrounding suicide and reaching out for help saves lives. On average, one person dies by suicide every 4 hours in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, according to 
research from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. There is no single cause of suicide, and suicide risk increases when several health factors and life stressors converge to create an experience of hopelessness and despair. But, together, we can reverse this course. By making mental healthcare, substance abuse treatment, and suicide prevention a national priority, we can reverse the tide on these deaths of despair. We will save lives, and we will do it together. 
COMBATING WILDFIRES IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Montana? There was no objection. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GARRETT ). 
Mr. GARRETT. Somewhere, Mr. Speaker, someone is watching what is going on in this Chamber. Even now, probably in a Nation of 320plus million, many someones are watching, and most of them don’t have a clue who I am, and that is okay. But the fact that most of them don’t have a clue who the lady pictured to my left, your right, is, is not okay. On April 23, 1951, in Prince Edward County, Virginia, at the R.R. Moton High School, a 16yearold student named Barbara Rose Johns strode onto a stage and implored her peers at this allAfrican American high school to assert their Godgiven rights of equality. I am honored today by the presence of Ms. Johns’ sister, Joan Johns, in the gallery. She is tickled when she speaks to me, which tickles me, because I am tickled when I speak to her. I told her earlier today, Mr. Speaker, that I was in love with her sister. It is interesting, because she is sitting with my wife. b2000 The reason that I say that is that I love America, and as a member of the State house, I had the honor of carrying legislation that made April 23 Barbara Johns Day in Virginia. The reason is that Barbara Johns’ story is a story that every American should know. Someone had the temerity to tell me, as I worked towards creating Barbara Johns Day, ‘‘That is Black history.’’ Mr. Speaker, it is not Black history or White history. It is American history. And America is not Black or White or brown. America is an idea. So when the Founders drafted the preamble to the Constitution and called for us to form a more perfect Union, the presence of the word ‘‘more’’ implied a perpetual duty. And the revolution that cast off an oppressive government from across an ocean against Great Britain is one that I would argue was perpetual, and that another hero of mine named Thomas Jefferson was a slave owner, certainly an imperfect man, who articulated near perfect ideas. Fastforward to April 23, 1951. Barbara Johns, with a clean and clear and bright mind, influenced by her teachers and her Uncle Vernon Johns, understood that rights are not given by government but by something bigger, and understood that the duty of a citizen and a free nation was to assert their Godgiven rights. So the idea of something as draconianly oppressive as separate but equal was intolerable. That day, she implored her students to walk out of Moton High School and the tar paper shacks and the leaking roofs and to demand equality not of outcomes, but of opportunity, because that is what America is supposed to be—without regard to gender, without regard to race, without regard to faith. Now, what that manifested itself in was a court case, Davis v. Prince Edward County. That court case was amalgamated into another case of which I hope that people have heard, Brown v. Board of Education. The difference between that case and every other case was that those were initiated by lawyers, and this case was initiated by a 16yearold girl who understood that the promise of liberty was not just to one group or another, that the American Revolution was perpetual, and that God had given her rights just like everyone else to be asserted as a citizen in a free society. The fact that people watching don’t know who I am is fine by me, but the fact that our students don’t understand that America is supposed to be not Black or White or brown, but an idea wherein all people are created equal with an opportunity to succeed based on their work and their merit, that is not okay. As a result, Mr. Speaker, we filed H.R. 5561, the Barbara Johns Congressional Gold Medal Act. Her efforts, without lauding herself, without patting herself on the back—indeed, going forth from this date and living a humble life as a wife and a librarian, as she aspired to—are the embodiment of the nameless faces of millions who sacrificed so that we can live in a country that seeks to employ an idea that is the greatest idea known to the history of free people. The civil rights movement is not a Black history story. It is not a White history story. It is an American history story. We are not a Black nation or a White nation. We are a nation built on an idea, and our students and our posterity need to understand that what makes us great is that this right fought for by people like this lady isn’t universal. So, Mr. Speaker, I hope that if the President is watching, he will file a Presidential Medal of Freedom; I hope that if Members or staff are watching, they will sign on to the Barbara Johns Congressional Gold Medal Act; and I hope that if students are watching, they will go to school tomorrow and tell their peers this is a country where people stood up so that we all have a chance to be that which we dream to be, because that is who Barbara Rose Johns was, and it is an American history story worth telling. WILDFIRES  
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring the Chamber’s attention to the wildfires that have devastated our country this year, consuming nearly 7.7 million acres across 12 States. This figure, however, doesn’t account for the lives tragically lost, the homes destroyed, or the livelihoods that went up in flames. This doesn’t account for the smoke from these wildfires that swept from many of our Western States into the Midwest, creating poor air quality. The House has passed measures to reduce the severity of our wildfires and improve the health of our forests. Last November, the House passed the Resilient Federal Forest Act, written by my friend from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN ). The legislation provides commonsense reforms that will benefit our forests, economy, and the environment. Conservationists, organizations, foresters, stakeholders, and local leaders throughout Montana recognize the need for reforms to get us managing our forests again. Unfortunately, the other Chamber, mired in obstruction, has not taken up the bill. The House, however, has not lost our focus, including critical forest management reforms into other legislation. Looking across the West and seeing the devastation of the wildfires this year, I know we can’t afford to wait. I am honored that many of my colleagues are joining me here tonight who recognize the threat of catastrophic wildfires and want to do something about them. I look forward to hearing from them. At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Utah, JOHNCURTIS . Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as thousands of Utahans in my district are returning to their homes after being evacuated due to wildfires that came within blocks of their homes. The Pole Creek fire and the Bald Mountain fire have engulfed over 100,000 acres of land and are still burning strong. It is a testament to our brave firefighters and our incredible 
community of volunteers that not a single life has been lost and property has been protected. Although this fire season has been one of the worst our State has ever seen, it has brought out the best in Utah. During the height of the Pole Creek and Bald Mountain fires, the Red Cross was overwhelmed. Now, Mr. Speaker, you might assume that that being overwhelmed came because of the 6,000 evacuees who needed a home. But, in reality, the Red Cross was overwhelmed because the list of people coming into the shelter offering homes was longer than the list of people needing homes. The Red Cross had to close shop. As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, I visited the Red Cross shelter and found a sign on the door that said, ‘‘Please, no more donations.’’ They had too many donations from Utahans. This is not the first time the Red Cross has had to close shop early. The people of Utah go out of their way to help others. As usual, Utah stepped up in the face of tragedy, and I plan to work to prevent future catastrophic events like this. Before I came to Congress, I was mayor for 8 years. I understand how overwhelming it can be to coordinate disaster response, recovery, and manage the daily operations of a community. In my district, many small towns and cities are overcome with challenges as they work out confusing jurisdictional responsibilities of the State and Federal Government, on top of actively rebuilding and preparing for the aftermath of the wildfires. To help in this effort, last week, I convened a group of mayors, county commissioners, State representatives, and emergency personnel so that local leaders could have direct access to the Federal Government, share resources, and prepare for what comes next. I stand committed to helping our communities obtain the resources they need to rebuild their homes, businesses, and prevent further damage. We can all agree that managing our forest is critical. While we won’t prevent every fire, we need forest management reforms to reduce the risk of fires. I have already started this discussion with my colleagues in Washington. Last week, I spoke with the interim Chief of the Forest Service, and today I met with Secretary Perdue, who oversees the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which includes the Forest Service. Both of these conversations focused on how to best manage our forests and prevent similar fires from happening in the future. As a member of the House Committee on Natural Resources, I look forward to advancing policies that protect lives and protect property throughout Utah. As we look ahead to preventing these catastrophic wildfires, let’s not forget the value of our local officials and their roles in forest management decisions. They know better than anyone the challenges they face in their own backyards. Should another fire strike, I am confident that Utahans will once again step up to the challenge and take care of our great State and the wonderful people in it. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah for his comments, and especially for his leadership on this important issue, bringing the knowledge of local government here to this House to help us deal with this devastating situation out west. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. PAUL GOSAR , for his comments on wildfires. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Montana for organizing this tonight. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring this Chamber’s attention to the multitude of wildfires that have devastated the Western United States. Now, Mr. Speaker, the West is on fire and has been on fire since April of this year. This has undoubtedly been one of the worst wildfire seasons in recent memory. Last month, more than 100 active fires scorched nearly 2 million acres, killed at least 12 people, and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage. As of today, more than 75 wildfires continue to burn throughout the United States. Wildfires are getting worse, in fact, in the United States just as they are getting better in more similarly advanced nations. A study published in Science last year found that the amount of acreage burning globally has declined by 25 percent over the past 18 years, irrespective of climate and temperature variability. The study’s findings point to daytoday human factors, especially land management, as the most consequential determinants of wildfire acreage burned. Substantial research and common sense continue to suggest that an imprudent combination of prematurely extinguished spontaneous small burns preventing controlled burns and limiting brush, hazardous fuel, and timber thinning to nearnegligible amounts is producing tinderboxlike conditions in our forests, conditions that overdetermine the eventual outcome of catastrophic wildfire. Our misguided land management assumptions, practices, and policies have ended up as a highly significant factor in ensuring our country’s experience with wildfires is worse than that of similarly situated peers. The sad truth is that mismanagement has left our forests vulnerable to insects and disease ripe for catastrophic wildfires. That is why the Western Caucus led efforts to pass a strong forestry title in the farm bill. The House base bill includes 10 categorical exclusions that allow for active management of our Nation’s forests and critical response. On September 13, a letter spearheaded by the Western Caucus from 40 bipartisan Members of the House was sent to the farm bill conferrees urging conferrees and leadership to include active forest management provisions in the final version of the farm bill. The base bill also reauthorizes the Landscape Scale Restoration Program. The first meaningful step that can be made to ensure that we can mitigate the frequency and intensity of wildfires next year is for the farm bill conference committee to include these forestry provisions within the final conference report. Otherwise, next year’s wildfires, sadly, may be larger than this year’s and will be the result of this Congress. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his principled approach to getting reform so we can start managing our forests again. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ), for his comments on wildfires. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership. I congratulate him on some great legislation that was passed out of the Natural Resources Committee earlier today, which I know will be extremely important to the citizens who are lucky to have him as their Representative. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here this evening. As vice chair of the Agriculture Committee and as a former chair of the House Forestry Subcommittee and a proud member of the Western Caucus—I always say I am on the eastern frontier of the Western Caucus, being from Pennsylvania, but we have the same issues. We really do. I have a national forest, one of the more profitable national forests in the country, but facing a lot of the issues: rural communities, school districts that are dependent on secure rural schools, and just so many issues—energy production, development—and so I am proud to be here this evening on an issue that is incredibly important, an issue that impacts the lives of so many and heavily impacts our Western States. I am honored to represent Pennsylvania, obviously, and as some have described our forest, Mr. Speaker, as asbestos forest in Pennsylvania, probably because of the 90somethousand miles of streams that we have. We have plenty of moisture. I wish we could put a bunch of that water in a pipeline and sell it to you. We would send it your direction. But as it is, while the devastating impact on our forests is invasive species—that is a subject for another evening—I can tell you, when the wildfires occur in States such as Utah, Montana, Colorado, and throughout the West, California, these devastating wildfires, there is a large sucking sound, as I like to describe it, out of my national forest, and it comes in the form of resources, money that is taken away because of the necessity that I support of having to fight those fires. 
b2015 We also have personnel that are deployed out of my national forest. So that means that our timber, the money for our timber marketing, and harvesting, and the multiuse comes almost to a screeching halt. So I am pleased with the leadership that we have done, in both the Natural Resources Committee and the Agriculture Committee, to address this issue. As vice chair of the Agriculture Committee, I am proud of the Forestry Title of the House farm bill. It contains a number of reforms intended to provide the Forest Service and our private foresters with more authorities and flexibilities to help better manage; that is both in increasing timber production, but it is also in managing a forest that is healthy and, therefore, managing the understory, the fuel load that has built up over decades of mismanagement. By providing new authorities and encouraging new timber markets, we do that in a number of ways, Mr. Speaker. The bill encourages active forest management. We reauthorize the Landscape Scale Restoration Program, and that allows for more partnerships to tackle critical challenges such as forest health, and wildfires, as well as drinking water protection. The bill supports, in many ways, these types of initiatives but, specifically, on the wildfires, Mr. Speaker. Over the past 2 decades, wildfires have been an increasing challenge for the Forest Service as costs have skyrocketed to fight them. Since 1995, the Forest Service’s annual wildfire budget has increased from 13 percent of the budget to nearly 60 percent of the budget, Mr. Speaker. Last year was the costliest fire year on record, with the Forest Service spending $2.4 billion in 2017 alone. Year after year, the agency runs out of fire funding, forcing it to draw additional funds from nonfire accounts and other forests, national forests, including to cover basic operational and forest management funds that pay for timbering, and research activities, and even proactive fire prevention. Unfortunately, this occurs because the Forest Service has been unable to access additional funding when the fire funds runs out due to a budget cap. Now, finally, the 2018 omnibus included a ‘‘fire borrowing fix’’ by creating a wildfire cap adjustment, which will treat wildfires like any other natural disasters; just like we saw down in the Carolinas with Hurricane Florence. Now this change will free up the Forest Service to fight wildfires and do so without transferring funds from non fire accounts. These are accounts that help to prevent fires with restorative cuts, and managing the understory, dealing with the fuel load, the standing dead timber because of, perhaps, disease. For forests around the Nation, especially in the East, this will mean more funding for other essential activities such as management, timbering, and even recreation and research activities. Now, along with fixing the budget cap, the omnibus currently provides the Forest Service with new management authorities, and these reforms are specifically intended to help the Forest Service better manage and proactively prevent forest fires from breaking out. Specifically, these new authorities will streamline the environmental analysis, reduce litigation, and provide timber harvest contract certainty. Some of these reforms include, within our proposed farm bill—which we are in conference in right now, and we need the Senate to realize these improvements were based on the successes we had in the last farm bill, which has really helped our forest products industry, our timber industry, helped make our forests more healthy; and when they are healthy, they are more resilient to wildfires. So it includes: Categorical Exclusions for Wildfire Resilience Projects; Healthy Forest Restoration Act inclusion of Fire and Fuel Breaks; 20year Stewardship Contracts; Cottonwood Reform; Fire Hazard Mapping Initiative; Fuels Management for Protection of Electric Transmission Lines; and Good Neighbor Authority Road Amendment. Forest fires do not recognize or respect boundaries. If they start in a national forest, they are going to wind up in State forests, they are going to wind up on private property land. So we are doing all the right things. I am very pleased, and we need to do this. When I look at the communities, such as the ones that the gentleman from Montana represent, as a result of wildfires, we see a loss of life; we see a loss of homes; a loss of the economy; a loss of the taxpayerowned assets, whether it is national forests or State forests; and certainly a loss of assets for those private property owners that have forests. So I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this topic and issue, and I really appreciate his managing this Special Order this evening on a very important topic of wildfires. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, especially that he is a member of the Western Caucus joining us there, and pointing out the national implications of the massive wildfires we have out west on resources back east; on the forests that you have in Pennsylvania and the resources there. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Nationwide impact. Mr. GIANFORTE. The gentleman mentioned many of the things that— the livelihoods, the lives. You know, the other thing that we often neglect is the amount of smoke that is discharged into the air and the effect on people with asthma and other lung issues. I am sure many, many have died as a result in our communities, so it is a public safety issue as well. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. It really is. Mr. Speaker, our watersheds, most of our water sources start—many of them start in national forests. They are certainly in forests, but a lot of national forests. And with wildfires, you create a situation where there is no stability in the soils. And so where these wonderful trout streams, streams that support life, support communities, support families with clean water, these wildfires, they basically caramelize that soil so that, essentially, the flash flooding, the runoffs, it puts all these solids within those streams, it creates turbidity, the solids, the nutrients that go in there. So the impact of wildfires, as the gentleman said, it is the land, it is the air and, quite frankly, it is the water, and that is why we have to do a better job of preventing these wildfires to start with. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his comments. This past summer, nearly 7.7 million acres have burned across America. Wildfires consumed thousands of acres in Glacier National Park. The Howe Ridge Fire in Glacier National Park consumed over 14,000 acres. I was there. I saw the devastation. It destroyed homes on the shores of Lake McDonald. These are historic national buildings, lost to fire. Last year in Glacier National Park as well we lost Sperry Chalet, which also had historic value and had created memories for thousands of tourists who had visited that facility. Our courageous firefighting efforts did save the main Wheeler cabin, with great effort. It even threatened the GoingtotheSun Road. I met with the incident commanders there and the brave firefighters at the Howe Ridge Fire. Last summer, we saw similar behavior. Nearly 8.5 million acres burned in our country last year. In Montana alone, last summer, Mr. Speaker, we lost 1.25 million acres. Just to put that in perspective, 1.2 million acres is the equivalent of the entire State of Delaware, burned in Montana last summer. And I saw the destruction firsthand. I was on five of these fires, visiting with the incident commanders, and seeing devastation. In one county alone, we burned 270,000 acres, and we had over 60,000 cattle with no grass. Fortunately, we were able to work with the Department of the Interior to get retired grazing allotments in the C.M. Russell opened up to fill that need for those ranchers, but those livelihoods were suspended. The habitats were destroyed. Smoke hangs in the air. My own driveway in Bozeman, Montana, on mornings when the fires are burning the worst, we come out to cars covered with ash that we have to brush off before we can drive them. The air quality is dangerous and unhealthy. 
And even where there weren’t fires, we saw smoke from the tragic, destructive California fires that filled our skies in Montana. As bad as the wildfires have been, I have seen the impact of properly managed forests. This year, when I was at the Glacier National Park fire, it was interesting to me, as the incident commanders explained what they were doing there. It turns out there were four fires being managed, all started by the same lightning storm, through lightning strikes. Three of those fires started in national forests where there had been hazardous fuel reductions. The forest had been managed. One started in a national park, and it was such a stark example to me to see that the three fires that had been started by the same storm in the national forests where there had been hazardous fuel reduction, on the day I was there, had been constrained to two to 300 acres each. And yet, the one that started in a national park was burning over 10,000 acres. Now I am not advocating to go log our national parks, just to be very clear. But it is a stark example of the impact. I have been in eastern Montana, southeast of Miles City, and I have seen where the BLM has done forest management. I saw a situation where a fire had burned through a landscape and, in an area where there had been no forest management, no fuels reduction, no thinning of the forest, the fire burned so hot that, even years later, it still looked like a moonscape. Nothing was growing. And yet, when it hit the managed forest, where the forest had been thinned, the fire quickly dropped into the underbrush, burned the grass and twigs, but not a single tree was lost. A year later, that forest was healthier than it was, and yet, the forest that had burned completely will not recover in our generation. This is a stark example. In other areas, where forest management has been done, where trees have been thinned, the water comes back into the streams again, the surface water. These are healthier habitats. So there are many benefits of a properly managed forest. We get more wildlife. There is more habitat. There is more opportunity for sportsmen and women. We have more recreational opportunities. You can gain access to the forests again. We have goodpaying timber jobs. Wildfires are less severe, and the health of our communities are not threatened. One of the biggest problems is litigation. We need more collaborative projects, but litigation is one of the greatest obstacles to managing our forests. A good example is the Stonewall Vegetation Project in Lincoln, Montana. I toured that site. It took 8 years to get a permit to thin the forest, and then the lawyers swooped in, arguing the project would disrupt lynx habitat. A judge overturned the permit, and that summer, that entire forest burned. And, Mr. Speaker, there is no lynx habitat anymore. There is no habitat for any animal there because that forest is gone. The House did take action this past year. We passed the Resilient Federal Forests Act that Congressman WESTERMAN of Arkansas authored and I cosponsored. It would get us back into our forests, managing them again. Unfortunately, the Senate, tied up with obstruction, didn’t act on it. But we have made progress. Back earlier this spring, we overturned the Cottonwood decision, which has been used as a tool to invalidate existing forest management permits. We have been cutting red tape to accelerate the removal of hazardous fuels. The Forest Service estimates that 6.3 billion dead and dying trees are across 11 States. I know in my own home State, in our State capital, Helena, Montana, if you drive west into the Lewis and Clark Forest, you can look at a hillside and, in some cases, because the forests have not been managed and they have overgrown, nearly 90 percent of the trees are standing. It is a tinderbox waiting to go up in flames. We have also reformed how we pay for catastrophic fires. This was fixed also earlier this year, through legislation in this House, and it was signed into law, that will allow us to treat large fires just like we do large hurricanes when they exceed budgets, because the cost of these fires has expanded so much, it is consuming the majority of the U.S. Forest Service budget. Mr. Speaker, last year, forest firefighting costs consumed 55 percent of the Forest Service budget. b2030 That takes away money for trail maintenance and recreational programs. It is consumed in fighting these fires. We have also added some provisions to the farm bill which is now in conference, adding Good Neighbor Authorities, extending that capability for categorical exclusions down to county commissioners and local government so that they can be involved in making our forests healthier. We have also provided for expedited salvage operations so we can cut dead and dying trees at landscape size without the frivolous litigation shutting down these projects. Mr. Speaker, it is time to act. We can’t control the weather, but we can control how we manage our forests. It is time to reform how we manage our forests by passing commonsense forest management reform. We need to reduce the severity of the wildfires. We need to get our forests healthy again. This is good for wildlife. It is good for recreationists. It is good for hunting. It creates goodpaying jobs in our mills. Montana can’t afford for Congress to continue kicking the can down the road and let important projects be tied up in unnecessary, frivolous litigation. This is an urgent issue, and we need to address it quickly. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues bringing to the attention of this Chamber the wildfires and the need for forest management reform. The House has offered commonsense solutions to get us back to managing our forests. The evidence shows that a properly managed forest is a healthier forest. We have less severe wildfires. I have seen this firsthand in the field. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the efforts of Mr. WESTERMAN , who has been a leader on the issue and a forester by training, and my colleagues who know the destruction of a catastrophic wildfire brings us to know how critical it is to deliver meaningful reforms. Like my colleagues, I urge the Senate to act on commonsense measures this Chamber has sent so that Montanans can spend the summer in their forests enjoying them, not having to breathe them at home. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET , Washington, DC. Mr. Speaker, I hereby submit for printing in the Congressional Record a revision to the allocations set forth in the Statement of Committee Allocations, Aggregates, and Other Budgetary Levels for Fiscal Year 2019 published in the Congressional Record on May 10, 2018 pursuant to section 30104 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–123). The revision is for new budget authority and outlays for provisions designated for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism and program integrity initiatives pursuant to section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), contained in the conference report to accompany H.R. 6157, the Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019. The Statement of Committee Allocations, Aggregates, and Other Budgetary Levels for Fiscal Year 2019 set the base discretionary 302(a) allocation to the Committee on Appropriations at $1.244 trillion, which is the sum of the fiscal year 2019 discretionary spending limits under section 251(c) of BBEDCA. Section 251(b) of BBEDCA allows for adjustments to the discretionary spending limits for certain purposes including Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, disaster relief, and program integrity initiatives. The conference report to accompany H.R. 6157 contains $67.9 billion in budget authority for Overseas Contingency Operations/ Global War on Terrorism and $1.9 billion in budget authority for program integrity initiatives. Accordingly, I am revising the allocation of spending authority to the House Committee on Appropriations. After making this adjustment, the conference report to accompany H.R. 6157 is within the fiscal year 
2019 discretionary spending limits under section 251(c) of BBEDCA, in addition to the aggregates and the 302(a) allocation to the Committee on Appropriations established by the Statement of Committee Allocations, Aggregates, and Other Budgetary Levels for Fiscal Year 2019 filed on May 10, 2018. Budget enforcement provisions of H. Con. Res. 71 (115th Congress) have been deemed to be in force by section 30104(f) of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. This revision represents an adjustment for purposes of enforcing sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. For the purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, these revised aggregates and allocations are to be considered as aggregates and allocations included in the budget resolution, pursuant to the Statement published in the Congressional Record on May 10, 2018, as adjusted. Sincerely, STEVE WOMACK , Chairman.
