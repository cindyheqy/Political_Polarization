Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ex-press my support for H.R. 1698, the Iran Bal-listic Missiles and International Sanctions En-forcement Act. I was proud to cosponsor this critical legislation, and support it during con-sideration by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and would have voted for it on the floor, but had to leave Washington in order to attend a funeral service. This legislation makes it clear that the United States will not tolerate Iran’s develop-ment of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. It authorizes sanctions against Iran for develop-ment of these weapons, as well as foreign in-dividuals and entities which provide aid to Iran in the development of such weapons. Further development of these weapons poses a threat to Israel, to our allies and part-ners in the Persian Gulf, and threatens to fur-ther destabilize the region. Additionally, failure to curb Iran’s development of ballistic missiles could undermine the international effort to end Iran’s nuclear weapons program under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. I was proud to support this critical bipartisan effort, and would have proudly voted for it had I been present. f

HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 27, 2017 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Seth and Jennifer Evans, of Lenox, Iowa for being named 2016 Master Pork Producers by the Iowa Pork Producers Association. Seth and Jennifer were presented the award earlier this year at the Iowa Pork Congress Banquet in Des Moines. They operate a 600- head sow farm and farrow-to-finish swine busi-ness. Currently, they market 13,000 head of swine from their own business a year. In addi-tion to hogs, they maintain a 60-head cow/calf herd of Angus and Angus-Simmental cross cattle. Seth and Jennifer are also active mem-bers of their community, coaching youth sports and serving as board members at various local organizations. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent lead-ers like the Seth and Jennifer in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize them today for this outstanding ac-complishment. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Seth and Jennifer for re-ceiving this award and in wishing them nothing but continued success.

CIVIL RIGHTS 
SPEECH OF  
HON. MARCIA L. FUDGE 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 23, 2017 Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend Rep. V
EASEY for hosting tonight’s special order. Let me begin by offering my condolences to the families of Sgt. La David Johnson and his fellow soldiers who lost their lives in Niger. Those who give their lives in the service of this great nation and their families deserve our honor, respect and thanks. The White House’s treatment of Sgt. Johnson’s Gold Star widow is an embarrassment to our nation. Furthermore, the White House’s attacks on Congresswoman F
REDERICA WILSON ’s char- acter are baseless and shameful. I know Con-gresswoman W
ILSON as a woman of integrity who has proven her deep commitment to her constituents and community over the years. Mr. Speaker, I stand today with my col-leagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to share a concern about the leaked FBI’s as-sessment creating a new class of threats and unjustly labeling ordinary Americans exercising their constitutional rights as extremists. In the report, the FBI coins a new term— black identity extremists—which can easily give the perception that African Americans speaking out against police brutality or anyone who identifies as black for that matter is a threat to law enforcement. I can’t help but wonder, what led the FBI to reach such a conclusion. Was it the Facebook ads purchased by Russian operatives tar-geting the Black Lives Matter movement? This type of mischaracterization is dan-gerous and further erodes the trust between law enforcement officials and communities of color. We have seen this before. The FBI has a long and troubling history of targeting African Americans in this country. In the 1960s, the FBI’s Counter Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO) was used to surveil and discredit civil rights activists fighting insti-tutional racism, including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and black members of Congress. These activists were fighting for equality, ac-cess to the ballot box, educational opportuni-ties, and decent housing. They no longer wanted to be treated as second-class citizens. Put simply, they were seeking an even playing field and equal treatment under the law as should be provided to every American. Here we are sixty years later, and we con-tinue to fight for the same rights. We have seen it play out in the unrest that unfolded in communities like Ferguson, Balti-more, and Cleveland where those who are being paid to protect and serve are not held accountable for killing unarmed African Amer-ican citizens. This report makes clear that we have harkened back to the dark days of J. Edgar Hoover. COINTELPRO 2.0 undermines the progress we have made and continues the current Administration’s disturbing trend of de-monizing communities of color. At some point, Members on both sides of the aisle must stand up and speak out against these efforts to mischaracterize actions of Americans fighting for a fairer and more just America. We all have rights under the Constitution, and no American seeking equal treatment under the law should be unfairly labeled when exercising those rights. f

Bonny began her work at the Taylor County Courthouse in September of 1973 while she was still a senior at Bedford High School. For seven years, she worked in the Treasurer’s of-fice before moving to the County Auditor’s of-fice. In 1999, Bonny was appointed as county auditor. She has worked on everything from secretary duties to the board of supervisors, election-day preparation, passport services and tax statements. She stated in the Bedford Times-Press that ‘‘I loved working there and loved the rush of working with people all day long.’’ Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent Iowans like Bonny in the United States Con-gress and it is with great pride that I recognize her today for her outstanding service.

CONGRATULATING THE HONORABLE KEN SALAZAR 
HON. JARED POLIS 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 27, 2017 Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, trailblazer, pioneer, true Coloradoan. These are just a few phases that describe the Honorable Ken Salazar. A native of San Luis Valley, Secretary Salazar has always been true to his Colorado roots and values. Working tirelessly for others and the environment, Secretary Salazar’s legacy will abide for generations to come. Secretary Salazar grew up on a rural ranch, learning to read and write by the light of oil lamps. No stranger to hard work, he pursued a varied education attending Colorado Col-lege, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in po-litical science in 1977, and law degree from the University of Michigan Law School. Later Salazar was awarded honorary degrees from Colorado College and the University of Den-ver. 1986 marked Secretary Salazar’s first ap-pointment in politics. Serving as Gov. Romer’s Director of Natural Resources, Salazar worked towards petroleum and mining reforms to bet-ter protect the surrounding environment. Secretary Salazar was elected as Colorado Attorney General in 1998 and handily won re-election in 2002. As Attorney General, he was awarded the prestigious Conference of West-ern Attorneys General Profile in Courage award for his work. In 2004, Secretary Salazar ran for U.S. Sen-ate and won. Salazar was a leading member of a bipartisan group of Senators that devel-oped the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which would have provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immi-grants and increased funding for border secu-rity. Secretary Salazar’s Senate record is reflec-tive of his passion for justice and environ-mental protections. He fought to limit natural gas drilling in western Colorado alongside Sen. U
DALL and his brother, Congressman Jon Salazar. Secretary Salazar worked in the Sen-ate to give benefits to Rocky Flats workers. In 2009, President Obama appointed Sala-zar as Secretary of the Interior. As one of two Hispanics serving in the cabinet, Secretary Salazar worked to ensure our national parks and monuments were inclusive to minority communities and America’s tribal commu-nities. During his time as Secretary, Salazar suc-cessfully developed and implemented numer-ous renewable energy initiatives on public lands and helped lead the Obama Administra-tion’s ‘‘all of the above’’ energy strategy. I am honored to know Secretary Salazar as a colleague, but even more as a friend. On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, I want to congratulate Secretary Salazar on his induction in the Latino Hall of Fame. f 
A TRIBUTE TO LYNNETTE YOSSI 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 27, 2017 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Lynnette Yossi of Dallas Center, Iowa for being named the 2016 Grimes Educator of the Year at the Grimes Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner and Awards Ceremony earlier this year. The Educator of the Year award recognizes a local teacher who has exemplified what ex-cellence in teaching looks like. Lynnette is the Physical Education teacher at South Prairie Elementary School in the Dallas Center- Grimes Community School District. Lynnette has found that creating games around books helps the children learn while also staying en-gaged in physical activity. Each school day Lynnette stands at the main entrance to greet children and their families as they are dropped off, providing a smiling face to open the door, help direct traffic, and ensure everyone arrives and departs the school safely. Mr. Speaker, I’m proud to represent dedi-cated teachers like Lynnette in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize her today. I ask that my col-leagues in the United States House of Rep-resentatives join me in congratulating Lynette for this outstanding accomplishment and in wishing her nothing but continued success.

HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 27, 2017 Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Baha´’i community as they celebrate the two-hundredth anniversary of the birth of their founder, Baha´’u’lla´h. I am proud that Wilmette, Illinois, in my dis-trict, is home to the Baha´’i House of Worship for North America. This magnificent temple stands as a beautiful testament to the power and strength of Baha´’u’lla´h’s teachings. Two centuries after the birth of Baha ´’u’lla´h, millions around the world remain committed to his teachings of peace and the oneness of hu-manity. In almost every country in the world, members of the Baha’i faith congregate to cel-ebrate the values of unity and equality which are central to their religion. These values are more important than ever today, a time when we all need to come together to oppose those who promote intolerance, division, and bigotry. Although the Baha´’i faith teaches and prac-tices peace, many of its members face perse-cution and violence around the world. As I congratulate the members of the Baha ´’i com- munity in my district and around the world while they celebrate this important anniver-sary, I also reaffirm my commitment to stand-ing with them against threats to freedom of re-ligion. f

Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of my friend, Lou Mervis, a business, education, and philanthropic leader, who passed away earlier this month at the age of 83. Lou came from a humble background and turned his father’s local scrap business into one of the largest family-owned scrap proc-essing companies in the country, with loca-tions in multiple states. However, Lou’s legacy in Illinois goes beyond his business success. Education was one of Lou’s passions. He was elected to the Danville school board at age 29, and served two terms on the board, including as president. He also served on the Illinois State Board of Election for 17 years, in-cluding seven years as chairman. Lou and his wife, Sybil, provided scholar-ships and support to programs at several col-leges and universities, including the University of Illinois, Indiana University, and Danville Area Community College. His family has fund-ed 92 scholarships to DACC students, and four scholarships at Indiana University.

IN RECOGNITION OF DOMINIC FUCILE, PRESIDENT OF HANAC HARMONY JVL INNOVATIVE SEN-IOR CENTER 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 27, 2017 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to my dear friend and previous staff member, Dominic Fucile, as he receives the Volunteer of the Year award at the Hellenic-American Neigh-borhood Action Committee’s (HANAC) Forty- Fifth Annual Gala. Dominic has truly made his community a better place to live. Founded in 1972, HANAC provides social services to communities in need throughout New York City. HANAC focuses on the imple-mentation and administration of services to benefit communities throughout the city. Serv-ing over 30,000 clients annually, HANAC sup-ports unemployed families, children, senior citizens, and those struggling with substance abuse. I started my career in public service working at HANAC, and I know firsthand that the work they do makes a huge difference in people’s lives. From housing to ESL classes to social services, HANAC does an out-standing job of helping New Yorkers. I am so pleased that HANAC is recognizing the remarkable work of Dominic Fucile. I first came to know Dominic in 1992 when I was running for Congress. He is one of the kindest, most considerate, genuine people I have ever known. I was proud to hire him as my Queen’s representative and sad when he retired from my employ. But in truth, Dominic never stopped working in the community. He has always given generously of his time, with warmth, humor and charm. Dominic’s work as president of the HANAC Harmony JVL Innovative Senior Center (HANAC Senior Center) advisory council is an invaluable component of the work that the Center does. From organizing monthly dance nights to expanding arts and health services at HANAC Senior Center, Dominic works tire-lessly to provide activities and programs that all members will enjoy. His strong managerial and organizational skills have led to the ex-pansion of programs for the benefit of resi-dents at George T. Douris Tower. Deeply re-spected by other members of HANAC Senior Center, Dominic has been instrumental in at-tracting people to the senior center. They know it is a place they will have fun and where they will be greeted warmly and made to feel welcome. His enthusiasm, selflessness and hard work make him a most deserving re-cipient of the Volunteer of the Year award. Dominic dedicated his life to serving the people around him. As a former congressional staffer and a longtime employee of the United Nations, Dominic has demonstrated an unwav-ering commitment to public service and the betterment of his community. In addition to the countless hours Dominic has volunteered with HANAC, Dominic also co-founded the 29th Street Block Association to address quality of life issues in his Astoria neighborhood. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the many accomplishments of Dominic Fucile, a man who has truly devoted himself to his community and his neighbor-hood. f

The Large Business of the Year Award rec-ognizes an outstanding community business with over 10 employees.

TRIBUTE TO ASSEMBLYWOMAN SHARON QUIRK-SILVA, THE IRVINE CITY COUNCIL, FIVEPOINT AND THE ORANGE COUNTY VETERANS MEMORIAL PARK FOUNDATION 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 27, 2017 Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few moments today to honor Assemblywoman Sharon Quirk-Silva, the Irvine City Council, FivePoint, and the Orange County Veterans Memorial Park Foundation for their contributions to the Orange County Veteran Community. These organizations have paved the long and tiresome road to establish the Southern California Veterans Memorial Park in EL TORO, Irvine, California. Their combined ef-forts have produced an ideal final resting place for our Nation’s Veterans that our Or-ange County residents can be proud of. In 2014, Assemblywoman Quirk-Silva intro-duced AB–1453, which marks the beginning of the journey to established a Veteran Cemetery in Orange County. Through Assemblywoman Quirk-Silva’s efforts and relentless advocacy, the bill gained the support of various State legislators. AB–1453 was approved and signed by Governor Brown on September 27, 2014, just months after Assemblywoman Quirk-Silva introduced the bill. The Irvine City Council pressed forward by diligently searching for a proper location for the veteran cemetery within the Old Marine Corps Air Station, El Toro, which is of great significance to Vietnam-era Veterans. After much debate over the location, the council agreed on an ideal site, proposed by the FivePoint Company. The council’s leadership and resolve would be instrumental in helping pass the necessary resolutions to move for-ward on the Veterans Cemetery. The contributions made by FivePoint should also not go unknown. Fivepoint helped facili-tate the selection of a pristine site for the vet-eran cemetery by proposing a land exchange deal with the Irvine City Council. Fivepoint’s unyielding support for the veteran community and the county illustrates their belief of being a community based cooperation. Finally, the Orange County Veterans Memo-rial Park Foundation, comprised of Korean and Vietnam War Veterans, was instrumental throughout the early conception of a Veterans Cemetery in Orange County. The relentless advocacy, collaboration, and achievements by Bill Cook, Zeke Hernandez, Brian Chuchua, Peter Katz, and Robert Brower will be a testa-ment to their commitment to one another and the veteran community. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize the groups of individuals that have fought to es-tablish a proper final resting place for our Na-tion’s Veterans and the positive impact they have made on the Orange County Community.
