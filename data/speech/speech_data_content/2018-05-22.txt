Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, shooting swimming caribou from a motorboat, bear baiting, dogs for black bears, using artificial light, shooting wolf pups and bear cubs in their dens are outrageous practices that were banned under a 2015 rule from the Obama administration, which the Trump administration has now announced that it seeks to reverse. This is absolutely outrageous. Our national parks and reserves have always had special status, and the Trump administration wants to roll that back, essentially making them into game parks. It is important for people to reflect on what this means. Think about what goes on in Yosemite National Park or Yellowstone National Park. Would that experience be enriched by having these extreme hunting tactics to eliminate some of the topline predators to be able to have more things to hunt? Absolutely not. Three hundred million people a year visit these national parks, and the draw is the wildlife. National parks without animals is just scenery. Mr. Speaker, it is important that people focus on why this is such an outrageous policy. These are lowdensity animals with low reproductive rates. In Alaska, there is no conflict with livestock. They have very little interaction with people, other than the people who want to see them. Mr. Speaker, it is wrong on three fundamental levels. First of all, it is just wrong. All animals suffer, and hunting them down with these extreme methods is cruel and is repugnant to virtually all Americans. It is wrong ecologically. For millions of years, we have seen these animals coexist, and the national parks—like Yosemite or what is happening in Alaska—are some of the few places where that ecological balance continues to work. Human beings cannot improve upon it; they can only damage that delicate balance. It is also wrong economically. The economic impact for gateway communities, for these 300 million tourists, is profound. If we are going to turn these national treasures simply into game parks, hunting preserves, they are going to lose their allure, the economic impact will be dramatically diminished, as well as upsetting the ecological balance, and the fact that it is morally wrong. What we should be doing, in this Congress, is raising our voices in outrage over the latest attempt by the Trump administration to roll back sensible, commonly supported protections. And while we are at it, not just raising our voices, but maybe taking some action on the floor of this House on animal protection. We have the animal cruelty PACT Act that has 282 cosponsors, which could be on the floor Monday. The House Republican leadership has refused to act on the PACE Act, the Parity in Animal Cruelty Enforcement Act, which just got 359 votes on the floor of the House with an amendment. Dog and Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act, 246 cosponsors. The Pet and Women Safety Act, 248 cosponsors. The Shark Finning Prohibition Act, 238 cosponsors. The Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers, providing service animals for our veterans, has a majority of sponsors in the House of Representatives. Why can’t the Republican leadership allow us to debate and pass these provisions to improve animal welfare and add our voices to the latest outrage of the Trump administration in its assault on our animal friends? f 
2020 CENSUS AND ILLEGAL ALIENS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BROOKS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend Alabama citizens’ right to fair representation and equal apportionment under the United States Constitution. In some recent censuses, the Census Bureau counted illegal aliens, and indications are they will count illegal aliens again in the 2020 census. This potentially illegal practice puts Alabama at significant risk of losing a congressional seat when the 2020 census reapportionment occurs for the 2022 elections. 
For this reason, the State of Alabama and I have filed suit in Federal District Court for the Northern District of Alabama against the United States Department of Commerce and the Census Bureau to require them to exclude illegal aliens when they conduct the 2020 census. Specifically, the State of Alabama and I challenge the legality of the Department of Commerce’s residence rule, which counts everyone, including illegal aliens, in America’s population count. If the roughly 15 million illegal aliens in America—no one knows for sure how many there are—were dispersed throughout the United States in equal proportion to each State’s population, then no State would be disadvantaged in congressional representation and this discrimination issue would be moot. However, the difference in illegal alien population between States is dramatic. According to Department of Homeland Security 2014 estimates, 46 percent of America’s illegal aliens live in just three States. California, with the greatest concentration of illegal aliens, estimated at 2.9 million, has roughly four more Congressmen due to apportionment that counts illegal aliens. Reapportionment of House seats and electoral votes is a zerosum proposition: one State’s gain is another State’s loss. With an estimated 65,000 illegal aliens, Alabama citizens, and citizens of many other States as well, lose proportional representation because of various open borders policies of some States. The exact effects of the illegal alien population on the apportionment of Congressmen is complex based on the Method of Equal Proportions formula that is used to minimize the percentage difference in population per Congressman. But one thing is clear: Simulations of the apportionment process, using current population projections, suggest Alabama is at great risk of losing a congressional seat if the Census Bureau counts illegal aliens. As with anything in the United States Constitution, the census should be read, understood, and strictly administered according to its original intent. The 14th Amendment protects the rights of citizens to fair and equal representation. Any deviation in this process threatens the right of each American citizen to fair and equal representation in Congress. We cannot allow a small number of States to cheat the rest of America by promoting illegal immigration and then, as a reward for their lawless conduct, to receive greater proportional representation in Congress and the electoral college. Mr. Speaker, the question is clear: Should congressional representation be based on the number of American citizens or expanded to include the number of illegal aliens? I cannot speak for anyone else in Washington, D.C., but for me. And, as for me, I side with American citizens, not illegal aliens and illegal conduct. America is a Republic, and the essence of being a Republic is respect for the right of American citizens to equal protection and equal influence over congressional elections. Any attempt by the Census Bureau to undermine American citizens’ equal protection and equal influence over congressional elections must be opposed. That is exactly what the State of Alabama and I are doing by filing this action on behalf of Alabama citizens. 
NO MORE MOMENTS OF SILENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, Glenda Perkins; Cynthia Tisdale; Kimberly Vaughan; Shana Fisher; Angelique Ramirez; Christian Riley Garcia; Jared Black; Sabika Sheikh; Christopher Jake Stone; and Aaron Kyle McLeod. Mr. Speaker, those are the 10 names of the people killed at Santa Fe High School in Texas last Friday. Two were teachers; eight were students. All were violently torn away from their loved ones and their pathways to bright futures way too soon. As usual, the elected officials have expressed that their thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families, but we all know by now that more is needed than a moment of silence, because the silence of lawmakers, especially those here in the House of Representatives, kills: 58 killed in Las Vegas, Nevada; 27 killed in Newtown, Connecticut; 14 killed in San Bernardino, California; 17 killed in Parkland, Florida; 4 at a Waffle House in Tennessee; 26 at a church in Texas; 49 at a nightclub in Florida; 6 at a Cracker Barrel in Michigan; and 9 at Mother Emanuel Church in South Carolina. The gunmen—and they were almost all men or boys—had different motives or motivations, including crime, racism, terrorism, revenge, and seeking notoriety, which they got. And they all had access to weapons and bullets that could kill scores of humans in just moments. For the most part, of the only thing the victims had in common was that they were killed by bullets. The Washington Post reported that the number of people killed in schools in 2018, this year, is almost double the number of servicemen and women killed in our military in both combat and noncombat fatalities. And this coming weekend, just like clockwork, as America honors fallen servicemembers on Memorial Day, Chicago—my city—will see a deadly toll. Fiftytwo people were shot over the Memorial Day weekend last year, and that was actually down from the previous year, 2016, when 71 people were shot in my city. There will probably be no national special reports or walltowall news coverage, because when 50 or 75 people of color are shot in an American city over a weekend, it barely makes the news; unless the NRA or FOX News use my beloved Chicago and her tough gun laws as a way of giving political coverage to politicians, while failing to point out that the loopholes and weak gun laws in Indiana, Virginia, and other States feed illegal guns into my city. And we should note that the NRA is now run by someone whose claim to fame—Oliver North—is that he lied to Congress, perjured himself, and sold guns to our country’s enemies. And they claim to be on the side of law and order? So, the result is political paralysis, societal paralysis, and actual, permanent paralysis as the butcher’s bill of dead and wounded grows and grows. When I came here in 1993, we had hope and optimism that we could cut crime and reduce the number of guns on our streets. But despite the drop in crime, all of our efforts to reduce the number of guns on our streets, in our houses, in our schools, and in our churches have been thwarted by the gun manufacturers. The assault weapons ban, I voted for and worked for, was here until it was killed by politics. The crime gun bill I wrote would work by reducing the availability and manufacture of the cheap, concealable handguns most often used in gun crimes, but it will never get a vote in this House of Representatives. See, we have established a schoolto coroner pipeline in this country that will persist until the American people arm their politicians to do something about it. But I fear the profit motive of the gun manufacturers and the politicians they own, got in their pocket, is greater than the will of the American people to take on and tame our runaway love affair with bullets. b1015 Mr. Speaker, it takes good people without guns working with good people who own guns to keep guns out of the hands of people who will use them to kill other people. It is not that we do not know what works, because we do. Waiting periods, background checks, trigger and gun locks, restrictions on the sales of guns can all be effective in reducing suicide, murder, and accidental death by firearms. We are not lacking the way. We are only lacking the will to overcome the deeply entrenched, highly profitable industry that thrives on fear, mistrust, inequality, racism, misogyny, and tribalism. 
We cannot afford another moment of silence, because silence kills. What we need is a moment of action to save the American people from killing themselves with American guns and American bullets. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  this list of moments of silence observed in the House since the Newtown shooting. It is compiled by the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. There are 43 of them, moments of silence, and nothing done to save the American people from the gun lobby and the NRA.

LET US REMEMBER THE FALLEN THIS MEMORIAL DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, many of us in this House will attend Memorial Day ceremonies over the weekend. I actually had four over this past weekend. I was privileged and honored to be there as we honor those who have died in the service of this great Nation to defend our rights and our liberties. Observed on the last Monday of May, Memorial Day is one of America’s most solemn occasions. The traditional Memorial Day dates back to 1864, in Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, not too far from my home in Centre County, Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District, as the birthplace of Memorial Day. Three ladies decorated the graves of fallen Civil War soldiers, and the custom has continued every year since then. Boalsburg still puts on a traditional Memorial Day celebration complete with a parade, a community walk to the cemetery, speeches, military enactments, and much more. On Memorial Day, communities across the country will pay tribute to our fallen veterans who never returned home. Many of us will gather with family members and friends and neighbors as we keep those we lost in our hearts. So as we raise the Stars and Stripes, as we lay wreaths at monuments, memorials, and cemeteries, let us remember that our freedom is thanks to those who died and served in sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, Memorial Day weekend also marks the ninth year that the National Endowment of the Arts and Blue Star Families begins Blue Star Museums. This program provides free admission to our Nation’s ActiveDuty military personnel this summer from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend of 2018. This is an initiative of the National Endowment of the Arts in collaboration with Blue Star Families, the Department of Defense, and more than 2,000 museums nationwide, including children’s museums, fine art museums, history and science museums, zoos, and nature centers. Blue Star Museums are one way our Nation’s museums can express appreciation to our military for their service and share with them America’s cultural treasures. Blue Star Museums also provide a way for military families to feel connected to their community, especially for those families that have recently relocated through a change of station. Blue Star Families build communities that support military families by connecting research and data to programs and solutions, including career development tools, local community events for families, and caregiver support. Since 2009, Blue Star Families have engaged tens of thousands of volunteers and served more than 1.5 million military family members. Mr. Speaker, Blue Star Families will be celebrating with every American this weekend as we commemorate Memorial Day in honor of so many who are no longer with us. May God bless them, and may God bless the United States of America. 
I WILL NOT GO ALONG TO GET ALONG The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, once again I rise as a person who loves this country. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a person who refuses to go along to get along. I rise as a person who will speak truth to power and truth about power. I rise today, Mr. Speaker, because in our country, our children are being murdered in schools. Our children are prognosticating that eventually it will come to the school that they happen to attend. Our children are concerned about their safety in what should be one of the safest places for them on Earth: the schools that they attend. I rise, Mr. Speaker, because there are parents who have sent their children to school and never have had them to come home again. I rise because these parents are suffering, because our Nation is suffering. There is great pain within the population. 
People of goodwill understand that we must do more than have moments of silence, words of prayer, expressions of condolences. People expect those of us who have been elected to the Congress of the United States of America to do what they sent us here to do, that is, have legislation brought to the floor, allow for some debate, and then take a vote. It is expected that we would vote on the legislation that is pending. We have more than 100 pieces of legislation dealing with gun safety pending before the House, and it is not being acted upon. I rise to ask, Mr. Speaker, that you bring this legislation to the floor of the House of Representatives so that the people can express their voices, can express their concerns, can take their positions by and through their legitimately elected Representatives. It is time, Mr. Speaker, for you to act, for you to bring the legislation to the floor so that we may vote on it. If there is someone who truly believes that the solution to this violence, to this killing, to these murders, if there is someone who believes that the solution is a good guy with a gun, put that solution into legislation, Mr. Speaker, and let’s vote on whether the solution is a good guy with a gun. Mr. Speaker, I will not go along to get along. Mr. Speaker, you have indicated that you won’t be returning to Congress. Well, Mr. Speaker, if you are not going to do your job, if you are not going to bring legislation to the floor—by the way, all of it, not Democratic legislation, not Republican legislation. This is not about Democrats; it is not about Republicans. This is about our children, who are being murdered in schools. If you are not going to bring that legislation to the floor, you ought to just step aside. This is bigger than you. It is bigger than all of us. It is about our children and how they are being murdered in schools. It is time to take the courage that has been embedded within your soul and your constitution and bring that legislation to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I speak truth to power. I speak truth about power. There is a problem. Mr. Speaker, you are the problem. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER LANCE WHITAKER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) for 5 minutes. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Officer Lance Whitaker, who was killed in the early morning hours on May 15, 2018, while responding to a police call for service. Officer Whitaker began his law enforcement career with the Atlantic Beach Police Department in Florida. He then joined the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office and has since served the city of Jacksonville faithfully for 17 years. Officer Whitaker was known among his fellow officers for his kind heart, and he had a very contagious smile. It was clear to those around him that he loved his job and he believed in what he was doing. Outside of work, Officer Whitaker was known as a proud father and family man. He is survived by his 14year old son, Cade Whitaker. Just 3 weeks ago, I attended the rededication of the Fallen Officers Memorial Wall in Jacksonville, where we had the chance to remember and celebrate the lives of 61 men who have died protecting our city. Tragically, another name now must be added to that wall. Today, I join the northeast Florida community to mourn the loss of Officer Whitaker. His service to the First Coast will never be forgotten, and my thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all of the JSO family, and I thank them for their sacrifice on behalf of a grateful city. Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: ‘‘The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you lived and lived well.’’ Officer Whitaker lived well. He did his job honorably and compassionately. He dedicated his life to his community, and he made a difference in the lives of many. Officer Whitaker lived his life well. RECOGNIZING RIVER CITY SCIENCE ACADEMY FOR  
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate River City Science Academy of Jacksonville, Florida, for winning the State championship in the Science Olympiad and for their excellent representation in the national competition that took place in Fort Collins, Colorado, on May 19, 2018. This remarkable achievement was the first time a school from Duval County has won the State competition, and I couldn’t be more proud of the students, teachers, and parents who came together to achieve this outstanding victory. My district is home to some of the brightest students in the country, and the academic excellence of the River City Science Academy is just more proof of the robust STEM programs that we facilitate back home. STEM education is so important in a highly competitive, technologically driven economy, and I am thankful for the educators who dedicate their lives to training the next scientists, mathematicians, and engineers. Congratulations once again to the River City Science Academy for leading the way, and I look forward to hearing of their many successes in the years to come. TRIBUTE TO COACH CHARLES BERRY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a legend in Arkansas high school basketball. Charles Berry, one of the State’s most successful coaches, is retiring this year after 57 years on the court. He is an Arkansas native, grew up in Huntsville, served in the United States Air Force, and returned home to begin a remarkable career as a teacher and coach, the last 50 years at his alma mater, Huntsville High School, in the gymnasium that now bears his name. The numbers speak for themselves: 1,367 career wins; 14 conference championships; six regional championships; two State titles, two times as a runner up. He is a sixtime Arkansas AllStar coach, and in 2007 was named the National Coach of the Year in girls basketball. His 2016 induction into the Arkansas High School Coaches Association Hall of Fame was automatic. His legacy as a coach is understood, but he is more than a coach. Charlie is a respected and dedicated mentor, educator, and person. He is simply one of the best. Thank you, Charlie, for your many years of service to your community, and happy retirement, my friend. 
RECOGNIZING BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, FIREFIGHTERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize approximately 60 firefighters in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who recently graduated from the national certification program. These brave men and women satisfactorily completed the Firefighter One training program offered by the Bucks County Public Safety Training Center. I would like to commend these firefighters for the work they do to protect and serve our community, selflessly putting their lives on the line on a regular basis. Recently, Firefighter Tim Pristatskiy of the Trevose Fire Company ran into a burning house in Lower Southampton to look for victims. With the compromised structure of the house, the second floor collapsed and Tim fell through. Despite the odds, Tim suffered no injuries, thankfully, and he is back serving on the force. Mr. Speaker, it is crucial that we honor our firefighters, like Tim, for the brave work they do in protecting the lives of our loved ones and our own. We truly owe them a debt of gratitude. b1030 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a resident of 
Bucks County, Pennsylvania, whose dedication to service has been a centerpiece of his life and his career. Bob Duaime of Middletown Township will receive the Give Life Hero Award from the American Red Cross later this month. Since 1972, Bob has donated blood 360 times and, over the past decade, has frequently donated the maximum amount of times permitted by law annually. A retired Council Rock High School teacher, Bob truly understands the value of community and the importance of leading by example. He is the cofounder and treasurer of Camp Discovery, a camp for child victims of abuse, and he volunteers for the Bucks County Emergency Homeless Shelter, the Churchville Nature Center, and Langhorne Open Space, Inc. Mr. Speaker, it is impossible to summarize all of Bob’s contributions to our community in this speech here today. I applaud Bob for his good works and encourage my constituents to follow his lead. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Muslim community in Bucks and Montgomery Counties, who are currently observing Ramadan, the holiest month in the Islamic faith. I wish them peace and renewal as they take on the virtues of charity and sacrifice. In this spirit, I would like to honor an organization in our community that seeks to provide cultural understanding between women in the Islamic and Jewish faiths. The Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom, a national organization, recently established a chapter in Bucks County. Founded by Aliya Murad of Yardley, this chapter seeks to bridge the gap between young women of separate creeds who are both devoted to their community and to their faith. Despite still being in high school, Aliya has already made a lasting difference in our community, and I call on all of my constituents to follow her lead. I thank her for her advocacy of compassion and understanding. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until 11 a.m. today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 32 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1100 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at 11 a.m. 
PRAYER Reverend Mark Goeglein, Harrisonville Community Church, Harrisonville, Missouri, offered the following prayer: Lord God of Heaven, You are the great and mighty God whose unwavering love and faithfulness for the world never ends. We bow in humble recognition of Your holiness and majesty, asking that You will be open and attentive to the prayer of Your servants. May we love one another just as You have loved us. We thank You for another day to do what is good, to do justice and to love kindness and to do what is best for this great Nation. Bless those who serve in Congress and assist them faithfully. Grant each of them wisdom to make the best decisions. Provide strength for those who are tired, and allow courage to do what is right for this great Nation. Help us to realize we are better together. Tear down the dividing wall of hostility, reconcile us, and restore us to pursue life and liberty together. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. SCHNEIDER led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING REVEREND MARK GOEGLEIN The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome my pastor, Mark Goeglein, to the U.S. House of Representatives and to commend him for his many years of faithful service to the Lord and to others. It is a blessing to have him here offering the opening prayer for today’s legislative session. Pastor Mark grew up familiar with the legislative process, as his mother was a longtime State representative from Indiana. I am thrilled to have him here today and appreciate his support of me and his love for our country. Mark has served in ministry for 25 years in churches in his home State of Indiana, Texas, California, and now as pastor of the Harrisonville Community Church in Missouri. I appreciate his passion for sharing God’s Word with his congregation and how his love of Scripture shows in his preaching and in the faded thumbprint on his Bible, testifying to the many years he has held that Bible preaching, studying, and praying. Besides a love of the Word, Pastor Mark loves the Pittsburgh Steelers, basketball, and his family. He is blessed to have his wife, Michelle, here today along with daughter, Makenzie, and sons, Micah and Mason. This family is an inspiration to our congregation and a testimony of God’s faithfulness and goodness. I wish Pastor Mark God’s continued blessings and know his faithfulness will be richly rewarded. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, joining the families and friends in Santa Fe, Texas, grieving for another 10 lives tragically cut short by senseless gun violence. Yesterday, this body held the now routine moment of silence in respect for the victims, just as we did after the Waffle House shooting in Nashville; Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas; and the list goes on and on and on. Fortysix times this Chamber has stood to remember the victims, and every single time congressional obstructionists stood in the way of doing anything concrete to change this deadly pattern. We haven’t considered background checks or bans on the sale of assault weapons or gun violence restraining orders to keep firearms out of the hands of the mentally ill or even, for goodness’ sake, bump stocks. I sit on the Judiciary Committee. We haven’t held a single hearing about reducing gun violence or working to keep 
our children safe. We can’t prevent every tragedy, but there are actions we can take right now, today, to save lives. We have the power. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to find the courage to act. Our kids are counting on us. 
POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION (Mrs. LOVE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise awareness about postpartum depression. I rise today to raise awareness about maternal deaths. I rise today to let the country know about one of my constituents, Emily Dykes. Emily was a good person. She was active in her community and beloved by all who knew her. But most of all, she was an amazing mother. However, with her fifth child, she developed some difficulties, and Emily was overtaken by severe anxiety. It was so severe, in fact, that it led to her mistreatment, misdiagnosis, and misunderstanding of her condition. Eventually, it led to her suffering so badly that, in her search for safety, she ran onto a freeway and was killed by a semi truck. The horrible fact is that Emily is not the only woman who suffers from this. Right now, there are thousands of women who suffer just like Emily suffered. As a mother, I want those women to know that they are not alone. There are many who have gone through very similar experiences, and there are places that mothers can go and get help. I encourage them to reach out. I encourage families to help out. This is not something that will go away unless we work to find a solution, that is, unless we as a society recognize it and take away the stigmas related to postpartum depression and help provide support to those who come forward for help. As we raise this awareness, we can find solutions that will make sure that the tragedies that befell Emily and her family won’t happen again. Mr. Speaker, I ask my community, State, colleagues, friends, and Members of Congress to come to the table to help save lives so that children like Emily’s five children are not left without a mother. 
GUN VIOLENCE (Mr. HASTINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, as my colleague, BRAD SCHNEIDER , just said, yesterday we held a moment of silence for those who were killed at Santa Fe High School. I have relatives and their children who live in Parkland, so these kinds of shootings affect us all. Everybody in this country knows that we have a gun epidemic in this country. We also know that we have a severe mental health crisis in our Nation. In my opinion, it is morally unjust for this Congress to do nothing. I own a gun. I believe in the Second Amendment. I would stand toetotoe with anyone who would urge that we take guns away from people, but I will stand with anyone who says that assault weapons should only be in the hands of military and police. I cannot understand how we continue to have these moments of silence and return to doing nothing. We don’t have all of the answers, but we do have some of the answers, and to do nothing is morally bankrupt and legislative malpractice. f 
RECOGNIZING 74 HEROES ON VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL WALL (Mr. CRAMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, during one of my recent weekly talk radio townhalls, I spoke to a family member of a veteran who served aboard the destroyer USS Frank E. Evans during the Vietnam war. The Vietnam veteran, Richard Grant, from Fargo, advocates for servicemembers who died during the Vietnam war but are not presently recognized on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial here in Washington. The USS Frank E. Evans provided naval gunfire off the coast of Vietnam, including during the Tet Offensive. While conducting friendly maneuvers outside of the official combat zone, it collided with a friendly Australian aircraft carrier, killing 74 crewmembers. I introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act to engrave the names of the 74 crewmembers who died on that day on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. Their sacrifice and that of their families is worthy not only of our mention, but of the high honor of being memorialized forever on the wall. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to lead this amendment and urge my colleagues to support it. I look forward to the day when the wall is engraved with the 74 names of the heroes of the USS Frank E. Evans.

b1115 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 905 provides for the consideration of three important bills aimed at protecting our country, reducing regulatory burdens in the financial sector, and allowing patients who have nowhere else to turn with another option to potentially save their lives. These three bills, taken together, show House Republicans’ commitment to putting Americans’ interests first. Today’s rule provides for a structured rule to begin consideration of H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. The resolution grants 1 hour of debate equally divided between the chair and ranking member of the House Committee on Armed Services. In addition, as the first of two likely rules on the fiscal year 2019 NDAA, the rule provides for the consideration of 103 amendments to the defense bill. Along with the Defense Authorization Act, the resolution today provides for a rule for House consideration of S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the Senatepassed bipartisan bill to reduce the regulatory burdens imposed on community and local banks by the DoddFrank financial regulatory legislation. The legislation went through rigorous debate in the House and the Senate, and it mirrors in many ways the Housepassed CHOICE Act, passed by the House in the summer of 2017 under the stewardship of Financial Services Chair JEBHENSARLING . Moreover, the resolution before us provides for a rule to allow the House to consider the unanimously passed Senate bill, S. 204, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017. This legislation, highlighted by the President during his last State of the Union address, has been a top priority of the President for the Congress, allowing terminally ill patients a last chance at survival using a carefully crafted FDA process. H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, would authorize appropriations for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, as well as prescribe military personnel strengths for the next fiscal year. This critical piece of legislation, one of the most important bills that any Congress will consider in any year, provides the resources and the direction necessary for our men and women in uniform to do what they do best: protect and serve our country throughout the world. As will be discussed by many Members of this body over this week, this bill touches on all aspects of military policy, from the Middle East to the Korean Peninsula to the Arctic waters. Among the hundreds of amendments the Rules Committee is likely to make in order on this legislation, I am pleased that, once again, my amendment, offered with Ms. LEE, Mr. L ANCE , Mr. DEFAZIO, Mr. J ONES , Mr. W ELCH , Mr. LEWIS, and Ms. S CHAKOWSKY , will again be made in order. This continues to push the Department of Defense to finally complete a full audit of its finances, as required by law. S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, corrects some of the more egregious provisions in the DoddFrank financial regulatory legislation. The bill focuses on regulatory relief on smaller financial institutions— namely, community banks and credit unions—so they can more readily meet the needs of their local communities without burdensome Federal regulations stifling their economic growth. This places the focus of the financial institutions back on their customers instead of completing paperwork and answering to agencies in Washington, D.C. Finally, Mr. Speaker, our final bill in today’s rule, S. 204, will look familiar to many people here today, as we are again considering legislation that would bring hope to terminally ill patients across our country. A similar bill, H.R. 5247, passed this House in March. Minority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER and Senate Democrats have refused to act on H.R. 5247, the revised version of the Right to Try legislation, which passed the House 2 months ago on a strong bipartisan vote. As this body had heard earlier this year, Right to Try was the one piece of legislation that President Trump came and stood in the well of this House and specifically promised to the American people in his State of the Union address. Today, I will say again what I said in March when we first took up Right to Try: I stand with the President and I stand with the thousands of Americans with terminal diseases and their families and their friends in getting this important policy to the President’s desk. Mr. Speaker, when we pass this bill today, it doesn’t go back to the Senate. It has already been passed by the Senate. It goes immediately down to the White House for a signature and becomes law. Here is an interesting fact. In the last couple of months since the House passed its Right to Try bill, even more States have joined this strong grassroots movement. Now, 40 States, including my home State of Texas, have passed and signed a version of Right to Try into law. In nine other States, a version of Right to Try has already been introduced, including the State of New York, which is the home State of the minority leader of the United States Senate. Last year, the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee held a hearing on access to investigational drugs where S. 204 was discussed. At that time, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, and other advocacy groups expressed concerns on the various Right to Try bills introduced in the Senate and the House. So, when the President asked the Congress to act, the House responded by holding multistakeholder discussions with patient groups, medical research advocates, and the administration in order to improve the original Right to Try bill. I want to commend Chairman WALDEN for leading these negotiations. I am also proud of the revised Right to Try legislation that the Energy and Commerce Committee produced because the policies were sound, and I believe it was a positive step forward in granting access to new treatments while allowing additional input from the Food and Drug Administration. Unfortunately, the minority party on the other side of the Capitol, Senate Democrats, said ‘‘no, thank you’’ to the revised House bill. While I am not surprised by their decision, I think the American people, particularly patients 
with terminal diseases and their loved ones, would not be satisfied with a ‘‘no, thank you’’ nonaction by Congress on such an important issue. Today, the House is ready to act for the American people and will be considering S. 204, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017. This passed the Senate unanimously last August. This bill will offer terminally ill patients a chance at life. After it passes this House, it will be signed into law. Our Nation has achieved unprecedented innovation and scientific breakthroughs recently and over the course of the last decade. American patients have widespread access to innovative treatments, thanks to researchers and our academic institutions and those working in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Despite these achievements, we continue to hear from patients with serious, lifethreatening conditions, including my constituents from north Texas, who remain frustrated with what they see as regulatory barriers from trying new therapies when everything else has failed them. As a physician, I understand that access to investigational drugs and therapies is a deeply personal priority for those seeking treatment for loved ones diagnosed with very difficult diseases. This crossroads where our Nation seems to be—when a potentially lifesaving treatment, while not approved, both exists but remains unavailable—is an important debate that we are having for these Americans. To them, it is not only a matter of life or death but another chance to spend more time with their children, grandchildren, parents, and other family members. Some of the opponents of Right to Try point to the Food and Drug Administration’s current expanded access program, which is aimed at helping patients who do not qualify for clinical trials gain access to therapies that the agency has yet to approve. While this program makes a good faith effort to help patients, we can do more by passing Right to Try and creating an alternative pathway for these patients to access eligible investigational drugs. Additionally, we know that many individuals may not qualify for a clinical trial if they do not meet strict patient inclusion criteria, which may include factors such as age, gender, type and stage of their disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions. There are also many patients for whom participation in a clinical trial is not feasible, especially those who live in rural areas far from the clinical trial sites. Most, if not all, of the patients with a terminal medical condition fall into one of these categories. This legislation that we are doing today allows these patients to participate in an alternative pathway, opening another door to investigational drugs that does not exist today. While there are a few differences between S. 204 and the Housepassed Right to Try legislation, the underlying policies between the two bills are very similar. For example, only certain investigational drugs are considered eligible under both bills. In order to qualify, the drug must have completed a phase one clinical trial; have an active application at the Food and Drug Administration; be under active development or production by a manufacturer; and not have been approved, licensed, or cleared for sale under current law. Also, both bills require reporting of serious adverse events, having written informed consent to the treating physician, and notifying the agency when a sponsor provides an investigational drug. Lastly, Commissioner Gottlieb at the Food and Drug Administration recently expressed support for the Senatepassed Right to Try bill being considered today and said that his agency could ensure an appropriate level of patient safety through guidance and rulemaking. In other words, while the Food and Drug Administration may have some additional work, the key point is the agency can achieve the proper balance of ensuring patient safety and granting access to new investigational drugs. I think the Commissioner would agree that we would have preferred the revised House Right to Try legislation, but doing nothing is currently not an option. Hundreds of thousands of Americans with terminal illnesses and their families are looking for us to act. I support restoring hope for these patients and giving them a fighting chance at life. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members of this esteemed body to support today’s rule and all three underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate. Mr. Speaker, the underlying measures that are in this combined rule are matters of substance that do need to be addressed, and I will get back to it in a moment. Several of my colleagues will join me today in recognizing a historic moment in this particular body in this great country of ours. Madam Speaker, let me recognize that tucked inside this rule is the majority’s 83rd and 84th closed rules of this Congress—and we are just in May—with more to go. b1130 That is a historic number because it makes the 115th Congress the most closed Congress ever. My Republican friends have made history for all the wrong reasons. But we should not let this milestone go unrecognized right from the very beginning, because it is a sad point in this Chamber’s history. It is why we have ignored virtually every major issue the public cares about. It is why this Congress can’t get anything done. It is why we are so dysfunctional. It is clear to me that the majority has turned a deaf ear, which is absolutely shameful. Please know this: 1,793 amendments offered by Members of this body have been denied. When I came to Congress in 1992, there was an echo chamber from the right talking about the Democrats’ closed rules. Quite frankly, at that time, I did not understand that dynamic. I arrived here, and during that particular session of Congress, we did have open rules, but there were closed rules as well. When NANCY PELOSI was last Speaker, we had 12 open rules. This Speaker, our now lameduck Speaker, up to this point, has been and is the only Speaker of the House of Representatives never to have an open rule. What that means is not just Democrats have been shut out but Republicans have been shut out. Day in and day out, night in and night out, in the Rules Committee, Members offer up meaningful suggestions to this Congress, and they are denied. That is not denying the Member of Congress; it is denying the people those persons are here to represent and who expect them to advance measures that are pertinent to their respective communities. There will be Members who will talk about the shamefulness of the kinds of amendments that have been denied. This particular measure authorizes $647 billion in base budget authority for defense programs in the coming fiscal year, as well as an additional $69 billion in overseas contingency operations. The legislation comes on the heels of the bipartisan budget agreement signed into law in February, which increased the budget caps for defense and nondefense spending for 2 years. The legislation provides, rightly, a 2.6 percent pay raise for ActiveDuty troops, the highest such raise in 9 years. It strengthens the Military Health System, provides assistance to local educational agencies servicing military dependent students, and improves the Transition Assistance Program to provide servicemembers better tailored resources and information as they prepare to enter civilian life. I was glad to see that this NDAA establishes a prescription drug monitoring program in order to prevent opioid abuse within the military, a proactive step that will help our country combat drug addiction. What is important about this particular measure is the chairman, Chairman THORNBERRY , and the ranking member, ADAM SMITH, have worked together, along with the members of the Committee on Armed Services, to 
produce a bipartisan product. It proves it can be done. This is a bipartisan measure, and most Members in this body will have amendments that will be made in order and will have an opportunity to present their ideas how to better sustain military readiness. That is as it should be. But there are members of the Committee on Armed Services who belong to other committees of jurisdiction. In those committees of jurisdiction where few hearings are held, no bipartisan effort is undertaken, they are shut out just as well as the rest of the members of the other jurisdictions. Every jurisdiction in this Congress should be bipartisan and should have input from both parties. And I find it passing strange that I hear voices saying that Democrats are obstructionists. Obstructionists of what? We can’t even get amendments made in order. The only thing we have left that we can do is voice our objection to the kind of closed process that we have witnessed during this particular session of Congress. I hope the American public understands how much their Members are being denied an opportunity to represent them. In terms of military readiness, the fiscal year 2019 NDAA dedicates substantial funding toward cuttingedge military capabilities and countering emerging threats through investments in cyber and space. The bill includes funding for thousands of additional ActiveDuty troops and authorizes important funding for military construction and infrastructure. You know what it doesn’t include and what it won’t? There will be Members who will offer that we have an Authorization for Use of Military Force. Seventeen years have passed since we have had a new Authorization for Use of Military Force. Congress should be declaring war, not Presidents. And it doesn’t mean this President. The three or four before him operating in this Congress were allowed to go forward under the aegis of a 17yearsago Authorization for Use of Military Force. I was also pleased to see an improved commitment to Historically Black Colleges and Universities in this year’s package—schools that are critical to ensuring a pipeline of highly skilled, diverse college graduates into the United States Armed Forces. This bill also takes significant steps to support our allies. It provides $6.3 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative and declares that it is the policy of the United States to counter Russian influence campaigns. The bill also imposes additional sanctions on Russia for violating the IntermediateRange Nuclear Forces Treaty, and it renews authority in the war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and fully funds Israeli missile defense partnerships. Madam Speaker, there is a lot that we can be proud of in this NDAA. Unfortunately, despite all of these important investments, there are a few provisions in this bill that raise serious concerns. I have already spoken to the failure to pass a new militaryuseofforce measure. The one that we have is overly broad, and Members have never had an opportunity to vote on a new one, even as we commit to military engagements overseas. Members on both sides of the aisle agree that an upordown vote on a new AUMF is long overdue. So this is the time and the place to do it. My colleague BARBARA LEE, I am sure, and my colleague on the Rules Committee JIMMCGOVERN , I am sure, are going to offer measures that will accomplish that. I am also particularly alarmed that this legislation repeals the Federal ban on military production of lowyield nuclear weapons. Repealing this 15year ban and pursuing lowyield nuclear warheads for submarinelaunched ballistic missiles will have significant ramifications for global security. Additionally, the NDAA includes a number of provisions targeting DOD’s fourth estate, which refers to nonmilitary portions of the Department of Defense. These provisions affect human resources, information systems, and other important services that affect the daytoday lives of our servicemen and women as well as national readiness. Under this bill, these offices are targeted with an unrealistic and unnecessary spending cut, setting up a sequesterlike automatic 25 percent reduction to critical support functions. Madam Speaker, this brings me to the second measure, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. Under the pretext of providing relief to community banks, this bill rolls back important financial and consumer protections and provides a giveaway to large Wall Street banks, allowing them to skirt enhanced regulations aimed at protecting our economy from another financial crisis. The third measure, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act, exposes more patients to harm and further sidelines the Federal Drug Administration’s ability to oversee investigational treatments than the bill passed by the House in March. In fact, during the Rules Committee hearing in March, Energy and Commerce Committee Chair WALDEN and Health Subcommittee Chair and fellow Rules Committee member BURGESS had reservations about this measure, which is why the House took up the more narrowly focused bill in the first place. Madam Speaker, last Friday, there was another school shooting. Again, America watched in horror as students and teachers fled their classrooms from a murderous gun rampage. Again, community leaders and government officials offered thoughts and prayers. Yesterday, we offered a moment of silence. Again, calls for stricter gun control laws and heightened school security returned. We all know that this will happen again to our young people. And for that reason, I can state emphatically and without fear of having to correct the RECORD that the Republican leadership of this House has not only abdicated their responsibility to the American people and our children but their common sense as well. No other country in the world has as many guns, as many homicides, or as many mass shootings as we do. There is simply no more time to waste. We need to be considering a ban on bump stocks. We need to be considering a ban on assault weapons. And don’t anybody tell me we can’t ban assault weapons. We did that when I first came to Congress. We banned assault weapons, and the kind of mass killings we have seen went down after we did that. We need to be considering protective orders allowing people to petition the court to temporarily remove firearms from an individual in crisis. We have seen evidence of that working when Florida passed its law. One week after that law went into effect, a person had his guns removed who would have been a harm to himself and to others. We need to be considering comprehensive background checks, and we can’t stop there. We need to increase access to mental health services. We need to eliminate the feeling in this country that seeking help carries with it some sort of stigma. We need to learn to recognize the danger signs and offer a clear course of action. We need to teach students about conflict resolution. And we need to do more about civility in this Nation, in this House. And we should be its leaders, not standing and offering a moment of silence and returning to do nothing, as we have done, shooting after shooting, mass shooting after mass shooting, in this country. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ), a member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the fiscal year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act. I want to thank Chairman THORN BERRY for all his leadership on this bill. Providing for our Nation’s common defense is our constitutional duty. As a retired lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, I know that certainty from Washington, especially on this side of the river, is critical for the military to carry out its missions. Our men and women in uniform need consistency and reliability over the long term to meet complex threats, changing threats, in all corners of the world. This bill increases resources for readiness training and upgrades essential 
equipment to provide our warfighters with increased capabilities on land, at sea, and in the air. I also want to thank the committee for including report language highlighting the critical role that the Soo Locks play in our national security. The Soo Locks, located in my home district, are a single point of failure in a multibilliondollar supply chain and a potential target for disruptive activities. Any unscheduled outing of the locks would threaten our national economy and, in turn, our national security. Again, I thank the chairman for all his hard work on this defense authorization. I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill. b1145 Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. TEDLIEU), a member of the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committees, to discuss the commonsense issues that we all care about but have been blocked during this closed Congress. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speaker, PAULRYAN promised regular order when he took over the speakership. He has broken that promise repeatedly. We have voted on bills here on the floor that violated the standard committee process. The majority has employed a technique called marshal law that allows them to bring up bills with little to no notice, and now we know we have the most closed Congress in U.S. history. The majority has blocked all amendments on most bills. That is a disgraceful way to run the people’s House. Twentythree amendments of mine have been blocked—simple amendments. One of them basically says, hey, the Federal Government should invest more in cybersecurity. We can’t even get a debate on that. Really? Another amendment I have deals with anticorruption, and whether you have a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent, you don’t want corruption. You don’t want members of the executive branch making money off the taxpayer’s dime. So one of these amendments basically says we are not going to reimburse the President or other members when they go and spend money on Mar aLago or other Trump properties and have the Federal Government pay money there because that flows to the President or his immediate family. Can’t even get a vote on that. Why? Because the Republican leadership knows it would pass. We need to open up this Congress and have a debate. We came here to debate ideas, not to block them. Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MESSER ). Mr. MESSER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this historic bipartisan compromise that rolls back some of the most harmful policies from the DoddFrank Act and will help grow our economy. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act includes bipartisan legislation that I authored to help communities in Indiana and across the United States save money on roads, bridges, and schools. It reverses a backward banking rule that gave foreign countries an advantage over American cities and towns. This will drive down the cost of borrowing and make it cheaper for cities and towns to finance local infrastructure projects. Ultimately, this bill saves taxpayer dollars. That is why it has passed the House twice. It is supported by numerous advocacy groups, and my good friend, the State treasurer of Indiana, Kelly Mitchell. I applaud this bill’s inclusion in this banking reform package, and I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill. Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ), a member of the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committees, to discuss the commonsense issues that we all care about but that have been blocked during this closed Congress. Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. We pride ourselves on being the most deliberative body on the planet, and all of us come here to contribute our best ideas to improve the lives of the American people. You wonder why this place doesn’t work? It is the whole set of exclusion of ideas from nearly half this body. I am one of those people who has offered just about 25 amendments that were blocked by the Republicans. What are they afraid of? Debate your ideas. Make your arguments. Vote. Be held accountable. Some of the things they blocked, the amendments I offered: an amendment to increase student loan interest tax deductions in our tax bill; a provision to end tax breaks for companies that ship American jobs overseas; an amendment to increase funding to combat violent extremism; and an amendment to increase funding for fire departments in the SAFER grants. Those are just four examples. Their practice, they marked an important moment in history, not a good moment: the most closed Congress in the history of the United States, excluding from consideration debate, argument, and accountability. Vote on these things so the American people know where you stand. That is what we have here, over 1,000 ideas proffered by Democrats that our Republican colleagues won’t even bring to the floor for consideration so the American people know where they stand on a range of important issues. This is a dark day for Congress, the most closed Congress in our history. It means the voices of the American people as reflected in nearly half of this body are not being considered, debated, and voted upon by the Congress. It is wrong. It is negatively impacting the lives of the American people. There are real consequences. It is not just that we want our own amendments considered. It is because we understand it will benefit the American people. I urge my colleagues to have some selfreflection on what they are doing here. Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds for purposes of rebuttal before I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD). As a point of situational awareness, as of last week, in this Congress, over 1,000 amendments have been heard on the House floor: 47 percent Democratic, 41 percent Republican, 15 percent bipartisan. For a point of reference, the last term that NANCY PELOSI was Speaker of the House, the 111th Congress, less than 1,000 amendments for the entire Congress. We passed that milestone prior to last week. We will continue to hear amendments on the floor. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD). Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas. Today is a great day for North Carolina’s community financial institutions, small business innovators, and, most importantly, our economy. I rise today in strong support of this rule that will bring a muchneeded regulatory relief bill, S. 2155, to the House floor. The most damaging aspect of the DoddFrank bill was the additional and unnecessary regulatory burden placed on community financial institutions, and because of this, we have seen American consumers and small businesses struggle to get the credit and the support that they need. Economic growth is held back because of Dodd Frank, but I am happy to report that relief is on the way with the passage of S. 2155. Madam Speaker, while I urge adoption of this rule and urge passage of this bill, I also look forward to working with our chairman and our leader, JEB HENSARLING , Senator M IKECRAPO , and Senate Democrats to craft a package of bills that focuses on capital formation. I offer any support I can to help bring that collection of bills across the finish line as well. I urge adoption of the rule, Madam Speaker. Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, just to respond briefly to Mr. BURGESS , it is a good thing that they made a handful of amendments in order that added up to 1,000. If we went through it, they would look like studies and things that were not significant; but when it came to the healthcare measures or when it came to tax reform, not one amendment by a Democrat was made in order. Madam Speaker, I yield 1
(Ms. D ELAURO ), who is a member of the Appropriations Committee, to discuss the significance of this recordbreaking closed Congress and real people affected by these closed rules. Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, this week, the Republican majority won the honor of having run the most closed Congress in American history: 84 closed rules, zero open rules. What does that mean? It means that they blocked us from fully debating or amending legislation, prohibiting us from fully giving our constituents a voice in this Congress. Why are we here? Our constituents sent us here to be able to debate issues and to vote on those issues. Two weeks ago, the majority blocked my amendment to ensure equal pay for equal work. Congress passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963 to end unequal wages. Yet, in 2018, women still earn about 80 cents, on average, to a man’s dollar. The gap is worse for women of color. A woman working fulltime will lose $400,000 over the course of her career. African American women lose $840,000. Latinas will lose over $1 million. Since women are the sole or co breadwinner in half of the families with children, our Nation’s families and our economy suffers, which is why I offered the Paycheck Fairness Act as an amendment. It toughens remedies in the Equal Pay Act to help America’s working women fight wage discrimination and receive a full paycheck. They blocked it. The strength of this institution is its potential to make a difference in the lives of the American people. That is vital when the biggest economic challenge is jobs that do not pay them enough to live on. We cannot help raise wages, improve education, or fix crumbling infrastructure when this majority, more than any in American history, has closed the House to debate and to amendments. They closed it to action. It is unacceptable. The American people deserve better. Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK ). Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) for yielding this time to debate these important measures. This is a historic moment here in the House. Today, we will be sending the most significant financial regulatory relief legislation to the President’s desk in more than a decade. I am proud to have been part of this effort, and I thank all of my colleagues who helped get us to this moment. Madam Speaker, for the past 3
1⁄2 years I served in this House, I have been telling the same story over and over again: My home State of Georgia lost 70 banks during the financial crisis, the most of any State in the Nation. Today, 52 of Georgia’s counties do not have a community bank headquartered there, and three of Georgia’s counties have no bank branch whatsoever. Why? Because of excessive regulatory burden placed on small community banks and credit unions by previous legislative action and through overreach by regulators. Today, we are taking a major step toward reversing that trend by taking bold action and by sending progrowth regulatory relief to small community banks and credit unions to the President’s desk. This bill will help ensure that community banks and credit unions will no longer be crushed under the weight of regulations that do not distinguish between them and the largest financial institutions. Much of this bill originally came from House bills—bipartisan, I may add. This moment is an example of the legislative process working well in a strong bipartisan fashion. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time both parties have remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. LOVE). The gentleman from Florida has 10
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 13 minutes remaining. Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ), a member of the Financial Services Committee, to discuss the significance of this recordbreaking closed rule and the real people affected by the GOP shutting down our democratic process. Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. Madam Speaker, I am here to protest what has been the most closed Congress in American history. I know the other side will recite the number of amendments that have been allowed, but the fact remains, this is the most closed Congress we have ever had: 84 closed rules and not one open rule. We are sent here by our constituents to advocate for their interests, and in the minority, one of the few tools we have is the ability to offer amendments and have those arguments heard on the floor of this House. Knowing that we may not win every fight, knowing that we may not win a majority on each idea, we ought to at least allow the power of a good idea to have a fair hearing. Twentyeight times I have offered amendments, thoughtful amendments that were crafted with the idea that we could actually improve policy, and 28 times those amendments have been blocked. These are not messaging amendments, just to give two examples: One would have increased the amount of funding available to local governments that are struggling to improve their drinking water systems. Think about my hometown of Flint and the hundreds of other communities that would have benefited from that. Another would have directed the Federal Government to do more to deal with this issue of PFAS, perfluorinated chemicals, that is poisoning groundwater. In fact, while the EPA is having a conversation today about this very dangerous chemical that is affecting human life in this country, I offered an opportunity for Congress to do something. Why didn’t we do it? Because up in the Rules Committee, it was blocked. The ideas ought to have a chance on the floor of the House. That is what we are sent here to do. We ought to open this Congress up. Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON ). Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this historic bipartisan legislation. This progrowth bill is thanks to all the hardworking members of the House Financial Services Committee, and I am proud to have contributed to this meaningful reform. S. 2155 will reduce regulatory burdens hindering Main Street by providing job creators with resources they need to grow their businesses and, frankly, their banks. Under DoddFrank, big banks have gotten bigger and small banks have become fewer. Our economy is not well served when small banks are handicapped. As a former manufacturer, I understand the toll excessive regulatory burdens can have on small businesses. That is why I am a proud supporter of this legislation, and I look forward to seeing this bill signed on the President’s desk. b1200 Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative SARBANES ’ bill, H.R. 20, the Government by the People Act. This legislation would overhaul our broken campaign finance system and return to a government of, by, and for the American people. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ), who is a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, to discuss our proposal. Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, no matter what you think of S. 2155, one of the underlying bills being considered today, it is not what a clear majority of Americans want Congress to be doing. Madam Speaker, nobody is coming up to us in townhalls and asking Congress to deregulate large financial institutions. We are not going to a fish fry 
and hearing from people that they want us to dismantle important consumer protections. And nobody at VFW halls, Rotary Clubs, and PTA meetings thinks this bill should be Congress’ priority. The reason this bill is on the floor is that the power brokers on Wall Street want it on the floor. It is their bill; it is not the people’s bill. Our broken campaign finance system lies at the heart of this warped political system, where big money calls the shots in Washington. For starters, in this broken system, too many good candidates without access to big money are effectively barred from running altogether. Those who can make it through have to spend hours dialing for dollars, courting a narrow slice of the Nation’s elite, while highpowered lobbyists and special interests are dictating legislation here in Congress, just like today. Most recently, these backroom power brokers used their influence to demand billiondollar handouts for the wealthiest 1 percent from the GOP tax scam. Now they are once again tearing down critical rules to protect our financial system from another economic collapse. Today’s previous question would force a vote on H.R. 20, the Government by the People Act, a comprehensive reform of our campaign finance system to combat the influence of big money in our politics, raise civic engagement, and amplify the voice of everyday Americans. This legislation would increase and multiply the power of small donors in America, breaking candidates’ reliance on the big money crowd, giving candidates the resources they need to compete and win. That way, when it comes time to make policy, the elected representatives of the people will work on behalf of our constituents, not the big money donors. Madam Speaker, the American people are sick of getting a raw deal from Washington. That is why Democrats are offering a better deal for our democracy: a comprehensive reform agenda to get rid of the corruption that has led to such a dysfunctional political system here in Washington. We will deliver real reforms that will restore a government of, by, and for the people. Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF ). Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. This progrowth package provides the desperately needed regulatory relief to our community financial institutions while providing consumers with greater options for accessing credit. For too long, we have seen many of the onerous regulatory burdens restrict banks and credit unions from serving the needs of their communities. After 8 years of failed economic policies, which led to the slowest, weakest recovery in the modern era, the economy is finally starting to take off, and consumer optimism is increasing each and every day each. As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, we remain committed to passing legislation designed to roll back some of the most burdensome provisions found in the Dodd Frank Act. This legislation was intended to rein in large financial institutions, while harming our local community banks and credit unions. These increased regulations created a higher cost of business and diminished credit availability. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. PALMER ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Frankly, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act tailors the rules to the size and risk profile rather than imposing sweeping changes to our consumer financial institutions. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their work on this important legislation, and I urge passage on the rule and on the final vote. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. GONZALEZ ), a member of the Financial Services Committee, to continue the discussion of commonsense issues that we all care about but have been blocked during this closed Congress. Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and distinguished Member of Congress, Mr. HASTINGS , for providing me the opportunity to speak today on behalf of deported veterans. Mr. Speaker, setting the record for the most closed Congress is not a proud accomplishment. Our job is in our title: Representatives. We represent the American people. According to the most recent Gallup poll, 78 percent of Americans disapprove of the way Congress is handling itself. Can you blame them? When I came to Congress, I heard from constituents and Americans across the country about the injustice of deported veterans. I heard from Arnold Giammarco from Connecticut, who was deported to Italy after coming to the United States at the age of 4 and honorably serving our country. I heard from Gerardo Armijo, a Purple Heart recipient in my district, who was brought to the United States as an infant. He served two tours in Iraq, came home honorably discharged with PTSD after he suffered major injuries from an IED, and failed to get the care that he needed from the Veterans Administration. Due to drugs and alcohol, he found himself in some trouble and is now deported. These stories are flooding in from all corners of the globe. We are deporting honorably discharged veterans after promising them citizenship. This is a disgrace. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ), my good friend, a former member of the Committee on Rules who is now a member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, to discuss the commonsense issues that we all care about that have been blocked during this closed Congress. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, this is the most closed Congress in my lifetime. Eightyfour closed rules. That means we don’t debate on the floor. That is also on top of the fact that we don’t debate in committee. The tax bill that was passed out of the Ways and Means Committee had no discussion, no debate, and no publication until it was brought up for a vote. The same thing is true for the healthcare bill. We need to be debating things. One of them was allowing citizens to import safe prescription drugs from Canada at a lower cost when those prescriptions were manufactured in FDA approved facilities. I offered that amendment, and we were denied the opportunity to vote on that. Mr. Speaker, had we been allowed to vote on it, it would have passed, and Americans would have saved billions of dollars—and I said the word ‘‘billions’’—on safe prescription medication if we could crack the lock that Pharma has on price gouging for pharmaceuticals. We could do that if the majority would allow us to vote on amendments that pursue the opportunities that Americans need to be safe and secure. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), the ranking member of the Committee on Rules, my good friend, who also serves on the Committee on Agriculture, to discuss the significance of this recordbreaking closed Congress and real people affected by these closed rules. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day, a very sad day, for this institution. Today, it becomes official that this will become the most closed Congress ever in the history of the United States. You heard why this matters. You heard from some of my colleagues here today that important issues, issues that the American people care about, like ensuring clean water for children, like high ethics in the executive branch, like cybersecurity, like banning bump stocks, like protecting our 
veterans, or like protecting Medicare or Social Security—these amendments are routinely denied. We are shut out. Millions of young people all over the country protested for us to do something to combat gun violence, and we have done nothing. We have done nothing in this Chamber other than a moment of silence. The frustration of these young people is compounded by the fact that we can’t even bring an amendment to the floor to ban bump stocks or to expand background checks or to ban assault weapons. They don’t want to let anything come to the floor. It is outrageous. And for anybody to stand up here and defend this process, to somehow normalize this process, give me a break. This closed process is something you would see in Russia or Turkey or in some other authoritarian government, not in the people’s House. This is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the world. What is so radical about deliberating every once in a while? We have a report that we are releasing today. It is 230 pages. Go to the Rules Committee Democrats’ web page, and you can read all about how there has been a deliberate attempt to shut out the voices of the American people. Enough. This is not the way this place is supposed to be run. If Democrats are given the privilege to control this House again, I will tell you, we need to be more accommodating, we need to be more open, and we need to allow this place to be a deliberative body where important issues get debated. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we need to fix problems in this country. We could pass a bill to protect the Dreamers in a nanosecond if the Republican majority would allow us to bring an amendment to the floor, but they won’t. Why? Because they are afraid that we are going to win. They don’t want a fair fight. They want a system that is always rigged in their favor. Well, that is not democracy. That is not the way this place is supposed to be run. If we have a more accommodating approach to legislating, then I guarantee you that the polarization will be less. You will have more bills that will pass in a bipartisan way. And, by the way, it is not just Democrats that get shut out; 180 Republicans have been shut out of the amendment process as well. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. MCGOVERN. The sad thing is that they just go along to get along, and they are complicit in this most closed process in U.S. history. Enough. Enough. We deserve better, the American people deserve better, my constituents deserve better, and your constituents deserve better. This place needs to be run differently. Mr. Speaker, vote against this rule. And I say to my Republican friends: Have the guts to stand with us and vote ‘‘no’’ on this closed process. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 11⁄2minutes for the purposes of a response. I would, of course, lead with the observation that those who do not remember their history are doomed to repeat it. I don’t remember precisely who said it, but I think it bears repeating today. In the 111th Congress, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats allowed less than a thousand amendments to be considered on the floor. Of the bills that were considered at that time, the DoddFrank bill was one of those bills. The amendments that were blocked by the Democrats in the 111th Congress were precisely the type of amendments that we are now considering today in the bill to alleviate some of the obstructions, some of the gridlock that has occurred with our credit unions and smaller banks— things that people have been asking us for repeatedly for the last 5 to 7 years. Mr. Speaker, the number of amendments that were blocked in the 111th Congress was significant. We have a chance today to undo some of that process, and I believe we ought to take that opportunity. As of 1
1⁄2weeks ago, over a thousand amendments had been made in order in this Congress. The Committee on Rules is run differently today than it was in the 111th Congress. It used to be that you had to submit 45 copies of an amendment and you had a time limit by which you had to submit those amendments. You can submit amendments late now. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to myself. Chairman SESSIONS has been very accommodating in allowing us to bring amendments to the Committee on Rules late. There is no clock in the Committee on Rules, as the gentleman well knows. You can talk as long as you want in the Committee on Rules about your amendments, and you can offer whatever amendments you prefer. The process is not ideal, but it is important that we move forward with these important reforms that people have been asking us for years. And, today, that day is at hand, and those reforms will be delivered. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1215 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ). Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me say to my friend from Texas, we don’t want to talk. That is what you guys want to do. We want to legislate. The fact is that the majority of bills that you have brought to this House floor have been closed. You have more closed rules than any other Congress in the history of the United States of America. How anybody can defend that with a straight face is beyond me. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I ask how much time I have remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 1 minute remaining. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I would advise the gentleman from Texas that I am prepared to close if he is. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, seeing no more speakers on my side, I am prepared to close. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I ask the American people to look at this chart. Rules under Speaker RYAN: structured rules, 44 percent; closed rules, 56 percent; open rules, zero. That is what we are talking about. As with all bipartisan measures, this NDAA has many things to like and some provisions that are causes for concern, but it did demonstrate that there can be bipartisan cooperation in order to safeguard our national security, and that should be the case in every one of the jurisdictional undertakings here in Congress. I commend the committee for once again tackling such a major legislative package, but sadly, this approach is far and away the exception to the rule around here. Finally, Mr. Speaker, we have a moral responsibility to address gun violence in this country. Gun violence has overtaken our country. We have a moral responsibility to every child who now attends school thinking about, not if a school shooting will happen, but when it will happen to them. This responsibility is not owed to them at our leisure, it is not owed to them next month or next week or tomorrow, but today. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I again want to reiterate, the Rules Committee has spent hours listening and considering Member testimony. We have welcomed over 225 Members to testify during this Congress, and roughly 493 times have made over 1,000 amendments in order, including 474 from Democrats, 383 from Republicans, and over 150 which were bipartisan amendments. The rule today is important, three important pieces of legislation. The National Defense Authorization Act. Our number one priority when we are elected to this body is the defense 
of our Nation, and we are authorizing that expenditure today. The bill to reform the financial services institutions is one that has been requested by small banks and credit unions for years, and this body is today prepared to deliver. Then finally, the Right to Try Act. The President stood in the State of the Union message and said that it was not correct that people had to go to other countries in order to get the medicines that they needed to prolong their lives. He wanted that to end, and today we are taking the step to end that. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support today’s rule and the three underlying pieces of legislation. The material previously referred to by Mr. HASTINGS is as follows: 
AN AMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 905 OFFERED BY  MR. HASTINGS  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 20) to reform the financing of congressional elections by broadening participation by small dollar donors, and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority members of the Committees on House Administration, Energy and Commerce, and Ways and Means. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 20. THEVOTE ON THEPREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on ordering the previous question will be followed by 5 minute votes on: Adoption of House Resolution 905, if ordered, and Approval of the Journal, if ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 222, nays 184, not voting 21, as follows: [Roll No. 210] YEAS—222

SEC. 413. ADULT AND JUVENILE COLLABORATION PROGRAMS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 5682, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5682, the FIRST STEP Act. The bipartisan bill before us is a meaningful, historic criminal justice reform measure. The FIRST STEP Act places a new focus on rehabilitation. While we recognize criminal behavior needs to be punished and criminals need to be incarcerated, we must also acknowledge that our prison population needs to be rehabilitated to the greatest extent practicable. The bill establishes a risk and needs assessment as the basis of both an effective recidivism reduction program and an efficient and effective Federal prison system. The FIRST STEP Act will incentivize prisoners to participate in evidencebased recidivism reduction programs, productive activities, and jobs that will actually reduce their risk of recidivism. We know that over 90 percent of all prisoners within the Bureau of Prisons 
will be released someday. That is an indisputable fact. We also know that without programming and intervention, which can train prisoners to be better citizens, not better criminals, prisoners are more likely to recidivate. Mr. Speaker, rather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation. By using a focused approach for each prisoner, we can lower the risk of recidivism. That is what H.R. 5682 does. Fewer recidivists means fewer prisoners in the future. It means greater savings to the American taxpayer. More importantly, it means safer communities, fewer crimes, and, of course, fewer victims. It also means greater opportunities for people once they leave prison. This bill is important because when prisoners who have received intervention and rehabilitation are released, they are less likely to commit crimes. When that happens, our streets are safer and innocent civilians are less likely to be victimized. Rehabilitated prisoners are more likely to leave the life of crime behind, become productive members of society, and contribute to their communities. If that isn’t meaningful, Mr. Speaker, I don’t know what is. I know there are some in this body who are opposing this legislation because it does not include sentencing reform. I support sentencing reform and have worked with my colleagues to find common ground on that issue. However, we should not let this opportunity pass by. The vast majority of Members of this House agree that this legislation is needed. Let us not linger any longer. Let us move this important and meaningful bill today. Just look at the bipartisan support from outside interest groups that the FIRST STEP Act has received. Numerous organizations—almost too many to list in the allotted time we have—on both the left and the right have enthusiastically endorsed this bill. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chief sponsors of H.R. 5682, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES ). They worked tirelessly to get this bill to the floor, and both should be applauded for their bipartisan approach to this issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the FIRST STEP Act, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to H.R. 5682, the FIRST STEP Act. On principle, I cannot support legislation which fails to address the larger issue of sentencing reform, and, though this bill makes some modest improvements in areas related to our prisons, actually it does more harm by cementing into our system new areas of racial biases and disadvantage that make worse a criminal justice system desperately in need of reform. Despite the bill’s good intentions, the new incentive system for prerelease custody credits could exacerbate racial biases and, unlike previous criminal justice efforts, is not balanced with the necessary reforms to our Federal sentencing system. As Monday’s New York Times editorial observed: ‘‘A partial bill could end up being worse than nothing.’’ The bill excludes large categories of inmates, based on convictions for various offenses and on immigration status, from being eligible for the prerelease custody incentives established by the bill. Second, certain prisoners who are eligible to participate in the incentive system and who successfully participate in recidivism reduction programs would face being denied early entry to prerelease custody if such inmates are judged to have a higher than low recidivism risk under the new system. It would be unfair to deny these prisoners what they have earned, and it is counterproductive for all of us to, in effect, create a disincentive for prisoners who most need recidivism reduction programming from engaging in it. Third, the combination of these factors, implemented through a problematic risk assessment tool, could operate to exacerbate racial and socioeconomic disparities already present in the criminal justice system. As the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the ACLU, the NAACP, the National Immigration Law Center, and dozens of other advocacy groups warn, ‘‘the exclusions could . . . have a disparate impact on racial minorities.’’ I want to acknowledge the tremendous work of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee—Representatives JEFFRIES , RICHMOND , and B ASSparticularly—for their efforts to improve the legislation. I wholeheartedly support certain provisions in the current version of the bill, such as expanding time credits for good behavior, banning the shackling of women prisoners, and enhanced compassionate relief. But, unfortunately, these good provisions do not outweigh the potentially harmful provisions contained elsewhere in the bill. Perhaps more importantly, it is clear that prison reform alone will not ameliorate the crisis of mass incarceration unless we address the principal cause of the problem—unjust sentencing laws. As former Attorney General Eric Holder writes in today’s Washington Post: ‘‘To reform America’s prisons, we must change the laws that send people to them in the first place. Anything less represents a failure of leadership.’’ It is unfortunate that after waiting nearly 1
1⁄2years to take up the issue of criminal justice reform, the majority was unwilling to subject H.R. 5682 to a single legislative hearing or even bother to obtain a CBO score so we could understand its impact. I also do not believe we can simply accept as a reason not to change our sentencing laws opposition to sentencing reform by a Trump administration that changes its legislative positions on a near daily basis and that has already done so much to weaken and undermine the criminal justice system. Nor do I believe more balanced reform is not viable when Senator CHUCK  GRASSLEY , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told us: ‘‘For any criminal justice system proposal to win approval in the Senate, it must include . . . sentencing reforms.’’ Although I oppose this legislation, I remain fully committed to achieving balanced reform as part of an effort to make our criminal justice system more just and our constituents more safe. But I do not believe that passing this bill today would contribute to that goal. I therefore urge an opposition vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON). Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this FIRST STEP Act. I spent 17 years of my life representing people accused of crimes. b1315 Some of them are people whom I will never forget. One is a woman named Daniella. She had some prior misdemeanor offenses and was charged with possession of crack cocaine. She was looking at a sentence of about 60 months, based on the amount. She had a small child. There were no weapons involved. The prosecutors told her: If you tell on your boyfriend, we will take you to State court. If you don’t, we are taking you to Federal court. They took her to Federal court. And try as I did, she ended up getting 60 months of prison. She got taken away from her child. I remember the screams of that little boy as they walked his mother into custody. I cannot imagine asking her to stay in prison one day longer than she needed to. I cannot imagine not giving every opportunity to improve her life and her skills. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I do so with a lot of enthusiasm today. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ). Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in strong support of the FIRST STEP Act. I supported this bipartisan bill in committee because it will help more exoffenders reenter the workforce. It will reduce recidivism. The FIRST STEP Act is just a first step in fixing our criminal justice system. We all realize there is a lot more to do and a lot more we must do, but this is an important start. I would remind everyone that the bill allows prisoners to earn an additional 7 
days off their sentence each year they demonstrate good behavior. It funds important job training, drug treatment, and education services. It prohibits the shackling of pregnant women and improves compassionate release. These are all very good provisions. It will not only reduce recidivism; it will enhance the safety of our communities by making sure folks have the ability to enter drug treatment, enter job training, and avail themselves of educational services. These are all commonsense ideas. I hope that everyone will support this legislation. I want to thank, particularly, my colleague HAKEEM JEFFRIES for his strong leadership in these difficult negotiations, and I urge my colleagues to vote for the FIRST STEP and then commit themselves to continuing to build on this, because there is much more work to do in sentencing reform and criminal justice reform broadly. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. D AVIS). Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I commend the Judiciary Committee for its tremendous work in bringing this bill to the floor. They have put forth tremendous effort and tried every way they could think of to compromise. But notwithstanding the effort, I find myself not in a position to vote in favor of the bill. One of the reasons is that many of the organizations and groups with whom I have worked over the years are in opposition. They are people who are on the ground floor of criminal justice reform. They recognize that, if we are going to provide an opportunity to seriously reduce mass incarceration, we have to make provisions for individuals to regain some sense of reality regarding what got them into prison in the first place. I appreciate all of the efforts. I think we have got too much authority being given to the Attorney General. I wish we had been able to get closer to what people I work with daily would be in agreement with. Unfortunately, we did not. Unfortunately, I do not support passage of the bill, but I support continuing to work to find the real, hard nosed solutions that we need. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS), the chief sponsor of the legislation and a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Chairman BOBGOODLATTE , who has been a great supporter of working towards finding solutions. I think that is what we are here for today is finding solutions. I want to thank the chairman for working this, taking this, and moving forward on a lot of different fronts. But as we look forward, there are some things I want to clear up and some people I want to thank. With HAKEEM JEFFRIES , I couldn’t ask for a better partner to work with through the intricacies of big solutions and big problems. These are big problems. Mr. JEFFRIES and I have said: Let’s take a look and see what we can fix. What is going to be said today is: I like this legislation, I like parts of this legislation; I like the legislation, but it doesn’t go far enough; if it just did a little more—as if this place produced perfect results every time and we just want to wait. But I also would ask those who choose to vote ‘‘no’’ today, and my question is this: Is it okay to make progress on many other things but on this one say no? Say no to a family who has a family member in prison who could get treatment and get help? And when they come home—which over 90 percent of all prisoners in this country do, they come home—is it okay to say no to those folks, and say: No, we are not going to provide that for your family member; we are not going to provide extra treatment so that they can get help with addiction or work problems or anger management or skills deficits or education deficits? No, it is not. Is it okay today to vote ‘‘no’’ and say: I like a lot of this bill, but I want to continue to shackle women as they have babies? It is a pretty simple understanding. I get it. I want to see sentencing reform, too. I am on record as saying I do. I am on record as continuing past this to actually do that. Mr. JEFFRIES and I have talked about this more than we ever imagined we would. But Congressman JEFFRIES is a great partner in this effort. This bill is real and meaningful reform. Senator CORNYN and Senator WHITEHOUSE across the way in the Senate have taken steps to actually introduce the same bill and are working to do this. The President has said this is something that can be signed. In fact, the President, Mr. Speaker, last week, said that America is a nation that believes in second chances. The FIRST STEP Act gives those second chances. It gives us hope. It gives us an ability to look at people. As I have said on this issue many times, it is a money and moral issue. In States like Georgia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Texas, New York, and California, these issues have been discussed and evidencebased approaches have worked. We have seen it, Mr. Speaker, work in my home State of Georgia. We have seen an evidencebased approach be the way that you need to go. This bill provides the protection, and it also provides the incentive for this to work. Now, there have been many discussions on why we shouldn’t do this, and there have been many people in recent days coming forward. I think it is pretty amazing to me—and I am going to have to be honest here—for the former Attorney General to come out and say this is not enough and say that the current Department of Justice could do some of this, then I have one question for the former Attorney General: Where were you when you held the office? Why didn’t you do something then? If it was within your grasp, why did you turn a deaf ear to the cries of families who were in need? Why did you decide not to do something and now weigh in on something that Congressman JEFFRIES and many others have put their hearts and lives into and weigh in and say it is not enough? Look to those families, Mr. Former Attorney General, and tell them it is not enough. It is easy to write an oped. It must be a lot harder to do it when you have the job. So, as we look forward here, this is a positive piece of legislation. This is something that we can look forward to doing, when you have a chance to give those prisoners the opportunity to cut the very things down in their life that cause them to get there to start with. When we begin to look at the reasons they are there—and there are multiple—then we are taking a first step toward solutions, a first step toward hope, a first step toward making a difference so that we can then see, if we can take this first step, then maybe we can get some of our colleagues to take that next step into sentencing reform and other areas that we have already worked on, that the chairman has worked on, and others across in the Senate have advocated for. But if we choose not to do that today, you are saying no to the future. Congressman JEFFRIES and I believe yes to the future. I know that when we have worked on this, it is about what we can accomplish and how we can accomplish it in a way that is meaningful to others. When we look at this, I also find it rather interesting, Mr. Speaker, the groups that have come together here. As we went around talking about this, we went to so many different groups from the left and the right that say this is a great first step: Justice Action Network, American Conservative Union, FreedomWorks, FAMM, Prison Fellowship, Faith and Freedom Coalition, #cut50, Heritage Action for America, and many, many more both on the left and the right. The Koch Foundation and others have said this is good. This is something we can move on. This provides that hope that we are searching for. To the bill’s detractors, I respect your opinion. To the bill’s detractors, I would just say: Why not? If why not, why not here? And if why not and why you don’t want to here, when? Is it ever good enough? Can we ever get to a point? I think one of the things, Mr. Speaker, that we often deal with here is the art of the possible. Today is about the art of the possible. 
We have an administration that says: We will sign the bill. Jared Kushner has been such an advocate for this and worked with the administration to say: We will put forth the effort to make this work. We have partners in the Senate who say: We want to work and do even more. I am glad of that. And I have a partner here and many who have come alongside of us and have spoken to say: Let’s do something today. Today is about action. Today is about being a part of something bigger than ourselves. This is a day when we can come to the floor of this House and be proud of why we are here. So many times we come down and we look at the bill and we see paper and we see words on a paper. But I tell you what I see, Mr. Speaker: I see the faces of the families behind these words. I see the faces of the families behind these words that it is actually going to help. So when you look at this vote and you look at this bill, I say: Look beyond the pieces of paper, look beyond the ink, and look to the families that will be helped. When you cast that ‘‘yes’’ vote, you are saying: I want to do something, and I am not afraid to wait on something I might want but know that I can take a step further now. It is very simple: vote ‘‘yes’’ to move it along or vote ‘‘no’’ and say no to those in need. I can agree and disagree about a lot of parts, but this is about the people behind the bill. Before I go, Mr. Speaker, though, in addition to the committee, the chairman, and the committee staff who have been so great, a few weeks ago, I had the chance to talk about a staff member of mine as a steel magnolia. Today, Jon Ferro, from my staff, a New York native who works for a Georgia Member, has earned from me the highest praise. He is now, as you will see in all of the groups that have worked on this, a Bulldog. He has worked this over and over. He has worked it to find solutions. For that I am thankful, and for that I am proud. Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. You could come up with every reason you want to vote ‘‘no,’’ and that is okay, I guess; but remember, there are families watching today. There are incarcerated people watching today. My question is: Will you vote for them or will you vote to hold up something that may or may not happen? Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the FIRST STEP Act. There are thousands of women who are incarcerated while pregnant. My language in the FIRST STEP Act addresses the treatment of pregnant inmates and the use of shackles. The current system is based on a male model that fails to meet the physical and mental health needs of women. This is occurring at a time when women are the fastest growing population in our prisons and jails, increasing in number by over 700 percent since the 1980s. The treatment of incarcerated women is particularly glaring during pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum. Pregnant women must be provided appropriate prenatal care, which includes nutrition and housing. We can also agree it defies common sense and logic to use shackles on a woman who is delivering a baby. More than 22 States have restricted the use on pregnant women, yet the practice continues. This is despite no reported incidents of women attempting to escape when shackles are not used during childbirth. If anyone knows of a woman who is able to jump up while delivering and overcome an armed guard, I would certainly like to meet her. Women across the country have shared their horror stories about being pregnant or delivering while shackled. The experiences are as grim as you can imagine. One mother recounted being shackled after having an emergency C section. She was handcuffed and a chain was linked across her belly. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. CARTER of Georgia). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. b1330 Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. BASS. She stated: ‘‘With the weight on my stomach, it felt like they were ripping open my Csection.’’ We must institute Federal standards and educate correction officers, medical personnel, and pregnant inmates regarding the standard of care for pregnant women. Women must be a part of the debate on prison and sentencing reform. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to introducing additional legislation to highlight this issue. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, let me thank Congressman JEFFRIES and Congressman COLLINS for this FIRST STEP Act. Does it go as far as I would want it to go? It doesn’t. But is it a substantial step in the right direction? The answer is yes. When we start talking about prison reform, we start talking about ways to help those who are incarcerated, one, when they get out; two, to better themselves when they are already in. And one of the things we do in this bill is to allow movement of inmates closer to their families so that they can keep that family connection, so that they can continue to be a part of the family, which also reduces recidivism. We also fix the ‘‘good time’’ problem that has happened. For every 7 days that you increase good time, you save $50 million a year. Not only did we fix it this year, but we fixed the problem BOP interpreted in the law, contrary to congressional intent, in the first place. So this bill takes, I believe, a significant step in the right direction, not to mention the $250 million toward restorative justice and other ways. Hopefully, the savings from this bill will continue to go toward criminal justice and we will continue to take second and third steps. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES ), a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman GOODLATTE as well as several distinguished members of the Judiciary Committee—in particular, CEDRIC  RICHMOND and K AREN BASS—for their leadership on this issue and, of course, my good friend DOUGCOLLINS for being a phenomenal champion of improving the lives of currently incarcerated individuals, folks who have no time for political games. These are individuals who are in the system right now without hope, without opportunity, without a meaningful chance at transforming themselves. And the FIRST STEP Act will provide that. It will give them an opportunity to get educated now, give them an opportunity to get vocational training now, a GED now, a college education now, give them the opportunity to deal with their substance abuse problem now, mental health counseling now. Why would we possibly refuse that? These individuals are amongst the least, the lost, and the left behind. And we have an opportunity, in a bipartisan way, to make a difference in their lives in so many areas. Any objective reading of this bill is that it will improve their quality of life. And what is so wonderful about this is that you have the right and the left, conservatives and progressives, united in this effort. Nothing meaningful is ever easy, but the mass incarceration epidemic has been with us for almost 50 years. You will not just take one legislative magic wand and wipe it away in one shot. It will require sustained effort, sustained intensity, sustained commitment, and a meaningful first step. That is what this bill represents. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this effort to transform lives, save taxpayer dollars, and dramatically reduce recidivism now. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. J AYAPAL ), a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, there is one thing everybody agrees on, and that is that it is past time that we face the institutionalized racial inequity that is built into every single step of our mass incarceration system. We know that mass incarceration disproportionately affects people of color and that, today, women in prison are, sadly, the fastest growing demographic, frequently caught up with the arrests of their partners and struggling with mental health and addiction. This bill does take important steps forward, and I want to say that it is a very good faith effort on the part of the bill’s two sponsors: my friend HAKEEM  JEFFRIES and Representative D OUG COLLINS . Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, I still am not going to be able to support the bill because I have serious concerns about how the bill creates, develops, and implements a new risk assessment system on a very quick timeline by someone who, frankly, has spent his career opposing criminal justice reforms and, in fact, has fought attempts to advance racial justice, and that is Attorney General Sessions. This is especially concerning given that research shows us that risk assessments produce racial disparities. And this bill does not address sentencing reform, which is an issue that has bipartisan support and is the crux of the problem today. In addition, Mr. Speaker, I am very concerned about language in the bill that excludes immigrants from being eligible for time credits. The bill excludes longtime, legal permanent residents, green card holders, who may have committed the exact same crimes as others and may be eligible for relief under U.S. law. If we are making redemption available, shouldn’t it be available for everyone, regardless of immigration status, for the same set of crimes? Moreover, continued incarceration of these people simply based upon citizenship status is a waste of taxpayer dollars and unnecessarily keeps families separated. The reality is that these are deeply important issues, and this bill shows that we have the capacity to work in a bipartisan way. Even with all of the good work and even for a first step, unfortunately, I believe we have more work to do to get to the place where our morals are being consistently applied. I look forward to doing everything I can to work on this. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close whenever the gentleman from New York is, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I have one further speaker, and then I will be prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE), the distinguished ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to offer my appreciation for all of my colleagues—in particular, those who have offered this legislation. I recall, in the Congress preceding this, we offered a bipartisan combination of comprehensive criminal justice reform, took bills that included prison reform and sentencing reform, and were really on the way to passing that combination of very important partnership. Unfortunately, the politics of that time got in the way. But my appreciation to Mr. JEFFRIES  and Mr. COLLINS . It really is the coming together of Members. Mr. NADLER  worked very hard to inject very important provisions, as well as many other Members. And they even did so on the day of the markup. And all but one that Mr. RICHMOND , Ms. J ACKSON LEE, Ms. JAYAPAL , and Mrs. D EMINGS put in on retroactivity failed in the committee. So let me give an open letter to the mothers and fathers of incarcerated persons who are in our constituency and, as well, to those inmates who may, by chance, be looking at this debate. Having recently visited one of the Federal centers, I know that inmates are astute and concerned about their future. So I think it is important to establish to those parents why Democrats have consistently tried to sew together, tried to stitch together the idea of sentencing reduction and prison reform. Elements of this bill are striking and good. But to a mom, is it more exciting for you to know that your son, who had an excessive sentencing because of mandatory minimums, and you, who are incarcerated, have your sentence reduced than maybe on the back end? Now, it is important to note that all of those, if this bill is passed, will participate in the rehabilitation programs, but it is also important to note that the Bureau of Prisons has closed halfway houses. That is a component of this bill. And they have reduced and cut the numbers of individuals who are corrections officers to the extent that corrections officers feel endangered and that augmentation has been used. Augmentation means that nurses and teachers and others who are inside the prison are being used to augment the staff of correction officers which have been fired—or terminated, rather— under this administration. In a letter from the BOP union president, they indicated that they are severely understaffed and it would be difficult to implement this bill without those aspects being remedied—meaning more staff, more halfway houses, more money to implement this program. So many of my friends have asked me: What is the harm? Let me give you what is the harm. First, it would divert limited resources for programming by requiring a complex risk assessment process that would primarily benefit people deemed at a low or minimum risk of recidivism. That means, if you came in with a harsh drug sentence but through the years, Mom or Dad, you saw your son or daughter fix their lives, you would note that they, in fact, would not be eligible for this program. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, without provisions in the bill to reduce the excessive sentencing produced by mandatory minimums for drug offenses, overcrowding will still persist and thereby divert resources from programs to reduce recidivism. Let me be very clear: The corrections officers indicate they don’t have the staff. Halfway houses have been closed. In addition, it is documented that, if your son or daughter has an offense that was considered excluded and they have repaired their life, through the prison they have made changes, they will not be eligible—not for the programs, but they will not be eligible for relief. So it is a first step. But I would simply say: If it is the first step, why not protection of immigrants? And, also, why not have a sentencing reform hearing, which the Republicans have canceled because of my position on this bill? Let us work together for what is good, Mr. Speaker. Let us make a difference in the lives of all of the inmates. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 5682, the ‘‘FIRST STEP Act of 2018’’ and thank my colleagues, Mr. JEFFRIES and Mr. C OLLINS for bringing this forward. This legislation purports to help reduce recidivism for the millions of formerly incarcerated people that will return to our communities. I respectfully reserve the right to voice my concerns with this bill. First, as the NY Times editorial noted, ‘‘the biggest problem with the FIRST STEP Act is ....  what’s left out, specifically, sentencing reform.’’ Eric Holder said in the Washington Post, ‘‘by choosing a tepid approach, the prison reform bill abandons years of work and risks making it harder for Congress to advance more serious legislation in the future. Meaningful sentencing reform will be less likely to occur if the narrow prison bill is enacted.’’ Even President Trump specifically stated during his remarks at the White House Prison Reform Summit last Friday, ‘‘we want the finest prison reform bill that you could have anywhere.’’ I agree with the President on this, as I also want the finest prison reform bill. Hence, I will continue to fight for the very best legislation that will adequately address the nearly 650,900 formerly incarcerated people that will return to our communities a year. That’s not partisan or personal politics, but rather, common sense, just and equitable politics. Imagine you are a mother, child or loved one of an incarcerated person that was robbed by a system that played Russian roulette with his or her life because that system 
decided they were criminals rather than victims of a public health crisis during the crack epidemic. Now imagine that same system, rather than remediating the tragedy it caused in broken homes and communities through inept policies that had a racial and economic disparate impact, now seeks to pat them on the back and further insult an entire race by feeding them crumbs. As a mother or loved one, you would demand that the system cure the defect in those sentencing laws that would drastically reduce his or her time in custody, and apply justice equitably. Let’s not forget what happened in the 1964 Crime bill. Congress has the power to do that. We should hold ourselves accountable to deliver on the promise we made when we acknowledged the draconian policies implemented during the ‘‘War on Drugs’’ crisis, in passing the Fair Sentencing Act. Let’s finish what we started then, by appealing to our better angels and not crucify each other because we disagree. As Families Against Mandatory Minimum indicated in their letter, ‘‘sentencing reform should be included in any final justice reform package.’’ Second, even if the majority chose to ignore sentencing reform due to pressure, we cannot sit idly by and allow a slimfast version of prison reform when dealing with the lives of millions of people. I will not apologize for demanding more from my colleagues. I will not apologize for fighting with every breath I have to secure justice for those left behind. And I will not apologize for doing my job and shedding light where we may fall short, even when we have in good faith, tried our best. We will all go home tonight. What about those that have longed for that same freedom after they’ve paid their debts to society. We owe it to ourselves, to the thousands of broken families, and to our society, to give each inmate that will return to our community, their best chance at success, by providing them incentives that will get them home to their families sooner also. Even the bill’s supporter at markup said in their letter, ‘‘the bill unwisely reserves its incentivized programming for those who already pose little threat of reoffending’’, for example, those that would commit the sort of crimes alleged against Kushner and others within Trump’s orbit. The supporters go on to say, ‘‘We fear that the bill’s failure to direct incentivized programming to the group that needs it most will result in little or no reduction in recidivism, and, worse, that that failure will be blamed on prisoners rather than the bill’s mistaken design.’’ Most alarming here, is that great skepticism looms even in those who want to support this endeavor, because the reality is that the risk assessment tool is flawed. This Kushner/Trump bill amounts to nothing more than a false sense of hope for those who will never be released, due to either lack of shelter given the significant reduction in housing, or lack of eligibility per the warden. The wide latitude and discretion given to Sessions, a person who wholeheartedly opposes any form of effective criminal justice reform, and proponent of overcriminalization, will inevitably prove problematic for many who otherwise would benefit greatly from this measure with some modicum of oversight. We should take our time to include an independent committee that would serve as a bulwark in the development, implementation and recommendation process of such a program that will use novice and untested tools at the federal level. Why must we rush this process? Why not take our time to produce the finest prison reform bill anywhere as the President suggested? I visited and spoke directly to guards and wardens in the BOP. They told me they are severely understaffed and safety is paramount given the shortage in staff. The Director of BOP quit, in the middle of Trump’s Prison Reform Summit. All of these facts tell us to wait so that we could get it right. In NOBLE’s opposition letter to this bill they write: ‘‘a key concern is the ability of the Federal BOP and U.S. Attorney Offices to implement key elements of this legislation. In particular, it will require that U.S. Attorney Offices and BOP address their needs in staffing and funding. It is our opinion that the proposed $50 million of funding per year for five years will not support the bill’s expanded programming.’’ For these reasons I oppose this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. The Act does not include a single provision that will reduce the prison time of persons who are serving unfair sentences for lowlevel offenses. Even supporters of the bill like FAMM states, ‘‘sentencing reform should be included in any final justice reform package.’’ The Act uses an untested and potentially racially and socially discriminatory risk assessment to identify individuals who are eligible to earn credits, which primarily depends on static factors that correlate with socioeconomic class and race, such as criminal history, to assess the risk. Therefore, it will likely fail to reduce crime or mass incarceration. The Act’s exclusions would likely have a disparate impact on racial minorities because the bill excludes individuals convicted of certain categories of offenses from redeeming credits towards early release, even if they successfully complete the program. The Act leaves it to the discretion of prison wardens to determine who can use their credits and when. Early release would be into a halfway house system which is so underfunded that there is no bed space. Therefore, it will be unlikely that prisoners can truly be released given the reality of the current halfway house system. The Act gives a false sense of hope because it wraps the empty promise of prison reform around exclusions and wide breadth of discretion to a fullthroated opponent to prison reform, policing reform and sentencing reform, in Jeff Sessions. BOP already has broad authority to implement the positive provisions of the bill, but has opted not to and Sessions cannot be trusted to implement these provisions. The FIRST STEP Act includes a list of prisoners who are ineligible for time credits if they participate in recidivism reduction programs by virtue of their convictions for certain offenses.

ONCIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS , Washington, DC, May 21, 2018. VOTE‘‘NO’’ ONTHEFIRST STEP A CT DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the 109 undersigned organizations, we write to urge you to vote NO on The FIRST STEP Act (H.R. 5682). While well intentioned, this bill takes a misguided approach to reforming our federal justice system. Without question, we appreciate the inclusion of some promising provisions to address some of the problems in the federal prison system, however, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) already has broad authority to make the majority of these changes through administrative action. In sum, this bill falls short on its promise to ‘‘meaningfully’’ tackle the problems in the federal justice system—racial disparities, draconian mandatory minimum sentences, persistent overcrowding, lack of rehabilitation, and the exorbitant costs of incarceration. Decisions we make now through this bill could have deep implications for our ability to impact the abiding and deepening harms that lead to mass incarceration. As such, we continue to have several, grave concerns with The FIRST STEP Act, including: The Dangerous ‘‘Risk Assessment System’’: The Act purports to offer people in prison the chance to ‘‘earn time credits’’ towards early release to prerelease custody— but by building and placing a ‘‘risk and needs assessment’’ algorithm in the hands of the Attorney General—one not required to be designed or tailored for the individuals it is meant to judge—we risk embedding deep racial and class bias into decisions that heavily impact the lives and futures of federal prisoners and their families. Researchers have shown that risk assessment tools applied in sentencing decisions in Florida—meant to predict recidivism—were twice as likely to be wrong when evaluating Black people as White people. One of the first independent studies analyzing the use of risk assessment in pretrial showed that decisionmakers using risk assessment tools—in this case, Kentucky judges—ignored their results over time, while also overseeing an increase in failurestoappear at court and an increase in pretrial arrests. A further recent analysis showed that risk assessment tools are as accurate as a prediction made by a random human selected over the Internet. We cannot introduce algorithmic risk assessment into the assignment of housing and release decisions or rehabilitative opportunities without sufficient transparency, independent testing for decarceral and antiracist results prior to implementation, and regular effective oversight for not just what the tool purports to predict, but how decisionmakers in our prison system use it. The Act uses ‘‘risk assessments’’ in an untested manner. It fails to ensure transparency, independent testing, or analysis of the proposed risk assessment system or its results prior to its adoption or implementation. And again, it doesn’t require the tool to be designed or tailored for the individuals it is meant to judge. Without these things, and in the hands of the nation’s most prominent proponent of a punishing, rather than a rehabilitative criminal justice system, ‘‘risk assessments’’ will further embed racism into the meting out of resources that could change prisoners’ lives—like access to treatment, work, and most importantly, the ability to earn time off of a sentence. The Overbroad List of Exclusions: The majority of people in prison will eventually be released. Categorically excluding entire groups of people from receiving earlyrelease credits will undermine efforts to reduce prison overcrowding and improve public safety since such exclusions weaken the incentive to participate in recidivismreduction programming. Furthermore, many of these exclusions, such as those based on immigrationrelated offenses, could have a disproportionate impact on people of color. The Overbroad Discretion Provided to Attorney General Sessions: The bill gives broad authority to the Attorney General and would rely upon implementation by this administration. Despite assurances to the contrary, this administration has failed to take any active steps to improve the justice system, has dismantled existing protections, and has shown outright hostility to people of color and other historically marginalized communities. Furthermore, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a wellknown, longtime opponent of sentencing and prison reform. It would be unwise and harmful to vest so much discretion in an Attorney General so hostile to meaningful justice reform. The Misplaced Incentive System: Effectively reducing recidivism requires targeting those most likely to reoffend with rehabilitative programming. Yet, under this bill, only ‘‘minimum’’ and ‘‘lowrisk’’ prisoners would be able to redeem their earned time credits, and they would earn more credits than prisoners categorized as ‘‘medium’’ or ‘‘highrisk.’’ Given that time credits would also be subject to denial by the BOP warden and they are not real time off of a sentence but rather a flawed mechanism to transition into a decreasing number of halfway houses or to home confinement that is rarely used by BOP, the bill is unlikely to provide the incentives that would meaningfully reduce recidivism. Allows for the privatization of certain public functions and allows private entities to profit from incarceration. The bill retains a provision that in order to expand programming and productive activities, the Attorney General shall develop policies for wardens of each BOP facility to enter into partnerships with private entities and industrysponsored organizations. The Absence of Appropriations for Implementation: The resources needed to expand programming authorized under the bill have not been—and may never be—appropriated. In fact, Congress could decide today, absent this legislation, that prison programming should be funded and increase the BOP’s budget by $50 million a year for the next five 
years. Instead, the FY19 BOP budget calls for a reduction. Furthermore, the recidivism reduction programming that currently exists in the federal prison system is grossly underfunded and not enough to serve those currently incarcerated. Therefore, without any guarantees that the necessary funding will be appropriated, this bill is an empty promise. The Undetermined Human and Fiscal Impact: It is unclear what the fiscal impact of this bill will be, given that the Congressional Budget Office has not released a score for the bill. Moreover, it is unclear what the human impact of this bill will be, given that neither the BOP nor the U.S. Sentencing Commission has produced updated estimates on the number of people projected to be impacted by the legislation. Proponents argue that at least 4,000 people will be impacted by the good time fix alone; however, relying on that number is misleading because it is based upon data that is over a decade old. No hearings have been held and there is no CBO score available in order to explore these questions further. The Omission of Sentencing Reform: Sentencing reform and prison reform are both important, but one will not work without the other. Meaningful reform requires both. Furthermore, advancing prison reform as a standalone will undermine longstanding, bipartisan efforts in the Senate to advance a comprehensive justice reform package that includes sentencing reform. Last week, we were joined by over 70 civil rights organizations in opposing this wellintentioned, but misguided legislation at the House Judiciary Committee markup. Many of our concerns were also shared by the American Federation of Government Employees representing 33,000 federal correctional workers in the Bureau of Prisons, as well as Representatives Lewis, Jackson Lee, and Senators Durbin, Booker, and Harris in a recent Dear Colleague letter. While we appreciate the inclination to support legislation that endeavors to reform our prison system, we believe that this particular bill would do more harm than good and would have unintended consequences that ripple into the future. Finally, if presented with one choice, ‘‘to take what we can get now,’’ then we must ensure that ‘‘what we get’’ will not perpetuate the existing harms of mass incarceration or give false hope to the men and women languishing in prison and the communities we represent. Our communities are being demonized and criminalized so we must stand firm to resist the lure of a compromise that is ultimately a false promise that may never be realized and isn’t in their best interests. For the foregoing reasons, we urge you to vote ‘‘No’’ on the FIRST STEP Act and The Leadership Conference will include your position on the bill in our voting scorecard for the 115th Congress.

T HESENTENCING PROJECT , Washington, DC, May 21, 2018. Re FIRST STEP Act, H.R. 5682, falls far short of meaningful criminal justice reform. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. CHARLES E. S CHUMER , U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN, M AJORITY LEADER  MCCONNELL AND MINORITY LEADERS PELOSI  
AND SCHUMER : As Congress prepares to consider the FIRST STEP Act, I write to express The Sentencing Project’s significant concerns regarding the bill’s deficiencies in addressing the overcrowding, staffing and programming crisis within the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Reform of the federal prison and sentencing system is long overdue and The Sentencing Project has been at the forefront of promoting comprehensive recommendations to ensure a more humane, fair and proportional system for more than two decades. Unfortunately, H.R. 5683 falls short of these objectives in two key areas. First, it would divert limited resources for programming by requiring a complex risk assessment process that would primarily benefit people deemed at a low or minimal risk of recidivating. Second, without provisions in the bill to reduce the excessive sentencing produced by mandatory minimums for drug offenses, overcrowding will persist and thereby divert resources from programs to reduce recidivism. The federal prison system currently operates at 14 percent above capacity, and at higher rates at high and medium security institutions, 24 percent and 18 percent respectively. Along with an ‘‘inmate to correctional officer’’ ratio among the highest in the country at 8.9 to 1, prison safety concerns are at critical levels. Indeed, the rate for some types of assaults in federal prisons has steadily increased since 2014. In order to successfully reform the federal prison system, including improving conditions of confinement in areas such as medical and mental health care, and to comprehensively rehabilitate instead of warehouse the people confined within, Congress should adopt policies to reduce the population, invest in correctional and programming staff, and fully fund programming for all incarcerated people. H.R. 5682 would authorize only $50 million per year to carry out the bill’s mandates to create a risk assessment tool to determine earned time credit eligibility, and expand programming and community corrections capacity. While The Sentencing Project supports the bill sponsors’ stated intentions to reform prisons, their promises of change ring hollow. For example, the bill excludes thousands of people in prison from benefiting from the programming incentives that allow for earlier transition into community corrections. By doing so it conflicts with research that demonstrates that prison programming and associated incentives are most costeffective when provided to the highest risk groups. Current authorization levels will only scratch the surface in overcoming the huge deficit of programming at the BOP. Indeed, the waiting list for the BOP’s literacy program alone is 16,000. Moreover, because of overcrowding and staff shortages, many programming staff are regularly required to 
augment correctional officer duties, resulting in fewer programming opportunities. This staffing shortage may partly explain why the number of people completing their GED dropped by 59 percent between FY2016 and FY2017. Congress must take more determined and thoughtful steps to change this dire situation. The Sentencing Project is pleased by the growing bipartisan consensus among lawmakers to prioritize change in the nation’s criminal justice system. We will continue to be a part of this conversation and look forward to strengthening effective bipartisan reforms to achieve shared goals of justice, fairness and safety. Sincerely, MARCMAUER , Executive Director. 
[From the Washington Post, May 21, 2018] THERE ’SSOMETHING HUGEMISSING FROM THE  WHITE HOUSE ’SPRISON BILL (By Eric H. Holder Jr.) Over the past decade, Republicans and Democrats across the country have joined forces to advocate for a fairer, more effective criminaljustice system—one that would keep us safe while reducing unnecessary mass incarceration. At the heart of that effort has been an attempt to reduce overly punitive sentences that fill our prisons for no discernible publicsafety rationale. But now the Trump administration is pushing a misguided legislative effort—likely to be voted on in the House this week— that threatens to derail momentum for sentencing reform. The bill is a tempting half measure, but lawmakers should resist the lure. The chance to implement real, comprehensive reform may not come again any time soon. It’s easy to miss, but the push for bipartisan sentencing reform has slowly been gaining strength. It was nothing short of remarkable when Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R– Iowa) led the Senate Judiciary Committee this past February to approve a measure that would revise the federal government’s outdated federal mandatory minimum sentences. Grassley’s move—in direct defiance of the administration—was the most significant legislative step toward federal criminal justice reform in decades. Unfortunately, this progress has hit a roadblock with the Trump administration’s modest prison reform bill, called the First Step Act. The bill seeks to improve prison conditions—such as by requiring that inmates be housed within 500 driving miles of their families and by prohibiting shackles on pregnant women. It also includes education, job training and other personal development programs, as well as a system of incentives to participate in the programs. These narrow reforms are important, but they do not require congressional action, nor do they deliver the transformative change we need. The only way to do that is by amending the bill to include comprehensive, bipartisan sentencing reform. Why is this so important? The statistics are stark and, by now, wellknown. The United States has 5 percent of the world’s population, but 25 percent of its prisoners. Mass incarceration is a core civil rights struggle for this generation: One in three black men will be behind bars at some point, a disparity that perpetuates underemployment in the black community and contributes to the racial wealth gap. The system is hugely expensive and ultimately unfair. And it is not necessary to prevent and punish crime. It is impossible to right this wrong unless we send the right people to prison for appropriate lengths of time. That starts by making sure that federal prison sentences are smart on crime rather than thoughtlessly ‘‘tough.’’ The Justice Department worked toward that goal when I led the agency under President Barack Obama, blunting the impact of harsh mandatory minimum sentences by directing federal prosecutors to seek lower charges when possible. It worked. The federal prison population dropped while the nation continued to experience nearrecord low crime rates. As Grassley’s support shows, this is not just a priority for Democrats. He worked with Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D–Ill.) and others to advance the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which would reduce some mandatory minimum sentences. The bill failed in 2016 as a victim of electionyear politics, but when Grassley doggedly brought it up again in February, it passed through the committee by a vote of 16 to 5, with support from several members of his own party. Republicans and Democrats are enacting bold sentencing reforms at the state level, too. Texas, Oklahoma and Massachusetts are just a few of the states that have made changes to cut back on overly punitive mandatory minimum sentences. Unfortunately, the White House has different ideas. President Trump warned of ‘‘American carnage’’ in his inaugural address, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions has stoked false and misleading claims of rising crime. Bowing to the president’s most extreme allies, the White House has put forward the First Step Act, which leaves out sentencing reform entirely. By choosing a tepid approach, the prison bill abandons years of work and risks making it harder for Congress to advance more serious legislation in the future. Meaningful sentencing reform will be less likely to occur if the narrow prison bill is enacted. Fortunately, lawmakers have time to change course. They can ensure that any legislation includes sentencing reform, on which there is such strong consensus. Progressive lawmakers in particular should fight to extend, not abandon, the Obama administration’s criminaljustice legacy. Conservative allies such as Grassley have stepped forward for a shared strategy and needed policies; Democrats should stand with them. Nobody is under any illusions: Criminal justice reform is hard. The White House might scuttle the bill entirely, and wavering members of Congress might balk. But to reform America’s prisons, we must change the laws that send people to them in the first place. Anything less represents a failure of leadership. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close if the other side is, and I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in spite of the good intentions of this bill, I believe the restrictions in the incentive system it would create with respect to recidivism reduction programming could compound the injustices that occur at earlier stages of the criminal justice process; that its approval would lessen the odds of achieving sentencing reform; and that, on balance, the negatives outweigh the positives of this bill. A broad spectrum of dozens of civil rights and other organizations agree and oppose this bill, including the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the ACLU, the NAACP, the NAACP Legal and Education Defense Fund, the American Federation of Federal Government Employees Council of Prison Locals, the National Immigration Law Center, and Human Rights Watch. For the reasons I have outlined today, I reluctantly oppose H.R. 5682 and ask that my colleagues do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to not oppose this very important piece of legislation before us today. It appears their opposition to the legislation is based upon what is not in the legislation rather than what is actually in it. I don’t believe there is a single provision in the bill that they oppose. b1345 In fact, many of the provisions in this bill are there because they specifically asked for them. For example, Democrats asked for a fix to the way the Bureau of Prisons calculates good time credit. We made changes to clarify congressional intent on that section. They also asked for language on the risk assessments to ensure that dynamic factors were used to evaluate a prisoner’s risk of recidivating. That request was honored. Various pilot programs and a prohibition of shackling pregnant inmates were also placed in the legislation at the request of Democrats. Good requests, good changes, and these are only a few of the many requests that were honored. Voting against this meaningful and important bill is a disservice to those men and women currently incarcerated and their families. It is a disservice to those great men and women who work in our Bureau of Prisons, and it is a disservice to the American people. The vast majority of those incarcerated are going to get out one day. Let’s make sure they have the tools and the resources to successfully reenter society. H.R. 5682 does just that. I urge my colleagues to support the FIRST STEP Act, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of H.R. 5682, the FIRST STEP Act. While I support several provisions in the legislation, including prohibiting shackling of pregnant inmates, requiring that individuals be incarcerated closer to their families, and clarifying good time calculations, I cannot support other provisions of the legislation. I strongly believe the House should be working to ensure that once convicted individuals have paid their debt to society they have the skills and support to reintegrate into society, but this bill puts in place too many barriers to that goal. The bill excludes undocumented individuals, including those who remained in the United States longer than authorized from the recidivism reduction programming. Worse, the bill also excludes some lawful permanent residents from the program and could trigger their 
removal. The bill also excludes those who have been convicted of drug crimes, including marijuana related convictions. Given that immigrant and minority communities make up a disproportionate share of immigration and drug related offenders in the criminal justice system, these exclusions will by their very nature exclude those who most need the benefits of the bill. Finally, any conversation about reducing recidivism must include sentencing reform that would keep low risk nonviolent offenders out of prison in the first place and address our draconian federal mandatory minimum laws. Mr. Speaker, we can do better, and we must do better if we are to address this issue. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, first I would like to acknowledge the gentleman from Georgia, Representative DOUGCOLLINS , and the gentleman from New York, Representative HAKEEM JEFFRIES , for their hard work and dedication in improving this bill over the last several weeks. Historically, the United States of America has been plagued with serious, fundamental problems within our criminal justice system. For far too long, policymakers have chosen to play politics and disapprove of common sense policy that is specifically geared towards reducing crime by instead enacting socalled ‘‘tough on crime’’ slogans and soundbites, such as ‘‘three strikes and you’re out,’’ ‘‘mandatory minimum sentencing,’’ and even rhymes such as, ‘‘you do the adult crime, you do the adult time.’’ These policies may sound appealing, but their impact ranges from a negligible reduction in crime to an actual increase in crime. Turning to the bill we are debating today, I recognize that the FIRST STEP Act includes a fix to the calculation of good time credit, which I have sought for many years. Calculating good time credit as Congress had originally intended is a serious improvement made by this bill. This bill also improves the auditing process for enforcing the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) to protect prisoners from sexual assault. It places prohibitions on shackling pregnant and postpartum women. The bill expands the use and transparency of compassionate release for terminally ill prisoners. It also requires the federal Bureau of Prisons to house prisoners closer to their primary residence, so they can maintain ties to their family and community. And there is a significant investment in programs designed to reduce recidivism. But process is essential to crafting an effective bill. There were no hearings on this bill. Nor has a CBO score been done. Nor has a prison impact analysis been prepared. And it is obvious that experts had little to do with drafting the bill. As a result of this process, there are several problems with the bill. First, the version of the bill we are voting on today is unnecessarily complicated by the use of a risk assessment tool. I have reached out to experts in the field of prison reform, and I have not found anyone who will say that risk assessment tools should be used to determine which prisoners can use time credits to gain early release from prison. Instead, they suggest that simply increasing programming for everyone will reduce recidivism and the complicated risk assessments are unnecessary and will stand in the way of reducing recidivism for many prisoners. The risk assessment process may also exacerbate existing racial disparities in the federal prison system. Second, experts have raised serious concerns about excluding groups of prisoners from this program who we know will be released from prison and therefore should be involved in the program. Third, there are questions of cost and funding. The Bureau of Prisons has cut contracts with halfway houses and terminated 6,000 correctional officers. This bill cannot achieve its goals without an adequately staffed prison system, as well as sufficient space at halfway houses. Even in the absence of hearings and experts, we can see that some of the opposition to this bill is almost comical, because it is lodged by advocates who support other legislation that carries the same provisions that are either similar to or worse than what they complain about in the FIRST STEP Act. Others oppose the bill because it does not include sentencing reform and therefore does not address mass incarceration. Unfortunately, the bill those advocates hold up as ‘‘sentencing reform’’ fails to make any meaningful reduction in mass incarceration, and may in fact add to mass incarceration. It is in the context of this absurd process that we have to vote on this legislation. Unfortunately, without the appropriate analysis, we can only guess about its impact. Based on that guess, it is my determination that no prisoner will be worse off, but many may be significantly better off, under the FIRST STEP Act. I expect that public safety will be enhanced by this bill, because more people will receive programming to reduce their likelihood to commit future crimes. Although this is a shameful process, I will therefore support the bill. Mr. Speaker, as the process moves forward, I hope that the sponsors of this legislation will continue to improve it, based on evidence and research. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today the House is expected to consider H.R. 5682—the Formerly Incarcerated Reenter Society Transformed Safely Transitioning Every Person Act or FIRST STEP Act. This bill represents a good faith effort to improve the reintegration of incarcerated individuals back into their communities and reduce recidivism. In this political climate, we must always strive to achieve meaningful reforms wherever possible. I believe that the FIRST STEP Act will do just that and I intend to vote for this measure when it is considered on the floor. I acknowledge that this is not a perfect bill. Very few are, if any. However, the STEP Act will offer a new opportunity for incarcerated individuals to participate in evidencebased programming to reduce their likelihood of recidivism. It is a bill that is supported by prominent civil rights and criminal justice reform organizations such as the National Urban League and the Texas Criminal Justice Coalition. It passed the House Judiciary Committee on a 25–5 vote, and I feel even more confidently about its passage on the House floor. Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that this Congress can do more to not only reduce recidivism through ‘‘backend reform,’’ but also engage in ‘‘frontend reform’’ to keep individuals out of prison in the first place. However, we must consider a bill entirely on its merits and not just oppose a measure because it does not go far enough in its reforms. The FIRST STEP Act is exactly that—a first step to make meaningful and impactful changes to our prison system. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5682, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
AUTHORIZING USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR GREATER WASHINGTON SOAP BOX DERBY Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 113) authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: 
H. C ON. RES. 113 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
SECTION 1. USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR SOAP BOX DERBY RACES. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association (in this resolution referred to as the ‘‘sponsor’’) shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, soap box derby races (in this resolution referred to as the ‘‘event’’), on the Capitol Grounds. (b) DATE OF EVENT .—The event shall be held on June 16, 2018, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate jointly designate. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Under conditions to be prescribed by the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board, the event shall be— (1) free of admission charge and open to the public; and (2) arranged not to interfere with the needs of Congress. (b) EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES .—The sponsor shall assume full responsibility for all 
expenses and liabilities incident to all activities associated with the event. 
Subject to the approval of the Architect of the Capitol, the sponsor is authorized to erect upon the Capitol Grounds such stage, sound amplification devices, and other related structures and equipment as may be required for the event. 
The Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board are authorized to make such additional arrangements as may be required to carry out the event. 
The Capitol Police Board shall provide for enforcement of the restrictions contained in section 5104(c) of title 40, United States Code, concerning sales, advertisements, displays, and solicitations on the Capitol Grounds, as well as other restrictions applicable to the Capitol Grounds, with respect to the event. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) and the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 113. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 113 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the annual Greater Washington Soap Box Derby in June. The mission of the Soap Box Derby is to build knowledge and character in our children and to teach them fair and honest competition. This American tradition, started in 1934, encourages kids to be creative and teaches them problemsolving and engineering skills. I am pleased this tradition continues, including in my home State of Pennsylvania. Winners from this local competition will join winners of other races in competing at the world championship in Akron, Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I share the enthusiasm of the chairman for the Soap Box Derby. I speak in favor of this resolution. I also want to thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ) for introducing this resolution every Congress on behalf of the Washington regional delegation. This annual competitive event encourages boys and girls, ages 7 through 20, to construct, operate, and then race their very own soap box vehicles. It has become a great tradition here in the Nation’s Capital, and it has been going on for over 20 years. It provides a terrific opportunity for children to appreciate the workmanship, the craftsmanship, the time, the effort that goes into the construction of these vehicles, and then they get to enjoy the thrill of the race and competition. The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby organizers will work with the Architect of the Capitol and with the Capitol Police to ensure that the appropriate rules and regulations are in place and that the event remains free to the public. I want to encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and then to come out on June 16 to participate in this exciting event. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), my colleague and leader. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. TITUS, and I thank the chairman for bringing the bill to the floor. I rise in strong support. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor every year that I have the opportunity to introduce this resolution and to support it on the floor. I just heard the remarks of the gentlewoman from Nevada. I thank her very much for her support, and I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his remarks. This is the 77th year our region’s Soap Box Derby will be a fun and educational event that brings families together. It will be held on Saturday, June 16, as I am sure has already been said, and you will see soap box racers from ages 8 to 17 compete in three divisions: stock, super stock, and masters. The winner from each one of these divisions, Mr. Speaker, will go on to compete at the national AllAmerican Soap Box Derby, held each year in Akron, Ohio. I was very proud of last year’s winners from Maryland’s Fifth District, 11 yearolds Ian Jameson in the stock class and Ryan Jameson in super stock. These twin brothers are from Hollywood, Maryland, the county in which I live, which is the most southern county in our State. They worked hard on their soap box racers, as did all the other young people who participated. Ian Jameson went on to win fourth place at the AllAmerican Soap Box Derby in Akron. Maryland’s Fifth District has been home to several Greater Washington Soap Box Derby champions in recent years, including the winners from 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, and 2014. Is there any doubt in any Member’s mind why I am so supportive of the Soap Box Derby? We do very well in the derby. Our racers even won national championships in 2007 and 2008. I feel confident that the Fifth District racers will continue to shine this year. Soap box derbies have been called the greatest amateur racing event in the world. They have a long tradition in our country, and many Americans carry fond memories of building soap box racers with their parents or other relatives when they were young. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in strong support of this AllAmerican activity that will happen right here on the Nation’s Capitol Hill. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, as you know, I represent Las Vegas. I am not sure we can take bets on the Soap Box Derby in Las Vegas, but I would say the odds are in favor of somebody from your district winning if it does occur. We have no other speakers, and so I just urge my colleagues to vote in favor. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 113. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. Speaker, for far too long, far too many people in our country have struggled to make ends meet. They have struggled to buy a car. They have struggled to buy a home. They have struggled—they have struggled for their version of the American Dream. I hear from these people frequently, Mr. Speaker. I hear from Colton in Terrell, Texas, who said that he and his wife have been unable to get a mortgage due to credit and that they were 25, 30 years old and they had good credit but they were getting denied. They needed a home to provide a sense of stability, but they couldn’t get it due to Washington’s bureaucratic regulations. Mr. Speaker, I heard from Dirk in Dallas. He said he used to have a $100,000 line of credit from his bank. He had an unsecured signature line of credit that he used for working capital for his small business. He often paid it down to zero, and cash flow was ample, but then the bank canceled it because of the bureaucratic government burden on the banking system. I heard from Sherry in Eustace, who said: After a divorce 4 years ago, I needed to buy a car because my car was over 10 years old. I had a checking account in my name at my credit union, but they didn’t loan me money for the car. 
b1400 Mr. Speaker, we hear these stories far too often. The Main Street banks and credit unions that these people depend on have been suffering for years under the weight, the load, the volume, the complexity, and the cost of heavy Washington bureaucratic red tape. They haven’t been able to serve these people to help get them into homes and to help get them into cars. As one west Texas banker told me, Mr. Speaker: ‘‘My major risks are not credit risks, risk of theft, or risk of some robber coming in with a gun in my office, my number one risk is regulatory risk.’’ We have been losing a community bank or credit union every other day in America and, with it, the hopes and dreams of millions. But today, that changes. Help is on the way with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. Mr. Speaker, this is the most pro growth banking bill in a generation. You would have to go back to 1999 to GrammLeachBliley. Although we didn’t have a formal conference with the Senate, I am proud that over half of the bills in this package, including threequarters of the regulatory relief provisions, came from the House. These are the provisions to help hardworking, struggling taxpayers get into home mortgages, get into car loans, and get into their small businesses. This is what will help drive 3 percent economic growth, which is the birthright of all Americans. Today is an important day in the history of economic opportunity in America, and I encourage all of us to support the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, before I get into the remarks that I prepared, I think I had better share this information with my colleagues. The FDIC released its quarterly banking profile today for the first quarter of 2018, and reported that banks made more money than they ever have. $56 billion in profits in a single quarter represents a 27.5 percent surge compared to 2017. Some of these profits came from that socalled tax bill that we passed, which we know was the Republican tax scam law. 
Democrats passed the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to prevent another financial crisis and protect consumers, investors, and our economy. The 2008 financial crisis resulted in 9 million people losing their jobs, 11 million people losing their homes to foreclosure, and the loss of $13 trillion in wealth. It was an economic catastrophe that must never be repeated. Now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are determined to help this President dismantle reforms that are designed to protect us from that kind of devastation to communities. Republicans are trying to pass this bill off as an effort solely designed to benefit small community banks. But the truth is, the bill is packed with poisonous provisions that benefit the megabanks like Wells Fargo and companies like Equifax. It also weakens critical mortgage protections to ensure borrowers can afford their loans, and prevent discrimination and fraud. One of the most harmful elements of this bill is its weakening of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, referred to as HMDA, which is a key tool to detect and prevent discriminatory practices in the mortgage market. S. 2155 would allow 85 percent of depository institutions to avoid ever having to report new HMDA data required by Dodd Frank, even though they are already collecting the data, badly undermining efforts to ensure fair lending. But that is not all. This bill guts many of the protections Democrats put in place to reduce the risk of bank failures and bailouts and ensure that bank failures don’t bring down the economy. It weakens stress tests and capital requirements for big banks, and undermines supervision of large foreign banks like Deutsche Bank. There is more. Despite Equifax’s carelessness in exposing the personal data of 148 million Americans, S. 2155 rewards Equifax and the other two national credit bureaus by funneling more business their way. It also takes away Active Duty servicemembers’ rights to sue the credit bureaus, even if the bureaus fail to provide required free credit monitoring, or notify them of scams involving their personal information. Mr. Speaker, these are just some of the many ways the bill would be harmful. Republicans have stacked the bill with provisions that have nothing to do with benefiting hardworking Americans and everything to do with helping out Wall Street. Donald Trump and the Republicans already gave a huge gift to big corporations with the tax scam, which came at the expense of hardworking Americans. Now they are pushing this rotten giveaway to Wall Street and big banks that harms consumers and increases the risk of another financial crisis. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. L UETKE MEYER ), the leading voice in Congress on trying to bring rationality to the SIFI designation and accountability to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman HENSARLING for his commitment to regulatory relief. We wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for his diligence and for the hard work of all of the great folks of the Financial Services Committee, on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, in the wake of the financial crisis the American people needed regulatory relief that would lift the economy. Instead, Congress responded with a framework that increased the cost of financial products, restricted access to loans, and redistributed credit from the middleincome borrowers to the highincome borrowers. Today, too many consumers are left struggling to get the tools they need to achieve financial independence. S. 2155 is a big step in the right direction. The majority of the provisions included in the bill come from bipartisan Housepassed measures, several of which were included in my CLEARR Act. Despite what rhetoric we might hear today, American borrowers are going to benefit from the relief that extends from this bill. However, the conversation cannot end with S. 2155. While the provisions in this legislation are granting important relief, there is so much more to be done. The Financial Services Committee has marked up more than 100 bills this Congress, many of which have the support of the ranking member and deserve to be considered by our colleagues in the Senate. We have to continue to rightsize regulation so that it is based not just on size or a single arbitrary factor, but on thoughtful analysis of an institution’s business model and risk profile. Mr. Speaker, arbitrary figures don’t necessarily guarantee a financial system. Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, the chairman for his diligent work on this fine bill, and ask my colleagues to support S. 2155. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me repeat: The FDIC released its quarterly banking profile today for the first quarter of 2018, and reported that banks made more money than they ever have. I have to say this over and over again: $56 billion in profits in a single quarter represents a 27.5 percent surge compared to 2017. Some of these profits came from the tax scam bill that was passed. These banks are just greedy. They will never get enough. They want to do away with DoddFrank because Dodd Frank is protecting consumers from their fraud. Look how much money they are making. All they will tell you is this is all about community banks. But let me just tell you that community banks, credit unions, and the economy are doing great with Dodd Frank reforms in place. The banking industry keeps making record profits, an average of $167 billion in annual profits in the last 3 years. Banks have increased lending to businesses by 80 percent since 2010. Community banks are outperforming larger banks in increased lending. Credit unions are growing and have increased lending by more than 10 percent in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Mr. Speaker, what more do they want? How much more money do they want from consumers? What is it they would have us do? What is it they would have us get rid of in DoddFrank that is protecting the average consumer, everyday working people? What would they have us do so that they can make more money? Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA ), the lead voice in the House for capital formation for our startups and small businesses, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment. Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, like in Michigan, like so many other places around the country, in 2008, we saw a massive economic downturn where people lost their jobs, lost their savings, and some even lost their homes. The Obama administration and their allies in Congress put forward a very flawed solution, which was called DoddFrank, which led to the slowest, weakest recovery in modern history. The American people were sold a bill of goods. Now what Congress is trying to do is get at the root cause. That is not what they had done before. They had denied hardworking families the economic recovery that they deserve. Economic growth stalled as access to basic financial services became less and less available to small businesses and lower income Americans. And America’s small and mediumsized community financial institutions were saddled with a crushing regulatory burden. We are changing that in this bipartisan bill. Instead of ending toobigtofail, this regulatory monstrosity, called Dodd Frank, enshrined toosmalltosucceed. On average, we are losing a community financial institution a day because of the extensive burdens placed on them by this onesizefitsall regulatory structure. These crushing regulations have made it more difficult for consumers to access credit to buy a car, realize homeownership, save for retirement, plan for their kids to go to college, climb the ladder of opportunity, and grow their small businesses, which are critical to growing our economy. Today’s bill, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, begins to provide relief to consumers and small businesses on 
Main Street. This bipartisan bill is combined with the momentum created by the tax reform bill that we had done previously. This bipartisan bill will continue to unleash American innovation, jobs, and capital, while supporting economic growth. Now, you may have just heard that this is a Republican plan only. Wrong. Sixtyseven votes in the Senate, including my two Democrat Senators from Michigan, voted for this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this historic progrowth bill, which we haven’t seen in almost a generation, not since GrammLeachBliley. I appreciate all of the work that has been put into this bill in a bipartisan manner, and I look forward to supporting it. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, some of the Senators are saying they wish that they had never voted for the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. CAPUANO ), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. There are some good things in this bill. I wanted to work with all of you to enshrine the good things and get rid of the bad things. We all did. We all offered it for years because DoddFrank is a good law, but it needs amending. We all agree. The limits are on it. We all have admitted that we just kind of picked them at the time. We were in a hurry, in a rush. But the amnesia around this place, I guess, is endemic. Maybe it is hard for you today to look people in the eye and say: Gee, maybe you can’t afford that loan. But, for me, the hardest thing was looking people in the eye and saying: I am sorry you are losing your home. I am sorry you are losing your job. I am sorry your kids can’t go to college because the economy just collapsed. The numbers are the numbers. But didn’t you get those phone calls? Didn’t you hear from any of your constituents? And what was your answer? Oh, the regulatory system is terrible. You didn’t answer that. You tried to help, and you couldn’t because the economy had gone down the toilet. If this bill passes, which it will—I know you wouldn’t come to the floor unless you had the votes. I know that. I can count. When people ask you the next time we have an economic collapse, when they ask you what happened, here is the only answer you are going to be able to give them: I voted for this bill today. b1415 The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida). The time of the gentleman has expired. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, the details of this bill, getting rid of HMDA requirements, do you not care about discrimination? Do you not recognize that it is real and that it exists? But, apparently, you don’t care. Do you not care that your constituents had their information sold out from under them and then not protected? But now you are going to give free credit monitoring only for people in the military—not for your mother, not for your sister, not for your student children, just for the military. The bill has some good provisions in it. I am happy to work with you on some of these. This bill goes too far, and you are responsible. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are again reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. DUFFY ), chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance and the author of the Family SelfSufficiency provision in S. 2155. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman HENSARLING for all of his work on DoddFrank reform. I think it is important that we look back. When DoddFrank passed, it was passed with a blindfold over our eyes, because the studies weren’t even done about what the root cause of the crisis even was. Democrats opened up their files and poured every bill they had dreamed of for 20 years into Dodd Frank. And what did it do to my constituents, my small banks and credit unions? It made them shut their doors or made them consolidate with a bigger bank. So, now, Spooner, Wisconsin, the decisions of the bank might not be made in Spooner, but they might be made in Milwaukee or Chicago or Minneapolis. I hear my friends talk about banks doing so well right now. Yes, because there are people who want to borrow money, and the economy is doing so well, that borrowers can pay back lenders so they make a little bit of money. I think what is pretty evident in this conversation is some of my friends would prefer that we have socialized banking like socialized healthcare. Let the government, let the Democrats across the aisle run banking in America. If you are confused about this debate and whether this is a good or bad bill, just do one thing: look at where the small community banks are, look at where the credit unions are. They are clamoring for this bill, they are begging for this bill, because they can’t comply with DoddFrank, the rules and regulations. It is putting them out of business. Small credit unions that care about their customers say ‘‘yes’’ to this bill. I hope, too, so do my Democratic friends. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ ), the ranking member of the Small Business Committee and a senior member of the Financial Services Committee. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to S. 2155, which strips back and weakens many of the regulatory tools and safeguards we enacted in Dodd Frank. Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker: this bill will make our financial system more vulnerable to a financial crisis. The bill undermines important safety and soundness protections like stress tests and capital requirements, key reforms that Democrats put in place following the financial crisis that prevent the risk of bank bailouts and protect our economy and taxpayers. The bill also weakens critical consumer protections like DoddFrank’s enhanced HMDA data monitoring and reporting requirements. Under this bill, 85 percent of depository institutions are excused from these important requirements. While many financial institutions say that these reporting requirements are too onerous and too difficult to comply with, S. 2155 will make it harder to determine if lenders are serving the credit needs of minority borrowers and to identify harmful and discriminatory lending patterns. Instead of eliminating important tools like HMDA, we should be finding ways to eliminate discrimination in lending. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 20 seconds to the gentlewoman from New York. Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, as ranking member of the House Small Business Committee, I support targeted reforms that provide relief for community banks and local credit unions, but this bill does none of that. It is a solution in search of a problem that harms consumers. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this dangerous bill. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY ), the vice chairman of the committee and the Chief Deputy Whip of the majority and author of two provisions of S. 2155 to promote capital formation and hold credit bureaus fully accountable. Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for making this day possible. Without the architecture of the work that the House Financial Services Committee did, the Senate wouldn’t be able to come to terms with this major change to DoddFrank. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my Democratic colleagues for participating in these bipartisan negotiations that made this day possible. The long, dark shadow of the financial crisis is over, and policymakers 
are now shifting to the muchneeded reforms we need in our banking system. We know that we have fewer community banks now than we did before the financial crisis, we have fewer community banks now than we did 5 years ago, and our communities are more starved for capital now than ever before, especially with the economy changing and economic growth now coming back to communities across this country. Now, today, Congress is coming to terms with a bipartisan bill, a bipartisan approach to make our banking system more inclusive and more accessible for everyday Americans. I am proud my provision that I authored, the Supporting America’s Innovators Act, is included, which helps small businesses get the investments they need to grow and prosper. Those communities have not been traditionally focused upon by investors. I am also proud that this bill allows community banks to get into the business of lending to their community, getting back into the business of mortgage lending in their communities. And I am proud that this bill will allow consumers to freeze their credit reports in the event that there is a data breach or identity theft. These are bipartisan pieces of this very important package. It is high time Congress gets on with it and passes this bill. I look forward to the outcome of today’s vote, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am amazed at what I am hearing today, because I was there, and I understand that at the time we entered the financial crisis, the banks were not lending to each other. There are many aspects of this to focus on, but today I will simply focus on the $163 billion that the banks made last year. A better name for this bill would be ‘‘Too Much Is Not Enough.’’ $163 billion, but that is not enough. The banks would have us now eliminate the Volcker rule, which prevents the banks from using the money on the consumer side, taking that money and moving it over to the investment side, and go to Wall Street and gamble. If they win, they keep the profits; if they lose, they can socialize the losses. This bill is not a bill that benefits consumers. It is a Big Bank bonanza. Too much is not enough, and too much is too much for me. I will vote against it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS ), the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and a senior member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, it has been 10 long years since I was a conferee on DoddFrank. Since then, I have seen credit markets in my district and across the country dry up, thanks to the increased regulations. That is why I am so happy to be speaking on a bill today that will roll back some of those burdens. As I have said over the last decade, DoddFrank was not written on the back of the stone tablets. DoddFrank will be addressed in this bill, S. 2155. S. 2155 is but the first step in making that perception a reality. It is the first step in bringing financial markets back to true efficiency and capacity. And, yes, I mean a first step. There are many more things this Congress could and should do to bring more relief to small community institutions across the country. Every year, small financial institutions in Oklahoma have made the trek here to ask me for relief, any relief. For the first time, I can give them positive news, which is, thanks to this bill, sure, there is more to be done, of course, but things in this bill like changes to stress testing, risk management protocols, required data disclosure, among other things, will help those who rely on small banks and credit unions for their financial needs. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman HENSARLING for this opportunity to vote on this bill today. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), our Democratic leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I commend her for her extraordinary leadership in protecting the American consumer, the American taxpayer, our American financial systems. She has been just a remarkable, wonderful leader. Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished Whip for yielding so that I could stay on schedule and for his great leadership as well. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, and I do so on behalf of the hardworking American people. It is a bad bill under the guise of helping community banks. It rolls back key safeguards for American consumers, it opens the door to lending discrimination, and it potentially threatens the stability of our financial system and our economy. The bill would take us back to the days when unchecked recklessness on Wall Street ignited a historic financial meltdown. Wall Street gambled with the livelihood of consumers, and then it was the middle class that lost its shirt. I just want to share with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle why I have serious concerns about what is happening on the floor today. It is yet again another weakening of Dodd Frank. Here is what I want to call to your mind, because you may not remember this or you may not have been fully aware of it, but you should know it. On the night of September 18, 2008, I called the Secretary of the Treasury and said: What is happening, that we have had in the past couple of weeks Lehman, Merrill Lynch, and then in that 24hour period, AIG? I said: Can you come to the Capitol to explain tomorrow morning what is happening so that we can help restore confidence to the markets and not say anything that would do anything less than that? He said: Madam Speaker—I was Speaker at the time—tomorrow morning will be too late. Tomorrow morning will be too late. Why am I calling you? So, in any event, the Secretary of the Treasury came to the Capitol for an emergency meeting. It was a bipartisan meeting, House and Senate, to inform us that a meltdown was imminent. What he described to us that night was so stunning, he took us down to the gates of hell, to a place so deep that even Dante would not have had a name for that circle in hell, because it was so stunning in terms of what was happening, the meltdown that was happening to our financial institutions. When I asked the Fed Chairman, who was also at the meeting, Ben Bernanke, what he thought, he said, ‘‘If we do not act immediately, we will not have an economy by Monday.’’ ‘‘An economy by Monday.’’ We thought it might be one or the other financial institutions. ‘‘We will not have an economy by Monday.’’ To stop the meltdown, the Bush administration requested and Congress immediately passed emergency funding, the TARP bill. You may be familiar with it. To prevent this from ever happening again, we passed DoddFrank, the most extensive banking and financial reforms in decades and the strongest set of consumer financial protections in history. b1430 And since the Republicans have taken the majority in the Congress and now in the White House, there has been a series of weakenings of DoddFrank. So you cannot just view this bill as this bill today, bad enough as it is, worthy of a ‘‘no,’’ unworthy of support, but to see it in light of a series of weakenings of DoddFrank. The bill dismantles key safeguards that are critical in combating racial discrimination in lending, despite overwhelming evidence that people of color are routinely discriminated against by financial institutions. All year, the GOP has opened the door to discrimination in our financial system. This is just another discriminatory piece of legislation. They pushed a CRA to roll back protections against discrimination in auto lending. They voted to repeal an executive order requiring Federal contractors to comply with basic nondiscrimination laws. Big banks are also using the guise of protecting community banks to help out the largest banks on Wall Street. 
The bill exempts 26 of the largest banks from the DoddFrank Act’s heightened oversight. Since 2007, these same banks have been sued or cited by the regulators nearly 200 times and paid settlements of $40 billion, some of which they can deduct from their taxes. Republicans are also using relief for community banks as a way of undermining the Volcker rule, threatening the stability of the financial system and the entire economy. Republicans’ willingness to abandon vulnerable Americans and jeopardize our entire financial system to further enrich wealthy Wall Street banks is astounding. Today, the FDIC reported that banks, helped by a massive tax cut, earned record profits in the first quarter of this year, as they have over the past 3 years as well. Time after time, Republicans put Wall Street and the rich first and families last. The American people deserve a Congress that looks out for them, not one that sells out and leaves them high and dry. This is a raw deal for the American people. Americans deserve a better deal, better jobs, better wages, and better futures. Democrats are fighting to put that economic power back. Who has the leverage? Put the leverage back in the hands of America’s great middle class, America’s working families. So just remember what they were willing to do leading up to 2008. They have forgotten, or maybe they don’t care, but they want to take us right back down that path one piece of legislation at a time. If I know Mr. HENSARLING , there is probably more to come, because I understand he doesn’t think this bill goes far enough in the wrong direction, and he probably wants more. But whatever that is, today is the judgment we have to make about this bill that our commitment—and by the way, some of the things they want to roll back are very harmful to our veterans as well, and they wanted me to be sure to make that point with you, in addition to all of the other concerns. It is a threat to our financial system: $250 billion, I think that number is too large; the exploitation of the custody banks that some of the banks already told me they were going to try to pass themselves off as; the discrimination in lending that is in the bill; the lack of revealing the information, which is so central to knowing what the facts are. Mr. Speaker, for these and so many other reasons, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ), who is the chair of our Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, since returning to a Republican majority 8 years ago, the Financial Services Committee has set out to introduce and pass progrowth legislation that lessens the burdens unfairly put on community banks and credit unions and the customers they serve. Today’s bill will allow for these institutions to do what they do best: focus on their communities. Mr. Speaker, this is something to celebrate. Under the leadership of Chairman HENSARLING , our committee has continuously made the case that the former administration’s efforts were not only misguided, but made basic financial services less accessible to small businesses and low and middle income Americans. With passage of today’s bill, that changes. American families’ and businesses’ access to credit will improve. This is credit they can and will use to buy a new car, achieve the dream of homeownership, expand their businesses, and, most importantly, create jobs. It is my sincere hope that we continue the momentum of today’s vote and work with our Senate counterparts to roll back Washington red tape to further our Nation’s economic growth and to continue to give hardworking Americans better access to affordable financial products. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this muchneeded bipartisan legislation. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the distinguished Democratic whip. (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I am constrained to say that the gentlewoman mentioned the progrowth administration. We had some 98 months of growth following the worst recession she and I have experienced in our lifetimes under the policies of the Bush administration. Mr. Speaker, in the wake of the worst financial collapse since the Great Depression, the Congress enacted, over the opposition of our friends in the Republican Party, mostly, the Dodd Frank reforms to safeguard our economy and safeguard consumers. When we passed DoddFrank in 2010, no one believed it was perfect. No legislation is ever perfect. There is nothing wrong with evaluating DoddFrank 8 years after it was enacted to determine what is working well and where we might improve. Many Democrats, myself included, support providing regulatory relief to community banks, and we ought to do that in a bipartisan fashion—not just a few bipartisan participants, but in a bipartisan fashion. I have talked to the ranking member. She has indicated that that is something that she supports as well. However, the bill on the floor today goes much further and would weaken the rules that DoddFrank put in place. It would undermine the regulatory framework for all banks. This would roll back parts of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, stress tests for large banks, and bank capital requirements. It would also, as has been noted, raise the threshold for the automatic designation of systemically important financial institutions from $50 billion to $250 billion. The changes that are proposed risk making our Nation’s financial system vulnerable to another crisis that would require yet another taxpayer bailout. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, because of that and because I would like to see a truly bipartisan bill supported overwhelmingly on both sides of the aisle to make sure that our community banks are not impacted in a way that was never intended nor should it be intended by the Congress, I therefore urge opposition to this particular piece of legislation, and I thank Ranking Member WATERS for her hard work in making its consequences clear. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR), the chairman of our Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade and the author of two provisions on access to manufactured housing and portfolio lending in S. 2155. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bipartisan legislation incorporating 29 bills originated and passed in this House to ease the regulatory burden on community financial institutions and their customers. This is the most progrowth financial legislation in a generation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. The 2010 financial control law, commonly known as DoddFrank, was supposed to protect consumers. Instead, this 2,300page monstrosity unleashed an avalanche of huge new compliance costs on community financial institutions that had absolutely nothing to do with the financial crisis. This hurt consumers by forcing small banks and credit unions to cut back on the products and services they serve their customers with. Critics who say this is about Wall Street are wrong. This is not about Wall Street. This is about community banks, community banks in eastern Kentucky who told me that they used to make a business judgment about the creditworthiness of a farmer and now the government, a bureaucrat, decides whether or not that farmer gets a loan. One prominent example of this is the abilitytorepay rule, which made it needlessly difficult for lenders to originate mortgages for creditworthy borrowers. The Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act, which I have worked on since I entered Congress, is included in today’s package of reforms and would expand access to mortgage credit by extending the qualified mortgage safe harbor to small creditors who hold 
their residential mortgage loans in portfolio rather than selling or securitizing them, allowing those lenders to satisfy the rule. This marks a return to relationship banking, where lenders can tailor products to meet the specific needs of customers without running afoul of government onesize fitsall requirements. The result is expanded access to mortgage credit without additional risk to the financial system or the taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING and Chairman C RAPO  for including this bill in the final legislation, and I want to thank the Kentucky Bankers Association, the Kentucky Credit Union League, and their customers for advocating and endorsing this solution. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ to finally unclog the plumbing of our economy and give Americans full access to the financial system. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON), the senior member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, in just about an hour or so, Congress will vote to roll back some of the rules for the biggest banks in the country. Think about that for a minute. Just 10 years after the big banks crashed the economy, Senate Republicans and some Democrats want to roll back the rules that were put in place to prevent the next crash. Some of my colleagues may have forgotten about the bad, bad days of that crash in 2008, but I sure have not. Millions of people lost their homes. In fact, 1 in 54 homes was in foreclosure. $2.6 trillion, with a T, vanished from people’s retirement accounts. Think about that for a moment. Why on Earth would we go back there? And let me remind everyone here: Before this crash, we heard all this talk about progrowth. Before the big crash, they said we want to allow commercial banks and investment banks and insurance companies just to all conglomerate together. We want to allow banks to use the money of their depositors to make gambling decisions on Wall Street. We are going to sell people no doc, lowdoc loans, and we are going to let the seller get a yield spread premium for steering people to highcost loans; and we are going to let them securitize all of it, and if they lose their money, it is okay because we are going to let them buy credit default swaps, which is insurance, so that the American people lose but the big banks and the insurance companies never do. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, all this progrowth talk is a movie that we have seen before. Remember Alan Greenspan telling all us: Let them do what they want to do. It doesn’t matter. You can’t interfere with the market. The market has all the answers. We found out who had the answers when it came to bailing out Wall Street. It was the American people. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to not vote for this because it will be the American people who pay, not to mention people who live in manufactured homes who are going to be allowed to be charged more for their home choices, and it will open the door to racial discrimination which has been proved time and time again. This bill is bad. Vote ‘‘no.’’ b1445 Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), the committee’s majority whip and the author of the amendment dealing with the Volcker rule. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the full committee for having us on the floor today to talk about S. 2155. I have heard all of this cold water from the opposition today, but this is the definition of bipartisanship. Sixty seven votes in the Senate, in this environment, in this town, is bipartisan. So many of our bills emanated here in the House with strong bipartisan support. As a former local chamber of commerce chairman and a local community banker, I have seen firsthand, Mr. Speaker, the negative effects of the DoddFrank Act since it was passed in 2010. I know we have had 140 hearings on how to make sense of improving Dodd Frank, to rightsize the regulatory system for small financial institutions, allowing our community banks and credit unions to actually serve our small businesses and our consumers. Rather than spending too much time on compliance, these institutions can redirect resources toward what they do best: approving loans, mortgages, and providing credit to small business. This bill has widespread support. You would never know it, listening to the opposition, but it has widespread support on a bicameral, bipartisan basis in this building. One particular provision, led by my friend Mr. BARR from Kentucky, I know will help hundreds of Arkansans, hardworking families who need access to credit for manufactured housing in the rural parts of our State. This bill will help people get housing, thanks to the work of the Senate and the House. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of S. 2155. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. M ALONEY ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment of the Financial Services Committee. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to S. 2155. It is important to remember why we passed DoddFrank in the first place. We were suffering from the worst financial downturn in our country. This country suffered $15 trillion in household wealth that was lost. Eight million people lost their jobs and 6 million people lost their homes due to unfair and deceptive banking practices. DoddFrank put in place protections for consumers. Prior to the crisis, predatory lenders saddled unsuspecting borrowers with toxic mortgages that they didn’t understand and could not afford. Too often, these predatory lenders targeted communities of color, and when these toxic mortgages blew up, it devastated these communities. In response, we passed DoddFrank, which imposed tough new rules on mortgage lenders and beefed up our efforts to crack down on lending discrimination. This bill would actually roll back some of these important protections. The bill would undermine fair lending laws by exempting the majority of lenders from the new reporting requirements on lending discrimination. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from New York. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. The bill would also weaken the protections for mobilehome buyers by allowing retailers of mobile homes to accept kickbacks in exchange for steering borrowers into predatory loans that they can’t afford. It is a terrible practice that DoddFrank outlawed. The list goes on and on and on. While the bill does contain some provisions that every House Democrat has supported, taken together, the bill goes too far in weakening the key mortgage rules that DoddFrank put in place. So I urge my colleagues to come together in a strong ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I now am very pleased to yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HULTGREN ), the author of two different provisions in S. 2155 to give more flexibility to private companies and small banks with respect to their call reports. Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING . Without his incredible commitment and effort, we would not be here today. I am convinced of that. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the very bipartisan S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. I was not here when the DoddFrank Act was signed into law, but I have been interested in addressing some of these damaging effects since first running for office, and it was a big reason why I ran for Congress. 
This legislation is a historic opportunity to tailor financial regulations in order to maximize economic growth in Illinois and across the country. We need to make sure that our community banks and credit unions are able to meet the needs of families and neighborhood businesses. I am especially happy to see a number of provisions that I had the privilege of authoring with my colleagues in the House make their way into this package of bills. They were also very bipartisan bills. The Community Bank Reporting Relief Act simplifies the call report so that smaller institutions can better focus on serving their customers. The Encouraging Employee Ownership Act makes it easier for private companies to provide ownership to their employees under SEC rule 701 so they can share in the benefits of growth. I am also very excited that other legislation that was introduced by my colleagues that I also had a part in cosponsoring is also part of this: the MOBILE Act; the Protecting Children from Identity Theft Act; the Protecting Veterans Credit Act; the Pension, Endowment, and Mutual Fund Access to Banking Act; the Municipal Finance Support Act; the National Security Exchange Regulatory Parity Act; and the SEC Overpayment Credit Act. I am incredibly supportive of the commonsense reforms that are made so that our regional banks are not automatically treated like major Wall Street banks. Please support this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. May I inquire as to how much time I have remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HOLDING ). The gentlewoman from California has 12 minutes remaining. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. HECK), a valued member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, I will regrettably vote ‘‘no’’ on S. 2155. It is regrettable because I believe our local banks and credit unions are struggling under the weight of regulations. I believe that we have bank rules that need fixing. I wanted to support a bill that would do so. But I cannot vote ‘‘yes’’ for two reasons. First, this bill cannot release the pressure small banks are under because it does not address the single biggest cause. Every bank and credit union I have met with cites one regulatory burden as paramount, and that is the Bank Secrecy Act, CTRs, antimoney laundering. And what does this bill have? Not one section, not one sentence, not one word. Secondly, this bill makes changes I believe could set us back. It has been cited; the increase of SIFI designation from $50 billion to $250 billion is a large step down a dangerous road. The insurance provision, on the other hand, also goes against my goal of returning power to State regulators, who provide the greatest consumer protection. If my colleagues had been allowed any input, I think we could have accomplished the goal. But this bill doesn’t solve the problem it aims for and may create new ones. Accordingly, I cannot support it. I ask Members, as well, to oppose it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I am now very pleased to yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ), the author of two different provisions in S. 2155 to bring clarity to the complex capital rules and flexibility to our savings associations. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan legislation. Our economy has struggled for years under the weight of misguided Washington policies. Banks have closed and consolidated, and communities across this country have lost their local financial institutions. American families have found it harder to get the funds they need to buy a home, and small businesses have been starved of credit to innovate, invest, and hire more workers. In this economic environment, small businesses have struggled to grow or even get off the ground. A recent study observed that we are missing 650,000 small businesses because of burdensome regulations relating to the financial industry over the last 10 years. Everyone, from the single mom in Ambridge looking to buy her first home to the entrepreneur in Beaver Falls working to achieve his or her version of the American Dream, deserves access to financial services and the chance to thrive in a growing, healthy economy. Today’s bill addresses some of these barriers that have been holding us back. I am also proud to say that two of my bills are in this legislation. One of these bills gives mutual banks the flexibility to evolve so that they can better serve their communities. The other bill addresses the unintended negative impacts of the supplementary leverage ratio on custody banks. This is technical, but the current SLR actually makes it harder for custody banks to safeguard cash of pension funds and nonprofit foundations in times of stress. Today, we fix that. Both of my bills received unanimous, bipartisan support in the committee, and I am glad they will soon become law. Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman HENSARLING for his work on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ), a very hardworking progressive leader. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to S. 2155. This bill will roll back many consumer protections, including protections that are critical for civil rights. This bill will permit 85 percent of depository institutions to avoid public reporting on their mortgage lending activities. This reporting is absolutely critical to identifying discrimination against Black Americans, Latinos, and other minority groups. Thanks to the public reporting requirement, we know that redlining still exists in 61 metropolitan areas across our country and that Black folks and Latinos are more than twice as likely as Whites to be denied mortgage credit. It is an unacceptable reality, but it is a reality that we have to see and acknowledge. The idea that we would roll back these policies that help us identify these problems, when we have the facts right in front of us, is simply unthinkable. I do want to make it clear that I have great sympathy for smaller banking institutions, including credit unions—I am a proud credit union member—and our community banks that have called for regulatory relief. But let’s be clear that, when we do that relief, Congress should be using a scalpel to create a fix for smaller banks, not taking a sledgehammer to the entire system that we set up to protect consumers and Main Street small businesses from the greed of big banks. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ), the author of the MOBILE Act, Making Online Banking Initiation Legal and Easy. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, for too long, there has been a culture of disregard for our community financial institutions out of Washington, D.C. Regulations that were intended to bring discipline to the Nation’s largest institutions have instead suffocated Main Street and prevented communities across the country from finding their footing on the path to prosperity. The passage of this historic, bipartisan, progrowth package today will mark a change in the regulatory rhetoric out of Washington. Communities will be heard instead of ignored. Families will find open doors where previously they were shut out. And small businesses will be empowered to grow rather than languish in regulatory uncertainty. One provision of this legislation that I authored, the MOBILE Act, embodies exactly the kind of commonsense help for families that today’s vote will provide. The MOBILE Act will allow consumers across the country to open bank accounts on their mobile devices using a driver’s license or personal ID, meaning access to financial services will start in your pocket and be more convenient than ever. Approximately threequarters of the 20 percent of the U.S. population that 
is underbanked has access to a smartphone. This provision will help these Americans get access to the critical banking services that will set them on the path to financial success. Mr. Speaker, this historic package is about unraveling red tape that stifles the financial success of all Americans, and I urge its passage here today. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ), cochair of the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the bank lobbyist act, which reverses the progress we have made since Wall Street brought our economy to the brink of collapse in 2008. This is yet another giveaway from our friends on the other side of the aisle to the wealthy donors who bankroll their campaigns, and, once again, working people will get screwed. Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect the middle class from the big banks and corporate special interests. Since 2010, the CFPB has returned nearly $12 billion to consumers in all 50 States. b1500 It has been a big step forward for working people, but this bill turns the clock back. Republicans are going to let the banks write the same risky loans that got us into the Great Recession in the first place. This is a bad deal for the American people. They deserve better. Let’s defeat this bill and put working families first. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ), the author of the key regulatory relief provision for small banks and credit unions in S. 2155. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, today Congress has a rare opportunity to help millions of Americans achieve their version of the American Dream. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act is the most significant progrowth, deregulation bill this Chamber has considered in years. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation will reduce the amount of red tape that prevents Americans from accessing the credit they need to buy a home, a car, or start or expand a business. It will foster economic growth and make regulation efficient, effective, and tailored. Perhaps most importantly, it will empower individual Americans to make independent financial decisions and informed choices in the marketplace. Dozens of the provisions in S. 2155 originated right here in the House, and I am pleased to see the text of my Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act and Keeping Capital Local for Underserved Communities Act, legislation that I worked on closely with my colleague from Wisconsin, Representative GWEN MOORE , included in the bill today. Whether it is in Rockford, St. Cloud, or Forest Lake, Minnesota, I consistently hear from small banks and credit unions that want to be that next critical source of capital and support for families, businesses, and communities around the State. This bill will allow them to be just that. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman HENSARLING for his tireless work on this legislation, and, knowing full well that our work here is far from complete, I urge my colleagues to make history today. Support giving more Americans the opportunity to achieve their American Dream, and pass S. 2155. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ), who is the author of two provisions in S. 2155, the Senior Safe Act and supporting capital formation for small companies. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this terrific bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, the unemployment rate in our great State of Maine is 2.7 percent. This is the lowest rate since the 1950s, and jobs, Mr. Speaker, are available everywhere for hardworking Mainers who now have bigger paychecks. This growing economy, Mr. Speaker, is because taxes are lower and regulations are fewer. We must keep these reforms going. That is why, Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone, Republicans and Democrats, to vote ‘‘yes’’ on S. 2155. This bipartisan bill includes two provisions which I have been pushing for 3 years. First, the Small Business Capital Formation Enhancement Act makes it easier for small businesses to borrow money when they need to grow, and that creates more jobs, bigger paychecks, more opportunity, and more freedom for our families. Mr. Speaker, secondly, the Senior Safe Act helps protect our vulnerable seniors against financial scams. The legislation allows, for example, bank tellers, insurance agencies, and financial advisers to warn our seniors against draining their savings accounts and wiring the money to some distant location because someone is pretending to be their granddaughter in trouble. This bill, the Senior Safe Act, makes it easier to stop financial scams before they hurt our seniors. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Senator SUSAN COLLINS  from Maine, for advancing this initiative in the Senate. Together, we pushed this commonsense provision in both the House and in the Senate. I ask everyone, Mr. Speaker, to please vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bipartisan bill, S. 2155, and I thank the chairman for this opportunity. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS ), a fellow Texan who is an incredibly strong advocate on our committee for small business to obtain credit for their customers. Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which passed the Senate with bipartisan support last month. This important legislation stems from years of consideration, hearings, markups, and floor votes in the House, coupled with a bicameral commitment with the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee to deliver relief for the American people. More than half of the 53 provisions included in S. 2155 originated in the House Financial Services Committee, and I applaud the work of the chairman throughout this lengthy process. Right now, small community banks cannot keep up with oppressive regulations that are reluctantly forcing so many to close their doors. As I have said time and time again, the practice of onesizefitsall does not and should not apply to financial institutions. In order to unleash our economic potential, Congress must act now to repeal unnecessary regulations while properly tailoring those we need. Mr. Speaker, S. 2155 will finally provide the relief for our community banks by cutting through red tape. In turn, small businesses and the American consumer will now have better access to credit and encourage more economic growth and consumption. Make no mistake about it: this economy is roaring. I have been in business 47 years, and I know what I am talking about. I am proud to join colleagues in support of this bipartisan, bicameral legislation and look forward to President Trump’s signature as soon as possible. In God we trust. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I continue to reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. LOVE), who is the author of a key regulatory relief provision to provide small banks the opportunity to grow. Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, we have an economy that is humming right now. Utah’s unemployment rate is better than the national average, and it is the best it has been in 10 years. We are adding jobs—1,400 just last month. I am urging a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill because I want to keep the good news coming. America needs a financial system that is strong, resilient, and innovative. As a former mayor, I know that access to credit is crucial for cities to build schools and roads, for families to buy a home, and for farmers to buy tractors. After the 2008 financial crisis, Congress passed laws to rein in large financial institutions, but the rules went 
too far, and they are hurting the smaller banks, who can’t handle all the red tape. S. 2155 would ease that burden without risk to the rest of the financial system. My bill, H.R. 4771, is included in this package to help those small banks gain the access to capital they need to serve their community. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote for the good of people and for the health of our economy. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ), who is the author of two key regulatory relief provisions for our community banks and credit unions in S. 2155. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bipartisan Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. This groundbreaking legislation is vital to rural communities like mine, where my constituents are actually struggling every day to make ends meet. This bill allows greater access to capital for consumers and small businesses that will unleash more opportunities for Main Street to flourish, finally. However, in order for Main Street to truly produce, we must ensure our community financial institutions are healthy, safe, and not overburdened to the point of closure. In my district in New York, small banks and credit unions are the lifeline for consumers who seek access to capital. Whether it is a family buying their first home or a young adult purchasing a new car, consumers in New York rely heavily on our Nation’s community financial institutions. I am grateful to have two pieces of bipartisan legislation that promote relationship banking and regulatory relief that are included in this bill package today. Two of my bipartisan bills included in this package are the Small Bank Exam Cycle Improvement Act and the Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act which offer small, local communities and financial institutions a little muchneeded assistance to help better serve their communities. I am proud of the hard work my colleagues have done to craft this important, bipartisan legislation, and I am very thankful to Chairman HENSARLING  for making sure that this bill becomes a reality for Americans. Mr. Speaker, S. 2155 will help families in my district achieve financial independence, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this, including my cosponsors, Mr. SHERMAN and Mr. CRIST, who I hope will be joining us in support of this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of Mr. HENSARLING how many speakers he has remaining. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers on this side. I believe I have the right to close. Ms. WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BURGESS ). The gentlewoman has 8 minutes remaining. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me again share with you what should be breaking news tonight: the FDIC released its quarterly banking profile today for the first quarter of 2018 and reported that banks made more money than they ever have. Mr. Speaker, $56 billion in profits in a single quarter represents a 27.5 percent surge compared to 2017. Some of these profits came from the Republican tax reform bill that we have called a tax scam law. The community banks, credit unions, and the economy are doing great with DoddFrank reforms in place. The banking industry keeps making record profits—an average of $167 billion in annual profits the last 3 years. Banks have increased lending to businesses by 80 percent since 2010. Community banks are outperforming larger banks in increased lending, and the credit unions are growing and have increased lending by more than 10 percent in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Despite all of that, we have this pay of CEOs of banks that represents so many times more than the median salary in their banks. Specifically, Wells Fargo’s CEO made $17.4 million in 2017, 291 times the company’s median salary. This is in spite of the fact that Wells Fargo has a track record of consumer abuses while demonstrating that the numerous fines imposed upon the bank have not been a sufficient deterrent to stop its pattern of appalling practices. Let me just identify some of those practices: opening 3.5 million fraudulent credit card and deposit accounts, for which they were fined $185 million. It was so bad that former Chair Yellen capped the bank’s size until it cleans up its act. In addition to that, they were found to have illegal student loan servicing practices; inappropriate checking account overdraft fees; unlawful mortgage lending practices, such as overcharging veterans for refinance loans; and charging customers for automobile insurance policies they did not need, which resulted in some customers losing their vehicles. They were fined $1 billion, but it really doesn’t make them any different. It is just a cost of doing business. Yet we have my friends on the opposite side of the aisle who come and ask us to be lenient on the banks, to do away with the DoddFrank reforms, and to forget about what happened in 2008. Somehow it is all right for these greedy banks to continue the practices that they have. Despite the fact that DoddFrank reined them in, they are doing very well. S. 2155, again, is not a community bank bill, and it certainly does not help consumers, so we should not pretend that that is the case. Instead of considering improvements to this Senate bill or advancing narrowly tailored relief, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are rubberstamping S. 2155 and advancing a Wall Street wish list that could jeopardize the stability of our country’s financial system. So, instead of considering a bill to address concerns raised by community banks, one that I am sure could easily pass both bodies with overwhelming bipartisan support, House Republicans have instead decided to take up a bill that is largely designed to fulfill the agenda of Wall Street’s megabanks. Passing this bill with broad support would send the wrong message to regulators to accelerate their deregulatory efforts for Wall Street. It is unfortunate that megabanks have once again piggybacked onto the substantial goodwill and support that exists to help ease the regulatory burden for community banks. S. 2155 is a dangerous measure that weakens key consumer protections and will make it harder, not easier, to combat unfair mortgage lending practices. The bill takes advantage of people just trying to make ends meet for the benefit of the largest banks that are making record profits. Make no mistake: I support our Nation’s community banks and credit unions, and I support tailored regulatory relief for those institutions. That is a fact that I have made clear through my support of numerous individual measures which have advanced through this Congress, as well as through my community bank regulatory relief bill from last Congress. b1515 I will continue to oppose any efforts to use regulatory relief for community banks as a vehicle to ram through deregulation for bad actors and megabanks. If my words and the words of my colleagues here today are not enough of a warning, then I would urge Members to listen to the pleas of hundreds of consumer, civil rights, veteran, religious, and labor groups that strongly oppose S. 2155. Though some of my colleagues in Congress may have short memories, the millions of Americans who lost their homes, their jobs, and their wealth during the 2008 financial crisis did not. So I oppose this bill. I want the Members of Congress to stand up on this very important legislation and say to the greedy banks and the megabanks: No, you are not going to get away with these kinds of actions anymore. Everything that you have done to try to undermine the DoddFrank reforms have resulted in more groups coming out to say: Congress, when are you going to stop these banks? They are making plenty of money. They are increasing their profits. Their CEOs are making high salaries. What more do you want from them? 
I think that our consumers deserve better than any attempt to try and relieve them of those regulatory actions that would support our consumers. I would ask for a resounding ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill that would only feed into the greediness of the major banks of America. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, since DoddFrank was passed, the big banks have become bigger and the small banks have become fewer. Free checking at banks has been cut in half. Credit cards: 200 basis points more, 15 percent fewer. Many creditworthy borrowers are having to pay almost $600 more for their auto loans. Mr. Speaker, the American Dream is shrinking. We have 1.6 percent economic growth, stagnant paychecks, decimated savings, and a diminished American Dream. That is the legacy of DoddFrank. Mr. Speaker, I wish I could believe 10 percent of what I heard from the other side of the aisle. I wish it did gut Dodd Frank. It didn’t. You can’t find something in here. It is hard, challenging, to find anything in this bill that helps what the ranking member calls the so called Wall Street megabanks. Mr. Speaker, listening very carefully to this debate, it is clear that there are some voices that appear to be driven by their loathing of banks and credit unions, and there are other voices that are driven for our love and respect of our fellow citizens, hardworking taxpayers like Dirk in Colton and Sherry, who I mentioned in my opening statement, who are trying to capitalize a small business, who are trying to buy a car that is 10 years old, who are trying to buy that home. It is their American Dream, and they are being challenged due to this law. I have heard so many of my friends on the other side of the aisle say: Oh, I believe in taking away bureaucracy and red tape from community financial institutions, and I believe in bipartisanship. Well, they may believe in it, but they are not voting for it. The opportunity is right here in front of us with S. 2155, a strong, bipartisan bill that has come over from the United States Senate. So, again, they claim they believe it in theory; they just don’t believe it in practice. Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, 3 percent economic growth counts. If you look at the history of our Republic, 3 percent growth is where all the job creation takes place. It is where the paycheck increases take place. It is where the poverty reductions take place. It is the birthright of the American people. Thankfully, due to the leadership of our President and this Congress, we now have a 3 percent tax policy. We need a 3 percent regulatory policy, especially for our community banks and our credit unions, who help finance the American Dream for all of our citizens. We should join in unison on this historic day to pass S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, for the help of all our citizens. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the bill before us, S. 2155. I support a majority of the provisions in this bill, as it makes crucial changes to federal banking laws that provide much needed relief from some of the worst, most burdensome financial regulations that have stifled American small businesses and in turn, harmed consumers. I intend to vote in its favor, but I have a real issue with the way in which we are considering the bill. A huge bill, almost 200 pages— under a closed rule. The section I want to speak on is a section that most folks probably don’t even realize is in the bill, and that is Small Public Housing reform, section 209. This is an issue I’ve been working on for years now, and while I’m always happy to see others such as Chairman CRAPO caring about it, I’m frustrated by how haphazardly they are written, and disappointed by how good they could be. Let me just go over a couple of things that are in the bill before us as they relate to small public housing authorities. The Senate tacked on a rural requirement to the definition of ‘‘small public housing authority’’ which is generally defined as a housing authority operating 550 or fewer combined units or vouchers. For starters, how many times have we debated USDA’s rural definition? It’s one of the most complicated rural definitions that exist— why are we still using this in new legislation even though we know how difficult it is to come to a consensus on it? The small PHA definition of 550 and under covers approximately 76 percent of PHAs across the country—that number drops to a little over a half when we add the rural definition. Moreover, there are already existing distinctions when it comes to small PHAs—fewer than 250 get to report less, fewer than 400 are exempt from asset management, etc. Now, we’ve created a new subsection—rural or non rural. So in theory we could have two PHAs of identical sizes in adjoining or nearby counties operating under different rules for performance and oversight. Both likely will have similar resource challenges but only one of them will get regulatory relief as a result of S. 2155. We’re creating complexity, not lessening it. We move physical inspection standards currently used in public housing (UPCS) and we say, let’s move them to the less burdensome section 8—which, again, I’m all for, but we don’t clarify which section 8. There are two types of section 8, tenantbased and project based. Presumably they meant tenantbased, but that’s something we need to clarify. These are just a couple of small, noncontroversial common sense corrections. I’ll be introducing authorizing legislation that makes these changes and a few others that I didn’t have time to go over—and hopefully, we’ll be able to attach some technical corrections to a mustpass piece of legislation I know many others share my frustration, to have this massive bill shoved down our throat with no opportunity to make the legislation better. Isn’t that our job as lawmakers? To make sure the bills we pass are the very best they could be. I applaud the deregulatory efforts on the financial side as well as the small public housing side, I’m jut disappointed to see that we don’t have the opportunity to make some of these common sense edits on the front end, instead of having to make technical corrections afterwards because what has been signed into law contains well intended, but confusing and imperfect provisions. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, it was 5:39 a.m. on June 25, 2010 when we passed the DoddFrank Conference Committee Report. At that early morning hour— other than a need for sleep—there was little we agreed upon. But one thing stood out, Republicans and Democrats openly discussed that there were problems in the bill that would need fixing. We knew some of the unintended (and intended) consequences that community banks and credit unions would face when looking to lend to homeowners and small businesses. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, it has taken nearly 8 years for us to pass into law any meaningful changes of those sweeping reforms. Smaller institutions have suffered; they have fewer assets over which to spread everincreasing compliance costs. That’s what leads to this conundrum where we have fewer banks today than we did during the Great Depression. Today, we take a step in rewriting these wrongs. I’m particular proud that the bill before us includes many provisions I authored on a bipartisan basis. S. 2155 provides potential homeownership for the socalled ‘‘credit invisibles,’’ increases small business lending from credit unions, and improves access to capital for companies looking to go public and hire more workers. I urge my colleagues to pass these overdue reforms. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee). All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 905, the previous question is ordered on the bill. The question is on the third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials into the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today, we are here to debate the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research Act, also known as the Childhood Cancer STAR Act. Each of us knows someone who has suffered from cancer, whether it is a family member, friend, patient, or loved one. It is especially heart wrenching to watch children go through a cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment. The bill we are considering today is for our children, the future of our Nation. I would like to acknowledge and thank my fellow Texan, Congressman MICHAEL MCCAUL, for leading our work to deliver hope to America’s youngest cancer patients. Congress has done remarkable work to pass legislation such as the 21st Century Cures Act, which provided Americans with great hope that increased investment in biomedical research would lead to treatment and even cures for our most devastating diseases. The 21st Century Cures Act authorized over $4.5 billion in new funding for the National Institutes of Health, including nearly $2 billion for the Cancer Moonshot. The Childhood Cancer STAR Act builds upon the mission of 21st Century Cures but focuses on empowering the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increase the amount of research and surveillance for cancer in children, adolescents, and young adults. Groundbreaking discoveries rely on robust and reliable investment in research, and this requires robust and reliable dollars for research. This bill authorizes $30 million a year through fiscal year 2023 for the National Childhood Cancer Registry, which will provide grant funding for the purpose of collecting information to better understand the epidemiology of cancer in children, adolescents, and young adults. The bill also authorizes the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health to make awards that will support childhood cancer biorepositories, giving physicians and researchers tools to better understand these diseases. Mr. Speaker, it is vital that physicians and their teams can provide comprehensive and coordinated care for pediatric cancer patients. The bill allows the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to make grants to establish pilot programs to develop, study, or evaluate model systems to improve the quality and the efficiency of care for childhood cancer survivors. It also provides for greater efficiency and coordination of care for those survivors as they transition into adulthood and for the Secretary to work with experts to identify best practices. Similarly, this bill gives the National Institutes of Health Director the authority to make grants to programs that conduct or support research relating to pediatric cancer survivors. As I have said, this legislation is for our children. It is for the families that are building our Nation’s future. If we can ensure that these young patients receive treatment and cures for childhood cancer, they may grow up to become biomedical researchers who will find the next generation of cures; they may write the next great American classic; they may become prima ballerinas, Olympic athletes, or all of the above. This legislation is for kids like Sadie. Sadie was diagnosed with ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, on February 25, 2015. She was just 7 years old at the time. This young north Texan fought through infections, blood transfusions, and rare side effects. She missed out on second grade and she missed out on third grade as she underwent weekly chemotherapy sessions. Today, it is my great joy to share that Sadie beat the odds and Sadie survived leukemia. She received her last chemotherapy treatment May 26, 2017. Now, at 10 years old, Sadie is able to live the life of a normal kid. I would like to thank Sadie and her family for their willingness to share their story and for their advocacy in support of this important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I met Sadie in my office last spring, and I was inspired by her story. She started a nonprofit, the Sadie Keller Foundation, to raise money to help other kids who are facing cancer. Her mission is pretty simple. It is to put a smile on the faces of children fighting cancer all over the country and to remind them to keep fighting. So, today, I urge Members of Congress to support this important bipartisan legislation. In sending this bill to the President’s desk, we will help Sadie achieve her mission of putting a smile on the faces of children fighting cancer. We will provide families across this country with hope for a better tomorrow. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 292, the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research Act. I want to particularly thank our lead Democratic sponsor, Mr. BUTTERFIELD  of North Carolina, for promoting this bill. Nearly 16,000 children are diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. each year. Those children are forced to bravely battle a disease and carry burdens that no one their age should. The Childhood Cancer STAR Act gives those children and their families hope by encouraging improved research as well as survivorship programs for children with cancer. This legislation urges the National Institutes of Health to find new opportunities to expand research into pediatric cancer and survivorship, such as supporting the collection of biospecimens, as well as supporting research on the causes of health disparities in pediatric cancer survivorship. The bill also allows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to award funding to help States strengthen their infrastructure to track the epidemiology of pediatric cancer. b1530 This improves childhood cancer surveillance and helps to guide public health decisionmaking as well as research inquiry. Finally, this bill recognizes that expanding research that leads to treatments and cures is only part of the equation in improving the experience of children diagnosed with this disease. We must ensure that quality care is available to meet their needs for the remainder of their lives. Unfortunately, the battle with pediatric cancer extends beyond beating the disease. As many as twothirds of pediatric cancer survivors suffer from longterm effects of their disease and treatment, including secondary cancers and organ damage. That is why this bill allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a pilot program to develop, study, or evaluate model systems for monitoring and caring for childhood cancer survivors through their lifespan, as well as to develop best practices for longterm followup services for pediatric cancer survivors. I will continue to support efforts like this to improve outcomes for cancer 
patients and survivors. However, unlike with this legislation, such efforts should proceed through the regular order process. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN), the chairman of the full committee. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I would thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and our staffs, who worked so hard on this legislation. I rise to offer my strong support for S. 292, the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research Act of 2018, simply known as the Childhood Cancer STAR Act. The House version of this important legislation was spearheaded by several, including my colleague Representative MICHAEL  MCCAULof Texas, the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security. I would like to thank the gentleman for his leadership on this bipartisan initiative. Being told your child has cancer is probably every parent’s worst nightmare. Even though childhood cancer is rare, it is still the second leading cause of death in children aged 1 to 14. In the last Congress we passed the 21st Century Cures Act. This landmark legislation modernized the Nation’s biomedical and innovation infrastructure, and it streamlined the process for how drugs and medical devices are approved so we can get new treatments to patients faster. And we have invested heavily in the National Institutes of Health through the appropriations process—then and now—recently increasing their budget by $3 billion in the 2018 spending bill, which I supported. The STAR Act builds on these investments and expands the reach of the 21st Century Cures legislation by focusing critical resources to advance both research and treatments for pediatric cancer. By reauthorizing and modifying the National Childhood Cancer Registry; supporting childhood cancer biorepositories; improving the tracking of cancer in children, adolescents, and young adults; and supporting efforts to improve the pediatric cancer survivorship care, the STAR Act will improve both treatment of children currently battling cancer and the quality of life for the young survivors who have beaten this terrible disease. So I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. This is good work we are doing here today in a bipartisan way in the United States House of Representatives. We will save lives. We will help families. Especially, we will help these children who are suffering mightily. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD ), the lead Democratic sponsor, who is always out front on so many important healthcare issues. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. PALLONE for his friendship and leadership on the committee. He has been an extraordinary leader in the healthcare space, and I want to publicly thank the gentleman for his work. As well as to Dr. BURGESS : I have been on the committee now for more than 10 years, and I have watched him and Mr. WALDEN , Mr. B ARTON , and others engage in debate. I know that all of them are seriously and totally committed to improving health outcomes in this country, and I thank them all for their leadership. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support S. 292, the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research Act, commonly referred to as the STAR Act. Along with Mr. MCCAUL, JACKIE SPEIER , and MIKE KELLY , I introduced H.R. 820, which is the House companion to S. 292. Over 85 percent of the House has cosponsored this bill. It is, therefore, my great honor to serve as cochair of the bipartisan House Childhood Cancer Caucus. Through the work of this caucus, I have had the opportunity to work closely with pediatric patient groups and stakeholders to promote legislation that can help save and improve the lives of young people. Passage of the STAR Act has long been a goal of those patients and of the Childhood Cancer Caucus, and I am grateful that the House is poised to send this important piece of legislation now to the President’s desk for his signature. Mr. Speaker, 16,000—16,000—children in the United States are diagnosed with cancer every year. Many of those have limited treatment options. The STAR Act, Mr. Speaker, is an important piece of legislation that will expand the opportunities for childhood cancer research, improve efforts to identify and track childhood cancer, and enhance the quality of life of childhood cancer survivors. Childhood cancer remains the leading cause of death in American children. As many as twothirds of childhood cancer survivors suffer from late effects of their disease or treatment, including secondary cancers or organ damage. That is why passage and enactment of this legislation is so important. The bill enhances research on the late effects of childhood cancers, improves collaboration among providers so that doctors are better able to care for survivors as they age, and explores innovative models of care for childhood cancer survivors. When enacted, S. 292 will help to advance pediatric cancer research and childfocused cancer treatments while also improving childhood cancer surveillance and providing enhanced resources for survivors. This bill, Mr. Speaker, is the most comprehensive childhood cancer legislation ever slated to be passed by this Congress. The STAR Act will give young cancer patients and their families better access to lifesaving treatments and the support they need even after beating cancer. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I thank all of the leaders of the committee for their work. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ), vice chairman of one of our subcommittees. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Childhood Cancer STAR Act, one of the most comprehensive pieces of childhood cancer legislation ever taken up by the Congress and another major bipartisan accomplishment of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. I certainly congratulate Dr. BURGESS . It is heartbreaking when a child is stricken with one of these lifethreatening diseases. I have met with families who have faced these terrible circumstances, and I have been touched by their stories of perseverance and hope. There is more work to be done. We need to improve Federal services for the pediatric cancer community, from research and access to treatment and survivorship. Federal healthcare and research entities must do all they can. The Childhood Cancer STAR Act delivers more resources and reform to make sure we are winning the fight against pediatric cancer by expanding grants for promising and expanded programs. Last week I stopped by the Hunterdon County Relay for Life event in Ringoes, New Jersey. The event brought together cancer patients, survivors, and their families. The crowd was large and enthusiastic in the fight against these terrible diseases. We owe it to those participants to ensure that federally supported research entities are doing all that they can do in this area. The Energy and Commerce Committee has made the cause of Cures a centerpiece of our work. This bill provides greater hope for all of the Nation’s youngest patients and their loved ones. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ), the vice ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership and for yielding the time. Mr. Speaker, we simply must do more for pediatric cancer and the children and families who are impacted by it. That is why I urge adoption of S. 292. It is also H.R. 820. I would like to thank my colleagues—Congressman MCCAUL, Congresswoman S PEIER , Congressman BUTTERFIELD , and Congressman KELLY —for leading the charge on this. It has broad bipartisan support. Mr. Speaker, I mostly want to thank the families and the parents across America who have helped educate us— folks like Bonnie Woodworth; her husband, Scott; and kids Joe, Delaney, and Piper—who have educated me and 
many policymakers across the Tampa Bay area. See, they lost their daughter and sister, Tatum, in 2012 to pediatric cancer. On behalf of so many families who often are held back by the pain of losing a child or dealing with childhood cancer, they channeled their energy into making things better for other families. They have educated me and others, along with Mary Ann Massolio with the 1Voice Foundation, back in the Tampa Bay area. I am so happy that it is paying off today. What they have explained is that, after you suffer this diagnosis, it is very isolating. America doesn’t do a lot of research on pediatric cancer. It is not coordinated very well, and the resources just are not there to help bring families together to get through these kinds of varied diagnoses. The STAR Act hopefully will make things better because we are going to ask the Centers for Disease Control to do more with States to track pediatric cancer. We are going to do a little more research on how it is best to care for survivors. We are going to try to endeavor to do better in coordination of care for kids with pediatric cancer, do more on research, and also, help folks in the minority community who often don’t have the resources dedicated to them that they need. Hopefully this will bring great relief to the families, and I urge a swift adoption. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, fellow Texan, and the principal author of the bill that we have before us today. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend Dr. BURGESS for shepherding this bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee and taking us to the point where we are today on the floor. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, the Childhood Cancer STAR Act. The bill addresses 4 major concerns facing the pediatric cancer community: survivorship, treatment, access, and research. I was proud to introduce this bill with Ms. JACKIE SPEIER , with G.K. BUTTERFIELD , and Mr. M IKEKELLY of Pennsylvania. This is the most comprehensive childhood cancer bill ever considered before this House. This bill passed the House in 2016, and I encourage the support of all Members today so we can finally send it to the President’s desk for his signature. I am proud to say that today is the day. I know a lot of the advocates have been waiting for this day for quite some time. Childhood cancer, unfortunately, remains the deadliest killer of our children. At some point we, as a Congress and as a Nation, must say enough is enough. In short, the STAR Act elevates and prioritizes the fight against childhood cancer at the NIH. Specifically, STAR places a pediatric oncologist on the board at the National Cancer Institute, so childhood cancer will now have a voice at the table when funding decisions are made. It also expands opportunities to childhood cancer research, allowing doctors to better understand and track how cancer develops in children. Finally, we must also address the needs of the nearly 500,000 survivors of childhood cancer. Due to their treatments using chemotherapy, a World War I chemical agent, twothirds of these survivors will face serious, lifelong medical conditions. When I think about what this means, I think of my friend Sadie Keller. She is perhaps the strongest person I know. Sadie underwent over 2 years of chemotherapy at the age of 7 after being diagnosed with leukemia. She has been, at her young age, perhaps the most relentless advocate for this cause, this bill here on Capitol Hill, and throughout the childhood cancer community. I just want to refer to this picture of little Sadie and myself when she was going through remission, on the Speaker’s balcony, looking out over The Mall, with a vision towards the future, a future where children will no longer have to go through this disease, looking at the dark clouds but the sunlight coming through. That is what this bill represents is sunlight for the children who have been afflicted with this terrible disease. b1545 While now her cancer is in remission, that does not mean her medical challenges are over. We must do more as a Nation to care for these survivors. To that end, the STAR Act will improve collaboration among providers so doctors are better able to care for survivors as they age. I want to close by thanking Sadie, but I also want to thank people like Danielle Leach and the Alliance for Childhood Cancer team for their relentless advocacy on the Hill and work on this bill. I also want to thank Nancy Goodman and Kids v. Cancer and the entire childhood cancer advocacy community for standing up and getting us to the point where we are today. They are the voice of these children. They made this event possible here today. And I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart. I urge passage of this lifealtering piece of legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ). Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the ranking member, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ). I rise today in support of the Childhood Cancer STAR Act. Thanks to research funded by the National Institutes of Health, the private sector, and philanthropic funds, we have made progress in the study and treatment of childhood cancers. However, every year, 16,000 children and their families receive that terrible, nightmarish news that their child has been diagnosed with cancer. My constituent Allison EasterLara was diagnosed with stage IV neuroblastoma when she was about 2 years old. Throughout her fight, she endured some of the harshest cancer treatments there are, with chemotherapy and stem cell transplants. Allison’s dad, Keith, visited my office earlier this year, and he shared a remarkable update. Allison is beating the odds. She is currently in remission and in a phase two drug trial. We must pass the STAR Act because we need more good outcomes like Allison’s. This bill will expand childhood cancer research opportunities at the NIH, improve our understanding of cancer as a disease, and work to enhance the quality of life for all survivors. It may be a moonshot, but I believe we can find new treatments and eventually a cure for childhood cancer. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE). Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. BURGESS . Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 204, the Right to Try Act. I am a physician and scientist with almost 40 years of experience in treating patients, and far too many of them, Mr. Speaker, have been diagnosed with cancer. A little over 3 years ago, my beloved wife, Pam Roe, who was a nurse, died of stage IV colon cancer, 5 weeks to the day after she was operated on. Pam would have liked the right to try. Less than 2 months after that, one of the best friends I will ever have in my life, Phil Street, a Vietnam veteran, Air Force veteran, died of cancer related to Agent Orange. Phil would have liked to have had the right to try. My senior partner in medical practice, a year later, good friend, Dr. Bill Bone, was diagnosed with brain cancer. Bill died. He would have liked to have had the right to try. Shortly after that, Linda Baines, a scrub nurse that I operated with hundreds of times in my medical practice, was diagnosed with brain cancer and died shortly after that. Linda would have liked to have had the right to try. Currently, I have three friends at this moment who are being treated with stage IV cancer. If those treatments don’t work, they would like to have the right to try. Mr. Speaker, my first pediatric rotation in medical school was at St. Jude Children’s Hospital, where, at that time, 80 percent of children died of their disease. I can still see many of those children’s faces today, and that was almost 50 years ago. Those children, today, have an 80 percent chance of living, but, as was stated, 16,000 parents have to face that this year. I have had the misfortune of having to look patients in the eye and say: Your life is not in my hands anymore; 
it is in God’s hands. In that moment, I will tell you this: all that these patients want and deserve is a right to try. Please support this legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I just want to urge support for this legislation. The support is obviously bipartisan, and I urge all my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to express my strong support for S. 292, the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research Act of 2018, Childhood Cancer STAR Act. And, once again, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), for spearheading this effort. I urge all my colleagues to support the legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access & Research (STAR) Act, a bill that will touch many lives affected by childhood cancer. This has been a true example of bipartisanship. I particularly want to thank my colleague Congressman MCCAULfor his leadership on this critical bill and my other fellow cochairs of the Congressional Childhood Cancer Caucus, Congressmen BUTTERFIELD and KELLY. I also want to thank our Senate partners, Senators REED, M OORE CAPITO , V AN HOLLEN , and I SAKSON . And to all children and families affected by childhood cancer, this is their victory. It is because of their tireless advocacy that this landmark legislation will be sent to the President’s desk and signed into law. With the STAR Act, we have won a battle in our longfought war against childhood cancer. This bill creates an arsenal of tools for the National Institutes of Health to promote vital research into childhood cancer, such as the establishment of National Biorepositories. It also improves the quality of life for survivors, including by funding models of longterm care to help monitor the progress of survivors as they age. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to recognize two of my constituents who have personally inspired my work on this important bill. The first is Christie Chaudry, who after surviving childhood cancer grew up to become a pediatric oncology nurse practitioner. For the last seven years, Christie has helped run the inpatient chemotherapy unit at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford—the same hospital where she was treated as a child. The second is Andrea Church, a childhood cancer advocate from San Carlos, California, who set a goal to have San Francisco City Hall lit up in gold in honor of Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Andrea’s daughter, Riley, passed away at age 14 due to an inoperable brain tumor. In her daughter’s honor, Andrea reached and surpassed her goal two years ago. Not only did San Francisco City Hall go gold, so did Oakland City Hall, AT&T Park—the home of the San Francisco Giants—and the Oakland Coliseum—the home of the Oakland A’s. Mr. Speaker, the STAR Act opens the door to numerous opportunities for research and innovation in the treatment of childhood cancer. It addresses critical gaps in the care of childhood cancer survivors, and it creates a holistic approach to studying the disease. With the passage of this legislation, we are moving closer to a future where children and their families may one day live cancerfree. I thank my colleagues for their support. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 292. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
TRICKETT WENDLER, FRANK MONGIELLO, JORDAN MCLINN, AND MATTHEW BELLINA RIGHT TO TRY ACT OF 2017 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 905, I call up the bill (S. 204) to authorize the use of unapproved medical products by patients diagnosed with a terminal illness in accordance with State law, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 905, the bill is considered read. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 204 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 2. USE OF UNAPPROVED INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS BY PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH A TERMINAL ILLNESS. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended by inserting after section 561A (21 U.S.C. 360bbb–0) the following:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous material into the RECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, here in the people’s House, we reflect the will of the American people. When the Right to Try Act is law in 40 States, it may no longer just be a grassroots movement. It is a call to action from Americans from coast to coast—many of the over 1 million Americans who die from a terminal illness every year—to return choice and control over treatment options to where it is most effective: with the patient, with the doctor. Today, the House is taking up the Right to Try Act for the third time. But the reason we are here again debating this issue is because of the Senate Democrats’ refusal to take up the revised righttotry legislation that passed this House by a bipartisan vote 2 months ago. That revised bill, H.R. 5247, was more narrowly crafted than this version of S. 204. This version, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, is before us today. S. 204 was authored by Senator RONJOHNSON of Wisconsin and passed by unanimous consent in the Senate last August. I think it is important, so let me take a moment to lay out the efforts by the Energy and Commerce Committee since that time. First, the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, which I chair, held a hearing last October to consider righttotry bills, including this bill, S. 204, where Members heard from Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, from patients and other groups that either support or oppose the concept of right to try. For several months, our committee engaged in conversations with patients, advocates, the administration, particularly the Food and Drug Administration, and stakeholders on all sides of this complex topic. Our aim was to open the door to innovative, experimental drugs for terminally ill patients without necessarily compromising the vital work and mission of the Food and Drug Administration. The product of that aim was H.R. 5247, the revised House right totry bill. Sadly, Senate Democrats said ‘‘thanks, but no thanks’’ to the House bill. Frankly, I am perplexed by their decision, because not a single Senate Democrat expressed any reservation when S. 204 passed their Chamber by unanimous consent last August. So House Republicans will show the American people that we hear you. We will act to deliver on a promise made by the President in this House before the joint session of the House and Senate during the State of the Union address. He told us that we would pass the righttotry legislation. Well, today, we are doing just that. You know, this was kind of a bold statement by the President, to stand up in the State of the Union and say that he wanted to sign this bill into law. So I am proud to boldly stand with him and stand with the American people. Mr. Speaker, we live in the greatest Nation in the world. An unprecedented amount of innovation and scientific breakthrough is the norm. We have innovative treatments at our fingertips because of the valuable contributions of researchers in academia and the private sector. Despite these achievements, I still hear from patients with serious, life threatening conditions, including constituents from north Texas, who remain frustrated with the current regulatory processes that prevent them from trying or experimenting with new therapies when everything else has failed them. As a physician, I understand that access to investigational drugs and therapies is a deeply personal priority for those seeking treatment for their loved ones with serious terminal conditions. To my friends on the other side of the dais in the committee and the aisle here in the House, I have a simple question: Why do you not want to allow these patients to exercise their right to fight for their future? Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H.R. 5247, the House righttotry bill that currently remains in the Senate. However, the righttotry legislation before the House today is the Senate bill, S. 204, so I am pleased that we are considering this righttotry bill so that terminally ill patients have a chance, maybe a second chance, at life. These patients are our constituents. They could be someone we know. Let us take this opportunity to improve access to experimental treatments for them and give them renewed hope. S. 204 establishes an alternative pathway for terminally ill patients to access certain investigational drugs that have successfully completed a phase one clinical trial and have an active application at the Food and Drug Administration. They also must be under active development or production by the manufacturer. It is important to note that, for these patients, they have exhausted all FDA approved treatment options and are unable to participate in a clinical trial involving these investigational drugs. The bill we will be voting out soon is about patients. It is about having more 
time with their loved ones. In the words of Vice President MIKEPENCE , ‘‘It’s about restoring hope and giving patients with lifethreatening diseases a fighting chance.’’ With hundreds of thousands of Americans with a terminal illness and their families looking for us to act, I urge Members of this House, the people’s House, to support restoring hope and giving them a fighting chance at life. I urge a vote in support of S. 204. Let us send this groundbreaking legislation to the President’s desk for his signature, and let it become the law of the land. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to S. 204, the Federal Right to Try Act. This is dangerous legislation that threatens FDA’s authority over ensuring that medical treatments are safe and effective. This bill needlessly exposes vulnerable patients to the risks of unproven medications. b1600 We heard last night in the Rules Committee from my Republican colleagues that we must accept and pass this legislation because the Senate is unable to pass a bill that passed the House earlier this year. That House bill was bad enough, but this Senate bill is much worse. I cannot fathom why my Republican colleagues are surrendering to the Senate and agreeing to pass a more dangerous version of the rightto try legislation. The Senate bill, like the House bill, establishes an alternative pathway for experimental treatments that eliminates any review from the Food and Drug Administration and scientific and medical experts of an independent review board. This will provide flyby night physicians and clinics the opportunity to peddle false hope and ineffective drugs to desperate patients. At a hearing before our committee, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb cautioned that S. 204 risked ‘‘exposing people to unwanted side effects from experimental therapies.’’ Now, supporters of this bill would have you believe that this legislation is targeted at those with terminal illnesses, but this is simply not the case. S. 204 would, in fact, apply to a much broader range of patients diagnosed with lifethreatening diseases or conditions. And the term ‘‘lifethreatening disease or condition’’ could include chronic and often manageable diseases, such as diabetes or chronic heart failure. If all patients with diabetes and other chronic but manageable illnesses were eligible, it would greatly expand the scope of the legislation well beyond the scope of most State laws and FDA’s expanded access program. This exposes an even greater number of patients to risk and undermines our clinical trial program by diverting patients from trials that could support full approval to the alternate pathway. Commissioner Gottlieb also cautioned Congress that this legislation risked ‘‘undermining a regulatory process that has been carefully crafted over many years to strike a very careful balance.’’ The Commissioner noted that S. 204 would not subject all participants to the alternate pathway to critical regulatory requirements, such as labeling products as investigational, charging limitations, and restrictions on promotion and commercialization of such treatments. S. 204 could also impede the FDA from taking action against manufacturers and others that violate other provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Under this bill, if a bad actor is not in compliance with good manufacturing practices or does not protect against intentional alteration—adulteration, I should say—or allows dishonest or misleading labeling, the FDA will not be able to take any enforcement action. But, more importantly, Mr. Speaker, this Federal righttotry bill simply is not necessary, in my opinion. FDA has an expanded access program and has an approval rate of nearly 100 percent. To be clear, FDA’s high approval rate is not just a rubberstamp for these applications. Of the applications FDA receives and approves, it also adjusts applications for 11 percent of patients to improve patient safety protections. This could include modifying the dosing, strengthening informed consent, or improving safety monitoring. We must protect patients from bad actors or from dangerous treatments that might make their lives worse. Without this critical review, there will not be any oversight to ensure that patients are not being taken advantage of or put in harm’s way. The main reason this bill is being pushed is to chip away at FDA’s authority to ensure the safety and effectiveness of our drugs. FDA oversight of access to experimental treatment exists for a reason: it protects patients from potentially snake oil salesmen or from experimental treatments that might do more harm than good. By removing the FDA oversight, you are counting on physicians and manufacturers to serve as the gatekeeper and protector of our patients. I simply don’t buy that that is going to work. Supporters of this bill want to blindly believe that there are no bad actors out there, but imagine someone like Martin Shkreli promising a dying patient a cure that could save their life. Under this bill, FDA would play no role in determining whether or not Martin Shkreli could provide that drug to that dying patient. If S. 204 is signed into law, patients will be taken advantage of and will be harmed. Bad actors exist, and this Republican bill gives them the opportunity to prey on desperate people who are, understandably, looking for any treatment that may help save their lives. Now, let me also point out that the supporters of this bill claim to be helping desperate patients who are looking for hope. If this is such a patientcentered bill, why does every major patient organization overwhelmingly oppose it? Where is the call from patients for this legislation? More than 100 patient organizations, including the National Organization for Rare Disorders, Friends of Cancer Research, and American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, sent a letter to Congress just yesterday opposing this legislation. In the letter, they stated: ‘‘The Senate version of the legislation is less safe than the pathway proposed in the House version and is dangerous compared to the current expanded FDA access process.’’ Four former FDA Commissioners from both parties also oppose this Republican legislation, noting: ‘‘There is no evidence that either bill’’—that is the House or the Senate—‘‘would meaningfully improve access for patients, but both would remove the FDA from the process and create a dangerous precedent that would erode protections for vulnerable patients.’’ Mr. Speaker, S. 204, I know, is a key agenda item for the President and the Vice President; but I think it is dangerous for our patients, and it is an unprecedented attempt to roll back FDA’s oversight of investigational treatments. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with more than 100 organizations that have come forward to oppose this misguided and, I believe, harmful legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), the chairman of the full committee. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, today represents the third time this year that the House has considered legislation to deliver hope to patients who are battling terminal diseases. Twice already, a bipartisan majority of Members has supported increasing patient access to investigational drugs through a new pathway outside of the existing expanded access program, and the bill before us today is deserving of that same support. Thirtynine States have righttotry laws, including my home State of Oregon. While the State policies vary, they have a common goal: helping vulnerable patients. President Trump praised the movement during the State of the Union. He said: ‘‘People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance here at home.’’ Those are the President’s words. Since this time, he has continued to feverishly advocate for this legislation. For today’s debate, I believe it is important to understand that it is both 
the background of this issue as well as the politics that have brought us back to this floor. Today, there is an existing process for patients to access unapproved drugs. The FDA oversees the expanded access program, commonly known as compassionate use. This program has been critical in helping patients access experimental or investigative drugs. As I previously said before in this Chamber, Commissioner Gottlieb and the agency should be commended for their continued work to improve the expanded access program for patients. To improve this successful program, the bill this Chamber previously passed provides liability protections for manufacturers, sponsors, physicians, clinical investigators, and hospitals that participate in the existing expanded access program and the new alternative pathway created under the legislation. That provision removes one of the biggest hurdles patients face, as identified by the Government Accountability Office, in gaining access to experimental therapies: manufacturer hesitancy to participate. That is the obstacle. That same bill creates a new alternative pathway for patients who do not qualify for a clinical trial. It is my view that the Housepassed bill strengthens patient protections with clearer informed consent and adverse event reporting. The bill also ensures that the FDA is notified when a patient receives an unapproved drug through the new alternative pathway to ensure proper oversight. But when a strong bipartisan majority of this Chamber, of the U.S. House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, delivered for patients and answered President Trump’s call to give Americans the right to try, leaders in the Senate on the other side of the aisle objected, blocking terminally ill patients from increasing access to investigational drugs. But we will not allow them to play politics to delay this effort any longer. That is why we are here today. Mr. Speaker, across our great country, men, women, children, and parents are desperately seeking a beacon of hope, and the Senate bill we have before us today will provide it. Mr. Speaker, I thank President Trump and Vice President PENCE for continuing to weigh in on this important issue; and the sponsors of past and current legislation, including Senator JOHNSON and Representatives FITZPATRICK and B IGGS, who are here with us today. They have all been tireless in their advocacy and their efforts for this worthy cause. I am glad to see that, together, we are once again going to deliver. But, most importantly, I would like to acknowledge the individuals this bill is named after: Trickett, Frank, Jordan, and Matthew. Jordan was here on the House floor the first time we considered righttotry legislation, and Matthew testified at our hearing last fall. Jordan is back with us today. It is through their advocacy and hope to find a treatment or a cure that we have this chance to give patients the right to try. Mr. Speaker, it is time for the House to do what the entire United States Senate did and pass this legislation. It is time to send a righttotry bill to President Trump’s desk, where he is eager to sign it. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR ), the vice ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his leadership and for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, S. 204 is harmful legislation that offers a false hope of access to investigational therapies and endangers patients who have serious and life threatening diseases. The bill establishes a dangerous and unnecessary alternative pathway that is void of any FDA review or oversight. It is opposed overwhelmingly by the patient community. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter to the Speaker and minority leader from 104 patient advocacy groups. It includes such groups as the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the American Lung Association, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation—all opposed to this bill—the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, and about 100 more. 
MAY21, 2018. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. The Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : The undersigned organizations collectively represent millions of patients with serious and lifethreatening diseases. We write to express our strong opposition to the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act (S. 204). On March 21st, The House of Representatives passed a version of the Right to Try Act (H.R. 5247), that incorporated important patient safeguards such as more robust informed consent and public reporting requirements, additional Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight, and a narrower definition of eligibility for this pathway. The Senate version does not include these safeguards and therefore could greatly increase the likelihood of our patients being harmed by unsafe and ineffective experimental therapies. Therefore, this version is substantially worse for patients. We reiterate our concern with creating a secondary pathway for accessing investigational therapies outside of clinical trials. This pathway removes FDA approval and consultation and would not increase access to promising therapies for our patients because it does not address the primary barriers to access. FDA’s expanded access program, though imperfect, facilitates access to investigational therapies for over a thousand patients facing serious and lifethreatening conditions each year. FDA repeatedly approves over 99 percent of requests while sometimes making important dosing and safety improvements to proposed expanded use. Conversely, it is often times the pharmaceutical company that denies access to its investigational therapy outside of its clinical trials for any number of reasons. The Senate version of the legislation is less safe than the pathway proposed in the House version and is dangerous compared to the current expanded access process. The Senate’s bill would allow unproven therapies to be given to patients without FDA notification for up to a full year and would not establish any standards for informed consent. Additionally, both versions prohibit FDA from halting access to these experimental therapies short of placing a clinical hold on all clinical research on the therapy in question. Both House and Senate versions would also remove FDA’s consultation on dosing, route of administration, dosing schedule, and other important safety measures available under FDA’s current expanded access program. While we did not support the recent House passed version of this legislation, the House legislation includes improved patient safeguards compared to the Senate version. The Senate version would negatively impact patient safety substantially, and our collective organizations are strongly opposed. We appreciate past efforts in the House to consider stakeholder perspectives and desire to continue the dialogue, but returning to the Senate version is simply not the way forward.

Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this bill is a bill in search of a problem. FDA has approved 99 percent of the expanded access requests it receives. FDA’s expanded access program approves nearly all requests for investigational drugs or biologics it receives. Physicians at the FDA are available 24 hours a day to approve any emergency expanded access requests that the agency receives, and it typically grants those emergency requests immediately over the phone and nonemergency requests in a median time of 4 days and generally no longer than 30 days. FDA has also taken actions to streamline this entire process. The process of clinical trials at FDA is vital to the protection of the health of all of our neighbors and the folks we represent. In 11 percent of expanded access applications, FDA has raised a red flag and said: Do you know what? You have got to change this. That is who we are trying to protect here: the actual patients. The patient groups across the country agree with us. Many States have tinkered with righttotry laws, but this is different. Forty States have enacted righttotry laws, but there is no evidence that anyone has obtained the type of therapy via these laws that couldn’t have been obtained through the FDA’s expanded access program. Righttotry laws do not compel companies to provide patient access to these treatments. Therefore, under these laws, patients still do not have a right to try, only the right to request it from the company. Sometimes those insurance companies will say: Do you know what? We are not going to pay for it. So that is going to be another barrier. Mr. Speaker, in the end, these right totry laws put patients at higher risk by prohibiting and weakening the FDA oversight, leaving our neighbors on the hook to cover the cost of unproven treatments. For all of these reasons, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the bill. Join with the patient advocates across America, who, in this letter, called this a dangerous proposal. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BARTON ), the vice chairman of the full committee and chairman emeritus of the Energy and Commerce Committee. (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, when I was a little boy, I used to read comic books, and one of them I read was Superman. In the Superman comic books, way back in the 1960s, Superman had an alterego that lived on Bizarro World. b1615 In Bizarro World, everything was a little bit offkilter. When I listen to my sincerely good friends on the minority side, I think they are on Bizarro World. I know they mean well, but they are not seeing the same planet I am seeing. I have told this story a number of times about my brother John at the age of 40 having liver cancer. He had exhausted all conventional therapy. He was given less than 3 months to live. Being a Member of Congress and on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I had access to the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. I called, and I said: Are there any experimental programs that you could get my brother into that might help him? They checked, and they had a clinical trial, I believe, in San Antonio, Texas. We called down, and they got him into it. But they told him: This is experimental. It has helped a lot of people so far, but it doesn’t help everybody. And if it doesn’t help you, it accelerates your disease. He and his wife prayed about it, and his mother and myself and his brother and sister, and we all decided, why not? They put John in the trial, and it didn’t help him, but we were at peace because we had used every available remedy that we could to try to help him. This bill—which has passed the Senate, and if we pass it today, it goes to the President and it is going to be signed this week—gives patients, if their doctors approve, the right to try. It has to be an investigational drug that is in an FDA clinical trial that has passed phase one, which has proved that it is nontoxic. It gives them the right to try. There is no downside to this. This could become law. It would give a statutory right to try at the Federal level. Why in the world my friends on the minority side have a problem with—it passed the Senate unanimously, which means, under the current Senate, 49 Democrats voted for it by a voice vote. There is no downside to it. The FDA is still in control of what drugs are passed through this phase one clinical trial. And the doctor has to recommend it, and the patient has to accept it. So I hope we will vote ‘‘yes.’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DONOVAN ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, the bill has already passed the House on a bipartisan vote. I think I am right that it passed with 261 votes the last time we sent it. The House bill is a little bit better bill than the Senate, but the Senate bill is better than no bill. So please vote ‘‘yes’’ when the time comes this afternoon. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCNERNEY ). Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the Members of the House for talking about this issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S. 204, the Right to Try Act. I don’t agree with my friend from Texas that there is no downside, and I will go over that here in these 2 minutes. The House took up this issue before, and I voted against it then. This version is worse, so of course I am going to oppose it. It would weaken the FDA’s authority and provide broad access to unproven treatments. The FDA’s oversight of experimental treatment plays a critical role in protecting patients from bad actors with malicious intent or from drugs that are grossly untested. The FDA’s oversight protections protect patients from experimental treatments that might do more harm than good. Chipping away at the FDA’s authority would put patients in my district and around the country in great danger by providing liability protections for manufacturers and weaken the FDA’s oversight ability. This legislation would leave patients with no recourse in the case of harmful side effects. This legislation is even more flawed, as I said, than the House bill that I voted against back in March. Like the earlier bill, the Senate bill contains the same dangerous, unnecessary pathways to experimental treatments, but it exposes a much larger number of patients to serious risk—not just terminal patients, but patients that would like to try something that is not even tested. In fact, it is so broad, that it exposes patients of all chronic conditions to the risk of experimental treatments. More than 100 major patient safety groups have voiced their strong opposition to this bill. Moreover, this bill is not even necessary. The FDA has an expedited approval process for terminal patients. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand up for patient safety and vote against this flawed legislation. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), a valuable member of the Health Subcommittee. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 204, the Right to Try Act, because this legislation will enhance access to potentially lifesaving treatments for patients with terminal diseases or conditions. Currently, patients can only receive drugs that are undergoing FDA clinical trials through compassionate use or expanded access. At this time, patients and their physicians can acquire unapproved treatments through the FDA, not directly through the drug sponsor. This critical legislation would establish informed consent for patients to access unapproved drugs that could save their lives. This bill still guards patients from manufacturers misbranding or mislabeling drugs and specifies that any unapproved drug used in the new alternative pathway must have an active application that is not the subject of a clinical hold. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Speaker and the majority leader for recognizing the importance of rightto try legislation and making sure that we fulfill our duty to patients looking for any chance to survive deadly conditions. This is a great step forward toward ensuring our patients get to take advantage of the incredible pharmaceutical therapies that are being researched and developed in the United States. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO ). Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the socalled Right to Try Act. This ideologically driven legislation is trying to solve a problem that simply doesn’t exist. Every single Member of this body supports allowing terminally ill individuals to seek access to experimental treatments that could be potentially lifesaving. However, we have to do so in a structured way that won’t undermine the role of the FDA in guaranteeing that the medications we all use are safe and are effective. I believe the FDA’s current expanded access program meets that test by ensuring proper informed consent and adverse event reporting and establishes the appropriate safeguards around access to experimental drugs. The legislation before us would take the FDA out of the process completely and would allow a black market of snake oil salesmen to emerge, with unscrupulous companies selling untested drugs to a broad array of individuals, including those with manageable chronic conditions like diabetes. Make no mistake about it: this legislation offers false hope to seriously ill individuals and will put patients at risk. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, before giving my remarks, I include in the RECORD a statement by Senator J OHNSONexplaining the intent of S. 204. 
STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT  (By Sen. Ron Johnson on S. 204 (as considered by the House of Representatives)) In a recent article about pending right to try legislation, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb was quoted as saying: ‘‘In terms of making sure that it balances [access to experimental drugs] against appropriate patient protections . . . with [S. 204], we’d have to do a little bit more . . . in guidance and perhaps in regulation to achieve some of those goals, and I think those are the goals that Congress wants us to achieve.’’ The article went on to quote Commissioner Gottlieb as saying: ‘‘We felt that there were certain aspects of [S. 204] that could be modified to build in additional patient protections, but if you weren’t able to do that legislatively, that there [was] a pathway by which you do that administratively and still remain consistent with the letter and the spirit of this law.’’ In response to this article, Commissioner Gottlieb tweeted the ‘‘FDA . . . stands ready to implement [right to try] in a way consistent with the intent of Congress.’’ As S. 204’s primary author and lead sponsor, I want to make this legislation’s intent absolutely clear and remove any ambiguity that the FDA could use to implement right to try in a way contrary to its aim. S. 204, as originally introduced, applied to patients ‘‘with a terminal illness,’’ as defined by State law. In discussion with the FDA, the agency suggested it would prefer a uniform federal definition, especially one that already existed in federal statute or regulation, because an existing federal definition would facilitate implementation of the law. The FDA suggested defining terminal illness as an ‘‘immediately lifethreatening disease or condition.’’ The FDA disclosed that its suggested definition would exclude, for example, patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy—an illness explicitly intended to be covered by the legislation. To be clear, I rejected this proposed definition because I believed it would inappropriately exclude patients with certain diseases from accessing treatments. By contrast, the legislation instead defines terminal illness as ‘‘lifethreatening disease or condition’’ (which exists in current federal regulation), which the FDA confirmed would include patients diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Contrary to the preference of FDA official Dr. Janet Woodcock, who expressed the FDA’s desire to draft the legislation ‘‘to make sure we don’t include patients we (the FDA) doesn’t intend to include,’’ I replied and rejected that notion by stating my intent was completely opposite hers: ‘‘I wanted to make sure we didn’t exclude any one we didn’t intend to exclude.’’ My aim from the beginning was to be as inclusive as possible such that as many patients as possible who are facing no available alternatives could potentially qualify. S. 204 is fundamentally about empowering terminallyill patients and their doctors who, together with the cooperation of the developers of potentially lifesaving therapies, should be in charge of making a determination about their own course of treatment. The bill is not intended to further empower any federal agency, including the FDA, to limit in any way the ability of an individual facing a lifethreatening disease or condition from accessing treatment. S. 204 is about preserving a right to hope and about expanding individual freedom. It is not meant to empower the FDA to limit the right to hope by regulation or guidance. S. 204 includes a provision ensuring the Secretary may not use a clinical outcome associated with the use of an eligible investigational drug to delay or adversely affect review or approval of the drugs, unless use of such clinical outcome is critical to determining safety. This language is in no way intended to enable the FDA to expand the scope of existing safety determinations regarding investigational drugs. S. 204 requires, in certain circumstances, that an eligible investigational drug be under investigation in a clinical trial that is intended to form the primary basis of a claim of effectiveness in support of approval or licensure. According to the FDA, this language simply incorporates the standard definition of a clinical trial. This language is not in any way intended to enable the FDA to exclude any clinical trial as a basis for precluding access to treatments under right to try. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Right to Try Act and on behalf of the patients who are fighting each and every day to try to save their own lives. It has been a long ride, but we are in sight of our destination. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a brief moment to thank my friend and colleague, Representative FITZPATRICK , for working with me on this cause from the moment we both entered office last year, and to extend my appreciation to Senator JOHNSON , whose efforts on behalf of right to try have been extraordinary. Mr. Speaker, I also thank Chairman WALDEN for his efforts and the leadership of President Trump and Vice President PENCE . Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge and thank my predecessor, Congressman Matt Salmon, for his tireless efforts to pass right to try. But it is the patients themselves and their tireless advocates who deserve the most recognition. I have said this before and I will continue to say it: when the Right to Try Act passes this Chamber and is signed into law by the President, it will be them, not us, who deserve the most credit for this remarkable victory. Everyone here has heard me speak about the Right to Try Act more than a few times already and everyone here is aware of the widespread support that this legislation has garnered. Forty States have already passed righttotry legislation, often with unanimous or overwhelming support from Republicans and Democrats alike. If we can’t come together to support a commonsense cause such as this one, I am not sure what effort we can unite behind. 
Those on the other side of this debate—and they are a shrinking minority—argue that this legislation is unnecessary. Well, if it is so unnecessary, why do I receive phone calls and letters from patients each week urging me to do everything in my power to get this legislation passed? I have no doubt the FDA’s expanded access program helps patients, but I also know that the agency’s personnel, including Director Gottlieb himself, want to help as many patients as possible, but their efforts simply are not enough. The Right to Try Act doesn’t eliminate the expanded access program. Far from it. We are merely providing another, more direct avenue for patients to acquire potentially lifesaving medications from pharmaceutical companies that don’t require them to ask permission from a bureaucratic middleman. Another argument I hear from the naysayers, one that makes me angry, is that we are peddling false hope. False hope? What is that? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, to this tired argument, I respond that there is no such thing as false hope. You either have hope or you don’t. I, for one, want those brave men and women who are fighting every day against terrible illnesses and almost insurmountable odds to have a choice, even if it is the last choice many of them will ever have the opportunity to make. I trust them to weigh the pros and cons and choose for themselves whether they wish to take a risk to try to save their own lives. Make no mistake: it is a choice. We are not offering a mandate, merely an option. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I just want to respond briefly to the previous speaker on the Republican side. I don’t understand how the gentleman can say that the expanded access program will continue even under right to try. The problem is, sure, on paper it will continue, but there wouldn’t be any reason for anyone to go to the FDA. If the FDA is now out of the picture and all you have to do is find somebody who manufactures a drug or treatment and get the doctor to say, ‘‘Okay, I will administer it,’’ then you don’t need to go to the expanded access program. You see, the problem is that the gentleman assumes that people will go to the FDA and they will know that the expanded access program exists. I think the very nature of this legislation, which basically says that you don’t have to go to the FDA, is going to mean that people won’t even know that that is an option. And if they can get somebody to give them the drug without going to the FDA, they will just do it. Let me just say this. I know the gentleman referred to the FDA’s bureaucrats. I guess you could say that the people at the FDA are bureaucrats, but the FDA existed because, for many years before then, in the 19th century and early 20th century, all kinds of snake oil and things were advertised and promoted in the papers and in magazines, saying that this is going to cure that, this is going to cure that, and people demanded that there be some kind of Federal oversight as to whether drugs or treatments actually are effective, whether they have harm, whether they are toxic. That is why the FDA was started. So I guess I just don’t understand, because the bottom line is there is very little evidence that there is any significant number of people who are denied treatment or drugs because of the expanded access program. At least then they know that some agency has looked at this to see whether it is harmful, whether it has some negative impact. The great concern that those of us on the other side of this issue have is that without the FDA, there is no guarantee that what somebody gets as a form of treatment is actually going to be meaningful, not be harmful. So I don’t want to prolong my response to the gentleman, but I do think that you have to understand that those of us on this side of the aisle actually think that the FDA has a purpose and actually performs an important function, and I don’t think we should deny that. I think it is unfortunate that there are those who think that somehow the FDA is not doing its job. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1630 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ), another principal author of the bill. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, today is long overdue; long, long overdue. I want to thank Leader MCCARTHY, Chairman W ALDEN , Dr. B URGESS , Mr. GRIFFITH , my friend and colleague, ANDYBIGGS, Senator R ONJOHNSON , and all of the advocates who have had a relentless fight to see right to try debated, passed, and signed into law once and for all. And I want to thank the overwhelming bipartisan majority of my colleagues here in the House who we had to work on, many of them, back in March, who supported the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act and proved emphatically that right to try is about more than politics. It is about hope. For those patients caught in between traditional drug delay approvals, a clinical trial process for which they do not qualify, and limited time, the Right to Try Act. Simply establishes the freedom for patients and their doctors to try therapies where the benefits far outweigh the risks. It gives them the option of saving their life. Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge the Wendler, Bellina, Mongiello, McLinn families, all who are here with us in this Chamber today to see history be made. Although the FDA has a program that allows terminal patients to apply for early access to promising treatments, the Right to Try Act is needed because the FDA’s compassionate use process does not help enough people. While 99 percent of expanded access applications are approved, the application process is complicated, it is time consuming, and it is expensive. Moreover, only about 1,200 people a year can make it through the application process. By contrast, Mr. Speaker, in 2014, more than 12,000 people in France were using investigational treatments through that government’s equivalent program. How is it, pray tell, that a country onefifth the size of the United States can help 900 percent more people? The FDA program clearly is not working. Mr. Speaker, the Right to Try Act gives people hope. And let me be clear: This bill requires robust informed consent between the patient, the doctor, and the manufacturer, while requiring notification be given to the FDA after an unapproved drug becomes available to an eligible patient, and requiring doctors and the manufacturers to report adverse events. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, when life hangs in the balance, the Federal Government must not stand in the way of this process. We have to get this done once and for all. Mr. Speaker, today, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, appeal to the better angels of your nature. All the groups that they say are opposed to this bill, I will tell you who is in favor of this bill: Over 80 percent of the American people, and they are the ones who have the power in this country, and they are the ones we have to listen to. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to respond to the previous Republican speaker. He made three comments that disturb me. One, he said that people should be able to try things, try the drugs or the treatment, when the benefits outweigh the risks. But how are they going to know that when the FDA isn’t involved? When the FDA goes through various phases of clinical trial, not only phase 
one, which determines whether something is toxic, but beyond, to determine whether it is effective or whether it has harmful effects, then you do know. The FDA basically will tell you: Yes, the benefits outweigh the risk, and that is why we have an approval process in general for drugs, and that is why we have the expanded access, so that the FDA can look at it and say: Okay. Maybe you are going to risk this, but we want to make sure that you have some protection. The gentleman said that the FDA process is complicated or time consuming. First of all, there is an emergency process where you can simply get on the phone or the doctor gets on the phone, and within 24 hours you can be approved. But on the other hand, if it is not an emergency, the average approval time is 4 days. So I don’t know how he can say that this is time consuming. And then the last thing he said is that there is consent, that the doctors and the manufacturers have to agree. But who is going to enforce this? Right now, because the FDA has to go through the expanded access process, the FDA has the enforcement. They can say: We are going to grant this; we are not; we are going to provide some safety or other protections. But if the doctor and some flyby night manufacturer decide that they want to give you this drug or treatment, who is going to enforce that? How do we know that the doctor is legitimate? How do we know that the manufacturer is not selling snake oil? Once the FDA is out of the picture, there is no way for the patient to know whether the doctor is unscrupulous, whether the manufacturer is unscrupulous. There is no review. There is no enforcement whatsoever. So, again, this is the problem once you take the FDA out. I understand there are some that don’t like the FDA, don’t think maybe they should be involved. But in the absence of the FDA, I don’t know how you possibly could know whether this thing is going to help you, whether the benefits outweigh the risk, whether there is a bad actor involved, either with the doctor or the manufacturer. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, I want to read from the Statement of Administration Policy that was put out by the Executive Office of the President. The last paragraph: Since the late 1980s, the Food and Drug Administration has facilitated access to investigational drugs, devices, and biological products for the treatment of seriously ill patients. Families in these situations have sometimes found this process challenging, and the Food and Drug Administration is constantly striving to make improvements to its expanded access program. Some patients and their families, however, still have challenges accessing investigational treatments. The administration believes that the treatment decisions for those facing terminal illnesses are best made by the patients with the support and the guidance of their treating physicians. This legislation will advance those principles. Mr. Speaker, that is from the Statement of Administration Policy, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want my colleagues on the other side to understand why so many of us over here have been so upset by this proposal today. As I think I said before, the House bill was bad enough. The Senate bill is worse for at least two reasons. One is our concern, on the one hand, that rather than these drugs or treatments without FDA approval would be handed to just terminally ill patients, that the Senate bill says that it would apply to people who have lifethreatening situations. And the FDA and the commissioner of the FDA have stated quite clearly that they are concerned about the expansion from terminal to lifethreatening, because it could be that people who have diseases like diabetes, severe diabetes, or chronic heart disease, for example, could make the argument that their situation is lifethreatening, and, therefore, they can go and get these experimental drugs without FDA approval. So that is a huge loophole that is very disconcerting. The second thing is that the prohibition, if you will, on promotional activity with these investigational drugs is taken out by the Senate bill. So the worst thing of all, we talk about snake oil and advertising, is now is some unscrupulous doctor or manufacturer now going to promote this and say: Well, if you take this, this may save your life? So that is why the Senate bill is worse. But I want to go back to the whole idea. The problem that I have with all this is that once you take out the FDA, and the FDA is not involved anymore, the way this bill is set up, how do I know, if I am the patient and I hear from some doctor or through some promotion or whatever, that there is something that might help me, and I am desperate, how do I know that the doctor that I go to or the manufacturer who is promoting this drug, that this is actually not a bad actor, not somebody who is taking advantage of the situation because there is no FDA approval? In other words, who is going to determine whether this person’s life is threatened or whether they are terminally ill? There is no FDA. Who determines that? Who is going to determine whether this drug has any effectiveness at all? Well, some of my Republican colleagues say: Well, it has to go through phase one, but phase one clinical trials could have 20 or 30 people. They are sometimes very small. The FDA doesn’t really have any ability to control those clinical trials. Sure, they have some oversight over clinical trials, but there are clinical trials that take place all over the country with very few people, and sometimes the drug manufacturers who are experimenting with these trials, with these small groups, are not necessarily known manufacturers or large ones that we know will be safeguarding these drugs or treatments. So I just think the problem is, when we talk about snake oil and bad actors, it is almost as if the Republicans assume there are no bad actors. Because if you assume that there are, which I do, and there are bad actors who are going to promote something that is not going to be effective or is going to harm somebody, and that there is a manufacturer who is not someone we know, who is going to determine whether or not they are a bad actor or what they are doing? You need to have some kind of enforcement. You need to have somebody who is supervising this. Otherwise, it is any man for himself decides: I will try this drug. It went through phase one. Maybe it is not toxic. So I really worry that this debate on the other side of the aisle is not taking into consideration that there always are going to be people who want to take advantage of the situation and sell something that they are going to make a buck on that is not necessarily going to have any real oversight in this situation. So that is my fear. That is my fundamental fear about this bill, that these situations are going to arise, nobody is going to be in charge, nobody is going to know what is going on, and then the person is going to either die earlier or have some awful impact, and then they are going to say: Oh, how come the FDA didn’t approve it? Or maybe they are going to assume the FDA approved it, and there is no FDA. They are gone. Mr. Speaker, in any case, I would urge my colleagues to oppose what I consider very harmful legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, on January 30 of this year, the President of the United States came to this House and addressed a joint session of the House and Senate in the State of the Union address, and he said, right from that podium, ‘‘People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for Congress to give these wonderful Americans the right to try.’’ Mr. Speaker, I couldn’t say it any better than the President has already put it. The Right to Try Act is before us. It is a good bill. The House needs to support it, and it will go to the President for his signature. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, this proposed ‘‘Right to Try’’ legislation will make it possible for bad actors to take advantage of desperate families. The pill would allow companies to completely circumvent the FDA if they claim to have a new drug or cure for a patient. And it dogs not require the doctor or the company to even report to FDA, so we will have no way of knowing who is trying which experimental drug. This legislation really does encourage snake oil salesmen. Currently, legitimate companies may have new experimental drugs that have not yet been approved, but that could be helpful for patients who have no other options . . . but this bill is not limited to that situation. And, FDA does have an existing process to allow for patients with lifethreatening conditions to try experimental drugs before they are approved. And, this bill is not limited only to patients with a lifethreatening condition. FDA has testified that the process under this bill would be available much more broadly to patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes. That is a large population with a condition that is managed with currently available treatments. Under this bill, bad actors could see the dollar signs to market ineffective drugs to these patients. The bill before us today does not require FDA or Institutional Review Boards (or IRB’s) to review any request for experimental therapy, and rescinds any requirement to report adverse effects of a drug immediately. This means that if someone loses their eyesight or dies from taking an unproven experimental treatment, then no one is required to report it immediately. This puts other patients taking the same drug in danger. Additionally, if a patient does have a success with a drug, but it is not reported or considered in a clinical trial, that success will not translate to other patients that could be saved by the treatment. I am also incredibly concerned that in 19 states, taking experimental treatment will result in the loss of people’s hospice care, and in 4 states it will result in the loss of their insurance, completely. To rake matters worse, this legislation does not stipulate that patients must be informed of this loss of coverage or hospice coverage in advance. This legislation, therefore, puts patients’ care network, financial stability, and safety at risk—without any legal recourse. If we open this loophole, a surge of bad actors who may claim to have experimental drug therapies could make money peddling dangerous therapies to unsuspecting patients with no system of oversight, safety, and accountability. The unfortunate victims will be families and their loved ones. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S. 204, the socalled ‘‘Right to Try’’ bill that offers false hope for patients and families while circumventing FDA’s role in overseeing drugs. Two months ago, our chamber debated the House Republican version of this legislation, H.R. 5247. I spoke out in opposition to that bill due to my serious concerns over the lack of oversight and protections for terminally ill patients and their families, particularly by excluding the U.S. Food and Drug Administration from any role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of experimental therapies. Instead of addressing our concerns, the Majority has doubledowned on this unnecessary legislation with an even broader proposal that would expose a great number of patients to unproven medical treatments and unwanted side effects. S. 204 eliminates critical patient protections, such as a review by a third party of clinical protocols and informed consent, and eliminates the requirement that treating physicians and manufacturers report adverse events to the FDA in real time. Under this legislation, insurers and pharmaceutical companies are not required to cover the cost, or reduce the cost, of these oftenexpensive treatments—meaning the full cost of these experimental drugs would fall on patients and their families. All the while, we already have a proven RighttoTry system already in place through the FDA. This program, popularly known as Compassionate Use, has been helping seriously ill Americans have access to experimental therapies still under clinical trials for 31 years. FDA approves nearly all requests for investigational drugs. For the past five years, FDA’s approval rate for expanded access requests is over 99 percent. In fact, FDA physicians are available 24 hours a day to approve emergency requests. My daughter, an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska, used FDA’s Compassionate Use pathway to provide an experimental therapy for an American missionary who had contracted ebola while in Africa in 2014. FDA approved the request for the experimental treatment over the telephone in less than 24 hours. The new pathway created in S. 204 is not necessary and, in fact, may well endanger the health and safety of seriously ill patients by bypassing FDA’s oversight and expertise. This is an unnecessary and dangerous bill that offers false hope to seriously ill patients and families. I ask my colleague to oppose this legislation and work with me to advance proven measures that will help Americans facing lifethreatening diseases. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania). All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 905, the previous question is ordered on the bill. The question is on the third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows:

Ms. SCHAKOWSKY (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Illinois? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, this that I am proposing today would be the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended, and this amendment would offer a more targeted approach to improve FDA’s expanded access program that allows patients access to experimental drugs that can possibly save their lives, which is the goal of all of us. b1645 The FDA ensures that expanded access requests are safe, and it approves nearly 100 percent of all the requests that are made, and most in a matter of hours, if necessary. The righttotry legislation we are considering today presents a huge risk to patients and is much worse than the House bill we passed in March, as our ranking member explained. If this bill is so good, why are 104 patient groups—these are the groups that represent the sick and dying people— opposed? And PhRMA, the big pharmaceutical companies, are not supportive because this gives open license to snake oil salesmen. This bill exposes far more patients to serious risks through a dangerous and unnecessary pathway for experimental treatment. FDA Commissioner Gottlieb noted this legislation is not limited to patients with terminal illness anymore: ‘‘We are certainly going to be exposing patients with potentially less severe conditions to a risk.’’ It is troubling that, in some States, patients using an investigational drug can lose their hospice coverage and, in other States, that they can be denied home care. These are the very people who need this care. Why should we put more patients at risk when the current process does work? FDA already approves, as I said, nearly 100 percent of the requests for experimental therapies through the expanded access program. If a person is denied treatment, it is because the manufacturer will not provide it. It also isn’t going about giving the terminally ill hope. If that were true, then why would these 104 patient groups, including the American Cancer Society, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the Vietnam Veterans of America also oppose this bill? The main reason that this bill is being pushed is to remove FDA oversight of the safety and effectiveness of our drugs. It allows manufacturers to serve as the gatekeeper and protector of patients. It opens the door for bad actors to prey on people desperate to save their lives or the lives of their children. Imagine if someone like Martin Shkreli, the infamous pharmaceutical bad actor, promised a cure to save a child’s life provided that the parents pay whatever price he might charge, under this bill, FDA would play no role in determining if that drug were safe and effective. Bad actors do exist, and this Republican bill gives them the opportunity to prey on desperate people who are looking for any treatment that might help to save their lives. Unlike S. 204, this motion to recommit is not based on the false premise that the FDA approval is a barrier to investigational treatments; rather, it provides clarification of the liability and how FDA will utilize clinical outcomes. With this motion to recommit, the FDA would provide manufacturers guidance to clarify how FDA will consider clinical outcomes associated with treatments under expanded access when making a decision about whether or not the drug should be granted full approval. It also provides transparency as to how many patients are making expanded access requests and how often these requests are granted or denied by the FDA and manufacturers. It also offers to provide manufacturers or sponsors liability protection if they comply with the requirements of the expanded access program. I believe that these legislative fixes facilitate patient accessing of experimental treatments while ensuring critical FDA oversight to protect public health. In conclusion, patients already have the right to try. Rather than creating an unnecessary pathway that puts patients at risk by allowing the sale of 
snake oil, I would urge my colleagues to join the over 100 patient groups, organizations that care about their neighbors and their friends and people who have these diseases, in support of the expanded access program. These targeted improvements are one way to achieve that goal, so I urge my colleagues to support my motion to recommit and oppose the dangerous Republican proposal. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, while the motion to recommit may be well intentioned, it has a practical effect of killing this bill because the Senate has rejected House attempts to refine the Senate bill that was passed by unanimous consent last August. So if you want to provide that right to try for patients, this is the vehicle. Now, interestingly enough, the Food and Drug Administration Administrator, this morning, Dr. Gottlieb, put out a statement. He said that he is: ‘‘. . . ready to implement it in a way that achieves Congress’ intent to promote access and protect patients; and build on FDA’s longstanding commitment to these important goals.’’ Mr. Speaker, I urge people to vote against the motion to recommit and vote for the underlying bill. Let’s give patients that expanded access, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5minute votes on: Passage of S. 204, if ordered; The motion to suspend the rules on H.R. 5682; and Passage of S. 2155. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 187, nays 231, not voting 9, as follows:

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 5515. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 905 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 5515. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. HARPER ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1743 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 5515) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2019 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, with Mr. HARPERin the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. S MITH) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to bring to the House floor H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. This measure was reported favorably out of our committee by a vote of 60–1, and if signed into law, this would be the 58th consecutive year in which a National Defense Authorization Act was signed into law. I want to begin by thanking the members of the House Armed Services Committee, because each of them has contributed to the work product that we bring before the House today. I particularly want to express my appreciation to the ranking member, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH), for not only his cooperative approach to matters of national security, but for all of the input, all of the good humor, all of the partnership that he brings into making this truly a bipartisan bill which we bring before the House today. I also want to thank the staff of the committee on both sides of the aisle for incredible hours, incredible work, not only in the last few weeks, but throughout this process as we have conducted our hearings, our briefings, and traveled, done all sorts of work that contributed to this bill. Mr. Chairman, I also want to especially thank the legislative counsel. We have had hundreds of amendments considered in committee. We have had hundreds of amendments which have been drafted for floor consideration. That is a lot of work on a very few individuals who have had to make sure it was in the appropriate legislative language. I especially want to thank legislative counsel working with our staffs for getting this measure ready for floor consideration. Mr. Chairman, the best way to summarize this bill is that it takes the next steps: the next steps to rebuilding our military, the next steps to reforming the Pentagon, the next steps towards strengthening our country’s national security. We are going to hear a lot more about the details in the moments and days to come. I just want to emphasize that no one bill can do everything that needs to be done on behalf of the men and women who serve our Nation, especially in repairing their equipment, in repairing their readiness, and in giving them the best equipment, support, and training our Nation can provide. No one bill can do all those things, but this bill takes important next steps building on what was done in the 2018 bill. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I just want to make this point: We live in a volatile and dangerous world. Our country has a number of tools at its disposal—diplomacy, economics and trade, soft power and influence, a variety of tools—but, in my view, the most important tool is our military strength. I believe our military strength enhances all of those other tools so that, when our military is strong, our diplomacy is more effective. When our military is strong, our economic tools and sanctions are more effective. When our military is strong, our soft power somehow becomes more persuasive. Just to take one example, there is a lot in the news these days, even today, about whether or not there will be some sort of a negotiated agreement with North Korea. I don’t know how that will come out. What I do know is a strong military improves our negotiating position, and a strong military helps make sure we can defend this country if negotiations do not bear fruit. What we are trying to advance in this bill, along with the appropriations bill, which will come, is to put the United States in a stronger position, hopefully, to get a negotiated result with Iran, North Korea, a variety of other situations around the world, but, above all, to defend this country and to defend our way of life, to defend the American people by way of supporting the men and women who risk their lives for us. That, bottom line, is what this bill tries to do. It is what all of these thousands of pages and hundreds of amendments are designed to do. With the bipartisan support of this House, I believe it will be successful. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to start off by agreeing with the chairman on the importance both of the bill, but also on the incredible work that we do in a bipartisan manner. I think the chairman has set the right tone for the committee. His leadership makes all the difference in the world in terms of making sure that we all understand that we are working together to produce a product that is enormously important to the national security of this country. Not that we don’t have our disagreements—we have many—but we do so in a respectful way, always with the goal of what is the best policy for our national defense. The chairman’s leadership has set the tone for that in a way that is helpful to all of us. All 62 members of the committee also contribute, and, of course, the staff. The staff has to look through all the amendments, all the issues, and make sure that we are aware of them, and they do a fabulous job. This is the one bill that we pass every year, and the work that our staff does is always outstanding and always puts us Members in a position to do the best we can on the bill. So I appreciate the staff, I appreciate the bipartisan spirit in the committee, and I look forward to having a 58th successful year in producing a National Defense Authorization Act because, first and foremost, it is incredibly important that we set national security policy for this country. As the chairman mentioned, we face an incredibly complex set of threat environments. We need policy to figure out what the best approach to that is. Most importantly, right now, after nearly 17 years of war, we have really worked the men and women who serve us in the armed services very, very hard, and there is a very real readiness problem within our military, as we have underfunded that to fund the shortterm needs as presented by the conflicts that we have gotten into. I think the most important thing about this bill is it really begins to pay that back. It begins to bring back up the readiness levels so that the men and women who serve us are prepared for the fights that we ask them to do. That, to me, is the most important point. We can have a very robust debate about how large the military budget should be, about what responsibilities we should take on, but wherever we come out on that debate, when we decide this is what we expect the military to do, it is incredibly important that we provide the funds and training to make sure that they can do it. Now, again, we can argue that they should do less, but in my mind, it is completely unacceptable to say: Well, we have got so many priorities, We don’t know how to do it. We are going to ask you to do all these things and then not have the men and women to get the training that they need to be ready for that fight. I believe this bill starts moving us in the right direction. It also honors the agreement that we made just a few short months ago for both FY ’18 and, now, FY ’19 in terms of what the defense and nondefense numbers should be in the appropriations process. So I appreciate that. There are several things; and as the chairman mentioned, in a bill of this size, of this magnitude, $717 billion, it would be a miracle if there were any one person who agreed with absolutely everything in the bill. I am sure there is not. But the one thing that I would point out that is most troubling to me is the endorsement of the nuclear posture review that was just put forward by the administration. I am very concerned, number one, that we are spending too much money on our nuclear weapons arsenal going forward and what impact will that have on those other needs that I mentioned just a minute ago. What impact will that have on readiness? What impact will it have on our ability to have the forces forward deployed enough to deter Russia, to deter North Korea, to deal with China’s rise in Asia? So I think we are overemphasizing nuclear weapons, number one, in terms of the amount of money that we are spending on them. But equally as troubling, this bill authorizes lowyield nuclear weapons for 
the first time in a very long time. It even authorizes a lowyield nuclear weapon for our submarines. I believe that that puts us down a dangerous course. We need to do more to make sure that we are deterring any possibility of nuclear war. There is a huge risk as Russia rises back up, with what North Korea is doing, now that we are not in the nuclear agreement with Iran, what they might be doing, that we avoid miscalculation and stumble into a nuclear war. Thinking that there is such a thing as a tactical nuclear weapon, a weapon small enough that it doesn’t really rise to the level of the other nuclear weapons, I think, is a mistake. And, yes, I know Russia is building them. So the question is: How do we deter Russia? Well, I think we deter Russia in a very straightforward way. We have over 4,000 nuclear warheads. We have more than enough nuclear firepower to present a credible deterrent to what they are doing. We don’t have to say: Well, if you use a small nuclear weapon, we won’t want to use a bigger one in response. We want to say that our deterrence is: If you cross the red line of all red lines and use a nuclear weapon, we will respond overwhelmingly. We want to make sure it never happens. So I think building lowyield tactical nuclear weapons is a mistake. I also think it is incredibly important that we increase the dialogue between our country and Russia and China and North Korea, nuclear armed powers, to make sure that there is not a miscalculation and we don’t stumble into a nuclear war. Overall, I think this is a good product. I look forward to the amendment debate and look forward to supporting the bill. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2019. I appreciate Chairman MACTHORNBERRY achieving a bipartisan success in the committee with 60 ‘‘yes’’ votes and only 1 ‘‘no’’ vote. This bill contains significant policy and funding initiatives to provide the military resources necessary to restore lost readiness for peace through strength. The bill authorizes additional funding for equipment and weapons systems maintenance, spare parts, and training—all sorely needed to begin to reverse years of minimal funding and military readiness accounts. In addition, the bill includes several provisions aimed at improving the readiness and operation of naval surface forces in response to the tragic collisions suffered last year with the loss of 17 sailors of the Fitzgerald and the McCain. We also addressed aviation readiness concerns by increasing flying hours, funding for spare parts, and depot level repair capacity. With military end strength at a premium for operational units, Federal civilians are an everincreasingly important component of military readiness. This bill contains several measures meant to improve the civilian workforce management with a special emphasis on faster hiring. There is a provision that provides the Secretary of Defense hiring authority for many critical readiness skills until 2025, as well as the ability to hire new college graduates. Also included are several additional authorities to provide commanders innovative ways to solve installation infrastructure problems, including a measure that will speed execution of force protection projects. In conclusion, I want to thank Chairman MACTHORNBERRY and Ranking Member ADAM SMITH and the subcommittee’s distinguished ranking member, the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. BORDALLO ), and her staff for their contributions to this bill and support in the process. Of course, we were joined by an active and informed and dedicated group of subcommittee members with professional staff members. Their recommendations and priorities are clearly reflected in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this worthy bill. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by thanking Chairman THORNBERRY , Ranking Member SMITH, and Chairwoman ELISE STEFANIK , the chair of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, on which I am proud to serve as ranking member. I thank them all for their contributions to this bill that is before us today. Each year, our committee’s legislation addresses issues vital to the defense of our Nation, and their leadership was key in crafting this bill. I would also like to thank the ETC staff for their work on this bill, particularly, Lindsay Kavanaugh, Pete Villano, Jamie Jackson, Eric Snelgrove, Katie Sutton, Mark Pepple, and Nevada Schadler, as well as my personal staff, Kathryn MitchellThomas, and my two fellows, Brian Mandock and David Wagner. b1800 Mr. Chairman, this bill contains many critical provisions that will enable and enhance our national security. We added $1 billion beyond the President’s request for the Virginiaclass and Columbiaclass submarines, ensuring continued naval and strategic superiority beneath the seas. We also incorporated my provision to require the Department to include energy and climate resiliency efforts as a factor for consideration in major military installation master plans so that we can be better prepared to face climate change headon. The ETC portion of the bill ensures that we are also ready for future threats by strengthening cyber operations and increasing preparedness for countering weapons of mass destruction. It also bolsters capability at the pointy tip of the spear, especially when it comes to supporting our Special Operations Forces, who execute our Nation’s most difficult missions. We bolster this capability by embracing risk, enhancing innovation, and improving oversight. To ensure we maintain strategic overmatch with nearpeer adversaries, we invest heavily in research and development, with a specific focus on transitioning critical capabilities to the warfighter. For example, the bill includes $40 million in additional funding for electromagnetic railgun programs as well as $10 million to grow future cyber warriors through the DOD Cyber Scholarship Program. The bill guides the Department as we confront new threats across the globe by expanding upon previous initiatives—for instance, encouraging the use of initiatives modeled on the successful Hack the Pentagon program to update cyber vulnerability and mitigation assessments of Department facilities—and by exploring ways to safeguard the integrity of increasingly globalized supply chains that support critical technologies. As we look to protect our country from threats beyond the next ridge line, it is essential these science and technology initiatives remain prioritized. We will not defeat next generation threats resting on the success of our past. In closing, Mr. Chairman, I again thank and congratulate Chairwoman STEFANIK and all of the members of the subcommittee for their efforts as well as the members of the House Armed Services Committee for their dedication to national security. Again, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their outstanding leadership of the committee. I look forward to voting in favor of this bill. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER ), the chair of the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces. Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. I thank Chairman THORNBERRY and all of the members of the committee and certainly the group known as the 
defense hawks in this body, who fought so diligently on increasing the top line so that this number will make a difference and change the direction of our national security. I also thank our subcommittee ranking member, Ms. NIKITSONGAS , for her support and contribution to this bill. The bipartisan partnership she and her staff demonstrated in helping to craft this bill is much appreciated. NIKIhas also served with me for the last 7 years as the cochair of the Military Sexual Assault and Prevention Caucus. Although this will be her last National Defense Authorization Act, her work on the subcommittee and the caucus on sexual assault prevention will be a strong legacy. Within the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Force’s jurisdiction, this bill recommends authorization of over $97 billion in needed modernization funding that is necessary for our comparative and competitive advantage against strategic peer competitors. The bill again recognizes the importance of fifthgeneration strike fighter capability and supports the President’s budget request for 77 Joint Strike Fighters. This bill also authorizes the Department to procure additional F–35 aircraft if funds become available through cost savings and program efficiencies. I also want to take this opportunity to highlight the many foreign partners that compromise the F–35 program, which often gets overlooked by many. These foreign partnerships strengthen our ability to better operate with our allies in future conflicts. The bill includes several oversight provisions to facilitate mitigation efforts for physiological episodes occurring in military aircraft, to include requiring the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Air Force to certify that any new aircraft procured will have the most current technological advancements available to mitigate future physiological episodes. However, much work remains to be done to improve overall aviation readiness and safety. Going forward, our subcommittee will conduct a more detailed review of the investigative and governance processes related to aviation safety mishaps. The bill provides an additional $623 million for the JSTARS recap program. Based on our analysis resulting from extensive committee oversight activity, we have concluded that completely walking away from this program imposes an unacceptable level of risk to our warfighters. The bill recommends funding to modernize 1.5 armored brigade combat teams, which is absolutely necessary for our Army. For the seventh consecutive year, this bill addresses sexual assault in the military. The bill requires the Department to create a single office responsible for sexual offender registration; expands expedited transfer rights for victims of sexual assault; and further empowers the Defense Advisory Committee on Investigation, Prosecution, and Defense of Sexual Assault in the Armed Forces. This bill also protects our servicemembers and their families by closing a gap in the way the Department prescribes controlled substances. The bill requires the Department to share more information with State prescription drug monitoring programs to combat the opioid epidemic. Finally, I would like to recognize the role small businesses plays. The Small Business Innovation Research Program is highlighted and is bolstered in this. Mr. Chairman, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. BORDALLO ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Readiness. Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Chairman, first, I commend Chairman THORNBERRY , Ranking Member SMITH, and the committee staff, who have worked many, many long nights on the fiscal year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, a bill that displays a true example of bipartisan support. The Subcommittee on Readiness’ portion of the bill takes important steps to aid readiness recovery and improve our military’s readiness. The bill includes a number of provisions aimed at improving readiness of the surface Navy. This is a priority for the subcommittee, especially following the four incidents that occurred in the Pacific last year. While the Navy has taken steps to address issues identified in the Strategic Readiness Review and Comprehensive Review, additional steps are still necessary. The bill also includes reporting requirements to improve oversight of key readiness issues and assess readiness over time. We further address military installations and infrastructure by supporting resiliency, force protection, research and development, and improvements to our defense communities. The bill provides continuing support to our DOD civilian personnel, who are invaluable to military readiness. Their hard work does not go unnoticed. I especially thank Chairman THORN BERRY for following through on his commitment to me to include my provision to address the critical workforce shortages on Guam for our construction and healthcare industries. I also thank Ranking Member SMITH and the distinguished Subcommittee on Readiness chair, JOEWILSON , for all of their support. It is important that we address Guam’s workforce challenges to meet requirements of our international agreements and for enhancing our regional security. I look forward to continuing to work together to protect the full intent of this legislation. This bill also supports American ship repair jobs on Guam and the United States. The bill requires the Navy to treat vessels without a homeport as if they are homeported in the U.S. or Guam. This will ensure that scheduled maintenance of these ships is performed, as intended, at domestic American shipyards rather than in foreign countries. In addition, the bill prohibits the Navy from redeveloping Guam’s former ship repair facility for any purpose other than to support depotlevel maintenance, to include the mooring of a floating dry dock. The Navy should maintain depotlevel ship repair capability, especially in the Western Pacific. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as this process continues. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS), the distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY  and Ranking Member SMITH for their leadership in bringing this year’s NDAA to the floor with another overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 60–1 out of our committee. I also thank my friend, the gentleman from Tennessee, JIMCOOPER , the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, for working with me on some of the most difficult and complex issue sets that the HASC is responsible for. The issues we deal with—nuclear weapons, missile defense, and space— are difficult issue sets, but our strong, bipartisan working relationship ensures the best oversight and policy is provided for our warfighters. I thank the gentleman for helping all of us in this regard. I will focus on some of the key provisions under the jurisdiction of our subcommittee. First, nuclear modernization. This bill starts with a clearminded view of the threat posed by our strategic competitors Russia and China. The Strategic Forces section of the bill heeds the advice of General John Hyten to ‘‘go fast’’ and ensures that the U.S. will have a safe, secure, and modern nuclear deterrent. We accelerate funding for the LRSO and GBSD. We ensure full funding of a lowyield nuclear weapon option, as recommended by the Nuclear Posture Review, and we invest in our nuclear infrastructure. On missile defense, we place additional emphasis on spacebased sensing, boostphase intercept, and directedenergy efforts. We also preserve the Missile Defense Agency’s unique acquisition authorities, ensuring that the MDA can continue to quickly deliver capabilities to defend against the missile threats of today and tomorrow. Additionally, we accelerate funding for our own conventional prompt strike hypersonic weapon development. In the space domain, we continue to press the Department of Defense and 
the Air Force to fix the significant flaws in the organization and the management of the national security space enterprise. In our section of the bill, we direct the establishment of a new numbered Air Force to help better resource the space cadre. We establish a subunified command for space to help bring back the advocacy and priority of space within the COCOMs. And we continue pressing for space acquisition reform. Since last year, President Trump has endorsed the establishment of an independent space force. We remain committed to laying the foundation for the space force and to keeping the pressure on the rest of the executive branch to make progress in this regard. This is a strong defense bill that directly contributes to increasing the lethality and agility of our troops, and I urge the House to adopt this legislation and vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill. I want to begin by thanking the chair and ranking member of the full committee for their leadership in getting this bill to the floor and their commitment to regular order. The bill before us has already gone through several rounds of bipartisan input, from the thousands of individual requests from members of the House Committee on Armed Services to more than 420 amendments and more than 14 hours of debate at full committee markup, to more than 560 amendments submitted from the whole House for potential debate this week. I believe that this commitment to regular order is one of the main reasons, when we pass this bill this week, it will be the 58th year in a row that the House has passed a defense authorization. I also salute my friend and colleague, Chairman ROBWITTMAN , for his inclusive and bipartisan approach to his role on the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces. This year’s mark continues a multiyear, bipartisan effort by the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces to push the Navy to explore options to build up important capabilities. To that end, the bill before us recommends 3 additional battle force ships above the 10 ships in the President’s request. It also continues the National Security MultiMission Vessel program to ensure that future mariners at our State maritime academies have new, Americanmade training ships and follows on last year’s work on the subcommittee to recapitalize the Ready Reserve Force. This bill also builds on the work our subcommittee has done to ensure that the Navy and industry have the resources to expand our undersea force. The need and rationale for a larger force of 66 fast attack submarines was laid out in the Navy’s 2016 Force Structure Assessment, which was based on a thorough analysis of strategic challenges that are emerging in the maritime domain. This year, and for the second year in a row, the committee heard blunt and powerful testimony from both Admiral Harris of Pacific Command and General Scaparrotti of European Command that their requirements for submarines are not being met by our current force structure and warned that the expected decline in the undersea fleet carried unacceptable risk for the country. Last year, the Committee on Armed Services responded to these warnings by including authorization to procure additional submarines in our mark— authority that was eventually carried to the final NDAA and this year’s omnibus. Navy officials have recently testified before the subcommittee about their intention to use this new authority to provide options for additional submarines in the next 5year construction contract. Therefore, this year, the NDAA will make a downpayment on two additional submarines by providing authorization to fund the long lead materials necessary to take advantage of industrial base capacity in fiscal years 2022 and 2023. I also note that this shipbuilding plan was based on the 2016 Force Structure Assessment and is not tied to the Nuclear Posture Review. The shipbuilding plan is about platforms; the posture review is about armaments. Its call for lowyield nuclear weapons is a profound departure from our existing strategic defense, and I want to associate my remarks today with Mr. SMITH regarding that issue. b1815 This bill and the committee report also include several provisions which I sought in committee, including additional support for our Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, continued support for DOD impact aid, and ensuring that our troops receive imminent danger pay in a timely matter. Finally, I want to highlight the hard work of the staff for their tireless effort to put together the Seapower sections of this bill. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Connecticut. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chair, I thank Dave Sienicki, Bruce Johnson, Phil MacNaughton, and Megan Handal. None of this is possible without the countless hours they put in and the invaluable expertise they provide us. Mr. Chair, I again thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH for a productive and collaborative process that has led to, I believe, an excellent product here today. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN ), the distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chair, I am continually asked why I believe we need to increase our financial support for our national security. My credentials as a fiscal hawk could be perceived as contrary to my concerns on insufficient national security funding. I realize that our Federal Government has a variety of choices to either increase or diminish specific programs that, in the entirety, make a more efficient and effective government. However, when it comes to our national security, our choices are quickly limited. It is painfully obvious that our Nation’s military is at a crossroads. We can choose to retreat from the world and allow other nations to dictate the circumstances of our fiscal health, or we can choose to lead from the front and shape the affairs of our national security. I choose the latter. I choose a military that can provide for our domestic security and is capable of protecting our national interests abroad. Our force structure is rapidly diminishing. The capability and capacity that were provided during the Reagan military buildup era are quickly coming to an end. We have 11 aircraft carriers but are currently on track to reduce to 9 aircraft carriers in the next 30 years. Our attack submarine force structure will be reduced by 20 percent in the next 10 years. Our Air Force is the oldest, smallest, and least ready force in its history. The axiom of ‘‘quantity has a quality all of its own’’ will be sorely tested. Distressingly, our military readiness continues to atrophy. We lost 17 sailors in 2 ship collisions last year. We lost 25 airmen in 2 C–130 transport incidents. We continue to see the impacts of the lack of readiness attention. As we review the reduction of our force structure along with increased accident rates over the last year, it is clear that we need to address both current readiness and future readiness concerns in this bill. Mr. Chairman, I think our committee does a good job of prioritizing current and future readiness and efficiently acquiring required ships and aircraft. I am particularly pleased that H.R. 5515 authorizes 13 ships, which includes the original 10 ships in the fiscal year 2019 budget request as well as an additional 3 battle force ships, including 1 Fordclass aircraft carrier and 2 additional LCS. The bill authorizes advanced procurement for two additional Virginiaclass submarines and authorized multiyear procurement for the Marine Corps’ next amphibious ship class, LPD Flight II. It also continues the critical research and development into the B–21 Raider 
program and Columbiaclass ballistic missile submarine. These investments continue strategic priorities that will serve to address our Nation’s future readiness. Mr. Chair, in closing, I want to recognize my ranking member, Mr. JOE COURTNEY , for his continued advocacy and bipartisan approach to rebuild our Navy. He has been an extraordinary proponent for an increased Navy presence, particularly in the undersea community. His insight has been instrumental in shaping the subcommittee mark. I also want to thank Chairman THORNBERRY for his continued efforts and effective leadership as he navigates the twists and turns of the budget process and appropriations alignment. Our national security would be significantly diminished without his exemplary efforts. I also want to thank Ranking Member SMITH for his continued collaboration and cooperation in this bipartisan approach to make sure that we produce the best bill possible. I also would like to thank the staff for their extraordinary efforts, and I encourage my colleagues to support the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. TSONGAS ), our ranking member on the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chair, I thank Ranking Member SMITH for yielding. Earlier this month, the Armed Services Committee advanced the fiscal year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act to the House floor with broad, bipartisan support. I thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH for their work in developing this year’s bill. I have greatly appreciated the bipartisan tradition that annually allows us to come together to best protect our country and those who serve on our behalf. The Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee has embodied that spirit of bipartisanship, and I would like to thank my friend and colleague Congressman MIKETURNER for all the work we have done together over the past several years. I am especially pleased that the bill under consideration today includes proposals related to better understanding and reducing physiological episodes in Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force aircraft. I believe it is important to keep calling on DOD to solve this problem across multiple aircraft, wherever it occurs. The bill also appropriately directs the Air Force to continue the JSTARS recap program while the service works to develop a nextgeneration JSTARS in order to ensure this critical capability remains available to maximum effect to our servicemembers. The proposal makes important investments in research and development aimed at using advanced materials to increase ballistic protection and reduce the weight of the personal protective equipment we issue to those we send into harm’s way. With these provisions in mind, I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to see that we provide our men and women in uniform with the resources they need to carry out their mission. Finally, I would like to thank all the members of the subcommittee and the professional staff members for all of their dedicated work to help produce this mark. Mr. Chair, I urge passage of this bill. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. COFFMAN ), the distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel. Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. The bill contains a variety of significant policy funding initiatives that continue our commitment to maintaining military personnel and family readiness and addresses issues important to our men and women in uniform. The provisions contained in this bill provide our warfighters, retirees, and their families with pay and benefits necessary to sustain them in today’s highly stressed force. To that end, this bill increases end strength across the services and Reserve components, allowing the military services to increase mission readiness while reducing strain on servicemembers and their families. It extends pay and bonuses to servicemembers in highdemand fields, providing the military services with the necessary tools to attract and retain critical talent. It improves the Transition Assistance Program to ensure that servicemembers who are leaving the military receive training and resources tailored to their postmilitary career plans. And it requires a comprehensive review of wounded warrior care and mental healthcare services, ensuring the highest possible quality of care to those who have sacrificed for our Nation. The bill also continues to provide oversight of critical issues including additional protections for victims of sexual assault, improvements to the Department of Defense’s process for reporting crimes to the FBI database, and the establishment of a Department of Defense prescription drug monitoring program to share information with State drug monitoring programs. Mr. Chair, in conclusion, I want to thank my colleagues on the Military Personnel Subcommittee, Ranking Member JACKIE SPEIER , and the rest of the members of the subcommittee for their contributions to the mark and support in this process. Their recommendations are clearly reflected in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN ), a member of the Armed Services Committee and a veteran of our military. I appreciate his service on the committee. Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair, I want to first thank Chairman THORN BERRY and Ranking Member S MITH for bringing a solid, bipartisan defense authorization bill to the floor. As we consider one of the largest defense authorizations since World War II, we must demand responsible leadership from both the Pentagon and the Commander in Chief. Responsible leadership starts with fiscal responsibility. A larger budget doesn’t guarantee a more capable force. We must spend our money wisely. Instead of spending money on parades and walls or cutting civilian jobs that support our worldwide mission, we should focus on modernization, warfighter readiness, and our technological edge. Responsible leadership, beginning with President Trump, must keep faith with those who serve and treat them fairly and justly. We are providing our troops with the largest pay raise in nearly a decade, but we must also honor the service of every American: the transgender soldier overseas, the Dreamer ready to defend the only country they know, the HBCU student aspiring to a national security career. And every member should be able to serve free from sexual harassment and assault. Responsible leadership requires our national security leadership team to be responsive to evolving challenges and make strategic choices. Our adversaries are attempting to shape the future. Russia is meddling in democratic elections worldwide and disregarding international borders and treaties. We cannot ignore this. Our competitors are deploying every tool—military, economic, information, and diplomatic—and so must the United States. While China has outlined strategies through 2050 to become the dominant global power, we must not hamstring our Defense Department or limit the diplomatic and development efforts. This bill gives our armed services the tools and resources they need to defend our homeland, promote our values abroad, and respond to security threats around the world. Congress is doing its part, and the administration must do its, to move from the vagaries of a Commander in Chief to responsible leadership within a strategic framework. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ), the distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. I thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH for bringing this important bill to the floor. For years, the House Armed Services Committee has been fighting relentlessly to increase defense spending to ensure our troops have the capabilities, capacity, and training needed to face the growing threats of today. Thanks to the leadership of Chairman THORNBERRY , we were able to pass a 2year budget agreement earlier this year that paved the way for the committee to draft a defense authorization bill that will continue our military’s road to recovery. As chairwoman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, I am proud of the provisions included in this bill that relate to the subcommittee’s work, and I appreciate Ranking Member SETH MOULTON ’s support of these efforts, including several important provisions to combat efforts by our adversaries to gain unauthorized access to highly sensitive military technology. We must face the reality that countries like China are using a wholeof nation approach to steal and exploit highly sensitive U.S. military information. This bill adds an extra layer of vetting for dual nationals who wish to work at the DOD or the National Nuclear Security Administration. The subcommittee is also conducting oversight on the transition of DOD security clearances from the Office of Personnel Management to the Department of Defense. The bill seeks to tackle security clearance reciprocity issues by directing DOD to ensure seamless transition of investigations between authorized investigative agencies. This bill is also good news for the warfighter. It fully funds continued development of the new B–21 bomber. Nuclear deterrence remains the foundation of national security for the United States and is fundamental to preserving international stability. The bomber fleet is the most flexible leg of the nuclear triad, and it is vital that we continue to invest in this new capability. As we invest in the B–21, we must also ensure that our current bomber fleet remains effective until the B–21 is operational. The NDAA supports responsible modernization programs for the current fleet, such as the B–2, to ensure we maintain our longrange strike capability. It also continues to address readiness and modernization needs by authorizing 24 additional F–18 Super Hornets, investing in A–10 modifications, and adding 4,000 troops to the Army’s end strength. These investments, along with many other important provisions, will ensure our Nation remains safe and secure. Mr. Chair, once again, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY for his leadership in advocating on behalf of our national defense. I am proud of this bipartisan bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage. b1830 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ), a member of the committee. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, my congratulations to the chairman of our committee, Mr. THORNBERRY , and the ranking member, Mr. SMITH, for helping us put together an extremely important bill that does many, many good things for our military and our national security. You have heard speakers before me talk about those issues ranging from the additional pay for our military personnel, both civil and enlisted. All that is good. However, I do want to raise an issue here, and that is, this bill also pushes even further and faster down the path towards a new nuclear arms race. I said before, we are well into the first quarter of it. Well, when this bill goes into law, we will be well into the second quarter, an extraordinarily expensive proposition, costing this country well over $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion over the next 20 years. It also puts us in a position where I believe we are not going to be more safe. Many of the weapons that are being developed—the bombs, the delivery systems—are designed not to be observed. So much of what we have learned over the years about how to keep ourselves and our enemies at bay on the mutually assured destruction track will not apply as we go into this. A couple of things immediately on my mind. A lowyield nuclear weapon, there is no such thing as ‘‘low.’’ It happens to be a whole lot, much larger than the bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima. So where are we going to go here? Does it make us safer to have a lowyield nuclear weapon on one of our submarines? Probably not, because now that submarine has become not a strategic but, rather, a tactical weapon and puts it in an entirely different class. Also, there is a lot of money being spent on the National Nuclear Security Administration, way over budget, $198 million—$115 million. It goes on and on. Is that a smart thing to spend $115 million for the mixed oxide facility? I think not. So there are questions that could be raised, and hopefully, as this bill progresses through the Congress, those questions will lead to a better resolution. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK ), the distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan bill that will help ensure our technological superiority over the next decade. As the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I am proud of our portion of the bill which energizes our science and technology enterprise, strengthens our cyber warfare capabilities, enables our Special Operations Forces around the globe, provides resources and authorities to counter terrorism and unconventional warfare threats, and advances programs and activities that counter the spread of weapons of mass destruction. I am especially pleased with the subcommittee’s work to review and understand our adversarial threats, most notably, from China and Russia. We have maintained our focus on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, directed energy, hypersonics, synthetic biology, and robotics. The bill before the House incorporates four broad subcommittee themes. First, the bill better organizes the DOD to oversee, accelerate, and integrate AI and machine learning across the defense enterprise by including H.R. 5365, a bill I introduced with subcommittee ranking member, JIMLANGEVIN . This will establish a national security commission on artificial intelligence to conduct a thorough review of the wide ranging military applications of this decisive technology. Second, we build upon previous NDAAs and advance prototyping and testing of directed energy weapons and hypersonic vehicles and accelerate these technologies by authorizing an additional $100 million. This bill also demonstrates our resolve to protect our servicemembers from the threat posed by our adversaries’ deliberate efforts to develop and field new technologies, ranging from unmanned aerial systems to quantum sciences. Third, the bill strengthens our whole of government cybersecurity posture by establishing a pilot program that improves coordination and partnering between the DOD and Homeland Security to prevent and respond to cyber attacks against our critical infrastructure. It also reinforces international partnerships in cyber warfare to counter aggressive adversaries, such as Russia, China, and North Korea, and it also includes support for our NATO partners to enhance cooperative cyber and information warfare capabilities. And finally, the bill authorizes U.S. Special Operations Command’s programs and activities, including ongoing efforts in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, and Eastern Europe. The bill will also strengthen congressional oversight of ongoing counterterrorism and sensitive activities and streamline DOD’s oversight of countering weapons of mass destruction. Before I conclude, I want to thank Chairman MACTHORNBERRY for his leadership, as well as my subcommittee ranking member JIMLANGEVIN of Rhode Island for his leadership. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is left on each side. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana). The gentleman from Washington has 10 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 6
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I don’t have any further speakers at this time. If the gentleman from Texas is prepared to close, then I am prepared to close as well. I yield myself the balance of the time. Again, I just want to emphasize the most important aspect of this bill is the bipartisan effort that we have done working together. There are literally thousands of provisions in this bill. All of them are important in their own way to helping make sure that we set the right policy and make sure that the Department of Defense can be as strong as is humanly possible. One thing I didn’t say in the opening remarks, that I do want to point out, I particularly want to thank Chairman THORNBERRY on his leadership on acquisition reform and reform in general—the idea of how can we make sure that every dollar we spend at the Pentagon is spent as wisely as possible. As we know that has not always been the case. I think we made a number of reforms, more in the previous two years’ bill than in this one, but this one continues on that. I think it put us on a path to having a more efficient and effective use use of dollars on the Pentagon side. We all look forward to that day, which is supposed to happen I believe this year, when we actually get the full audit from the Pentagon on where they spend their money. In these times of scarce resources, it is incredibly important we get the most out of what we spend. And the last little piece on that point, I do worry about the future from a fiscal standpoint. We are right now spending roughly 20 percent more money than we take in every year, and that is projected to go up. The debt to GDP ratio is over 100 percent and, again, is projected to only go up. We have got the deal for FY18 and FY19 which gives some degree of predictability for our military—and that is good—because the last, gosh, 8 years now, we have gone from CR to CR, couple of government shutdowns, a number of threatened government shutdowns, and a large amount of unpredictability which is a problem for the entire discretionary budget—not just for the Department of Defense but every other Department that is dependent upon the discretionary budget has lived with uncertainty. That makes our government less efficient and less effective. We need to lock in more predictability. Now, traditionally at this point, this is when everyone says that the Budget Control Act and the budget caps have got to go, and I agree with that. The problem is you can get rid of the budget caps and you can get rid of the Budget Control Act—and we certainly should. That was passed back in 2011. It wasn’t even passed for a good reason back then. But even if you get rid of those caps, it doesn’t make money magically appear. We still have the debt and the deficit that we are facing. We still have the crushing needs that we have, not just in the Department of Defense, but in infrastructure and research and education and a whole bunch of critical areas to the health and wellbeing of our country. Someone thought I was joking when someone talked about his ‘‘fiscal hawk credentials.’’ I am wondering if anyone has fiscal hawk credentials at this point when you look at the debt and deficit. We have got to get that in order. Now I don’t think we are going to balance the budget tomorrow. I don’t think we should. I think the impact on the economy will be devastating, but we have got to get on a glide path to a more fiscally sustainable situation or we are headed for trouble. I simply don’t believe that you can spend 20 percent more money than you take in forever and not have it be a problem. And everything you want to know about how big a problem this is is contained in three votes that we took over a couple month period. There are many, many Members of Congress who voted for the tax cut, which estimates say it is going to reduce our revenue by $2 trillion; for the spending agreement, which increased our spending by $500 billion; and then, a week later, they voted for a balanced budget amendment. To say that that is a math problem is the understatement of the year. It doesn’t add up. We all say we want to balance the budget. We don’t want to raise taxes. We don’t want to cut spending. That doesn’t work and a lot of different aspects of our government pay a price for that. But the Department of Defense is one of the biggest. As the largest portion of the discretionary budget, they pay the highest price when we don’t get ourselves on a fiscally responsible path, and national security is at least one of, if not the most important function that our government needs to provide. So I think FY18 and FY19, those are good deals. The building code for the future, we have got to get on a fiscally responsible path. But, again, within this bill—and you have heard a lot of it from our Members—there are a lot of good policies that I think are going to make a very positive difference in terms of making our Department of Defense work better and, most importantly, providing for the men and women who serve our country and their families. I thank the chairman. I thank the staff. I think, once again, we have done outstanding work. I hope that we can get through the amendment process, get this bill passed, and then go chat with the Senate about getting the bill finished. They are marking their bill up in committee this week, so I think we are on a good path to do that as well. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time. Mr. Chairman, I would just pick up on a couple of the points the ranking member made, largely in agreement with him. We do have fiscal challenges in this country, and that is even more reason that, together, we need to continue to work to see that the taxpayers get more value for the money that is spent by the Pentagon. That is part of the reason that we have put such an effort, again, on a bipartisan basis, on defense reform, on buying things and services smarter, so that we can get more value for the taxpayer, but also, so we can make decisions faster. With the world moving so quickly around us, we have to be able to be more agile, and our reform efforts are a part of that goal. But I do think Secretary Mattis has cut to the heart of the matter when he says, We can afford survival. Currently, defense is roughly 15 percent of the Federal budget, not much for all that it provides for the American people and for the country. Yes, the country can afford to survive. Lastly, Mr. Chairman, I just want to make the point that over the next 3 days we are going to consider many amendments. We are going to hear debate about some of them. We got a taste of that tonight with a difference, for example, on some of the policies in the nuclear posture review, and we will have to vote on some of those amendments. There will be people pro and con. Some Members, including me, may not have our position prevail on all of those amendments. But none of that should take away from the fact that there is far more in this bill upon which we agree than upon which we disagree. I think that is a very important message for friends and allies around the world to hear, for adversaries or potential adversaries around the world to hear, and, most importantly, for the men and women who have volunteered to risk their lives, to serve our Nation, to protect our freedoms, defend our country, they need to hear that there is far more in this bill upon which there is agreement on a bipartisan basis than any of the disagreements that we may discuss and, ultimately, vote on. The country has to be defended. I am very proud, on a bipartisan basis and a vote of 60–1, this bill has been reported favorably to the House floor, and I look forward to its consideration over the next 3 days. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD the following exchange of letters during consideration of H.R. 5515:

(b) ASSESSMENT .—The assessment described in this subsection is a written summary of the views of the Marine Corps with respect to the Small Arms Ammunition Configuration Study of the Army, including— (1) an explanation of how the study informs the future small arms modernization requirements of the Marine Corps; and (2) nearterm and longterm modernization strategies for the small arms weapon systems of the Marine Corps, including associated funding and schedule profiles. Subtitle C—Navy Programs 
SEC. 121. INCREASE IN NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL AIRCRAFT CARRIERS OF THE NAVY. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the following: (1) The aircraft carrier can fulfill the Navy’s core missions of forward presence, sea control, ensuring safe sea lanes, and power projection as well as providing flexibility and versatility to execute a wide range of additional missions. (2) Forward airpower is integral to the security and joint forces operations of the United States. Carriers play a central role in delivering forward airpower from sovereign territory of the United States in both permissive and nonpermissive environments. (3) Aircraft carriers provide our Nation the ability to rapidly and decisively respond to national threats, as well as conducting worldwide, onstation diplomacy and providing deterrence against threats to the United States allies, partners, and friends. (4) Since the end of the cold war, aircraft carrier deployments have increased while the aircraft carrier force structure has declined. (5) Considering the increased array of complex threats across the globe, the Navy aircraft carrier is operating at maximum capacity, increasing deployment lengths and decreasing maintenance periods in order to meet operational requirements. (6) To meet global peacetime and wartime requirements, the Navy has indicated a requirement to maintain two aircraft carriers deployed overseas and have three additional aircraft carriers capable of deploying within 90 days. However, the Navy has indicated that the existing aircraft carrier force structure cannot support these military requirements. (7) Despite the requirement to maintain an aircraft carrier strike group in both the United States Central Command and the United States Pacific Command, the Navy has been unable to generate sufficient capacity to support combatant commanders and has developed significant carrier gaps in these critical areas. (8) Because of the continuing use of a diminished aircraft carrier force structure, extensive maintenance availabilities result which typically exceed program costs and increase time in shipyards. These expansive maintenance availabilities exacerbate existing carrier gaps. (9) Developing an alternative design to the Fordclass aircraft carrier is not cost beneficial. A smaller design is projected to incur significant design and engineering cost while significantly reducing magazine size, carrier air wing size, sortie rate, and onstation effectiveness, among other vital factors, as compared to the Fordclass. Furthermore, a new design will delay the introduction of future aircraft carriers, exacerbating existing carrier gaps and threatening the national security of the United States. (10) The 2016 Navy Force Structure Assessment states ‘‘A minimum of 12 aircraft carriers are required to meet the increased warfighting response requirements of the Defense Planning Guidance Defeat/Deny force sizing direction.’’. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the United States should expedite delivery of 12 aircraft carriers; and (2) an aircraft carrier should be authorized every three years. (c) INCREASE IN NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL  AIRCRAFT CARRIERS OF THE NAVY.— (1) INCREASE .—Section 5062(b) of title 10, United States Code, is amended by striking ‘‘11 operational aircraft carriers’’ and inserting ‘‘12 operational aircraft carriers’’. (2) EFFECTIVE DATE .—The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall take effect on September 30, 2022.

SEC. 147. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING KC–46 AERIAL REFUELING TANKERS. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the following findings: (1) Aerial refueling tankers provide an essential foundation for our nation’s ability to project power and deter adversaries, enabling the global reach of our joint force. (2) 87 percent of the legacy aerial refueling fleet is comprised of KC–135 aircraft with an average age of 56 years. (3) The Commander of United States Transportation Command has identified the aerial refueling fleet as the ‘‘most stressed of our air mobility forces’’ and stated that ‘‘delaying KC–46 production puts the Joint Force’s ability to effectively execute war plans at risk’’. (4) As directed by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Public Law 115–91), the Air Force is undertaking an updated mobility capability and requirements study that will reflect guidance articulated in the 2018 National Defense Strategy and reassess the current tanker requirement of 479 aircraft. (5) The fixedprice contract for KC–46A calls for 179 aircraft to be delivered by 2028. (6) The KC–46 is a multirole platform that will bring enhanced capabilities to both the aerial refueling and strategic airlift missions. The aircraft provides the ability to refuel joint and coalition aircraft by both boom and drogue systems in the same sortie; improved cargo, passenger and aeromedical evacuation capabilities; and enhanced survivability with multiple layers of protection enabling it to operate safely in a broader range of threat environments than legacy tankers. (7) The Government Accountability Office has stated: ‘‘The KC–46 program’s total acquisition cost estimate remained stable over the past year at $44,400,000,000, which is about $7,300,000,000 less than the original estimate.’’ (8) The Commander of Air Mobility Command has stated that the KC–46 ‘‘will bring tremendous capability to our joint warfighter’’. (9) The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition has stated: ‘‘Stability of requirements and funding are the keys to KC–46 program success and will enable the Air Force to deliver this new tanker ready for employment on day one.’’ (10) The Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition has identified the KC–46 as the Air Force’s second highest combat aviation acquisition priority ‘‘for the role that it plays in being able to power project’’. (11) With the support of Congress, the Air Force has executed three low rate initial production contracts for a total of 34 aircraft. In fiscal year 2018, Congress provided funding for a fourth production lot totaling 18 aircraft. (12) A steady production rate of 1.3 aircraft per month has been maintained through independent investment by industry in order to expedite deliveries to the Air Force upon completion of developmental testing and certification. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the Air Force and industry should dedicate the resources and manpower necessary to ensure the first KC–46 is delivered in fiscal year 2018; (2) the Air Force should maximize efficiency in the test and certification process to ensure that— (A) test points are not redundant; (B) test plans are approved expeditiously; (C) receiver aircraft are available to support test flights; and (D) Air Force inputs necessary for Federal Aviation Administration and military airworthiness certifications are expedited; and (3) the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition and the Director of the Defense Contract Management Agency should develop and implement a plan enabling the Air Force to accept and field KC–46 aircraft at a rate higher than three aircraft per month after the delivery of the first aircraft.

(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the following findings: (1) In 2017, there were three collisions and one grounding involving United States Navy ships in the Western Pacific. The two most recent mishaps involved separate incidents of a Japanbased United States Navy destroyer colliding with a commercial merchant vessel, resulting in the combined loss of 17 sailors. (2) The causal factors in these four mishaps are linked directly to a failure to take sufficient action in accordance with the rules of good seamanship. (3) Because risks are high in the maritime environment, there are widely accepted standards for safe seamanship and navigation. In the United States, the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (hereinafter in this section referred to as the ‘‘STCW’’) for Seafarers, standardizes the skills and foundational knowledge a maritime professional must have in seamanship and navigation. (4) Section 568 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114328; 130 Stat. 2139) endorsed the STCW process and required the Secretary of Defense to maximize the extent to which Armed Forces service, training, and qualifications are creditable toward meeting merchant mariner licenses and certifications. (5) The Surface Warfare Officer Course Curriculum is being modified to include ten individual Go/No Go Mariner Assessments/ Competency Check Milestones to ensure standardization and quality of the surface warfare community. (6) The MilitarytoMariner Transition report of September 2017 notes the Army maintains an extensive STCW qualifications program and that a similar Navy program does not exist. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the Secretary of the Navy should establish a comprehensive individual proficiency assessment process and include such an assessment prior to all operational surface warfare officer tour assignments; and (2) the Secretary of the Navy should significantly expand the STCW qualifications process to improve seamanship and navigation individual skills training for surface warfare candidates, surface warfare officers, quartermasters and operations specialists to include an increased set of courses that directly correspond to STCW standards. (c) REPORT .—Not later than March 1, 2019, the Secretary of the Navy shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report that includes each of the following: (1) A detailed description of the surface warfare officer assessments process. (2) A list of programs that have been approved for credit toward merchant mariner credentials. (3) A complete gap analysis of the existing surface warfare training curriculum and STCW. (4) A complete gap analysis of the existing surface warfare training curriculum and the 3rd mate unlimited licensing requirement.

(b) IMPLEMENTATION .—Such plan shall be implemented not later than March 1, 2020. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the following findings: (1) In its 2011 ‘‘Annual Report to Congress on Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China’’, the Department of Defense stated that, ‘‘China’s defense industry has benefitted from integration with a rapidly expanding civilian economy and science and technology sector, particularly elements that have access to foreign technology. Progress within individual defense sectors appears linked to the relative integration of each, through China’s civilian economy, into the global production and R&D chain . . . Information technology companies in particular, including Huawei, Datang, and Zhongxing, maintain close ties to the PLA.’’. (2) In a 2011 report titled ‘‘The National Security Implications of Investments and Products from the People’s Republic of China in the Telecommunications Sector’’, the United States China Commission stated that ‘‘[n]ational security concerns have accompanied the dramatic growth of China’s telecom sector. . . . Additionally, large Chinese companies—particularly those ‘national champions’ prominent in China’s ‘going out’ strategy of overseas expansion—are directly subject to direction by the Chinese Communist Party, to include support for PRC state policies and goals.’’. (3) The Commission further stated in its report that ‘‘[f]rom this point of view, the clear economic benefits of foreign investment in the U.S. must be weighed against the potential security concerns related to infrastructure components coming under the control of foreign entities. This seems particularly applicable in the telecommunications industry, as Chinese companies continue systematically to acquire significant holdings in prominent global and U.S. telecommunications and information technology companies.’’. (4) In its 2011 Annual Report to Congress, the United States China Commission stated that ‘‘[t]he extent of the state’s control of the Chinese economy is difficult to quantify . . . There is also a category of companies that, though claiming to be private, are subject to state influence. Such companies are often in new markets with no established SOE leaders and enjoy favorable government policies that support their development while posing obstacles to foreign competition. Examples include Chinese telecoms giant Huawei and such automotive companies as battery maker BYD and vehicle manufacturers Geely and Chery.’’. (5) General Michael Hayden, who served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and Director of the National Security Agency, stated in July 2013 that Huawei had ‘‘shared with the Chinese state intimate and extensive knowledge of foreign telecommunications systems it is involved with.’’. (6) The Federal Bureau of Investigation, in a February 2015 Counterintelligence Strategy Partnership Intelligence Note stated that, ‘‘[w]ith the expanded use of Huawei Technologies Inc. equipment and services in U.S. telecommunications service provider networks, the Chinese Government’s potential access to U.S. business communications is dramatically increasing. Chinese Governmentsupported telecommunications equipment on U.S. networks may be exploited through Chinese cyber activity, with China’s intelligence services operating as an advanced persistent threat to U.S. networks.’’. (7) The Federal Bureau of Investigation further stated in its February 2015 counterintelligence note that, ‘‘China makes no secret that its cyber warfare strategy is predicated on controlling global communications network infrastructure.’’. (8) At a hearing before the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives on September 30, 2015, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work, responding to a question about the use of Huawei telecommunications equipment, stated, ‘‘In the Office of the Secretary of Defense, absolutely not. And I know of no other—I don’t believe we operate in the Pentagon, any [Huawei] systems in the Pentagon.’’. (9) At such hearing, the Commander of the United States Cyber Command, Admiral Mike Rogers, responding to a question about why such Huawei telecommunications equipment is not used, stated, ‘‘as we look at supply chain and we look at potential vulnerabilities within the system, that it is a risk we felt was unacceptable.’’. (10) In March 2017, ZTE Corporation pled guilty to conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by illegally shipping United Statesorigin items to Iran, paying the United States Government a penalty of $892,360,064 dollars for activity between January 2010 and January 2016. (11) The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control issued a subpoena to Huawei as part of a Federal investigation of alleged violations of trade restrictions on Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. (12) In the bipartisan Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives ‘‘Investigative Report on the United States National Security Issues Posed by Chinese Telecommunication Companies Huawei and ZTE’’ released in 2012, it was recommended that ‘‘U.S. government systems, particularly sensitive systems, should not include Huawei or ZTE equipment, including in component parts. Similarly, government contractors—particularly those working on contracts for sensitive U.S. programs—should exclude ZTE or Huawei equipment in their systems.’’. (13) Christopher Wray, who serves as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, stated in February 2018 during a hearing of the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate that he was ‘‘deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don’t share our values to gain positions of power inside our telecommunications networks. That provides the capacity to exert pressure or control over our telecommunications infrastructure. It provides the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information. And it provides the capacity to conduct undetected espionage.’’ Admiral Mike Rogers, who served as Director of the National Security Agency, agreed with Director Wray’s characterization, and added that Government programs need ‘‘to look long and hard at companies like this’’. (14) Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency General Robert Ashley, Director of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency Robert Cardillo, Director of the National Security Agency Admiral Michael Rogers, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Michael Pompeo all indicated by show of hands in February 2018 at a hearing of the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate that they would not ‘‘use products or services from Huawei or ZTE’’. (15) General Paul Nakasone, who served as the Commanding General of United States Army Cyber Command, stated during his 
confirmation hearing to be National Security Agency director in March 2018 before the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate that he ‘‘would not’’ use any Huawei, China Unicom, or China Telecom products nor would he recommend his family do so. (b) PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN TELECOMMUNI CATIONS SERVICES OR EQUIPMENT .— (1) PROHIBITION ON AGENCY USE OR PROCURE MENT .—Except as provided in paragraph (3), beginning not later than January 1, 2021, the head of an agency may not procure or obtain, may not extend or renew a contract to procure or obtain, and may not enter into a contract (or extend or renew a contract) with an entity that uses any equipment, system, or service that uses covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system.

(4) COVERED COMPONENTS .—With respect to a covered component of an entity for which such entity reasonably believes will not need to be replaced during the 5year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, such entity shall provide a written assurance to the head of the agency for which such covered component is in use that such entity shall replace such covered component, at the end of such covered component’s reasonable lifecycle, with a comparable component that is manufactured by a person other than Huawei Technologies Company or ZTE Corporation (or any subsidiary, successor entity, or affiliate of such entities). (5) DEFINITIONS .—In this section: (A) The term ‘‘appropriate congressional committees’’ means the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate.

It is the sense of Congress that— (1) retaining attack rotary wing aviation assets in the Army National Guard continues to be important; (2) the National Guard should retain organic attack aviation training capacity; and (3) the Western and Eastern Army Aviation Training Sites have proven invaluable in maintaining Army National Guard aviation readiness. 
SEC. 1082. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE LEGACY, CONTRIBUTIONS, AND SACRIFICES OF AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVES IN THE ARMED FORCES. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the following: (1) The United States celebrates Native American History Month each November to recognize and honor the history and achievements of Native Americans. (2) American Indian and Alaska Natives serve in all branches of the Armed Forces, attend all service academies, and defend our country with valiance, pride, and honor. (3) More than 30,000 active duty, reserve, and National Guard members of the Armed Forces identify as Native American. (4) American Indian and Alaska Natives have served and continue to serve in the highest proportions to population than any other ethnic group. (5) American Indian and Alaska Natives have served in every war, from the Revolutionary War to current overseas conflicts. (6) Native American veterans are Congressional Medal of Honor, Congressional Gold and Silver Medals, Purple Heart, and Bronze Star Medal recipients. (7) American Indian and Alaska Native women serve in Armed Forces in higher proportions than any other ethnic group. (8) Native American Code Talkers and their languages proved an invaluable asset during World Wars I and II. (9) Ira Hayes, Akimel O’odham (Pima) helped to raise the American flag on Iwo Jima; (10) Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow, Apsa ´alooke (Crow), served in WWII and became a war chief. (11) Numerous present and past military aircraft, helicopters, and munitions programs bear the names of Native American tribes and tribal leaders to honor their legacy of martial prowess, including the Apache, Kiowa, Black Hawk, Lakota, Chinook, Huron, Iroquois, Comanche, Cayuse, Chickasaw, Ute, Gray Eagle, Mescalero, Tomahawk, and more.

(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the following: (1) More than 730,000 radio amateurs in the United States are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission in the amateur radio services. (2) Amateur radio, at no cost to taxpayers, provides a fertile ground for technical self training in modern telecommunications, electronics technology, and emergency communications techniques and protocols. (3) There is a strong Federal interest in the effective performance of amateur stations established at the residences of licensees. Such stations have been shown to be frequently and increasingly precluded by unreasonable private land use restrictions, including restrictive covenants. (4) Federal Communications Commission regulations have for three decades prohibited the application to stations in the amateur 
service of State and local regulations that preclude or fail to reasonably accommodate amateur service communications, or that do not constitute the minimum practicable regulation to accomplish a legitimate State or local purpose. Commission policy has been and is to require States and localities to permit erection of a station antenna structure at heights and dimensions sufficient to accommodate amateur service communications. (5) The Commission has sought guidance and direction from Congress with respect to the application of the Commission’s limited preemption policy regarding amateur service communications to private land use restrictions, including restrictive covenants. (6) There are aesthetic and common property considerations that are uniquely applicable to private land use regulations and the community associations obligated to enforce covenants, conditions, and restrictions in deedrestricted communities. These considerations are dissimilar to those applicable to State law and local ordinances regulating the same residential amateur radio facilities. (7) In recognition of these considerations, a separate Federal policy than exists at section 97.15(b) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, is warranted concerning amateur service communications in deedrestricted communities. (8) Community associations should fairly administer private land use regulations in the interest of their communities, while nevertheless permitting the installation and maintenance of effective outdoor amateur radio antennas. There exist antenna designs and installations that can be consistent with the aesthetics and physical characteristics of land and structures in community associations while accommodating communications in the amateur radio services. (b) APPLICATION OF PRIVATE LANDUSERESTRICTIONS TO AMATEUR STATIONS .— (1) AMENDMENT OF FCC RULES .—Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications Commission shall amend section 97.15 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, by adding a new paragraph that prohibits the application to amateur stations of any private land use restriction, including a restrictive covenant, that— (A) on its face or as applied, precludes communications in an amateur radio service; (B) fails to permit a licensee in an amateur radio service to install and maintain an effective outdoor antenna on property under the exclusive use or control of the licensee; or (C) does not constitute the minimum practicable restriction on such communications to accomplish the lawful purposes of a community association seeking to enforce such restriction. (2) ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS .—In amending its rules as required by subsection (a), the Commission shall— (A) require any licensee in an amateur radio service to notify and obtain prior approval from a community association concerning installation of an outdoor antenna; (B) permit a community association to prohibit installation of any antenna or antenna support structure by a licensee in an amateur radio service on common property not under the exclusive use or control of the licensee; and (C) subject to the standards specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a), permit a community association to establish reasonable written rules concerning height, location, size, and aesthetic impact of, and installation requirements for, outdoor antennas and support structures for the purpose of conducting communications in the amateur radio services. (c) AFFIRMATION OF LIMITED PREEMPTION OF  STATE AND LOCAL LAND USEREGULATION .— The Federal Communications Commission may not change section 97.15(b) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, which shall remain applicable to State and local land use regulation of amateur service communications. (d) DEFINITIONS .—In this section: (1) The term ‘‘community association’’ means any nonprofit mandatory membership organization composed of owners of real estate described in a declaration of covenants or created pursuant to a covenant or other applicable law with respect to which a person, by virtue of the person’s ownership of or interest in a unit or parcel, is obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes, insurance premiums, maintenance, improvement, services, or other expenses related to common elements, other units, or any other real estate other than the unit or parcel described in the declaration. (2) The terms ‘‘amateur radio services’’, ‘‘amateur service’’, and ‘‘amateur station’’ have the meanings given such terms in section 97.3 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations. 
SEC. 1084. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE INTERNATIONAL BORDERS OF THE UNITED STATES. 
It is the sense of Congress that— (1) gaining and maintaining situational awareness and operational control of the international borders of the United States is critical to national security; (2) the United States Government must devote adequate resources to securing the border, both at, and between, ports of entry, and the agency tasked with that mission, the Department of Homeland Security, should be adequately resourced to conduct such mission; and (3) the Department of Defense must ensure that when it acts in support of that mission, such as when mobilized by the President to conduct homeland defense activities, or when military facilities are adjacent to an international border of the United States, it has adequate resources, capabilities, and authorities to carry out the mission while maintaining combat readiness.

(3) Article 1 of the Chemical Weapons Convention requires all signatories to ‘‘never under any circumstances...use chemical weapons’’. 
(4) Russia’s stock of chemical weapons has been implicated in the assassination or injuries of the following individuals: (A) Sergei Skripal, Yulia Skripal, and Wiltshire Police Detective Sergeant Nicholas Bailey, poisoned using the nerve agent ‘‘novichok’’ in Salisbury, England, in March 2018.

(5) Russia has also demonstrated its disregard for the obligations imposed by the Chemical Weapons Convention by— (A) continuing to provide military and diplomatic support for Syrian President Bashar alAssad, who has used chemical weapons including chlorine gas and sarin against Syrian citizens; (B) actively working to hinder the efforts of inspectors of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in Syria; and (C) consistently using its veto power at the United Nations Security Council to prevent effective international action against Assad for such activities.

In fact, due to Russia’s March 4, 2018, use of a military grade nerve agent to attack two individuals in the United Kingdom, the United States certifies that the Russian Federation is in noncompliance with its obligations under the [Chemical Weapons Convention].’’. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that the Russia’s actions constitute violations of Russia’s obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention.

During its flight, the nuclearpowered engine reached its design capacity and provided the necessary propulsion.’’; (D) ‘‘[i]n December 2017, an innovative nuclear power unit for this unmanned underwater vehicle completed a test cycle that lasted many years. . ..[t]he tests that were conducted enabled us to begin developing a new type of strategic weapon that would carry massive nuclear ordnance’’; (E) ‘‘[b]y the way, we have yet to choose names for these two new strategic weapons, the global range cruise missile and the unmanned underwater vehicle. We are waiting for suggestions from the Defence Ministry’’; (F) ‘‘A real technological breakthrough is the development of a strategic missile system with fundamentally new combat equipment a gliding wing unit, which has also been successfully tested. . .[w]e called it the Avangard’’; and (G) ‘‘I want to specifically emphasise that the newly developed strategic arms  in fact, new types of strategic weapons are not the result of something left over from the Soviet Union. Of course, we relied on some ideas from our ingenious predecessors. But everything I have described today is the result of the last several years, the product of dozens of research organisations, design bureaus and institute.’’. (3) During the House Armed Services Committee hearing on April 12, 2018, Secretary of Defense James Mattis was asked whether Russia should honor the terms of the treaty and limit its new strategic offensive arms under the New START Treaty as it requires and he stated ‘‘Sir, I believe they should.’’.

SEC. 1649. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NUCLEAR POSTURE OF THE UNITED STATES. 
It is the sense of Congress that— (1) for more than 70 years, the nuclear deterrent of the United States has played a central role in the national security of the United States and international stability; (2) the nuclear forces of the United States have and will continue to play a fundamental role in deterring aggression against the interests of the United States and the allies of the United States in an increasingly dangerous world; (3) strong, credible, and flexible nuclear forces of the United States assure the allies of the United States that the extended deterrence guarantees of the United States are credible and that the resolve of the United States remains strong even in the face of nuclear provocations, including nuclear coercion and blackmail; (4) the 2017 National Security Strategy and the 2018 National Defense Strategy correctly assess that, due to increased global disorder and complexity, the decline of the international rulesbased order and security environment, and the erosion of the competitive advantages of the United States, interstate strategic competition must now be the primary focus of the national security strategy of the United States; (5) the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review aligns with these conclusions, and recognizes that deterrence is dynamic, not static, and that while the nuclear posture and policies of the United States are underpinned by enduring consistency, such posture and policies must also undergo measured adjustments to remain credible as threats evolve; (6) the Russian Federation has elevated the role of nuclear weapons in its strategies, is developing and deploying new nuclear capabilities (including a recently announced nuclearpowered cruise missile and highspeed, nuclearpowered underwater drone), is violating many arms control agreements (including the INF Treaty), and has made explicit nuclear threats against the United States and the allies of the United States; (7) the United States remains committed to its full range of nuclear arms control and nonproliferation obligations and seeks continued engagement for prudent and verifiable agreements, however, the policies and actions of the United States must also hold states that violate arms control treaties accountable for such violations and take such violations into account when considering further arms control agreements; (8) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) plays an essential role in the national security of the United States and NATO should continue to strengthen and align its nuclear and conventional deterrence posture, planning, and exercises to align with modern threats, including modernizing its dualcapable aircraft, command and control networks, nuclearrelated facilities, and conventional capabilities; (9) to deter largescale, catastrophic war with Russia, the People’s Republic of China, and other potential adversaries, as well as reassure allies, the United States requires reliable, diverse, and tailorable nuclear forces that are able to respond to a variety of current threats while preparing for future uncertainty; (10) the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review reconfirms the value of the nuclear triad and dual capable aircraft of the United States, directs the continuation of the comprehensive nuclear modernization program initiated by the previous administration, and proposes two supplemental capabilities (a loweryield submarinelaunched ballistic missile warhead and a sealaunched cruise missile) that will strengthen deterrence and assurance and reduce the chances that nuclear weapons are used in conflict; (11) three successive Secretaries of Defense across two administrations have stated that nuclear deterrence is the highest priority mission of the Department of Defense; and (12) in light of this prioritization, the age of the current nuclear forces and infrastructure of the United States, and the small percentage of the defense budget that will be expended on the recapitalization of the nuclear deterrent of the United States, the modernization of the nuclear forces, command and control systems, and supporting infrastructure of the United States is affordable and a national imperative. 
SEC. 1650. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON EXTENDED NUCLEAR DETERRENCE IN THE INDOPACIFIC REGION. 
It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the nuclear program of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea poses a critical national security threat not only to the United States, but to the security and stability of the entire IndoPacific region, including South Korea, Japan, and Australia; (2) the nuclear and conventional forces of the United States continue to play a fundamental role in deterring aggression against its interests and the interests of its allies in the IndoPacific region and beyond; (3) the United States stands unwaveringly behind its treaty obligations and assurances, including those related to defense and extended nuclear deterrence, to South Korea, Japan, and Australia; (4) the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea remains a central foreign policy objective of the United States; (5) the status of any denuclearization or endofconflict agreement with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea should not supersede such treaty obligations and assurances described in paragraph (3); and (6) the presence of United States Forces on the Korean Peninsula should remain strong and enduring.

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 115–698. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle B of title II, add the following new section: 
SEC. 2ll. ESTABLISHMENT OF INNOVATORS DATABASE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall establish an innovators database within the Department of Defense in accordance with this section. (b) MAINTENANCE OF DATABASE .—The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering shall maintain the database and ensure that it is periodically updated. (c) ELEMENTS OF DATABASE .— The database established under subsection (a) shall— (1) be coordinated across the Department of Defense enterprise to focus on small business innovators that receive funds under the Small Business Innovation Research program or the Small Business Technology Transfer program; and (2) include appropriate information about each participant, including a description of— (A) the need or requirement applicable to the participant; (B) the participant’s technology with appropriate technical detail and appropriate protections of proprietary information or data; (C) any prior business of the participant with the Department; and (D) whether the participant’s technology was incorporated into a program of record. (d) USE OF DATABASE .—After the database is established under subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall encourage program offices across the Department of Defense to consult the database before initiating a Request for Information or a Request for Proposal to determine whether an organic technology exists or is being developed currently by a an entity supported by the Department (which may include a company, academic consortium, or other entity). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 905, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, there is widespread, bipartisan support for efforts to expand the number of small businesses that do business with the Department of Defense. I particularly want to thank Chairman CHABOT and Ranking Member VELA´ZQUEZ of the Small Business Committee for their partnership in working toward that goal. Unfortunately, I believe that a number of small businesses that may receive some initial funding to do business with the Department of Defense and develop their technologies have found that they do not continue to do business with the Department of Defense or their technologies are not taken up into a program of record so that it is a temporary, onetime infusion of cash which does not fully accomplish the goals that so many of us want to achieve. This amendment requires the Department of Defense to set up a database of small business innovators, specifically those who receive grants through the Small Business Innovation Research program and the Small Business Technology Transfer program, so that we can track these businesses and see: Do their technologies get taken up in a program of record? Do these small businesses do further business with the Department of Defense? I think that is in doubt, but we won’t know until we have this database. That is the purpose of this amendment. I recommend its adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I support the gentleman’s amendment. I just want to comment on a couple of aspects of it. I think it is incredibly important that we get more small businesses involved. Sometimes the best technology, the best ideas, that is where they start, and working with the Pentagon bureaucracy can be overwhelming. A large company like Lockheed Martin or Boeing doesn’t have a problem, but maybe the best ideas come from some small garage startup. I think making affirmative efforts to make sure we reach out and get those companies involved is something that is very important and something we need to continue to do. Yes, we need to track the success of it. Given the record of some of the programs of record, I personally would hesitate to judge them based on whether or not they made it into a program of record. I know we have done some reforms where it has worked where they don’t have to get into a program of record. The Pentagon doesn’t have to go through all of the processes that are involved with that. They just are able to say: I like that. We are going to buy it. 
In fact, that is one of the reforms that the chairman has been a leader on doing is freeing up more opportunity, particularly when you are talking about technology, to simply buy the best product instead of having to do an RFP and a down select and going through a lengthy process. So I agree with the chairman on that. As we are judging whether or not these small businesses are truly contributing to our national security, I would hope we would keep two things in mind. One is having a program of record may not necessarily be a measure of whether or not they are doing that; and two, not all ideas work out, but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t keep pursuing them. It is the Silicon Valley mantra that it is okay to fail. You learn something from that. You build a better technology. And with the rapid pace of technology, that is part of what we need to do as well. I think these programs are critically important. The gentleman’s amendment will help with that. I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I would just say the gentleman is right. I don’t mean to say that inclusion in a formal program of record is the only measure of success. I just think we need to track this to see: Do those small businesses continue to do business with the Department of Defense? Are their technologies taken up or not? That is the goal here. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . NOLAN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 115–698. Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 905, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. NOLAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strip all funding authorizations for the overseas contingency operations fund for fiscal year 2019, saving the American taxpayers $69 billion, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. The overseas contingency fund has been called out by many, myself included, and including Democrats and Republicans and liberals and conservatives, that this OCO budget is nothing but a slush fund for the purpose of circumventing the Budget Control Act in order to fund these endless wars of choice and the socalled nationbuilding that has been so costly to our country and our people in blood and in treasury. As a result of the Cost of War Act, sponsored by our good friend JOHN LEWIS in 2016, we now have a more elaborate and adequate picture of how much these endless wars are costing us. You will see from the chart that I have here that we are now involved in conflicts in 76 different countries all over the world. That is right. Fortysix percent of the countries in the world are involved in one kind of a conflict or another, and we have gotten ourselves involved in those. Twentytwo of them happen to be in the Middle East, in Africa, where I have a little background to qualify myself on this. I lived in the Middle East. I have studied the language. I have got a fairly good idea what has been happening and what is going on there. So what I would like you to do is to just bear with me and look at the numbers as a result of that cost of war resolution. Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University estimated we spent $5.6 trillion on these socalled wars of choice, that we have an additional $7.9 trillion going forward just on the interest paying for those costly wars, and that we have $2 trillion going forward to take care of the veterans. That is right, the men and women who stood up to serve and protect us. They suffered irreparable damage. They lost arms. They lost legs. They had irreparable damage to their bodies and minds and spirits. Twentythree of them are committing suicide every day. This totals up to be a little over $15 trillion. I don’t have time in my 5 minutes to go through it, but I could tell you in detail how we have been on every side of every one of these conflicts at one time or another, and it is time to put an end to it. We have so many unmet domestic needs in this country. You all know, as Members of Congress, we need more money for infrastructure. We need more money for education. We need more money for healthcare. We need more money for mental health. We need more money for this and that, and indeed we do, but the money is not there. That is the answer all the time: No, we don’t have money to spend at the National Institutes of Health or anyplace else. Why? Well, show me your budget. Show me your budget, and I will show you your priorities. $15 trillion has gone into the endless wars of choice, making ourselves the policemen of the world, socalled nationbuilding of the world. Well, let’s think about it. For one of those trillion we could have graduated every kid in America from college debt free. Don’t tell me we can’t afford to do that. For another one of those trillion dollars, there is another trillion for infrastructure. Don’t tell me we don’t have the money to do that. For another one of those trillion dollars maybe we find a cure for cancer or diabetes or Alzheimer’s or the mental health treatment that is needed throughout this country. And guess what? We would still have $12 trillion left. Give America a tax break. Put some money down toward deficit reduction. Maybe take care of some of the other unmet human needs in this country. That is what this is all about. Are we going to be standing here 10 years from now? We just elected two Presidents in a row that got elected because they were going to stop these wars in the Middle East, these endless wars of choice. You can quarrel with my numbers if you like, but President Trump just came out and said Afghanistan and Iraq, alone, cost $7 trillion. It is hard to get these numbers out, but thanks to JOHNLEWIS and the Cost of War Act, we are getting a look at it. My friends, two things: one, there are a lot of things in life you would like to do and you can’t afford, and that is the case here. It is going to bankrupt this country. Two, there are things you do that create more problems than they solve, and that is the same with these endless wars of choice. It is time to put an end to it. We hear Republicans and Democrats and liberals and conservatives all over the country. They are in unanimous agreement. Two Presidents got elected because they were going to get us out of these wars, and the wars continue. The only way we are going to stop them is to stop funding them, and that is what my amendment is all about. Please support it, and please pass it. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. Chair, I was interested to hear the gentleman’s reasoning behind his amendment. Just to clarify for all Members, the overseas contingency account existed before the Budget Control Act existed. The reason it was created was because we live in a volatile, dynamic world, and there needed to be some accounting mechanism that would be responsive to particular kinds of conflicts so that, if we needed more people, more weapons to be successful, for example, fighting a terrorist in a particular location, you would have that flexibility. But those funds are authorized and appropriated just like every other part of the defense budget is. So the assertion that one sometimes reads that these are slush funds that can be spent as wanted by the Pentagon is, of course, absolutely not true. Mr. Chairman, it is true that our forces are engaged in more countries 
where there are conflicts going on—not that we are in all of those conflicts, but we are engaged with local militaries in more countries than we had been in the past. Part of the reason is because the terrorism problem has spread to more countries than it has in the past, and most of us think that it is better to engage terrorists over there rather than just stick our heads in the sand and wait for them to come attack us over here. So that has been part of what has happened, at least in the past 17 years, as we try to prevent terrorist attacks here at home. I have to say thanks to our military and intelligence community and law enforcement, they have been remarkably successful. I would just say, finally, Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned before, 15—one, five—15 percent of the Federal budget is spent to defend this country. The rest, 85 percent is spent on other things. When John Kennedy was President, it was 50 percent of the Federal budget that was spent defending the country. As Secretary Mattis says: I think we can afford survival. So I understand the sentiment that we wish all of this conflict would go away and the world would just be a peaceful place. It hasn’t quite happened yet, and until it does, it is important for the United States to be strong, to keep terrorists engaged overseas rather than here, and that is exactly what the overseas contingency account tries to help accomplish. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH), the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, first, let me say I agree with Mr. NOLAN on a couple of key points. Number one, I think the overseas contingency fund has come to be relied on too much. Yes, it was created before the Budget Control Act, but these wars have been going on long enough now that we ought to be able to incorporate it into the funds. So I agree with him on that. But completely zeroing out the overseas contingency fund, I think, is irresponsible, because while I agree in some cases the terrorism threat may be overblown, it is, nonetheless, real. b1900 Yemen is always the best example. We went into Afghanistan after 9/11. We dealt with that. We thought we had alQaida contained. And then we had the underwear bomber in Detroit and the package bombs that both almost came into the U.S. and attacked us, and they came out of Yemen. So we had to respond to that. We had to respond in our own selfdefense. And that is part of what the overseas contingency fund funds. So, if we wanted to reduce it, if we wanted to get more transparency, I am all for that. But to simply zero it out would basically be to say that we have all these wars and we really have none of them. I am somewhere in between on that. So I can’t support zeroing out the overseas contingency fund, although I do agree with some of the statements that the sponsor of the amendment made. Mr. Chairman, because it zeros it out completely, I have to oppose the amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. NOLAN ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MS . GABBARD  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 115–698. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 905, the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. GABBARD ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Hawaii. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Chairman, make no mistake: the authorization in section 1225 of the underlying bill authorizes our U.S. military to go to war with Iran. One of the main reasons why I voted against this bill in committee was specifically because of this provision that authorizes the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State to ‘‘develop and implement a strategy with foreign partners to counter the destabilizing activities of Iran.’’ The provision does not define what destabilizing activities they want our troops and taxpayer dollars to counter. It does not define a clear objective or end state for our troops to achieve. In addition, this provision shuts the American people out from this decision entirely by circumventing Congress’ constitutional responsibility to declare war and giving unilateral power and unending authorization to counter Iran to this and future administrations without defining in any way, shape, or form what the objective really is. It sidelines Congress and the American people entirely, with the only requirement being that the administration report to Congress after their plan is being implemented and only for the next 4 years, while the authorization for war has no expiration date. It gives afterthefact license for what is already happening in the Middle East. Since 2015, without express congressional authorization, U.S. troops have been providing direct military support to Saudi Arabia and Yemen through information sharing, logistical support, and refueling Saudi warplanes which have dropped U.S. made bombs on Yemeni civilians. The most recent attack was on a Yemeni wedding party, with 2 rounds of bombing killing more than 20 people and wounding dozens of others. This Saudiled interventionist war has created one of the worst humanitarian disasters in history, worsening a situation that has led to mass starvation, cholera outbreaks, devastation, thousands of civilian deaths, and tens of thousands of injuries. This provision gives total authority to the administration to keep U.S. troops in Syria or any other country in the Middle East as long as they deem necessary—an intention clearly stated by members of this administration. To name a few examples, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said last month that U.S. troops would stay in Syria indefinitely until their goals are accomplished—namely, to counter Iran. National Security Advisor John Bolton said in a 2015 oped entitled ‘‘To Stop Iran’s Bomb, Bomb Iran’’ that ‘‘the United States could do a thorough job of destruction, but Israel alone can do what is necessary. Such action should be combined with vigorous American support for Iran’s opposition, aimed at regime change in Tehran.’’ Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently advocated that the U.S. will ‘‘crush’’ Iran with economic and military pressure unless it changes its behavior in the Middle East. So it is clear that, if left unchecked, war hawks in the Trump administration will drag our country into more Middle East wars, leaving destruction in its wake around the world and here at home. Trillions of taxpayer dollars have already been spent on these regime change wars in the Middle East since 9/ 11. Rather than dumping more taxpayer dollars in these wars, as this provision authorizes, we should instead be investing in rebuilding our community right here at home. For too long, the U.S. has engaged in military adventurism and interventionist wars, sending our troops overseas with no clear objective or end state. Countering Iran is not an end state that our military or diplomats can achieve. Without a clear objective, you end up in endless war. So what is the objective of this authorization for war? Is it regime change in Iran? Regime change in Syria? More war against Iran and Syria? Yemen? I strongly urge my colleagues to consider the serious consequences of section 1225 being enacted, because it would authorize any or all of these. It is Congress’ responsibility and constitutional role to declare war. The American people have a right to real 
debate on such a declaration. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of my amendment to uphold this responsibility. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Hawaii has 1 minute remaining. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. KHANNA ). Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Representative GABBARD for offering this amendment for one simple reason: it is going to stop the march to war in Iran, another blunder like Iraq. I don’t understand our foreign policy. It seems that the qualification, in John Bolton’s case, is to be wrong for the last 25 years, and then that makes you an expert—wrong about Iraq and wrong about the neoconservative philosophy that got us into this mess. This amendment, forget all the details; we are rushing again to another historic blunder, and this Congress needs to stop that. I respect Representative GABBARD for putting this forward so we don’t make another blunder in our foreign policy. Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment to strike section 1225, which is an important and necessary provision in the fiscal year 2019 NDAA. Iran is a significant threat not only to Israel but to the stability of the entire region, and this provision provides an effective plan to counter their destabilizing efforts. Iran has supported militias in Syria, provided weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon, and helped the Houthi militia to overthrow the government in Yemen. They continue to pose a threat to Israel by building up forces near Israel’s northern border and to U.S. forces in the region as well. This provision not only emphasizes the importance of multilateral cooperation, but it encourages the Secretary of Defense to establish a framework for critical mutual investments in ISR assets, ballistic missile defense, and cybersecurity and cyber defense. At its core, section 1225 supports the National Defense Strategy by highlighting the importance of partnerships and the responsibility of all affected nations to contribute in order to achieve shared objectives. It is only through this level of shared responsibility that the United States can expect to manage the threat from Iran, as well as those from Asia and Europe. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER ). Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. It is a confusing amendment to me because, looking at what we want to do, I haven’t talked to many people who don’t think that Iran isn’t a bad actor in the region. It is really almost impossible to find anybody except somebody in the Iranian regime who would say that. This basically peacefully works with our partners to say: Let’s find a strategy to counter this terrible activity, this terrible regime. Cyber defense. Working together for intelligence. What do we do to come together with our friends to make sure we can counter these destabilizing activities? If this amendment would pass, it would hand a victory to a few people. It would hand a victory to Russia—Russia that has invested a lot in propping up the Assad regime and working with the Iranian regime to do so. This would be a huge victory to Bashar alAssad, who has killed half a million of his own people simply because he wants to stay in power. Fifty thousand of those are children, by the way. Many of those gasped their last breath on chemical weapons. This would be a victory to Hezbollah, which has 150,000 rockets aimed at our best ally in the Middle East, Israel, that is worried about their future. This is the same Iran that calls Israel ‘‘little Satan’’ and the United States ‘‘big Satan.’’ And this would be, of course, a huge victory for Iran itself. This is a nation that is responsible for almost onequarter of American deaths in Iraq that I actually operated against—onequarter of the American deaths in Iraq. I would think it is pretty good to counter that. So, ultimately, this makes military action less likely, because we are working with our allies to do what we can to prevent actions by this regime that will make war more likely, as we saw in the escalating situation between Israel and Iran just a week ago. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding the time. I urge my colleagues to resoundingly defeat this amendment. Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. GABBARD ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Hawaii will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . AGUILAR  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 115–698. Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 790, line 1, insert ‘‘ AND MODIFICATION ’’ after ‘‘
EXTENSION ’’. Page 790, line 7, strike ‘‘Section 1043(a)(1)’’ and insert ‘‘(a) EXTENSION .—Paragraph (1) of section 1043(a)’’. Page 790, after line 10, insert the following: (b) PROJECTED FUTURE TOTAL LIFECYCLE  COSTS.—Paragraph (2) of such section is amended— (1) by redesignating subparagraph (G) as subparagraph (H); and (2) by inserting after subparagraph (F) the following new subparagraph (G): ‘‘(G) An estimate of the projected future total lifecycle cost of each type of nuclear weapon and delivery platform for each five year period occurring during the period beginning on the date of the report and ending on the date that is 20 years after the date of the report.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 905, the gentleman from California (Mr. AGUILAR ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman of the full committee and the ranking member for their hard work in developing this product. Mr. Chairman, our nuclear triad and the strategic deterrence it provides helps protect our Nation from the existential threat of nuclear war. However, the age of its elements must give us pause. Our B–52s, of which we have over 70 in current use, are over 50 years old. Our Ohioclass submarines’ lifespan has been extended from 30 years to 42 years, and the first Minuteman III ICBMs were deployed 40 years ago. With the number of nuclearrelated threats increasing around the globe, a credible, safe, secure, and reliable nuclear deterrent is vital to our national security. But just because the modernization is necessary does not mean that we should fail to track how much this modernization process will cost. Over the next 30 years, we will be replacing our bombers, ICBMs, and ballistic missile submarines while also sustaining and modernizing our nuclear bombs and warheads. Additionally, the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review called for the development of lowyield nuclear weapons, a nucleararmed sea launched cruise missile, and continuation of the Long Range Standoff cruise missile. Our old requirements, in combination with these new initiatives, make cost estimates even more important if we hope to balance our conventional and nuclear force investments. My amendment would require the DOD to include a 20year estimate of the projected lifecycle costs of each type of nuclear weapon and delivery platform in an annual report they already produce. A CBO report released in October 2017 estimated that over a 30year span the sustainment and modernization of our nuclear forces will cost $1.2 trillion, which, of course, didn’t take into account delays, changes to the weapons systems, or understated estimates. 
If Congress hopes to provide proper oversight of these modernization efforts, we must have uptodate estimates that accurately reflect any updates and changes that impact our nuclear bombs, warheads, and delivery systems. I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This amendment is very similar to NDAA amendments that have been presented to and rejected by this House each of the last 4 years in a row. One of the reasons this amendment has failed so many times is that even the Obama administration opposed it. A few years ago, President Obama’s Assistant Secretary of Defense told us that this type of multidecade report was a bad idea. He called such a report ‘‘burdensome,’’ explaining, ‘‘As you would expect, looking out that far, 25 years, the credibility of the numbers would be very, very suspect.’’ He went on to say: ‘‘Forecasting DOD costs over a 25year period with any useful accuracy is extremely difficult given the challenges of predicting developments in the international security environment and ongoing technological advancements.’’ b1915 The Trump administration opposes it, too. Here is the view of the current Department of Defense on this idea: ‘‘Projecting out 20 years will result in even lower quality cost estimates with a higher degree of uncertainty. . . . ‘’ They go on to say: ‘‘Given these and other uncertainties, cost estimates that project beyond 10 years into the future provide little value in understanding either the Department’s fiscal position or its performance in managing programs.’’ This amendment would not result in good, effective oversight and transparency. It would result in false, unreliable data entering the public debate. This amendment is part of a longstanding effort to make our nuclear deterrent appear too expensive by calculating its costs over multiple decades. Regardless of the trilliondollar figures thrown around by nuclear disarmament advocates, CBO has confirmed that our nuclear deterrent will never cost us more than 7 percent of the defense budget in coming decades. Seven percent of the defense budget to deter nuclear attack on our country is a bargain. As Secretary Mattis said last year: ‘‘America can afford survival.’’ Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for his comments. We have had this discussion a number of times. I served on his committee and have a lot of respect for him. But he called this a bad idea. He said that it is a bargain if we just continue the status quo. Mr. Chairman, the Department of Energy asked this exact question. The Department of Energy produces a fiscal year stockpile stewardship and management plan. It is a 25year plan with longterm costs. It is required in Federal code. We are doing this analysis in other areas. Why isn’t the Department of Defense doing this? The majority seeks to say: Why even ask the question? We have to ask ourselves, what is oversight if we don’t ask hard questions? Now, I think that there is a reason why folks like the National Taxpayers Union, who have supported this amendment and have said that they are going to score this amendment, have signed on to support it. It is because we need to ask these tough questions. If we are going to genuinely offer oversight, we need to ask how much these programs cost, we need to plan, and we need to budget. It seems like a reasonable step to take. I appreciate my colleagues’ concerns, and I would ask an ‘‘aye’’ vote of my colleagues. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ), my friend and colleague. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for the great work he has done and for his leadership on this issue. I do agree with my colleague from California, yes, we need to do modernization. If you will remember, President Obama pledged to modernize our nuclear forces in return for the Senate passing the New START Treaty. The current national posture review, which has been endorsed by security officials from several administrations going back, both Democratic and Republican, says this: Maintaining and operating our current aging nuclear forces now requires between 2 and 3 percent of the DOD budget. The replacement program to rebuild the triad for decades of service will peak for several years at only approximately 4 percent beyond the ongoing 2 to 3 percent needed for maintenance and operations. This 6.4 percent, just slightly under the 7 percent that the chairman mentioned, of the current DOD budget required for the longterm replacement program represents less than 1 percent of the overall Federal budget. That is a bargain. Nuclear warfare is, God forbid it should ever happen, an existential threat. One percent of our Federal budget devoted to preventing that is truly worth investing in. The modernization needs to take place. It is well within the moneys that are going to be available to the Department of Defense in the coming years. I agree with the chairman that projecting 20 or 30 years out contains so many potential inaccuracies, it would be kind of an unnecessary and burdensome exercise, and not very useful. We do have and will have the money. It is a vital investment. I agree with the chairman. Let’s turn this amendment down. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. AGUILAR ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . GARAMENDI  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in House Report 115–698. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk as the designee of the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
In section 3114— (1) strike subsection (a) (and redesignate subsection (b) as subsection (a)); (2) in subsection (a), as so redesignated, strike ‘‘The Secretary’’ and insert ‘‘Except as provided by subsection (b), the Secretary’’; and (3) add at the end the following new subsection: (b) LIMITATION .—Of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2019 for the W762 warhead modification program, not more than 50 percent may be obligated or expended until the date on which the Secretary of Defense submits to the congressional defense committees a report— (1) assessing the potential effects of the modification or development of a lowyield nuclear warhead for submarinelaunched ballistic missiles on strategic stability; and (2) assessing options to— (A) reduce the risk of miscalculation associated with adversaries being unable to distinguish between a submarinelaunched ballistic missile carrying a lowyield warhead and such a missile carrying several high yield warheads; and (B) preserve the survivability and the secondstrike capability of ballistic missile submarines without increasing risk. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 905, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this amendment deals with the new lowyield D5 or W76–2 nuclear warhead. 
In the NDAA, there is the establishment of this new lowyield nuclear warhead. This amendment would fence 50 percent of the funding for the warhead until such time as the Secretary of Defense submits a report on the program’s impacts on strategic stability and options to reduce the risk of miscalculation associated with the inability of adversaries to be able to distinguish between an SSBN missile carrying a single lowyield warhead and a missile carrying several highyield nuclear warheads, and to preserve the survivability of the secondstrike capability of the SSBNs. It also strikes the unnecessary provision in the mark. People who have looked at these issues—for example, former Secretary of State George Shultz and Senator Lugar, recently wrote: ‘‘The justification for new Trident warheads fails on many levels. It is unlikely that there is such a thing as a limited nuclear war; preparing for one is folly.’’ Back in January, 2018, former Secretary of State George Shultz wrote in Congressional testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee: ‘‘One of the alarming things to me is this notion that we can have something called a small nuclear weapon, which I understand the Russians are doing, and that somehow that’s usable,’’ he told the panel. He went on to say: ‘‘Your mind goes to the idea that, yes, nuclear weapons become usable. And then we’re really in trouble, because a big nuclear exchange can wipe out the world.’’ Senator Nunn and former Secretary Moniz talked about this, saying: ‘‘The most immediate priority should be to structure and posture U.S. and Russian nuclear forces to deter nuclear use and reduce the risk of an accidental, mistaken or unauthorized launch. Against this backdrop, the current Russian concept of ‘escalate to deescalate’— i.e., limited nuclear use designed to create a pause in the conflict and open a pathway for a negotiated settlement on Moscow’s terms—and U.S. calls for more ‘usable’ nuclear weapons taken together make the world a vastly more dangerous place.’’ So what we would like to do here is simply have a report, again, from the Secretary of Defense to lay out exactly what this is all about, why it is important, and what it means for our principal deterrent force: nucleararmed submarines. That is what it is. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment. Three successive Secretaries of Defense—Secretary Hagel, Secretary Carter, and Secretary Mattis—have said that nuclear deterrence is DOD’s ‘‘highest priority mission.’’ In its 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, Secretary Mattis conducted a clear eyed assessment of nuclear threats. In the end, Secretary Mattis concluded: ‘‘We must look reality in the eye and see the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.’’ This stands in stark relief to the Obama administration’s 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, which concluded: ‘‘Russia is not an enemy and is increasingly a partner.’’ I will not list the many, many ways that this statement from 2010 is so obviously wrong. I will just note that Russia has many thousands of low yield nuclear weapons, including nuclear artillery shells, nuclear land mines, and nuclear torpedoes, and recently announced even more. Russia regularly exercises them with its ‘‘escalate to deescalate’’ doctrine, which they believe will force the U.S. to surrender early in a conflict. The NPR rightly states: ‘‘Correcting this mistaken Russian perception is a strategic imperative.’’ Russia is not a partner, but a competitor, and we must shore up our deterrence posture. Let me briefly address the specifics of the gentleman’s amendment. First, previous NDAAs already line item authorize funding for individual warhead programs, regardless of the yield. Second, in an April hearing, the Navy confirmed that having a lowyield nuclear weapon does not increase risk to the submarine. Finally, Secretary Mattis and General Hyten of STRATCOM have stated that having this lowyield weapon does not increase the risk of strategic miscalculation. The bottom line here is that this amendment is designed simply to slow down the longoverdue modernization and improvement of our nuclear forces. Because of that, I have to urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1
3⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH), the ranking member of the full committee. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I agree very strongly with my colleague from the Armed Services Committee, Mr. ROGERS , that we need a strong nuclear deterrent. Russia is primarily the focus of that, but not exclusively the focus of that. China has nuclear weapons, North Korea has nuclear weapons, Iran aspires to have them. Without question, we need a strong deterrent. My argument is that we have one. We have over 4,000 nuclear weapons. We do have some lowyield nuclear weapons. We don’t have them in the standoff capacity. But more than that, what we need to communicate to Russia is not that nuclear war is something of degree; that, basically, well, if you were to use a lowyield nuclear weapon, we wouldn’t know what to do because we don’t have one that is equally as small. I think that is the exact wrong approach. Our approach should be that nuclear weapons are the red line to end all red lines. There is no such thing as a tactical nuclear weapon. Even these tactical nuclear weapons that the gentleman talks about Russia having, I think are some 100 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. What we need to communicate to Russia is: If you use a nuclear weapon, we will respond with nuclear weapons. So don’t. We don’t need to build small nuclear weapons so that military people can start to imagine a survivable nuclear war. This is the way people used to think in the sixties and seventies when we came tiptoeing up very close on more than one occasion to stumbling in to the conflict to end all conflicts, a nuclear war. If we start buying in to Russia’s philosophy that a lowyield nuclear weapon is, like, a manageable thing that you can use in a combat situation that doesn’t necessarily lead to a broader nuclear weapon, we are running the risk of creating the very thing we are trying to prevent. We need a deterrent. We have a deterrent. We should not mince words with the Russians or anybody else. Nuclear weapons are red line. We will respond. And we will not trouble ourselves to make sure that our nuclear weapon isn’t bigger than yours. We will deter them in that way, rather than running the risk. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ), my friend and colleague. b1930 Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for the great work he is doing on this. We all agree that we want a strong nuclear deterrent, and we all agree we want that deterrent to be as stabilizing as possible. We don’t want destabilizing trends. We all agree with that. General John Hyten, Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, testified before the House and said: 
We require a mix of yields and improved platforms to credibly deter the threats of the near future. The National Posture Review directs nearterm fielding of a lowyield SLBM capability and, in the longer term, pursuit of a modern, nucleararmed, sealaunched cruise missile. 
So the commander of U.S. Strategic Command says we do need this option. And let me also quote James Miller, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy 
under the Obama administration, the principal author of President Obama’s Nuclear Posture Review: ‘‘Secretary of Defense James Mattis’ 2018 Nuclear Posture Review offers continuity with past U.S. policy and plans, including those in the 2010 NPR. It deserves broad bipartisan support. Its proposal for a lowyield SLBM weapon and a new nucleartipped, sealaunched cruise missile are sensible responses to changed security conditions, especially Russia and North Korea.’’ Well, things have changed since 2010. That is what the 2018 NPR addresses. So, from both administrations, from both sides of the aisle, we have agreement that we do need this lowyield option. That is a stabilizing influence, to have more tools in the toolbox. When you have fewer tools, you have fewer options, and that is destabilizing. Mr. Chair, I ask for a rejection of this amendment. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I once again urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. LAMBORN ) having assumed the chair, Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5515) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2019 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
PERMISSION TO REVISE REMARKS DURING GENERAL DEBATE ON H.R. 5515 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may be permitted to revise my remarks, made during general debate in the Committee of the Whole earlier today, beyond technical, grammatical, and typographical corrections. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 905, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER ). Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Chair, I rise today to support the National Defense Authorization Act and thank the chairman of the committee for this bipartisan legislation which supports our troops, enhances military readiness, and provides for the defense of our Nation. I also encourage my colleagues to support my amendments, Nos. 43 and 48, to the NDAA. My amendments seek to improve the mental health services provided by the Department of Defense so our troops receive only the best treatment. It comes as no surprise that the high levels of violence and trauma our servicemembers experience is cause for negative impacts on their mental health. Our soldiers suffer from major depression at a rate five times higher than the civilian population rate. Additionally, their diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder was approximately 15 times greater than the general population. Congress can help. Currently, there is a serious shortage of mental health providers at the DOD. Our troops are paying the price, but they don’t have to. One of my amendments would help identify the scope of the workforce problem at DOD and ensure that an effective strategy is in place so our Nation’s troops have full access to qualified mental health providers. My other amendment would require the DOD to establish a monitoring program carried out by each branch of the armed services to conduct periodic reviews of the medication prescribing practices of its own providers to treat PTSD. This monitoring program will help ensure that every military branch is regularly monitoring the medications prescribed to treat PTSD to ensure that our troops are getting the proper treatment. Some of the greatest wounds inflicted upon our brave servicemen and women are unseen. We should be doing everything possible to ensure that we are treating these wounds as we would any other. I urge my colleagues to support my amendments on behalf of the servicemembers and military families that we represent. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ). Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chair, openair burn pits pose serious health risks to our troops; yet, still to this day, our military uses them to dispose of waste and equipment—like human waste, plastics, computers, and jet fuel—on the battlefield. I am a board certified emergency physician and a public health expert, and in public health and in the medical field, we know that, if there is a high enough suspicion with a severe enough illness, which we have with veterans developing rare and permanently severely disabling pulmonary autoimmune diseases and dying of cancer, then we need to act on that suspicion. We can start to do that by doing these three things: one, stop our troops’ exposure to dangerous burn pits out on the battlefield; two, conduct public health education for doctors and veterans to train them to recognize subtle changes in their health, help to catch cancer at an early stage when it 
can still be treated, and save lives; and third, get our veterans and servicemembers the medical treatment they need quickly and ensure it is covered by the VA or the DOD. My amendment will help accomplish this first step by directing the Department of Defense to conduct a feasibility study on ending the use of dangerous burn pits by using incinerators or other technology. I thank the committee leadership for their support of this amendment and on this emerging health crisis for our veterans. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote to help save our veterans’ and men and women in uniforms’ lives. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time on this amendment. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER ). Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Chair, Iran’s destabilizing activities in the Middle East are not a new phenomenon. However, of late, their malign influence has dramatically expanded and intensified in Yemen, in Iraq, in Lebanon, and, perhaps of greatest immediate concern, the establishment of a potentially permanent foothold in Syria. Such a presence enables Iran’s increasing support for Hezbollah, including not only weapons transfers, but also assistance in building an indigenous rocketproducing capacity. I therefore appreciate the work of the House Armed Services Committee in including a provision authorizing the Secretaries of Defense and State to develop and implement a strategy with foreign partners to counter Iran’s destabilizing activities. My first amendment would ensure the strategy includes specific countries in which Iran is operating, an assessment of their destabilizing activities, and the implications thereof. My second amendment would require a report on Iran’s support for proxy forces in Syria and Lebanon and an assessment of the threat posed to Israel, other regional allies, and U.S. interests. It is important to know where Iran is operating, what exactly they are doing, who they are backing, and how this impacts the United States and our allies. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their support for my bipartisan amendments. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N). Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the bloc of amendments, and amendment 41, for the Department of Defense to gather the data necessary to successfully extend the TRICARE Prime healthcare benefit to Puerto Rico to meet the needs of our retired military families on the same basis as in the mainland. More than 200,000 Puerto Ricans have served in all branches to date, and the VA has registered almost 100,000 veterans residing in Puerto Rico, yet they face disparity in benefits. TRICARE treats Puerto Rico as an overseas location, with fees and copays higher than what they would be for Prime. Dependents of retired veterans in Puerto Rico either get fewer benefits or pay more. Puerto Rican veterans have fought, bled, and died side by side with their comrades in arms from the whole Nation. The information required through this amendment will support the decision to finally do justice for our servicemembers and veterans. Mr. Chair, I support this amendment. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ). Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the ranking member and the chairman for their support of my efforts to help veterans and servicemembers who have been exposed to burn pits. We have a responsibility to protect the health of our men and women in uniform and veterans from the harmful health effects of exposure to burn pits, and we can start to do so by, first, stopping our troops’ exposure to these dangerous burn pits out on the battlefield; second, conducting education and public health outreach to veterans and their doctors; and third, getting our veterans and servicemembers the medical treatment they need quickly and ensuring it is covered by the VA or the DOD. Earlier, we discussed my amendment that will address step one and finally put an end to the use of dangerous burn pits on the battlefield. My second amendment will tackle step two, requiring the Department of Defense to conduct an annual education and outreach campaign to veterans exposed to burn pits and who are qualified to enroll in the burn pits registry. This will improve our understanding of the different health effects of exposure to burn pits and help raise awareness for our veterans to be on the lookout for subtle changes in their health that could be early signs of cancer. Mr. Chair, again, I thank the committee for their support of this amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER ). Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Chair, we are still uncovering more troubling evidence of the breadth, depth, and reach of Russia’s interference in our most recent election, so I am pleased that the NDAA includes a provision requiring a National Intelligence Estimate of interference by Russia and China in democracies around the world, including our own. While understanding this threat is an important first step, we also need to take action to ensure we are doing everything possible to secure our own elections and defend the integrity of our democracy. My amendment would add a requirement that, following the submission of the NIE, the Secretary of Defense shall report to Congress on the specific efforts by the Department of Defense to deter such interference both at home and abroad. Protecting our elections, the foundation of our democracy, and those of our allies from outside influence by malign foreign actors is of paramount importance. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for including my amendment in this en bloc passage. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. We have no further speakers on en bloc No. 1. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. I also urge support for en bloc No. 1. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. b1945

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 905, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER ). Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, North Carolina’s Seventh Congressional District is fortunate to have more than 63,000 veterans call it home. Unfortunately, many of these brave heroes encounter a variety of problems that require congressional action, whether through casework or legislation, as is the case with my amendment tonight. Recently, a veteran battling Parkinson’s disease contacted my office in a desperate attempt to modify the beneficiary for his survivor benefits plan. In this particular case, the veteran is fighting for his life, and because one currently can only make changes during open season, he is unable to change the beneficiary of his plan. My amendment will provide flexibility, via waiver, to veterans such as this gentleman who desire to change beneficiaries. I appreciate my colleagues’ support for this amendment so that terminally ill veterans are given the ability to update their survivor benefit plan as they wish, when they wish. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, last August, 10 U.S. Navy sailors were killed when the USS John S. McCain collided with a commercial tanker off the coast of Singapore. One of those sailors was Petty Officer Logan Palmer of Harristown, Illinois. Logan’s death was the first casualty from my district since I became a Member of Congress, and let me tell you, it is an experience no one prepares you for, and I pray no other family will have to go through it. While there is little we can do to lesson the grief of these families, we can ensure they don’t have to navigate a complicated bureaucracy. I was a little miffed to learn that, if the body of a servicemember who dies during noncombat operations is flown to Dover Air Force Base, we do not automatically arrange and cover the travel costs for their family like we would if that servicemember died in combat. This amendment requires the DOD to automatically arrange and cover travel for family of noncombat service deaths just as they do for combat operations, instead of making them get a waiver. An outside organization covered the cost for the Palmer family, but I think we can make this process easier and ensure these families are taken care of by including this amendment. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers on this en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to.

(2) For over six decades, NATO has been a successful intergovernmental political and military alliance. (3) NATO’s collective defense acts as a deterrent to aggression where the alliance defends its Allied countries against external security threats. (4) NATO strengthens the security of the United States by utilizing an integrated military coalition. (5) While Russia has continued to threaten the sovereignty of countries in Europe and exhibit threatening behavior toward our own military assets, NATO sends a clear collective message that the Alliance will not tolerate Russia’s provocation. (6) In respect to the changing threats against Europe and the United States since the end of the Cold War, NATO has evolved to take on new dangers including terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and cyber attacks. (7) After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, NATO invoked Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty for the first time in NATO’s history to deploy military resources to Afghanistan in support of the United States mission to combat a dangerous terrorist threat. (8) NATO aided the United States military by leading the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan from August 2003 to 2014, working with Afghan authorities to respond to the terrorist insurgency and to provide effective security across the country. (9) NATO continues a civilianled presence in Afghanistan to strengthen Afghan security forces and institutions to ensure the country can rebuild its security operations and end safe haven for terrorists. (10) In November 2002 at the Prague Summit, NATO leaders adopted a Prague package to adapt NATO to the challenge of combating terrorism which included a Military Concept for Defense against Terrorism, a Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism, missile defense, cyber defense, and enhanced intelligence sharing. (11) In November 2006 at the Riga Summit, NATO declared that ‘‘terrorism, increasingly global in scope and lethal in results, and the spread of weapons of mass destruction are likely to be the principal threats to the Alliance over the next 10 to 15 years’’. (12) In July 2016 at the Warsaw Summit, NATO leaders agreed to strengthen the Alliance’s military presence in Eastern Europe, declared Initial Operational Capability of NATO’s Ballistic Missile Defense to strengthen the defense of Allied countries against ballistic missiles, and recognized cyberspace as a new operational domain. (13) The attacks in Paris, France; Berlin, Germany; Istanbul, Turkey; Manchester, England; Barcelona, Spain; and Brussels, Belgium, home of the NATO Headquarters, shows the importance of an international alliance to combat terrorist groups. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the United States reaffirms its commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as the foundation of transatlantic security and defense; (2) NATO serves as a critical coalition in preserving peace and stability in the transatlantic region; (3) NATO’s continued effort to develop new capabilities and technologies to combat terrorism and a changing international security environment are crucial to enhancing national security and strengthening the United States ability to combat evolving security threats; and (4) the United States encourages each NATO member country to meet or exceed the commitment to spend two percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on defense.

The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee) having assumed the chair, Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5515) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2019 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. NATIONAL MARITIME DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to take a few minutes here on the floor to discuss, really, something that follows along from the last couple of hours where we have been discussing national defense issues. The $708 billion that is going to be spent in the National Defense Authorization Act by the Department of Defense is extremely important, and there are many parts of that National Defense Authorization Act that are worthy of discussion. One thing that was not discussed here on the floor but was taken up in committee over the last several hearings was the ability of the military to actually be able to deliver materiel, supplies, in the case of a major conflict. Do we have the ability to deliver the followon equipment necessary should a major conflict break out somewhere in the world? The answer is, no, we don’t. And the reason is that the American maritime industry has dwindled over the last several decades. In the 1980s, we had about 240 Americanbuilt and American flagships with mariners, captains, engineers and seamen and women on those ships capable of providing the necessary support for the military sealift command. Today, we have about 80 Americanflagged ships with American seamen on those ships. b2000 The mariners are in short supply. TRANSCOM, responsible for moving the personnel as well as the equipment that the military needs somewhere in the world, estimates—as well as the MARAD indicate that we are some 1,800 mariners short of the minimum necessary to man and personnel the ships to move the equipment somewhere in the world. This is a major national defense issue not really taken up and discussed in the NDAA. So what are we going to do about it? Can our shipyards actually produce the necessary ships for the American military? The answer is: not now, but they need to. In the National Defense Authorization Act, there is a section that calls for the construction of the ships—actually, construction by foreign shipyards. It seems strange that we would find what was once one of the great maritime nations, the United States, in such a quandary that we do not have the personnel or the ships to be able to move our national defense. There is something we can do about this, and it is not directly in the area of the Department of Defense, although it is tangential and, therefore, important to our national defense. It seems that over the last decade we have become an energyproducing Nation. With the fracking and other techniques, we are now actually an exporter of oil and natural gas. This is part of the energy revolution that is taking place in the United States. That oil and natural gas is a strategic national asset, as is the United States Department of Defense—the Navy, the Army, the Air Force, the Marines, and the Coast Guard. If we are to maintain our ability to defend this Nation and to conduct military operations anywhere in the world, we have to have a strong maritime industry. If we consider for a moment the combination of that strategic necessity of the maritime industry, the strategic benefit that comes from the production of natural gas and oil, and the economic value of exporting natural gas and oil, we can come to what we call a solution. The solution is to take a very small percentage of the production or the export of natural gas, LNG, and oil and require that it be exported, transported, on Americanbuilt ships, American flagged, with American mariners. We call this the Energizing American Shipbuilding Act. It was introduced yesterday, and we announced it in a press conference earlier today. Joining me at that press conference was Senator ROGER WICKER , who will be carrying the bill on the Senate side; the chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, DUNCAN HUNTER ; a member of the Committee on Armed Services, DONALD  NORCROSS ; and a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure’s Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, ALANLOWENTHAL ; together with members of the industry: the Shipbuilders Council, VT Halter Marine out of Mississippi, the representatives of the maritime unions that work on the ships and unions that work in the shipyards. We are prepared to move this bill. Let me tell you what it will do if we are successful in passing the Energizing American Shipbuilding Act. What we will do and what America will do is build ships once again. It is anticipated that, if we start with 1 percent of the LNG that is exported, over the next 15 to 20 years we will build some 23 LNG ships. If we ramp that up to a full 15 percent, we will be building those LNG carriers. Similarly, if we begin at a very small percentage of the oil that is exported, we will build another 30 LNG tankers. In the course of some 15 to 20 years, we will be able to build some 50 ships in American shipyards, providing thousands of jobs not only in the shipyards but in the supply of engines, pumps, pipes, electronic equipment, and fittings of all kinds. And, of course, the steel industry that would be providing the steel for 
these ships would also be playing a major part. Now, do keep in mind that this is a very, very small part of the total number of LNG vessels that are going to be needed. It is anticipated that just to supply the necessary transport for American LNG some 225 LNG vessels would be built. We would be looking at a very small percentage of those that would be built here in the United States. Nonetheless, that would represent a major part and a major opportunity for the American shipbuilding industry. Similarly, for the export of oil, that would similarly build ships here throughout the shipyards of the United States. Exactly how many? Well, we will have to figure that out as it goes on. If we really ramp up the amount of oil and natural gas that we export, perhaps we will build more than 50. But it also means that the mariners will be able to work on these ships. As they work on these particular ships, the LNG and the oil tankers will be developing the skills necessary to transfer over to provide the personnel necessary for the military on the cargo ships, the rollon and rolloffs, as well as the oil tankers that the military will need as it transports the personnel and the equipment around the world. So this is what we are trying to do. We are trying to energize the American shipbuilding industry by requiring that a small percentage of the LNG that will be exported from the United States and the oil that will be exported will be on Americanbuilt ships with American mariners. That is our goal. I believe that we will be able to accomplish this in the days ahead, as we move this thing through the process and get it under way. We have very strong, bipartisan support, both Democrats and Republicans supporting the bill. We also have very strong bicameral support, with the bill being introduced in the Senate by Senator R OGER  WICKER and here in the House by myself and by Chairman DUNCAN HUNTER . So I bring this to the attention of the Congress and the American public, that it is our goal to make it in America, that there is a better deal for America if we pass a law that requires that this strategic national asset, oil and natural gas, be on an equally strategic important asset, American ships, and that those ships be manned by American sailors and officers. That is our goal. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
