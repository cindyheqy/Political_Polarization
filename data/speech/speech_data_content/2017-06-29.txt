Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, Members on both sides of the aisle have offered their share of passionate words about the GOP healthcare bill. And as can happen, the debate has been deeply polarized here, leaving Americans to wonder sometimes whether the facts get obstructed by the politics of the day. So I want to take a minute and share what some experts have had to say about the Republican healthcare proposal. These are not politicians; far from it. These words come from folks who operate outside the walls of Washington’s halls and have dedicated themselves to fighting for those struggling with mental illness. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the Republican healthcare plan will ‘‘force people with mental illness out of work, onto the streets, and into jails and emergency rooms.’’ The legislation ‘‘shows dangerous disregard for the wellbeing of people with substance use disorders and their families and erases decades of progress,’’ says the Association for Addiction Professionals. Mental Health America tells us that this bill ‘‘will ultimately do significant harm to people with all chronic conditions, including mental illness, while increasing the cost of healthcare to everyone.’’ The National Association for Rural Mental Health agrees, saying, ‘‘these actions will leave millions of Americans with serious mental health and substance use conditions without life sustaining and essential health insurance coverage, especially at a time when the Nation is suffering from the largest opioid epidemic in history.’’ In short, this bill would be, according to the American Psychiatric Association, ‘‘particularly devastating to the millions of Americans in need of mental health and substance use treatment.’’ Mr. Speaker, these groups are not political organizations. They are doctors; they are healthcare professionals; they are patients; they are advocates who have dedicated their lives day and night to filling the gaps of a badly broken mental health system. Take it from them. This is what TrumpCare is offering our country. This is what they are trying to sell us at a time when we are losing nearly 100 Americans a day to an opioid epidemic. This is what is being negotiated behind closed doors as we speak while the rest of us read reports that tell us that the death toll from opioids could reach well over half a million people in the next decade. So let me be clear: You cannot advocate for comprehensive mental health reform and then stand on the opposite side of nearly every major mental health organization in this country. You cannot claim to be a champion for those suffering from mental illness and then support a bill that guts funding for Medicaid, which is the largest payer of mental healthcare in this country. You cannot say that you are committed to addressing the opioid epidemic and then stand behind a piece of legislation that gives insurance companies cover to deny those patients addiction treatment and to tell those in the grips of addiction to summon just a little more will. You have to choose: With these families or with this bill? Which side are you on? f 
JULY AS PARKS AND RECREATION MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I introduced a resolution with Congresswoman NIKI TSONGAS to designate July as Parks and Recreation Month. It is a fitting time to celebrate our Federal, State, and local parks and recreation systems as so many start this summer season by visiting these facilities that are available within our communities or even a short commute. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 406 recognizes the important role that public parks, recreation facilities, and activities plays in the lives of Americans and the 
contributions of employees and volunteers who work daily to maintain public parks across the Nation. As a lifelong resident of rural Pennsylvania and an avid outdoorsman, I strongly support our Nation’s parks and recreation facilities. Our parks provide countless recreational and educational opportunities for individuals and families to engage in the outdoors. This resolution simply recognizes and supports Parks and Recreation Month and the many benefits, including health benefits, that a healthy active lifestyle contributes in our park settings that is provided to all Americans. Our parks generate opportunities for people to come together and experience a sense of community. They pay dividends to communities by attracting businesses and jobs and increasing housing values. In the United States, public park operations and capital spending generates nearly $140 million in economic activity annually. Ninety percent of people in the United States agree that public park recreation activities and facilities are important government services, a figure that displays a base of support that spans across all people in the country regardless of race, income, gender, or political party affiliation. Nearly 75 percent of Americans agree that it is important to ensure all members of their community have equitable access to public parks and recreation facilities. The most economically sound communities are those with ample and healthy public parks and recreation facilities and activities. In fact, a key factor in business expansion and location decisions is the quality of life for employees, with a premium placed on adequate and accessible public parks and open space. Mr. Speaker, public parks and recreation facilities foster a variety of activity that also contribute to a healthier society. People who use public parks and open spaces are three times more likely to achieve recommended levels of physical activity than nonusers. Americans living within a 10minute walk of a park have a higher level of physical activity and lower rates of obesity. Recreation programs at public parks provide children with a safe place to play, access to healthy foods, opportunities to be physically active, and enrichment facilities that help prevent atrisk behavior such as drug abuse and gang involvement. Mr. Speaker, as our Nation celebrates Independence Day next week, scores of Americans will visit public parks and recreation facilities to spend time outdoors with family, friends, and neighbors. We are blessed with beautiful outdoor facilities. I wish everyone a safe and happy Fourth of July. Get out and enjoy the parks in your area. CUTS TO MEDICAID The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. CARBAJAL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of children and adults living with disabilities across the United States. The cuts to Medicaid outlined in the dangerous Senate healthcare repeal bill will not only result in the loss of healthcare access for millions of Americans, but will also significantly reduce funding for InHome Supportive Services in my home State of California. Medicaid covers 50 percent of the program costs for InHome Supportive Services. These funds provide care for an estimated 531,000 disabled children and seniors throughout California, which permits them to continue to live with dignity in their own home. The $772 billion cut to Medicaid outlined in this bill will have a devastating impact on seniors and people with disabilities who rely on Medicaid as their safety net for necessary long term care services. These cuts will directly affect the lives of my constituents, including 15 yearold Crystal from Santa Maria, California, in my district. Crystal was born with spina bifida, weighing in at just 2 pounds. She has survived under the dedicated care of her mother and grandmother, who are her primary caretakers. Crystal is covered by Medicaid, which allows her to receive specialized medical attention, adaptive medical equipment, physical therapy, and pharmaceuticals. Crystal’s condition requires 24hour care, a need that is fulfilled by the InHome Supportive Services program. Her life is contingent upon this program. I call upon my colleagues in the Senate to vote against this cruel healthcare repeal, also known as TrumpCare, for Crystal and the millions of our constituents like her who are at risk of losing their quality of life. 
PLAYER OF THE YEAR The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Logan Aleshire, a senior at St. Cloud Tech High School, on recently being named the Minnesota High School Class AAA Baseball Player of the Year by the Minnesota State High School Baseball Coaches Association. Logan is a star athlete, and due to his leadership and skills as a pitcher and shortstop, he helped lead his team to an undefeated season in this year’s State tournament. Logan excelled on the field this year, but we have known about him for a while. In fact, he has been a threetime AllCentral Lakes Conference pick, and just last year he was a Times Baseball AllArea Team selection. While his high school baseball career is coming to a close, I have no doubt we will see great things from this young man both athletically and scholastically in the future. We look forward to seeing what he will accomplish next. A FARM FAMILY TO CELEBRATE  
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Kreitlow and Ford family on being recently named the 2017 Farm Family of the Year. Built in 1898, the Kreitlow farm has been passed from generation to generation for more than a century, with each generation teaching the next about hard work and successful farming. Today, the Kreitlow farm is successfully operated by Willard Kreitlow, his daughter Marienne, and her husband Jerry Ford. The farm was once a dairy operation, but since 1990, the farm has mainly become a vegetable and pasture operation. However, the work the Kreitlow and Ford family has accomplished goes far beyond the fresh produce they harvest. In fact, this hardworking family goes above and beyond by striving to educate others through their work with the Sustainable Farming Association of Minnesota. I want to thank the Kreitlow and Ford family for not only providing quality food for Minnesotans, but also for educating others about the benefits of sustainable farming and giving back to their community. Our State is a healthier place because of their dedicated work. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the United Way of Central Minnesota for helping families throughout our communities escape poverty for an incredible 50 years. Over the past half century, the United Way of Central Minnesota has raised more than $100 million, allowing them to help fund other nonprofits who provide services that help Minnesota families in need. It is largely because of the generous contributions from the United Way of Central Minnesota that the Boys and Girls Club of Central Minnesota was able to get off the ground in the 1970s and to be able to grow into what it is today. Thankfully, the United Way of Central Minnesota continues to grow strong. In fact, they recently announced their latest partnership with the St. Cloud School District to create neighborhood resource centers for students and their families. It is inspiring to see an organization solely devoted to helping others. Sometimes when someone is down on their luck, all it takes is a helping hand to get them back on their feet. On behalf of thousands of Minnesotans, I would like to thank the United Way of Central Minnesota for being that helping hand for the past 50 years, and we look forward to many successful years to come. 
b1015 GUN VIOLENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, in the 4 years that I have been privileged to represent the remarkable people and amazing communities of Illinois’ Second Congressional District, I have come to this floor many times to urge action. I have called for a budget that invests in jobs, farmers, and rural communities. I have called for action to address the trilliondollar student debt crisis. I have called for real solutions that make healthcare affordable for all American families. I have spoken on many issues facing this House, but nothing I have spoken on is more important than protecting American lives. I have begged for commonsense reforms that prevent children from being shot while playing at a playground. I have begged; I have pleaded; I have screamed; I have cried; and I have even ground the people’s House to a halt with last year’s historic sitin. What answer was I given? Was I given answers to take home to grieving mothers and police widows? Was I able to tell them that their loved one’s death wasn’t in vain and that we were going to do something to save the next life? No. I was met with silence, and worse, an active effort to silence my voice and the voice of millions of Americans. So I ask myself: Why? What is the issue? Why can’t I, an elected Representative of the American people who draws my authority directly from the United States Constitution, get something done to save lives? Why can’t we get a vote on commonsense, lifesaving legislation that is supported by 90 percent of Americans and more than 70 percent of NRA members? Mr. Speaker, tragically, the answer is simple. It is greed. Mr. Speaker, what is the cost of your inaction? It seems that $5,950 you took from the NRA matters more to you than the 7,490 Americans we have already lost this year to gun violence. Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve to know that just 79 cents for an American life is the cost of your silence and inaction. Well, Mr. Speaker, it might be easy for you to ignore the connection between those dollars and the lives lost, but I cannot—and I will not—ignore it. I will not let you ignore or forget it either. I am going to stand here and remind you, remind the people of Wisconsin’s First District, and remind all Americans that money matters more to you than these American lives. One dollar— one name. One dollar—one grieving family. One dollar—one lost American: One dollar—Xavier Joy, 23, was a success story. He was playing football at Morehouse, was an AmeriCorps volunteer, and wanted to change Chicago for the better; Two dollars—Blair Holt, 16, was killed shielding his friend on a CTA bus; Three dollars—Hadiya Pendleton, 15, killed just weeks after performing at President Obama’s inauguration. While Chicago might make headlines, gun violence is killing people in every community, in every city, and in every town, including Wisconsin’s First District. Four dollars—Paramjit Kaur, 41, killed while trying to pray; Five dollars—Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65, killed at the temple he founded; Six dollars—Prakash Singh, 39, a reader at his temple; Seven dollars—Sita Singh, 41, killed by a White nationalist for wearing a turban; Eight dollars—Ranjit Singh, 49, murdered at his church; Nine dollars—Suveg Singh, 84, killed while expressing his love for his God; 10 dollars—Harry Canady, Jr., 20, killed sitting on a porch in Racine; 11 dollars—Sean Bialas, 23, of Kenosha, shot and killed while physically unable to defend himself; 12 dollars—David Bauspies, 36, of McHenry, accidently shot and killed in East Troy; 13 dollars—Jose Torres, 36, murdered on the 1600 block of Holmes Avenue in Racine; 14 dollars—Nicholas Chaulkin, 17, of Racine, killed by a domestic abuser, likely while defending his mother; 15 dollars—David Tilton, 37, of Janesville; 16 dollars—James Norris, 37, was killed at his job as a restaurant delivery driver in Racine; 17 dollars—Jeremy Trawitzki, 38, killed in Muskego; 18 dollars—Thomas Kruse, 41, killed in Muskego; 19 dollars—Joseph Hensel, 27, killed in Elkhorn; 20 dollars—Andrew Jones, Jr., 27, also killed by his friend in Racine; 21 dollars—Maurice Carter was shot and killed in a Racine County robbery; 22 dollars—Carl Nichols, 26, shot and killed by a friend in Kenosha. 
AMERICA: LAND OF OPPORTUNITY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. COSTELLO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, one thing that we can all agree on is that America is the land of opportunity. Our beautiful country has remarkable stories about those young and old, who, through adversity, have gone on to achieve great things. Those human stories are often the best way for us to demonstrate why our country is so special. I would like to share two stories with you this morning. Emily Torchiana recently visited my office while she was here in Washington, D.C., after being chosen for a Jefferson Award for community service. Just last week, she was also awarded the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Award for Public Service. Emily is from Collegeville, in my congressional district, and, after her own experience with severe cyberbullying led to a suicide attempt, she began telling her story. Emily found people would reach out to her after each speech to share their own experiences and thank her for being so open with her journey. She is now the founder of a nonprofit focused on mental health advocacy, awareness, and services. Emily’s nonprofit supports mental health workshops in schools as well as workshops for parents and teachers so adults can learn how to support children and young adults suffering from mental illness. The mission statement of Emily’s nonprofit includes working to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health, something I believe is a critical aspect for us all as we continue to develop and advance solutions for those facing mental illness. Quoting from Emily’s nonprofit website, she writes: ‘‘My hope is that the more people who will open up about their struggles, the more others will feel comfortable reaching out for help. . . . Unlike physical illnesses, these mental illnesses are not seen, but that does not mean they are not there. I hope this will give us all the opportunity to walk briefly in the shoes of the fellow human beings we come across every day.’’ Emily’s work is an inspiration to us all. Congratulations, Emily, for being recognized for your outstanding service to communities across our country, and we wish you the best of luck with your career. Ammar AlRubaiay is another young adult who has an inspiring and remarkable story. A reporter in my congressional district recently shared Ammar’s story with me, and I want to take a moment to share a story about opportunity, hard work, and a young man fulfilling his dreams. A native of Baghdad, Iraq, Ammar became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2015. He was participating in a youth exchange program that transferred him to West Vincent Township, in Pennsylvania’s Sixth Congressional District, where he attended Owen J. Roberts High School and ultimately attended Westtown School. Ammar came face to face with al Qaida before his move. In a column in 2009, journalist Michael Rellahan remembered reading Ammar’s college essay. Mr. Rellahan wrote: ‘‘In striking detail, Ammar recalled the day in June 2007 when he sat in his classroom at the Gifted Students School in his native Baghdad and a teacher came in to announce simply that: ‘They are here—al Qaida.’’ Ammar wrote in his journal: ‘‘At that time, I felt like I was a few minutes away from death, getting closer 
every second. I was scared, but not because I thought that I was going to die. I was scared because I was thinking about what might happen to my family when they heard that I got killed. My dad always told me, ‘Don’t go to school; your life is more important than your education,’ but I never listened, and I always argued with him because I believe that my education was important enough to take the risky chance.’’ The gunman entered the room, looked around, and went away. They stole some cars, but left everyone alive. Ammar recalled: ‘‘Those seconds felt like years; they were the longest seconds in my life.’’ Here is the great part of the story: It is not a story; it is real life. Ammar was granted political asylum, and in 2013, he graduated from Bard College and has since completed medical school, moving on to a career to help others and improve their healthy lives. We should be proud of him and the thousands of other young men and young women every day who are fighting through adversity to achieve, who will go on to make this a greater country than it already is; and it is a reminder to all of us in what is, at times, a very divisive political environment that the reason that we do these jobs is to make sure that we are providing opportunity for the next generation, and it is they who will make our country an even greater place. It is their achievements that are the cornerstone of our country and a great reminder to all of us that we are a special country with special people doing great things every single day. 
GUN VIOLENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ) for 5 minutes. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to associate myself with the comments and remarks of the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ) with regard to being mindful of the deaths from gun violence that plague our communities all across the country, and particularly as the summer has begun, these deaths will continue. Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak today about another kind of gun violence that makes our streets and homes unsafe, and that is the deadly encounters between civilians and police officers. Mr. Speaker, I have wracked my brain trying to understand these deaths. I have grieved with the mothers who have lost their children. I have met with experts and attended roundtables on how to find a way to mitigate these fatal police encounters. Let me tell you, I think I can propose a solution that we can all support, and that is H.R. 3060, the Preventing Tragedies Between Police and Communities Act, which would link law enforcement training on deescalation techniques to receipt of Federal Byrne JAG funds. Now, Mr. Speaker, I certainly wish that I could take full credit for this concept because I think that this legislation would both save civilian lives and police lives; however, this idea is rooted in the Police Executive Research Forum report which both Republicans and Democrats have cited. It was written by police officer peers and by police officer experts. Mr. Speaker, what they found is that police academies require 58 hours of training on how to use a firearm and another 49 hours on other defensive tactics. While they don’t require, they offer 8 voluntary—1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8—8 voluntary hours on how to employ deescalation tactics in crisis intervention. We need to require this deescalation training. This deescalation training curriculum would be to use verbal and physical tactics to avoid escalating the situation, use the lowest level of force as possible and a safe response to identified threats, and be aware of mental health and substance abuse issues and crisis intervention strategies in order to appropriately respond. This training would provide police with the tools they need to prevent violent interactions and save not only their lives, but the lives of civilians, too. We know that kids are out of school and that the tensions in our streets are high. Police are on alert, and far too many of us are distrustful of the police due to the painful and frightful memories of how many deadly encounters have dominated headlines—close to 1,000 in 1 year. How can this Congress recess for the summer and not take up this bill? Yes, the Affordable Care Act is a big issue here before us in Congress, but if you live in communities of color around the country, the immediate healthcare issue for you is being shot by a police officer who has been sworn to protect you. b1030 If you die at age 12, like Tamir Rice, who was shot by police for playing with his sister on a playground in Cleveland, how can you be concerned with Medicaid? If you are killed at 31 years old, like Dontre Hamilton, who was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee, nursing home care is not your priority. You won’t have the good fortune of living that long. I ask my colleagues to prioritize preserving lives by supporting this legislation. 
RECOGNIZING RETIRED COLONEL ROBERT A. ATOR, II The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 5 minutes. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize one of Arkansas’ finest, Colonel Robert A. Ator, II, of Little Rock. A veteran of the United States Air Force, Colonel Ator retired on June 3, 2017, after proudly serving our country for 28 years. Before joining the Arkansas National Guard, Colonel Ator served 11 years on Active Duty with the United States Air Force. He is a veteran of several major combat operations, including Operation Desert Shield, Operation Desert Storm, Operation Provide Comfort, Operation Provide Promise, Operation Joint Forge, and Operation Noble Eagle. Ator is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, where he married Michelle, his wife of 28 years, just 3 days after graduation. Today, his son, Cadet Third Class Robert A. Ator, III, is a sophomore. Colonel Ator is the recipient of numerous awards and medals, including the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, the Air Medal, the Aerial Achievement Medal with one oak leaf cluster, and the Air Force Commendation Medal with one oak leaf cluster. Colonel Ator is an example that all Arkansans and Americans can admire. I wish him and his family the very best in their future endeavors. SALINE COUNTY CAREER AND TECHNICAL  
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the proposed plans for a career and technical education center in my district. Lamont Cornwell of the Saline County Economic Development Corporation presented detailed plans to the Arkansas Economic Development Commission on June 8 for a center that is specifically aimed at training our State’s skilled workforce community. The center would allow students to enroll in science and technology career preparatory classes, careers that will only become more invaluable as our Nation moves forward. The center will impact parents and children of all socioeconomic statuses and positively change our technical career education environment in central Arkansas. As cochair of the Congressional Skilled American Workforce Caucus, I was encouraged to see the recent passage of H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education Act. I am encouraged to see leaders in Saline County step up and embrace a passion for our skilled workforce community. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the importance of foster families around Arkansas and the organizations dedicated to their recruitment. According to recent Arkansas data, the number of foster youths has outpaced the number of spaces available in foster homes by 1,283. Many families have already stepped up to the plate to provide a loving home for children in the foster system. One such family, Andrew and Amy Baker of Searcy, Arkansas, was recently named Foster Family of the Year by our State’s Division of Children and Family Services for their 
dedicated efforts to reunify foster children with their biological parents. In addition, there are organizations around our State that have been at the forefront of recruitment efforts for foster families, including 50 families in the month of April alone. One such organization is entitled The CALL, locally directed by Lauri Currier, who notes that a stable, loving home can make a huge difference in a child’s life, specifically with regard to escaping the grasp of neglect and abuse. Today I want to emphasize Ms. Currier’s statement that if one family from each of the 6,000 churches around Arkansas came forward to adopt, no more children would ever be waiting for a forever family. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a handson mentorship program in my district created through a partnership between the Bryant Police Department and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Bryant. The summer program entitled ‘‘Fishing with a Hero’’ pairs Boys and Girls Clubs students with local police heroes to bond over the longstanding, joyful pastime of fishing. Through a 2day fishing instruction program, local police officers are able to build quality mentoring relationships with students in traditionally underserved or impoverished communities. Along with being one of the students’ favorite programs, the established relationships aid in creating longterm bonds between our law enforcement officers and local youth. The stability and prosperity of our local communities hinges on mutual respect between our citizens and our law enforcement officers. The creation of genuine relationships at a young age ensures the longevity of that important respect. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the recent selfless actions of two extraordinary individuals in the Second Congressional District of Arkansas, Robin Creole and Danny Revis. Both men work tirelessly in the Benton School District transportation program. 
MEDICAID IS A LIFELINE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, how many of us here have had an aging parent, a grandparent, an aunt or uncle who could no longer stay in their home alone? Seniors with Alzheimer’s, dementia, and other special needs, someone to watch over them at home so they don’t get lost or injure themselves or leave the stove on and injure others? Seniors with Parkinson’s who need help to walk, to move, to get out of their chair, seniors too frail to care for themselves, or need longterm rehabilitation after a fall and an injured hip or an injured femur? How many of us have worried about where they would live and how they would get the care that they need? And oftentimes, the real question is: How are they going to pay for that care? Most people work their entire lives, save for retirement, pay into the system, yet still find themselves struggling to afford the care that they need. Both parents in middle class families have to work to barely make ends meet; no money and nobody home to care for their parents or grandparents. I understand the tough decision. You want to keep your loved one close, you want to care for them yourself, but you have to work and make ends meet to barely keep going. That is why most of the 1.4 million people across the country living in nursing homes rely on Medicaid. For Americans in nursing homes, Medicaid is a lifeline. That is why TrumpCare’s Medicaid cuts would devastate our Nation’s seniors, leaving the 64 percent of nursing home residents who depend on Medicaid out in the cold. In fact, nursing homes account for 42 percent of Medicaid spending. Under TrumpCare, many seniors will lose their nursing home care, grandmothers with disabilities would find it harder to be cared for, harder to walk, harder to eat, harder to bathe. Nursing homes give patients a safe and caring place to recuperate when they are weakened by disabilities but don’t need to be in a hospital, and they provide families peace of mind knowing that their loved one has a safe and caring place to get aroundtheclock care. That is why we must stop TrumpCare. We cannot allow these deep cuts to Medicaid threaten the health of our seniors. We cannot rip these services away from the most vulnerable among us. We must put seniors first. We must give voice to vulnerable seniors. Let’s put people above partisanship, and solutions above ideology. I oppose TrumpCare, and I will continue to fight to protect care for seniors and for all Americans. f 
RECOGNIZING RON AND DIANE WITHEM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two lifelong servants from the State of Nebraska, former Speaker of Legislature Ron Withem and his wife, Diane. Speaker Withem is retiring this month from 2 decades with the University of Nebraska, where he has served as the associate vice president for university affairs and the director of governmental relations. As we see the end of one’s historic career, we are reminded of the positive impact one person can have on so many. Ron and Diane Withem have selflessly dedicated their lives to the State of Nebraska both in educating our youth as well as through the legislative process. The impact they have made on the entire State of Nebraska is evident all around us in Nebraska. The story of the Withems is one full of many accomplishments. After moving to Papillion, Ron and Diane both became respected teachers in our local school district. Prior to entering politics, Ron was a teacher of history. Diane spent nearly 4 decades teaching in the PapillionLaVista schools and prepared many students for college and success, including my own chief of staff, Mark Dreiling. As leaders in our Democratic Party, Diane and Ron’s political journey began in 1976, when they campaigned for Hess Dyas during the U.S. Senate primary. Later that year, they both worked for another former Second District Congressman, John Cavanagh, in the general election. Following Congressman Cavanagh’s victory, Ron served as a congressional aide in his local office. By the 1980s, Ron was a member of the PapillionLaVista School Board and was a member of the Papillion Planning Commission. When the legislative seat in District 14 became vacant in 1983, Ron was tapped by Governor Bob Kerry to serve out the term. And serve he did. Ron Withem dedicated 14 years of his life in our legislature, serving as the chairperson of the Urban Affairs Committee, the chairperson of the Education Committee, and the high mark being his election as the first Democratic speaker since 1970, which happened in a Republicanmajority body of our officially nonpartisan legislature. During that time, he rose to become one of the most wellrespected voices in our unicameral, proudly working on issues that he was passionate about and that would have had a profound impact on our State. Some of his accomplishments are easily visible, such as the Harrison Street Interstate Exchange. Working alongside local elected officials and business leaders, Ron’s strong advocacy paved the way for what is now one of our most vibrant areas in the district. A leader among leaders, Ron was instrumental in sponsoring and guiding many other important pieces of legislation into law. He negotiated the State’s first major reform in K–12 educational funding, sponsored legislation granting tuition waivers for veterans’ dependents, led efforts to improve accessibility and the transparency of our elections, and he worked to create Nebraska’s first bone marrow drive system. Through his years in public office, he was wellrespected by both his colleagues as well as his constituents. Ron was known for his uncanny ability to remember bill numbers, the year a bill was discussed, and even the most 
minute details surrounding the debate. As his former aide, Michelle Waite, said: ‘‘He might be a donkey, but Ron had the memory of an elephant for sure.’’ He was considered a master legislative strategist who knew how to pull together a coalition from both parties to get the people’s business done. After 14 years of serving in the legislature, Ron went to work for the University of Nebraska. During his tenure, he made a tremendous impact on our State by leading the university’s legislative relations strategy. He also was the force behind the Building a Healthier Nebraska legislative initiative. The result of this initiative was a new cancer center, veterinary diagnostic center, and a health sciences center facility. Ron was one of the architects behind the compromise that transferred the Nebraska State fairgrounds to the University of Nebraska for the development of the Nebraska Innovation Campus. This publicprivate partnership leverages university research for economic benefit, all the while preserving some of the history of our State fairgrounds. His colleagues at the university talk about their tremendous respect for Ron. He was known for building quality relationships with others and his ability to meet daily challenges with positivity. Ron once said: ‘‘My goal is to communicate to policymakers the enormous value the University of Nebraska brings to the State and its people.’’ His passion for the university and the success of Nebraska’s youth motivated him to work in higher education State relations. His achievements in higher education State relations did not go unnoticed. At the Higher Education Government Relations Conference in 2013, Ron was awarded the Marvin D. ‘‘Swede’’ Johnson Achievement Award, a very prestigious national level award. As a fellow citizen of Papillion, I want to thank both Ron and Diane Withem for their positive impact that they have made serving our community and our State. 
ANTIDEFAMATION LEAGUE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible work of the AntiDefamation League, or ADL. The founder of this uplifting organization, Sigmund Livingston, envisioned an America where we all are created and treated equally. This is an objective that remains everrelevant in today’s America. Through programming in schools, the ADL creates dialogue to educate and prepare students to fight back against hate and confront discrimination wherever it may exist. In addition, the ADL works to bring individuals together to build understanding. b1045 I have had the pleasure of meeting a special person, Rabbi Gruenberg, a leader in Congregation Beth El, in my community, as well as the Philadelphia ADL, earlier this year. I am proud to stand with my neighbors, advocates, and elected officials of every stripe to reaffirm that there is no room for hate or discrimination in any of our communities. The work of the AntiDefamation League must continue and expand, because the only way we can end senseless hate is by building bridges and engaging with people we may perceive as being different from ourselves. Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the ADL for the incredibly important work they are doing. I stand with them, as should everyone in this Chamber. f 
SANCTUARY CITIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, finally, this week, we are taking up two pieces of legislation that will address a huge problem in my home State of California for a long time. As California moves more and more towards becoming a sanctuary State, already having several sanctuary cities, H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 move in the right direction toward law and order and what people expect from their government in providing for the public safety. We go back to the story of two Californians I can think of off the top of my head immediately, Kate Steinle and Jamiel Shaw, Jr., taken needlessly by people who shouldn’t have even been in the country. They were illegal immigrants who were allowed to slip through the system and cause the death of both of those fine young people in California. Juan Sanchez was an illegal immigrant with a record of seven felonies. He had been caught and deported not once, not twice, by five times. He should not have been on the streets of California. But on July 1, he was roaming around free in San Francisco. He stole a gun out of a Federal officer’s car, fired shots in public, and shot Kate Steinle in the back. San Francisco is a socalled sanctuary city, but it was not a sanctuary city for Kate Steinle. By shielding illegal immigrants from Federal authorities, sanctuary cities are disobeying the law. These actions have fatal consequences, as Kate Steinle and her family found out. Action we take this week on H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law, will toughen the punishment for illegal immigrants who reenter the country. The second bill, H.R. 3003, No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, cracks down on sanctuary cities, protects the public from dangerous criminals, and sends a message that if you are not with us in enforcing the law, then you are not going to receive funding or other help from the Federal Government. I think that is finally the right message coming out of Washington, D.C., for those who don’t uphold the laws and see to the first duty of government, which is to protect and stand up for the safety of its citizens. f 
HONORING AL ST. LAWRENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the SavannahChatham Metro Police Department’s construction of its newest training facility, which memorializes longtime Sheriff Al St. Lawrence. After 21 years of service as an officer, St. Lawrence ran for Chatham County Sheriff in 1992. Because of his outstanding service to our community, his constituents reelected him five times. He held this position until he passed away on November 25, 2015. Sheriff St. Lawrence was also responsible for overseeing the significant renovation of the county jail, which ultimately added an additional 400,000 square feet to the facility and doubled inmate occupancy. Remembering Sheriff St. Lawrence’s dedication to training personnel, the Chatham County Police Department developed the Al St. Lawrence Recruitment and Training Range. This range will not only provide effective training resources to officers but will also house the Sheriff’s Office Internal Affairs Division and the U.S. Marshals Service. The facility is located on 10 acres of property at the Chatham County Sheriff’s Office and includes several training ranges, including cable ranges, steel target ranges, and a Rogers Range, which improves an officer’s aim when discharging a firearm. Twice a month, the facility will also host a civilian gun class, which is open to the public. Educating the public on firearm safety will reduce the risk of accidental deaths from the misuse of guns. Sheriff St. Lawrence’s enduring service will forever be etched in the history of Chatham County, and his contributions will ensure that Chatham County will remain a safe, thriving community for years to come. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our electric linemen, the men and women who ensure our lights stay shining every day. In Georgia, electric utility companies have started a movement to recognize the hard work linemen do every day. Companies such as Georgia Power and MEAG Power celebrate their workers, who make modern living possible. Without linemen, we would not have many of the things we have grown accustomed to using. Air conditioning, refrigerators, warm showers, entertainment devices, and plenty more, are all 
things we would have to learn to live without. It is easy to take these services for granted, but it is important to remember the people who make it all possible. Earlier this year, we witnessed the valuable and honorable service these individuals provide when severe thunderstorms and tornadoes tore through Georgia over 3 days. Homes and businesses were destroyed and thousands of citizens were left in the dark. Crews of linemen all across the State joined together and selflessly worked for 2 weeks until every light was back on. It is our duty not to overlook the workers and services that make our lives easier. I want to take this time and sincerely thank not just linemen in Georgia, but all linemen across the Nation, for powering the life inside our homes. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER Bishop Stephen E. Blaire, Diocese of Stockton, Stockton, California, offered the following prayer: O God, in this House, many words are spoken just as in our houses of worship. Grant us, O Lord, the wisdom to speak words that will always be edifying—to build up our Nation as a people. Let our words not only denounce war, violence, and injustices, but promote all that is necessary for building genuine peace through right relationships. Let our words not only condemn exploitation, racism, and abuses of wealth, but demonstrate that the cries of the poor and excluded have been heard. Let our words promote building just systems that ensure the common good and protect the inherent dignity of every human life. Let our words not only lament environmental degradation but promote all that is necessary for respecting the Earth as our common home. Lord God, grant that our words will always build ‘‘one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.’’ Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. BROWN of Maryland led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING BISHOP STEPHEN E. BLAIRE The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCNERNEY ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to be joined by a special guest from my district, Bishop Stephen Blaire, who had the privilege of leading us in our opening prayer. Bishop Blaire oversees the Diocese of Stockton, and he was appointed by Pope John Paul II in 1999, becoming the fifth Bishop of Stockton. Throughout his career, he has been a staunch advocate for workers’ rights, commonsense legislation to reduce gun violence, and has promoted and worked towards social justice gains. As a newly appointed bishop, he followed in the footsteps of his predecessor, continuing to address the needs of Spanishspeaking parishioners by bringing more Spanishspeaking priests to the diocese and maintaining the ministry to migrant workers. I want to leave Members with some words of wisdom from Bishop Blaire that I believe we can all take to heart as we head into the Fourth of July holiday. When he was appointed Bishop of Stockton, he said that his vision was to build a church that was strong in faith but also strong in service to the community. As we head home to celebrate the birth of our Nation, let us remember that, as Members of Congress, our job is to build a government the American people have faith in because of our commitment to serving their needs. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, every day there are more stories about the Affordable Care Act’s, or ObamaCare’s, ongoing collapse. Insurers have been dropping out of the ACA’s markets for 3 years now. It is estimated that two out of every five, or 40 percent, of all counties in the country will have only one insurer on the exchanges, and many markets may soon have none at all. The House passed compromise legislation to provide the American people, especially those in the individual market, with more flexibility and choice and fewer Washington mandates, all while putting Medicaid, a critical safety net program, on a sustainable path. Critics of this legislation have responded with hyperbolic, irresponsible rhetoric, and no solutions, other than higher taxes, more spending, and more Washington control. Some ACA defenders are actually calling for a singlepayer system, which would result in unbearably high taxes, even tighter grips from Washington, and unsustainable spending. It would destroy innovation, create scarcity, degrade quality, and drive up costs. Even the liberal California legislator seems to have abandoned the singlepayer fantasy this week. Instead of careening toward single payer, let’s keep the promises we made to repeal and replace ObamaCare and meet the expectations of those who sent us here. f 
DEMOCRACY AND AUTONOMY FOR HONG KONG (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on July 1, 1997, Britain transferred sovereignty over Hong Kong to China. Under a ‘‘one country, two systems’’ arrangement with London, Beijing promised to allow universal suffrage as an ultimate aim, along with other freedoms. But 20 years later, that promise remains unfilled. Last March, a new chief executive was elected, not by the people of Hong Kong, but by a committee whose members have close ties to the Chinese Government. Human rights groups have documented an erosion of press freedom and growing threats to judicial independence. Hong Kong’s freedoms are at grave risk. This Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit Hong Kong to mark the 20th anniversary of the handover. Some protesters have already been detained, including Joshua Wong, who I have met, and newly elected legislator, Nathan Law. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of this Chamber to hold China to its word and speak out in support of democracy and autonomy for Hong Kong. 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION (Mr. DESJARLAIS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DESJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, today I want to address illegal immigration and what House Republicans are doing to ensure Americans’ safety. This week, we voted to defund sanctuary cities that harbor criminals like the man who murdered Kate Steinle in San Francisco. My heart goes out to her parents and families around the country who have lost loved ones to foreign nationals who should have never been in this country in the first place. We passed Kate’s Law to increase penalties on previously deported illegal immigrants. Also, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act would defund sanctuary cities and prevent lawsuits against local governments that follow Federal law. Shockingly, Nashville, in my home State of Tennessee, has been considering a sanctuary bill, even though murders this year already outnumber last year’s total. Some on the city council want Nashville to become a magnet for violent gangs that transport drugs and human beings. Sanctuary policies endanger not only San Francisco or Nashville but the entire U.S. President Trump is cracking down on immigration crime. Illegal border crossings are down, and arrests and deportations of criminal aliens are up, just as Americans demanded last November. Here in the House, we are keeping our promises and our country safe. 
COMMUNITYBASED POLICING EFFORTS VITAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3003, a partisan bill that seeks to punish socalled sanctuary cities, strikes at the heart of community based policing efforts vital to public safety. Under this bill, States and counties where local police focus on community priorities rather than immigration enforcement would be punished, losing millions of dollars that could be used to build up communities, improve our Nation’s infrastructure, and strengthen local government. Moreover, this bill would jeopardize public safety by discouraging people from trusting law enforcement, sharing information, or reporting crime. Across the country, most police chiefs have expressed serious concerns about policies that may lead to racial profiling or requiring their officers to break up families. They have said that immigration enforcement should remain a Federal responsibility. Instead of forcing local police to act as immigration officers, we should work on passing comprehensive immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship for aspiring Americans. And if we truly want to makes the streets of America safer, Congress should act to strengthen bonds between community and police, invest in mental health and substance abuse services, reduce gun violence, and reform the criminal justice system. f 
TRIBUTE TO STAFF SERGEANT HENRY J. NYKAMP (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Staff Sergeant Henry J. Nykamp of Milford, New Jersey. This July, Sergeant Nykamp will be awarded the French Legion of Honour, normally reserved for French nationals. However, other nationals who have aided France or promoted its ideals can receive the recognition as well. Due to Sergeant Nykamp’s tremendous dedication to the allied cause in World War II, from June of 1943 to October of 1945, there is no one more deserving of the honor. During World War II, Sergeant Nykamp was stationed in Hardwick, England, where he flew 35 missions as a B–25 nose gunner. Some of Sergeant Nykamp’s most important operations involved lowlevel flying in support of ground forces during the Battle of the Bulge. He was awarded four Bronze Stars and five Air Medals. Sergeant Nykamp’s is a story of great sacrifice and courage. Mission after mission, flight after flight, he answered the call of duty. He entered World War II at one of the world’s darkest hours and did not rest until the struggle was over and the forces of right had prevailed. I am pleased that France is recognizing Sergeant Nykamp for his role in its liberation, and I also thank him for his tremendous service not only to the United States but to the allied cause. 
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IS RESPONSIBILITY OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3003. This bill before the Chamber today, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, is another attack on the immigration communities and communities of color in my home State of Texas and communities throughout the country. This misguided legislation would strip critical Federal funding for our local police agencies, such as COPS grants, that do not comply with Federal immigration detainers. Doing so would only undermine the public safety in our communities in Houston and Harris County. Our local law enforcement officers for Houston Police Department and Harris County sheriffs are responsible for protecting the people of our great city and county and upholding our local laws. They are not, nor should they be, de facto Federal immigration agents. The U.S. Constitution is clear that immigration enforcement is the responsibility of the Federal Government and not the States or local governments. To require local police officers to enforce Federal immigration law would not only violate our 200year tradition of federalism but will tear apart the local trust our police and sheriffs have built with the immigrant community and communities of color over the years. I ask my colleagues to let our local law enforcement protect our families and our homes and not be immigration agents. f 
SANCTUARY CITIES UNDERMINE FEDERAL LAW (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, let’s be clear. Socalled sanctuary cities have become a safe haven for illegal immigrants who have committed crimes. They undermine Federal law and put the safety of lawabiding citizens at risk. Kate Steinle was murdered in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant who had seven felonies and had been deported five times. Where was Kate’s sanctuary? We are a country of laws, and we must enforce them and hold accountable anyone who violates them. Sarah Root was killed by an illegal immigrant, street racing drunk. Grant Ronnebeck was murdered in cold blood by working the nightshift at a convenience store. Mr. Speaker, no family should ever have to go through what these families have faced. Kate’s Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act will help protect our communities and help protect families from these senseless and preventable tragedies. 
COMBATING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, most Americans get it. Frankly, it is just common sense. We can’t continue to reward folks who come to our country illegally while those who work hard and play by the rules struggle to get ahead. It is way past time to fix our broken immigration policies in America. Today, the House is considering two commonsense reforms to combat illegal immigration, restore rule of law, and protect public safety. 
The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act defunds sanctuary cities and cracks down on dangerous sanctuary city policies that shield criminal investigations from Federal immigration enforcement and puts American citizens at risk. Kate’s Law increases penalties for deported felons who return to America and commit further crimes. Kate’s Law was named after a young woman who was tragically gunned down by a fivetime deported felon nearly 2 years ago to this day. It is outrageous. The Federal Government’s first duty is to protect its citizens. I urge my colleagues to support these muchneeded reforms and then do more to stop illegal immigration in the United States. 
b1215 HONORING THE LIFE OF EMIL FRANZI (Ms. MCSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Emil Franzi, a dear friend and a legend in our southern Arizona community. Born on the Fourth of July, Emil Franzi was a patriot and outspoken conservative commentator, political strategist, columnist, and talk show host who had an encyclopedic knowledge of local politics. Franzi’s radio career spanned three decades, and he was host for the ‘‘Inside Track.’’ His passing marks the end of an era. Franzi loved classical opera, guns, and the old west. He worked to preserve local western heritage through his ‘‘Voices of the West’’ radio show. Underneath his curmudgeonly exterior was a soft and charitable heart. Not only did he raise three successful daughters, he also took in a number of youth as a foster parent with his wife, Kathy. Franzi also adopted many stray animals. One of them, here, he named after me: Martha, this 6monthold puppy—one of the highest honors I have received as a fellow dog lover. Emil Franzi passed away on June 7 after battling cancer. He was 78. He left an indelible mark on southern Arizona. I am deeply grateful for Emil’s friendship, advice, and his faithful support. He will be sorely missed. 
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the month of June as National PostTraumatic Stress Awareness Month. Millions of our Nation’s heroes experience posttraumatic stress upon returning home from their service. Invisible wounds like PTS are just as important and worthy of treatment as physical injuries. Seeking help for PTS is not a sign of weakness or defeat, but a show of strength and commitment to a full and healthy life. Treating PTS is not a onesizefits all process either. Our veterans need options to find the treatments that work best for their unique needs. That is why I am proud my legislation, the COVER Act, has been signed into law and will help increase access to evidencebased alternative therapies at the VA. For National PTS Awareness Month, I stand committed to serving our Nation’s heroes and improving their treatment options. f 
HONORING THE ARKANSAS FARM FAMILY OF THE YEAR (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is an extreme honor to note the accomplishment of a hardworking Arkansas Fourth District family. Mark and Shay Morgan and their daughter, Kate, of Clarksville, were named last December as the 2016 Arkansas Farm Family of the Year, and will compete this coming October among nine other State winners to be the 2017 Southeastern Farmer of the Year. The Morgans’ diverse farm is best known for its Peach Pickin’ Paradise which consists of 3,500 peach and nectarine trees on 17 acres. I was fortunate to visit Peach Pickin’ Paradise last fall and sample some of their produce. With peaches making up 60 percent of the farm’s operation, it also consists of 600 acres of hay used for their 300 head of beef cattle. Beyond their hard work on the family farm, the Morgans are a vital part of their local community, participating in a number of organizations that display the hard work ethic they live by. Congratulations to Mark, Shay, and Kate Morgan as they have exhibited exemplary testimony to the American Dream and to the Fourth District of Arkansas. 
RECOGNIZING RAY HECKLER, A TRUE AMERICAN HERO (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true American hero, Ray Heckler, who is being laid to rest in Arlington today with full military honors. Ray began his service to his country as a private in the Army, and retired after 40 years as a command sergeant major in the Illinois National Guard in Urbana. During his time in the Army, he served in Germany, Berlin, Japan, Paris, Africa, Morocco, Casablanca, and Marcel in France. He was awarded the Bronze Star in France for his heroic and praiseworthy service on the field of battle. Remembered by those closest to him as being a helping hand whenever needed, Ray spent time with his community by working to construct and rehabilitate homes through Habitat for Humanity. It is my honor to recognize Mr. Heckler and his devotion to our country. My thoughts and prayers are with his family as they mourn the loss of a truly courageous and selfless man. Rest in peace, Ray Heckler. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF WILLIAM ‘‘RYAN’’ OWENS (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, on January 29, 2017, U.S. Navy Chief Special Warfare Operator William ‘‘Ryan’’ Owens was killed during a raid in Yemen. At the age of 36, he gave the ultimate sacrifice in order to protect our great Nation. He is survived by his wife and three young children. This week I introduced a bill which would rename the Chillicothe, Illinois, post office in honor of Ryan’s life and service as a Navy SEAL. My office and I worked closely with the U.S. Postal Service, the U.S. Navy Congressional Liaison Office, Central Illinois Gold Star Families, and, most importantly, Ryan’s family. All of us were determined to make sure we got this right. His wife ultimately made the decision to name the post office after Ryan in Chillicothe, a town in my district, where Ryan graduated high school. This effort has the backing and bipartisan support of the entire Illinois delegation, and it is our hope that the post office will forever remind the community of their hometown hero and his commitment to serving our country. While we can never fully repay Chief Owens and his family for the sacrifices he made, renaming the post office in his honor is a small effort to thank him for his service and his dedication to protecting America. He and his family are forever in our hearts and prayers. 
WELCOMING SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON JAEIN TO WASHINGTON (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to rise to welcome Moon Jaein of the Republic of Korea to the United States on the occasion of his first visit as President. The United States and the Republic of Korea share a longstanding pivotal defense alliance, and we are bound together as fellow democracies who share common values. 
The U.S.Korea relationship has been a growing partnership, and now they are the United State’s sixth largest trading partner. It is Florida’s third largest export market, and we have over 1,700 Korean Americans in my district. Korea is one of only five U.S. mutual defense allies in Asia, one of only three nations in the region to have completed a bilateral trade agreement with the United States, and hosts a U.S. military presence of nearly 38,000 Americans. The Republic of Korea is our foundational partner in facing the gravest threats to the world’s peace and security, and that is the rogue nuclear regime of Kim Jongun. We will continue to stand together to address this grave threat and maintain our close bilateral relationship. I give my most sincere congratulations to President Moon Jaein on his first electoral victory, and I welcome him warmly to Washington during such an important time. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas) laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3004, KATE’S LAW, AND PROVIDING FOR PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PERIOD FROM JULY 3, 2017, THROUGH JULY 10, 2017 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 415 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. SLAUGHTER ), my dear friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. This rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3004, also known as Kate’s Law. It should be instructive, also, Mr. Speaker, to recognize that H.R. 3004 had a companion bill that we debated on the rule yesterday—not voted on, we will vote on these today—that was a companion bill to this that is a very important bill. These are both effective law enforcement tools that need to be made available not only to protect the people of the United States, but, in particular, people who live in many of the jurisdictions that are being denied that support by effective law enforcement because of political policies that are being instructed by city councils and mayors across the country. Mr. Speaker, on July 1, 2015, Juan Francisco LopezSanchez shot and killed Kate Steinle at Pier 14 in San Francisco, California, while she was walking with her father. Mr. Lopez Sanchez claims that he does not fully recall the murder, as he took strong sleeping pills prior to the incident. Mr. Speaker, this senseless and cowardly murder should never have happened. Mr. LopezSanchez is and was an unlawful criminal alien who had previously been deported five times from the United States of America. b1230 He had numerous felony convictions in the United States of America, including for the possession of heroin and the manufacturing of narcotics in the United States of America. Despite his lengthy history of criminal acts dating back to 1991, Mr. Sanchez was able to illegally reenter the United States again and again and again with minimal consequences, showcasing serious fault lines in one of our systems of deterrence: our border. For years, the lack of immigration enforcement and the spread of dangerous sanctuary policies have failed the American people and cost lives. The death of innocent Americans, such as Kate, Sarah Root, Grant Roanebeck, and too many others across this country, is simply unacceptable. Mr. Speaker, that is why we are here today. The American people have had enough. And I believe Congress has heard from the people, and we have heard enough and had enough. The bottom line is we now have a President, Donald J. Trump, who not only heard this same story as he went around the country running for President, but had a different answer, because I assure you, the major candidates running for President on the Republican and Democratic ticket heard this same content. One person stepped up to the plate. He is now our President: Donald J. Trump. The American people are sick and tired of turning on their TVs or radios or newspapers and seeing yet another senseless murder committed by a previously deported criminal alien. Their deaths are especially devastating since I believe they could have been prevented if our immigration laws had been carefully enforced or we had, really, what I call the national deterrent: the will to stop these senseless acts. Kate’s Law gets close to doing just that. The underlying legislation that the House will be able to vote on in this rule and in the legislation today enhances the current maximum sentences for illegal reentry. The bill raises the maximum sentence for criminal aliens who reenter the United States to between 10 and 25 years in Federal prison, depending upon the criminal’s history. For all those who are attempting to politicize this legislation—and, yes, they are—I would encourage them to read the bill. Mr. Speaker, I have that bill in front of me as we speak, and it is really not too much of a lift. It is half of a page and four other pages. Members of Congress do have time to read the bill. Members of Congress do 
have time to understand why we are here today. And it is more than just that is just the way it is. It is, in fact, a reality that has become all too known by every single American, and especially moms and dads, moms and dads and uncles and grandparents who hurt when our children are hurt. So regardless of your position on general immigration reform, I would hope that you would join us today, join us today in agreeing that we should do everything we can to discourage murderers and criminal aliens. Disagreeing one way or another on immigration policy is not what this is about. This is about where even there is the slightest potential that there could be citizens who would be harmed, we need a second look, a second opportunity, and a chance to address the issue. The American people, I believe, need and deserve stronger deterrence of those who have come here illegally and have already proven that they are willing to break our Nation’s most serious laws. These are not huddled masses yearning to be free or families attempting to come here for a better life. These are bad people, and we call them criminals. They have violated the criminal conduct code here in the United States of America. They are people who we know are capable of terrible crimes, who, via their own criminal actions, have made sure that they have taken away the right that others had and, in doing so, have harmed the lives of our citizens. The American people spoke clearly in November. President Donald J. Trump understood that. This is a criminal matter; this is not a politics issue; and the time of letting the worst criminals back in our country over and over and over again must stop. The process begins again today. Mr. Speaker, that is just the way it is, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS ) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, all of us mourn the death of Kate Steinle, tragically shot and killed in San Francisco in 2015. Indeed, there isn’t a parent anywhere who doesn’t worry constantly about the wellbeing and the health and the safety of a child. And we all know, even though we may not have lost our own, we have deep sympathy with those who do. But as the Cato Institute has outlined, the legislation before us today would not have prevented that tragedy. As the Cato Institute has said, the alleged shooter ‘‘did not end up in San Francisco due to lax border security, and the case actually shows the opposite. In recent years, Border Patrol caught him each time he attempted to cross.’’ He was only in the city because the U.S. Justice Department failed to do its job, and that is why Cato has called this bill, ‘‘a waste of Federal resources.’’ Let me say that again, Mr. Speaker, that these are the words of the Cato Institute, a group founded by the wellknown conservative Charles Koch. Cato could not have been more clear when they said it this week: ‘‘Kate’s Law would not have helped Kate.’’ Now, our country has listened as President Donald J. Trump called Mexican immigrants ‘‘criminals, drug dealers, and rapists.’’ The public has watched him promote the formation of a deportation force to tear apart immigrants from their families and sign an executive order directing Federal resources toward the construction of a wall along the border between the U.S. and Mexico, where there is one mostly already that has not done that much deterring, but that is despite the fact that Federal spending on border security over the last few years has been at the highest level that our country has ever seen. It seems the majority has now taken a page from the President’s playbook, apparently trying to turn his dangerous rhetoric into law. It is shameful that they are prioritizing a bill that is completely unnecessary, since current law already imposes adequately severe penalties for illegal reentry, including enhanced penalties for criminal offenses. It is already covered, Mr. Speaker, but we do have something we need to fill the afternoon since the health bill failed. All the while, the majority is ignoring the many, many, many major issues facing the Nation today. Now, I know, and we all know, that the bill wasn’t the only thing they were hoping to ram through here before we adjourned for the district work period. They also hoped to pass their healthcare repeal bill so quickly before leaving town that the American people wouldn’t notice; but, frankly, even as I say that, they have noticed, as I understand now, that the approval rating for that bill is 12 percent. They have noticed. I think what they have noticed is that they are going to kill Medicaid. The reason they wanted to do this in a hurry, repeal healthcare first, was in order to fulfill their tax bill promise of corporate tax cuts as well as tax cuts for the richest people in the United States. They wanted to take from the health bill, the expanded Medicare money, $80 billion to pay for tax cuts. The devastation that that would create, I think most American people understand it. If they have a loved one in a nursing home, that means that, since 64 percent of the cost of nursing care is borne by Medicaid, that they would very likely have to bring the person home. It means that 22 million people would lose their health insurance. You know, we just say that, ‘‘22 million people.’’ Let me put that number in some perspective. That number, 22 million, is more than the population of Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, D.C., West Virginia, and Wyoming combined. That is pretty impressive, isn’t it? In February, our President Trump said: ‘‘Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated.’’ Well, Mr. Speaker and Mr. President, those of us on our side who worked for more than a year to craft the Affordable Care Act knew that very well. I was chair of the Rules Committee at the time, and just the Rules Committee heard from 46 different Members of Congress over the course of three meetings which, together, lasted more than 20 hours, one of them a full Saturday of hearings. So, together with the work done by the other committees of jurisdiction, the healthcare reform law received such a thorough vetting—and I want to get this on the record because I hear all the time it was written behind closed doors and strange people and nobody knew what it was and that we were all surprised. Nothing could be further from the truth. Bill Kristol proclaimed on FOX News: ‘‘This is the most thoroughly debated piece of legislation in my memory in Washington.’’ I feel like I need to say that again, but I won’t take the time, but how important it is. But those of us who were there knew it. We knew how many committee meetings were held on this legislation. On the bill you are talking about from your side, the majority side, not a single committee has heard it. I wager that the vast majority of the Republicans—who deserve to see it—have not even seen that bill, and that is a tragedy. We do not operate the United States of America that way. So, Mr. Speaker, there is no comparison between the open, the transparent, and lengthy process that we went through to craft the Affordable Care Act—which, by the way, was written by experts—and what the majority is trying to do with this disastrous repeal bill. And while I am at it, so many times when I was doing the rule on the repeal bills—and, you know, repeal and replace, repeal and replace. We know now that all those 7 years and those more than 60 votes that we paid for while we are running the House, that all this time there was no replacement. They still don’t have a replacement. If that wasn’t a hoax on the American people, I don’t know what was. But the process we are seeing now is defined by backroom deals and secrecy and a complete disregard for regular order. And I understand that, between now and tomorrow afternoon, there will be a lot of big deals changing hands so that we won’t know next week what is there anyway, but we wait to see the new CBO score and see what that says. Nearly every President since Theodore Roosevelt tried to enact healthcare reform. That is a long time. Teddy Roosevelt tried it and many 
Presidents after him. But after decades of failed attempts and false starts, President Obama, working with a Democratic Congress, was finally able to deliver. The majority should work with us again. We are willing to do that. And what we would really like to see you do is take the ACA and the problems that it has and let’s work together and improve that law, which has already been in effect now for a number of years, since 2014, and we could just move ahead and get on with things that are terribly important to us. We wish that you would do that instead of trying to dismantle it. If it were dismantled, it would disrupt the markets. It would harm the sick and disproportionately impact those in nursing homes. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ), a distinguished Member of this body. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, Kate’s Law, the bill that this rule brings to the floor, is very personal to the people of my district because of two other names that we will never forget. b1245 On October 24, 2014, Sacramento County Sheriff’s Deputy Danny Oliver and Placer County Detective Michael Davis were brutally gunned down in one of the most coldblooded rampages in the history of either county. It began when Deputy Oliver approached a car in a parking lot to ask if he could help a couple who seemed to be lost. He was shot dead. A bystander who was too slow turning over his car keys became the next victim. Miraculously, he survived a gunshot wound to the head but vividly remembers the smile on the gunman’s face as he pulled the trigger. The next victim was Detective Michael Davis. His father, a Riverside County Sheriff’s deputy, had lost his life in the line of duty on the very same day 26 years earlier. These crimes should never have happened. Their assailant had repeatedly entered this country illegally. While here, he had been apprehended for committing other crimes and repeatedly deported, only to easily recross the border without being challenged. I have heard it said there is no evidence that illegal immigrants commit crimes at any higher rate than the general population. Well, that is just not true. It is true that crime statistics don’t aggregate by legal status. Some States, like California, no longer even report the legal status of inmates. They can tell us by race, gender, age, background, and jurisdiction who stole a car last year, but they won’t tell us how many illegal immigrants did. By painstakingly piecing together all of the available fragmented data in 2015, FOX News concluded that illegal immigrants are three times more likely to be convicted of murder than the legal population. According to this report, illegals account for 3.7 percent of the population but are convicted of 13.6 percent of all crimes, including 12 percent of all murders, 20 percent of all kidnappings, and 16 percent of drug trafficking. Each year, 900,000 illegal immigrants are arrested for crimes. Citing the GAO, FOX reported that 55,000 illegal immigrants were in Federal prison and 296,000 in State and local jails in 2011. The real tragedy is that there should be zero crimes committed by illegal immigrants because there should be zero illegal immigrants in this country. For 16 years, two Presidents—one Republican and one Democrat—ignored their constitutional responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. Well, thank God, we finally have a President who takes that responsibility seriously. This rule brings a bill to the floor that increases penalties for those who return to our country after they have been deported. The other to be debated today adds longoverdue sanctions to local jurisdictions that refuse to protect their own citizens, and I rise in strong support of that bill as well. It is too late for Officers Davis and Oliver. It is too late for Kate Steinle. It is too late for thousands of other Americans killed by illegal immigrants. But perhaps it is just in time for your neighbor, your family member, or yourself. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOFGREN ), the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, this Saturday marks the 2year anniversary of the death of Kate Steinle, which was a tragedy for her family and for our entire community. My colleague from California has mentioned the murder of Officers Davis and Oliver, something that shook our northern California community. These things are terrible, and I think we can agree that every Member of this House objects to, mourns, and is tremendously distressed and opposed to these criminal acts. But H.R. 3004 is not the solution to prevent such tragedies. The bill expands criminal sentences for illegal reentry offenses, but, as has been mentioned by the ranking member of the Rules Committee, the person charged in connection with Kate’s death—I believe he is, in fact, the murderer—spent over 16 years in Federal prison. He was repeatedly deported. It didn’t prevent his crime. I think it is important to recall that we are not here writing bumper stickers. We are here writing laws. So we need to examine what is the current law and what is the proposal to change the current law. The discussion I have heard seems to assume that there are no harsh penalties in law for people who reenter without inspection. Nothing could be further from the truth. Right now, there is a felony provision for attempts to reenter. There are criminal penalties for reentry of certain removed aliens. For example, if you are removed subsequent to a conviction for a commission of three or more misdemeanors involving drugs, crimes against a person, or both, or a felony, there is a 10 year sentence. If you are removed subsequent to commission of an aggravated felony, it is a 20year sentence, and on and on. What does the bill do? It, for example, changes the 20year sentence to a 25year sentence. Well, you can argue whether that is wise or unwise. I personally think whether it is 20 or 25 is not going to be the major difference for a heinous criminal. It also expands the definition of the misdemeanors that must be committed to entail these tremendous penalties. Right now, I mentioned it is penalties involving violence or drugs. This would just be gardenvariety misdemeanors. If you were driving without a license, if you were loitering, that would count for the 10 years in Federal prison. I don’t think that those provisions are likely to make a material difference in the kinds of crimes that we all abhor, but there is something else that is in this bill that I think needs to be attended to. The bill’s sponsor claims this targets immigrants with criminal convictions, but the reality is the bill mostly affects other people. The bill, for the first time, would make it a criminal offense for an individual who was previously denied admission or ordered removed to seek to reenter the country legally, even if the individual has no criminal history, no history of repeated reentries. The bill does this by adding a definition to the term ‘‘crosses the border’’ that includes those who enter the country in ‘‘official restraint.’’ This small change means it would be a felony for a person who has been previously denied admission or previously removed to present themselves at a port of entry to request asylum, parole, admission, or another form of entry consistent with immigration laws. This is a drastic departure from current law. Under current law, an individual can be prosecuted for illegal entry if they are trying to evade or intend to evade detection. If they are trying to sneak in, they get caught, we charge them with a crime. An individual who comes to a port of entry and voluntarily presents herself to an immigration officer to ask permission to enter the country legally has not committed a crime. This bill would change that. Think about that for a minute. The bill makes it a crime to come to a port of entry not with the intent to enter the U.S. illegally, but to ask for a form of entry provided by the immigration laws. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 2 minutes. Ms. LOFGREN. In other words, this bill makes it a crime for someone to try to reenter legally. If you are a victim of human trafficking and come to a port of entry to seek protection and, ultimately, a T visa, which the law allows, you would commit a crime under this bill. If your U.S. citizen relative is critically injured and you show up at the port to ask for humanitarian parole so you can donate blood or an organ to your U.S. citizen relative, you have committed a crime. In each of these cases, you can be prosecuted and put in jail for up to 2 years, even if you ultimately win your immigration case. I also want to make a point about some of the other types of people this bill would affect. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, at least half of all the individuals convicted of illegal entry under the current statute, which is the most common Federal prosecution in law today, were coming to reunite with their family in the United States. Half of them had at least one child living in the U.S. Twothirds of the offenders had other family members—a spouse or others—they were trying to get back to. So, in addition to the people who are trying to enter legally, this bill massively increases penalties on people who are trying to get back to their families, many of whom are U.S. citizens. The desperation of these broken families is a direct result of our failed immigration policy. Hundreds of thousands of immigrant parents have been deported over the years, leaving their U.S. citizen children as orphans in the United States. These parents—and I understand it—are trying to get back to their kids. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. Ms. LOFGREN. We may think that is a good thing or a bad thing, but we don’t think that it is a crime to love your child and want to get back to that child. The desperation that these families feel is a direct result of our inability to create a toptobottom reform of our immigration laws that allows families to be united, allows the economy to meet its needs, allows the crops to be picked legally. We have created this problem by failing to enforce our laws. This bill doesn’t solve the crime problem that we all care about. It creates new problems. It is not the answer to the terrible offenses that are at the name of it. In fact, those terrible crimes seem to me to be merely an excuse to expand deportation for the many, many people whose only offense is wanting to be near their families. I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and to oppose this bill. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), the majority leader. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for the continuing work he does as the chairman of the Rules Committee. It is very important work for this Nation and the House. Mr. Speaker, there are some debates on this floor that are very complicated. They hinge on technicalities and complex judgment calls. You need to properly weigh all the data, all the studies, and all the nuances. But I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that today’s debate is not complicated. This is not about nuance. The subject is not complex. This is about answering a simple question: Is the purpose of our government to protect the American people first, or is the purpose of our government to protect felons who have entered our country illegally, broken our laws, and threatened our people? I wish this were an exaggeration, but American citizens have died because some local governments have refused to uphold our laws. These socalled sanctuary cities offer safety for illegal felons, but they do so by putting our families, neighbors, and fellow Americans in danger. The American people now look to their government and they are uncertain. They elected people to represent them, but would those Representatives rather protect felons here illegally or their fellow citizens? As far as this House is concerned, let us end the uncertainty today. Our government should, and always will, put the safety of American people first. Cities offering sanctuary for criminals will no longer be ignored. Criminals who threaten our citizens and reenter our country with no respect for our laws will be punished. b1300 Kate Steinle, an American citizen, a daughter, and a promising young woman would be alive today if local governments did not act as a safe haven for lawbreakers. Juan Lopez Sanchez shot Kate after being deported five times. He had seven felony convictions before he murdered her. After this crime, we asked the same questions the rest of America did: How could this man be let free? Why was he in America in the first place? How can cities across our Nation continue to shield such people from the law? In America, the Federal Government has little right to tell States and localities how to conduct affairs properly left to them. But our Federal Government has every right to demand that these governments follow our just laws written in accordance with our Constitution. And if they do not, if those cities protect criminals at the expense of lawabiding Americans, they should not expect their fellow citizens to help them through the Federal Government. For those cities with laws designed to harbor immigrants who have entered this country illegally, our legislation will prohibit those laws, cut off Federal grant money, and allow the families who suffer as a result of their foolishness the right to have their day in court. And to the criminals: If you break our laws and ever return, justice will come for you, and the penalty will be severe. Mr. Speaker, being an American means something. We should never forget that. If America is your home, you are a citizen. If you are part of this national community, rest assured, the government is here for you. The American people come first. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I inquire if my colleague has more speakers. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I have several more speakers. Mr. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished young gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN ). Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SESSIONS  for his continued leadership here in the House of Representatives, and especially on this issue in the Rules Committee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying bill, which we are calling Kate’s Law. Mr. Speaker, we are calling this crackdown on illegal immigration and sanctuary city policies Kate’s Law after Kate Steinle. For those of you who don’t know the story of Kathryn ‘‘Kate’’ Steinle, she was a beautiful 32yearold woman from northern California who was murdered on the streets of San Francisco while walking on a pier with her father 2 years ago this weekend. Murdered. The alleged murderer, an illegal immigrant named Juan Francisco, had seven felony convictions and had been deported from the United States five times. Deported five times. Let that sink in. It is truly unbelievable, Mr. Speaker. Yet he was back in our country after maneuvering through the previous administration’s weak southern border and negligent immigration enforcement. Then he lived in San Francisco due to that city’s blatant disregard for Federal law, a sanctuary city. San Francisco was no sanctuary for Kate; no sanctuary for that beautiful 32year old woman. If this story isn’t a clear sign that our system is broken, I don’t know what is. We need Kate’s Law to increase criminal penalties for illegal felons like Juan Francisco who have been convicted for crimes, deported, and then decided once again to illegally re enter the United States of America, a sovereign nation. 
Kate’s Law is straightforward, it is common sense, and it is the right beginning to make our homeland safer and get smart about immigration policy. It is time for us to make America safe again by addressing the lack of enforcement of Federal law. Kate’s Law is the right answer. I thank Chairman GOODLATTE for introducing Kate’s Law so we can crack down on this kind of illegal behavior that so often means life or death for American citizens. It is time to enforce the law. The gentlewoman, a few minutes ago, was talking about the law. Well, there are laws on the books that say it is illegal to enter this country. There are laws on the books that prohibit these types of sanctuary cities or sanctuary campuses as we are now seeing. I hope Congress will cut off the funding to these cities. It is time to get their attention, to enforce Federal law. I am pleased the White House has vocalized their support for the underlying bill should it reach President Trump’s desk. Now I call upon my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, to support the rule and the underlying bill. It is time again to make America safe again and honor young women like Kate. This should be a bipartisan issue. Respect for the rule of law and protecting the American citizens is really that simple. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, President Trump campaigned on the promise of bringing jobs back home and removing barriers to job creation. But despite these promises, President Trump’s budget does the complete opposite. It cuts job training programs by 39 percent, and its draconian spending cuts would lead to massive job losses. My colleagues will be happy to hear that I have an amendment that will ensure that the President keeps his promise of bringing jobs back home. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative PASCRELL ’s Bring Jobs Home Act, H.R. 685. H.R. 685 will close a tax loophole that rewards companies for moving jobs overseas, while providing a tax credit to companies that move jobs back to the United States. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. CHAFFETZ ). Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ) to discuss our proposal. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, because I listened very carefully, I hope that, while I am opposed to the rule, we are debating a bill, in my estimation, to reinforce negative stereotypes about the immigrants. I have listened to the response, perhaps, to that. Are you impugning through the Chair the record of Democrats on fulfilling our oath of office, the first part of which is to defend America from within and from without? That is the oath of office. As co chairman of law enforcement in the Congress of the United States for over 14 years, I am very close to the law enforcement community. I think we ought to hesitate a second before we start pointing fingers. We are good at it, all of us, on both sides. While we are doing that, most of our constituents are concerned about how to defend middle class jobs and bolster our manufacturing base. The majority of Americans agree that keeping U.S. jobs from moving overseas should be a top priority. Yet, despite the empty promises made by this President, the flow of jobs overseas has not stopped. Mr. Speaker, the administration had awarded government contracts to companies that continue to offshore jobs. This is worse than empty words. These are the facts. In fact, we use our tax money to help those corporations go offshore. I hope that makes you feel really good. In December, thenPresidentelect Trump told hundreds of workers at the Carrier manufacturing plant in Indiana that he would save their jobs. Six hundred union jobs from that plant are moving to Monterrey, Mexico. This is happening despite Carrier receiving $7 million in tax incentives from the State of Indiana to keep the plant open. Chuck Jones, president of United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents Carrier employees, said that the President ‘‘lied his’’ you know what ‘‘off.’’ Layoffs at the company start July 20. We don’t stop companies from offshoring American jobs by holding rallies. We do it by making good policy, an exercise this administration and this Congress has refused. So what we haven’t settled for—and we can’t—is empty words and pyrrhic victories while we undermine our values. If they want to change that, my friends on the other side can start right now, and we will help them. Under current law, when companies move overseas, we give them a tax break for the cost. That is unbelievable. We need to stop offshoring. This Congress could defeat the previous question and bring up the Bring Jobs Home Act. This bill eliminates the tax deduction. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, this bill gives a tax credit of up to 20 percent of the cost to U.S. businesses that bring jobs back to the United States. The companies would have to add jobs to claim the tax credit. Let’s stop subsidizing companies that ship jobs overseas, and start bringing jobs back to our shores. In fact, we used it in the last campaign as a reason why we have a problem with employment, because the immigrants take these jobs. That has been an empty fact. No details. No facts. No science. Mr. Speaker, it doesn’t get much simpler than this. This is not a new idea. President Obama and Congress raised the bill for years. The House blocked it on the majority—on the other side. Senator STABENOW of Michigan leads this bill in the Senate, where it cleared a procedural vote 93–7. I challenge you today to stop the small talk, put your money where your mouth is, take up and pass this bill to stand for American manufacturing and the workers here at home who need help. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question so we can bring up the Bring Jobs Home Act and start bringing jobs back to the United States. Mr. Speaker, I will take a back seat to no one when it comes to upholding the law. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind Members that remarks in debate may not engage in personalities toward the President of the United States, including by repeating remarks made elsewhere that would be improper if spoken in the Member’s own words. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN). Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong support of Kate’s Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. This Saturday, July 1, marks 2 years since the tragic death of 32yearold Kate Steinle, who was shot and killed by an illegal immigrant who had seven prior felony convictions and who had also been deported five times. b1315 Kate’s death is a clear reminder that we must do more to stop the abuse of our immigration laws by criminals who repeatedly flaunt the rule of law by illegally reentering the United States. Kate’s Law puts in place new guidelines for stiffer penalties for criminal aliens who continue to reenter the United States illegally. Kate’s Law is desperately needed to protect the residents of the State of Texas. Nicodemo CoriaGonzalez—who had been deported five times to Mexico for crimes, including three DWIs—reentered the United States illegally and was charged with committing multiple sexual assaults and kidnapped a woman solely for the purpose of setting her on fire. Current policy enables criminals to roam American streets—no matter 
where they come from—with little fear of arrest and deportation. Kate’s Law imposes stronger consequences and is an important step in restoring law and order. It will protect American lives. Sadly, there are local and State officials in our great Nation who put the interests of criminal aliens before the safety of American citizens. These officials should take the time to meet with the families of the many victims of these criminal aliens, like I have. They will see the resulting tragedy of sanctuary city policies. To rein in such States and localities, we need to pass the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which will impose consequences on State and local jurisdictions that ignore Federal immigration law by refusing to work with Federal immigration officials to remove criminal aliens from the United States. In the first month of the Trump administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued over 3,000 detainers. These are orders for local authorities to keep criminal aliens in custody for 48 hours to enable ICE agents to come and get them for deportation. Remarkably, 206 of these detainers were declined by sanctuary city jurisdictions. In other words, local authorities deliberately ignored ICE’s detainer request and released these dangerous individuals onto American streets. These weren’t just petty criminals, folks. Their crimes included homicide, rape, assault, domestic violence, indecent exposure to a minor, sex offenses against a minor, aggravated assault with a weapon, vehicle theft, kidnapping, driving under the influence, hit and run, and sexual assault. Passing the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act is common sense, as it cuts off certain Federal Department of Justice grants to these sanctuary cities. Our bill redirects these funds to States and localities that are cooperating with Federal immigration authorities and making America safer. The message of this legislation is clear: American taxpayers are tired of footing the bill for States and localities that threaten their safety. Criminal aliens with final deportation orders make up more than 50 percent of foreignborn inmates sitting in our prisons right now. Our streets will be made safer by deporting these criminal aliens, rather than letting them loose onto American streets. Local law enforcement officials should work with Federal law enforcement agencies to keep criminals out of our country and off of these streets. This is why we must pass Kate’s Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act to prevent other deaths like Kate Steinle’s. I am proud to support these two commonsense, law and order bills, and strongly urge my House colleagues to vote in favor of them today. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. K ING), one of the leading voices in Congress, not only on this issue, but also issues of great importance and it’s Americanism: that our country is a great country, and that we live in the greatest country in the world. There isn’t one time that I am not around this gentleman that he does not speak about American exceptionalism, the rule of law, and the important attributes of our country that make us world leaders. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I would like to reciprocate in a compliment to the gentleman from Texas, who stands here and leads in this Congress every day, and takes on a heavy load in the Rules Committee. A lot of times those are late night meetings—maybe the rest of us have put our feet up, not so much me, but some of the rest of us, Mr. Speaker—and PETE SESSIONS is up there working away, keeping organization in this House, and helping bring these things to the floor. We would not be here on the floor today if we didn’t have a Rules Committee to work with and that cooperated. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman GOODLATTE for joining with me on this and putting his name on top of this bill as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, or we would be still stuck back in hearings and markups. This is a great week to be debating these immigration bills that are here. A big reason for that is that this is a holdtheirfeettothefire week that many of us have joined, as the radio talk show hosts that believe in secure borders, the rule of law, enforcing immigration law, and building a wall come together at the Phoenix Park Hotel in Washington, D.C. We talk about the rule of law and enforcing immigration law. That has gone on now for a long time. I have joined in most of those. But, also, this is a week that the grieving families, who have lost a loved one at the hands of a criminal alien in this country, have not only come to this city and joined in the radio discussion that has taken place at the Phoenix Park Hotel, but they also were invited out to the White House to meet with the President yesterday, where there were a number of these families that were there to be represented and respected. I would say twothirds to threequarters of them are people who I have worked with from nearly the beginning of the tragedy that struck their family. I am greatly respectful of the individuals who have had the courage to step forward that President Trump has identified. I recall those times when he asked some of these families—Jamiel Shaw, for example; Michelle Root; Mary Ann Mendoza; and Sabine Durden, whose son Dominic was killed by an illegal alien. These families are families that have paid a huge price, but they were strong enough and courageous enough to step up on the stage with Presidential candidate Donald Trump and recount their stories to the media, some of them to speak before the national convention and reiterate these stories. Just this morning, I heard Jamiel Shaw reiterate the story of the murder of his son that took place within the sound of the gunshots of the living room that Jamiel Shaw was sitting in. I have heard that now for 9 years, but the pain has not gone out of his voice, Mr. Speaker. We have some obligations here. And I heard it in the previous speaker: Keep our people safe. Well, of those who die at the hands of criminal aliens, illegal aliens—anyone who is unlawfully present in America and perpetrates violence against an American citizen, kills an American citizen, or someone who is lawfully present in America—every one of those are preventable crimes, 100 percent preventable crimes. I would just direct the attention here, Mr. Speaker, of a tweet that I had them pull down for me. I didn’t know the date, but I saw the news story about Kate Steinle. It says: ‘‘Family devastated after woman shot, killed in San Francisco. ‘‘The family of a San Francisco woman who was killed in a seemingly random act of violence is mourning her loss as police continue to search for a . . . .’’ And then it is lost in space—the article that I read. But it must have been published on the 2nd of July—she was killed on the 1st—of 2015. My tweet came up on the 3rd, the very next day. I didn’t stop to think about it. I didn’t wait to see if it became a national story that Bill O’Reilly would bring up. By the way, I thank Bill O’Reilly. He helped a lot in getting us here today. But here is a message I sent out, with a picture of Kate Steinle. It says: ‘‘100 percent preventable crime. Just enforce the law. This will make you cry, too, and it happens every day.’’ That is within only 142 characters, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a tweet regarding Sarah Root. 
Sarah Root, 21, would be alive, living & loving life if Obama had not violated his oath & ordered ICE to stand down. Teen charged in Iowa woman’s death may’ve fled the country Authorities say a teenager who was at the wheel of a car that was involved in a crash in Omaha last month that killed an Iowa woman has missed a court hearing and may have fled the count . . . 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, every day in this country, at the hands of criminal aliens, people who are lawfully here are suffering, and they are paying a huge price. There isn’t a way that we quantify loss to a crime. The crime victim is often out of the equation when it comes to enforcing the law. I sat in on a case where I was the subject of a severe property rights crime. I listened to them announce the case, 
the case of the State v.—I remember his name—Jason Martin Powell. It occurred to me that I am not in this. My name isn’t part of the proceedings because we don’t honor the victims enough. Well, we are honoring them here today in a couple of pieces of legislation that are coming down, and we are honoring the life of Kate Steinle, and we are honoring the work of Jim Steinle, the rest of her family, and all of those adults who came forward and put their necks on the line for this. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), a gentleman who my party prays for on a daily basis. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot. We hear every day about healthcare. This is a healthcare bill. It is for the health of Americans, the physical health of people, so that they have the right to good health, health that is sometimes prevented by those people who are foreign nationals that commit crimes in the U.S., go to prison, get deported, go back, come back to the U.S., and commit another crime. It is a healthcare bill. And I would hope that our friends on the other side would vote for at least one healthcare bill this year, and this is that bill. The idea that a person could commit a crime in this country, get deported, come back, commit more crimes back and forth across the border, as we have heard, and continue to do it with lawlessness and arrogance is nonsense because the law is not enforced. Our cities talk about the immigrant communities that live there. I live in Houston, Texas. This bill helps protect the immigrant population. We have got MS–13 gangs, criminal gangs, who come to the U.S. They set up shop in our immigrant communities, they terrorize those communities, and they do it with lawlessness because they believe, if they ever get caught, they will eventually be able to come back into the United States and continue their wicked ways. This bill helps prevent that. If cities do not want to protect their immigrant communities, and law enforcement does not want to help enforce the law, then those communities shouldn’t get Federal funds for law enforcement. That is what these two bills do. So I would hope Members of Congress would understand the importance that this bill deals with criminal aliens that run through the United States committing crimes, get deported, and continue to come back. This legislation helps us, all together, to protect the American health of everybody—those people who live in big cities and those people who live in small cities. It is a bill that protects the people who live in the United States and makes them healthier because we make sure that those people, who want us to be unhealthy by their criminal violent acts, are not in the United States. And that is just the way it is. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is the 38th closed rule allowing no amendments that House Republicans have brought to the floor this year alone, and it is only June. At this rate, the majority is well on its way to becoming the most closed Congress in history. Regular order seems to be a thing of the past under this leadership, with bills coming to the House floor, as these two are, for a vote without even going through the committee process. The immigration bills we considered this week didn’t even go through regular order. The disastrous healthcare repeal bill, which would impact one sixth of the Nation’s economy, didn’t get a single hearing, and hardly anybody saw it. No experts were ever called to discuss its impacts, and it was jammed through the Chamber last month without even a score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office outlining its costs or its impacts. The Senate has also completely bypassed the committee process. I was proud to bring the Affordable Care Act, as I said earlier, to the House floor in 2009, as chair of the Rules Committee. That process couldn’t have been more different. Let me remind those watching today that the House held 79 bipartisan hearings and markups on health insurance reform in 2009 and 2010. During this time, House Members heard from 181 witnesses from both sides of the aisle, considered 239 Democratic and Republican amendments, and accepted 121 of them. b1330 That process was entirely different from what we go through today. In fact, a lot of the Members of the House are really cut out of most of the process. The idea of getting an amendment is really pretty rare. The legislation we consider here should be able to withstand scrutiny, but, more and more, the Nation’s business is done in the dark, or by a few people. Let’s get out of the back rooms, Mr. Speaker, and let legislators of both parties do their job under an open process. That is what the Speaker promised when he took the gavel, and it is what all the books and Rules of the House of Representatives desire, and it is certainly what the American people deserve. Mr. Speaker, we should not consider a bill that would cost tens of millions of people to lose health insurance, and not consider the antiimmigration bills before us today. So I am going to urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question, on the rule, and the bill, and hope for better days. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the dialogue today with the gentlewoman, my friend, from New York, the ranking member of the committee, not only for her professional conduct today, but also for her daytoday service to the Rules Committee as both she and I work through these difficult issues that face our great Nation. Mr. Speaker, what we are doing here today has a lot to do with two bills that were taken out of a larger immigration bill. Yesterday, we heard a debate on H.R. 3003, and today, on H.R. 3004. They are, in sense, companion bills. Balancing acts is what I would refer to them as, acts about addressing two very specific problems that are in our country that are very interrelated. These are law enforcement bills. Make no mistake about it. These are not political. These are law enforcement bills. These are law enforcement bills that are designed to make sure that we effectively codify into Federal law the viewpoint that cities cannot harbor criminals, rapists, murderers, or people who are robbing and killing people as they choose—multiple times—and cities turning a blind eye to not even recognize requests from other cities that might want these people, but also from the Federal Government. The second bill that we have got is one that says that what we are going to do is not only not fund these cities that are sanctuary cities, but we are going to deal more effectively with these criminals in the system. That is Kate’s Law. Both of these bills, H.R. 3004 and H.R. 3003, effectively balance each other because, as Members of Congress, we hear from people back home, many times, not just families from people who are impacted, but really citizens who are worried about our country dividing itself on this issue of criminals. Make no mistake about it, these are criminals. Make no mistake about it, this is a law enforcement bill. Make no mistake about it, the United States Congress needs to ensure that our cities and States follow the laws, the Federal laws that we know have been, not only cleared by Congress, but signed by the President of the United States. They will be subject to review by the courts. We will be very pleased to take that review also. Because, in fact, what we are doing is protecting American citizens. We are answering the call. And I would say, we are also making sure that we support the President of the United States, President Trump, who spoke very clearly on these issues, not only during the campaign, but he was elected therein. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation. The material previously referred to by Ms. SLAUGHTER is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 415 O FFERED BY  MS. SLAUGHTER  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

b1404 So the resolution was agreed to. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I was absent during rollcall votes No. 339 and No. 340 due to my spouse’s health situation in California. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘nay’’ on the motion on Ordering the Previous Question on the Rule providing for consideration of 3004. I would have also voted ‘‘nay’’ on H. Res. 415—Rule providing for consideration of H.R. 3004—Kate’s Law. 
NO SANCTUARY FOR CRIMINALS ACT Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 414, I call up the bill (H.R. 3003) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to modify provisions relating to assistance by States, and political subdivision of States, in the enforcement of Federal immigration laws, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MARSHALL ). Pursuant to House Resolution 414, the bill is considered read. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3003 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act’’. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3003. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. This simple, straightforward bill combats dangerous sanctuary policies that permit criminals to go free. We are all too familiar with how sanctuary policies have devastated families across the United States, and today we are taking action to prevent these senseless tragedies and save American lives. For years, the lack of immigration enforcement and spread of sanctuary policies have cost too many lives. The Obama administration encouraged or, at the very least, turned a blind eye to jurisdictions nationwide that implemented sanctuary policies designed to prevent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from being able to effectively enforce Federal law. Foolhardy jurisdictions continue to pass legislation and implement policies aimed at stymieing and maligning Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Earlier this year, a Baltimore City Council member introduced a resolution calling on ICE to arrest only those posing a ‘‘serious risk.’’ In discussing this initiative, the council member likened ICE officers to Nazis several times. Such rhetoric is reprehensible, creating a moral equivalent between genocide and a nation exercising a fundamental right and obligation of sovereignty. In a deeply troubling move on the other coast, San Francisco announced that it would no longer participate in the Joint Terrorism Task Force because of concerns that the task force’s duties may coincide with immigration enforcement. Sanctuary policies often focus on flouting ICE detainers, notices issued by ICE to allow it to take custody of aliens in law enforcement custody in order to initiate removal proceedings. These irresponsible policies have led to a sharp drop in ICE’s intake of aliens from criminal detention facilities, which forces ICE agents to engage in the far more timeconsuming and dangerous task of picking them up on the streets. This, among other factors, led to a drop in the number of criminal aliens removed from the interior of the United States from almost 87,000 in fiscal year 2014 to approximately 63,500 the following 2 fiscal years. We must discourage, not encourage, sanctuary policies and practices. H.R. 3003 addresses sanctuary policies and also takes great strides in clarifying Federal immigration detainer policy. Since the 1990s, Federal law has barred jurisdictions from restricting communication with Federal immigration officials regarding immigration status; however, this provision has never been enforced. H.R. 3003 amends current law and expands this prohibition against impeding Federal law enforcement. Instead of merely focussing on communication, the bill ensures that no jurisdiction may restrict assistance or compliance with immigration enforcement. To be clear, this bill imposes no affirmative duty to act on the part of any jurisdiction. Should a jurisdiction not comply with this provision, the jurisdiction will not be eligible for certain grant programs administered by the Department of Justice and Homeland Security. Eligibility for many of these grant programs is already predicated on compliance with this provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act. This section is also in line with a recent memo by Attorney General Sessions outlining compliance with this provision as the single factor that the Justice Department will use in identifying sanctuary jurisdictions. Regarding detainer policy, Congress has long heard that jurisdictions will not comply with ICE requests to hold individuals due to a lack of probable cause inherent in the detainer. I am pleased that H.R. 3003 provides the probable cause standards necessary to ensure that ICE only places detainers on aliens for whom they have probable cause and are deportable. In addition, the bill mandates that ICE must take custody of the subject of a detainer within 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays. Jurisdictions who comply in good faith with detainer requests will be immune from liability associated with that detainer, and if such an action does arise, the U.S. Government will substitute itself in as the defendant. This ensures that jurisdictions do not go bankrupt defending against neverending litigation. And in those jurisdictions that refuse to honor a detainer resulting in an alien committing a crime, the victim or victim’s family will be provided with the opportunity to bring a lawsuit against that jurisdiction. The third section of H.R. 3003 is named for Sarah Root and Grant Ronnebeck, two young people whose lives were suddenly taken by criminal aliens who remain at large today. This section was originally introduced as separate bills by Judiciary Committee 
members S TEVE KINGand A NDYBIGGS, who worked tirelessly to bring these tragic cases to the attention of the committee and the Congress. This section provides that aliens who are arrested or charged with serious crimes that result in death or serious bodily injury of another must be held without bond during the pendency of their removal proceedings. b1415 In addition, aliens convicted of even one drunk driving offense will also be ineligible for bond during their removal proceedings. The latter would have prevented the August 2010 death of Sister Denise Mosier, a Catholic nun in Virginia, at the hands of a drunk driving illegal alien who was released from ICE custody on bond. These classes of individuals present a clear and present danger to society and should not be permitted to roam our communities during the pendency of their removal hearings. The commonsense provisions of H.R. 3003 will provide better immigration enforcement and the peace of mind that no criminal will be provided sanctuary from our immigration laws. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear at the outset of this debate that this legislation does nothing to make our communities safer, and it does nothing to improve our immigration system. Instead, H.R. 3003 will trample the rights of States and localities to determine what is in the best interest of their public safety, and it will conscript law enforcement to enforce Federal immigration law. The ultimate experts on community safety are communities themselves, and hundreds of them have determined that, as community trust increases, crime decreases. This is because immigrants will come out of the shadows and report crimes to local law enforcement when they are not threatened with deportation. In fact, a recent study found that community trust jurisdictions are actually safer than their counterparts. Against this considered judgment, H.R. 3003 forces localities to abandon community trust principles and mandates the conscription of local offices into Federal immigration enforcement. Some localities, of course, would rightfully resist this conscription. As punishment, H.R. 3003 would rob them of vital law enforcement funding that they depend on to prevent crime, prosecute criminals, and boost community policing ranks. Localities, therefore, would face a losing choice: they can abandon community trust policies and leave their communities in danger, or they can leave community trust policies in place but forgo law enforcement funding, leaving their community in danger. It is important that we consider that this is more than just bad policy. It is also likely unconstitutional for multiple reasons. First, H.R. 3003 likely violates the 10th Amendment by commandeering States to comply with detainer requests that drain their resources. In addition, the bill’s changes to the Department of Homeland Security’s detainer authority exacerbate the current Fourth Amendment concerns associated with immigration detainers. The bill does not require any particularized finding about the individual that may form the basis of a probable cause determination and fails to provide for a prompt judicial determination of probable cause. The bill further compounds constitutional concerns by eliminating the ability for a detained individual to obtain an independent, individualized review of his or her bond determination by a neutral decisionmaker. For these reasons—and there are others—I urge my colleagues to please oppose this dangerous, meanspirited, and constitutionally suspect legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING), who is a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee not only for working with and cooperating on all this legislation, but for the relentless work that has come forward in the committee. He has spent a lot of time on this floor and in committee, and we are getting some progress here today. This is a big week, and we are starting to restore the rule of law. The sanctuary cities legislation, which is before us right now, is something I just looked back through my records and wondered: How long have I slugged away on this? The first amendment I brought was in 2005 to cut off some funding to sanctuary cities. At each appropriations opportunity, along with CJS and Homeland Security, when there was a chance, I would bring another amendment and another amendment, 2005 on through 2014 and 2015. In 2015, then I introduced the broader sanctuary cities legislation which is the basis for this legislation. I also had the misfortune and fortune of having the Root family as my constituents. Sarah Root was tragically killed by an illegal alien on the streets. Her father and mother both have been here to testify. Her mother is in town this day. Her father, Scott Root, testified before the committee. He said this: 
They bailed the killer of my daughter out of jail for less money than it took to bury her, and he was out of this country before we could have the funeral. 
Those words were some of the most chilling and mournful words that I have heard in this Congress. This bill today honors his daughter’s life, Michelle’s daughter’s life, Sarah, and it also brings into play the enforcement that we need to have. We have got to put an end to sanctuary cities and ban those policies— which the bill does—block the DOJ grants if they don’t comply with the Federal law, and refuse the warrants to the sanctuary cities because they will just release them on the streets and let ICE take custody of them within 48 hours. And then the good faith hold harmless for ICE detainers, when they got the wrong recommendation out of the Obama administration, this makes the right recommendation to local jurisdictions. The private cause of action is also very useful to us. It is a good, solid bill. I thank the chairman and all those who put the work in this today, and I urge its passage. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOFGREN ), who is a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, this bill isn’t about fixing our immigration system. In fact, it makes the system more dysfunctional and puts communities in peril. This bill is about telling communities how to police themselves and protect their people. It says: We here in D.C. know better than you do, local police, across the United States. Now, 600 or more local governments engaged in what they call community trust policies. These policies promote, among other things, allowing immigrant victims and witnesses to crime to report these offenses to local authorities without fear of immigration consequences. Years of locally informed experience have proven that this approach best ensures these communities’ safety. I think that is why we have received communications from the National Fraternal Order of Police in opposition to this bill, from the Law Enforcement Task Force—that is 36 sheriffs and chiefs across the country—in opposition to this bill, from the Major County Sheriffs of America in opposition to this bill, from the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence against this bill, as well as the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, and the National Association of Counties. ICE is not prohibited from doing their job, but as the San Jose Police Department has told me, San Jose police are not enforcing the securities laws, they are not enforcing the Federal tax laws, and they are not enforcing the immigration laws of the United States. They are doing their job to protect their community against crime. Now, because they are doing that, the threat is to remove funding from jurisdictions. Now, what would that funding be? It is grants against violent gangs. It is grants for the AntiHeroin Task Force and the AntiMethamphetamine Program, grants on port security to 
prevent terrorists from getting into the United States, and grants for the BioWatch Program to prevent terrorists from getting biohazards and killing us all. That is not smart to take those programs away from local governments that are working with us to help keep America safe. Now, I always think, as I said earlier, we are not doing bumper stickers here. We are doing laws. It is important to take a look at the details of what is in this proposed bill. In addition to banning collaborative grants with localities, the remedies it has made available is if a community has a community trust policy, the Department of Homeland Security can refuse to honor warrants—legal warrants—that are issued by that jurisdiction. That is astonishing. That is simply astonishing because what the local governments have said on the detainer policies is that the Fourth Amendment prevents them from holding people whose sentences have been served. In fact, there are a number of Federal courts that have made that determination, you can’t hold somebody on a civil detainer request without violating the Fourth Amendment. There is a remedy to that: get a warrant like anybody else. The Fourth Amendment means something, and there is a remedy. Go get a warrant. I don’t know why our Federal Government feels that they can upend constitutional law for their own convenience. Now, there is a provision in this bill that I find shocking. What it says is that if local governments violate the law—violate a court order—that they cannot violate the Fourth Amendment, that they are immunized, the Federal Government is going to pay, go ahead and violate the law. I cannot remember a time when we had a bill before us that said to States and localities: go ahead, violate the law because we are going to indemnify you for the violation. That is not the way our Federal system should work, and it is not the way those of us who believe in our oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States think that things ought to work. Now, finally, it creates something that I think is truly astonishing: a private cause of action against a State or locality if because the detainer cannot be honored because of the Federal Court cases and a person is released and, for any reason, commits a crime that it is the locality that bears the cost, not the criminal. This is a crazy provision. We should oppose this bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say to the gentlewoman from northern California that what is crazy is what the city of San Francisco is doing with their taxpayer dollars, since it was reported just yesterday that San Francisco taxpayers could soon pay $190,000 in a lawsuit settlement with an illegal immigrant who claimed he was reported to Federal immigration authorities in violation of the city of San Francisco’s sanctuary city ordinance. b1430 The city attorney’s office confirmed this, and the settlement is expected to be confirmed by San Francisco’s supervisors in future hearings. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield myself an additional 30 seconds. Now, people who are murdered, people who are injured by people who are unlawfully present in the United States should have their day in court with the city of San Francisco or anyone else just as well as they are apparently willing to pay money to people who are illegally in the country because they were properly turned over to Federal authorities to be deported from this country. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia, our chairman, for his leadership on this, and I rise in strong support of the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which has been worked on by a whole number of Members of the House. The adoption of dangerous sanctuary policies across the country makes it more difficult to adequately enforce our immigration laws, which, in turn, needlessly puts Americans’ lives at risk. Unfortunately, sanctuary cities that fail to comply with Federal law and deliberately refuse to cooperate with Federal authorities become safe havens for undocumented criminal immigrants, because criminals know they are less likely to be detained in those cities, which are, by definition, sanctuary cities. Far too many innocent lives are put at risk when a criminal alien convicted, for example, of drunk driving or charged with another serious offense is not detained so they could be appropriately dealt with and, if warranted, deported from our country according to the law. That is why it is essential that we pass this resolution, which will strengthen our Nation’s immigration laws, hold sanctuary cities accountable, and enhance public safety by requiring detention of criminal aliens. The bottom line is, if we expect our Federal immigration authorities to enforce our Nation’s immigration laws and protect the American people, State and local officials need to cooperate, not defy Federal immigration laws. And those local officials who refuse to do so and instead give socalled sanctuary to those that have come to our country illegally and then committed crimes here, they are putting the very people who they were sworn to serve and to protect at risk. And unfortunately, this has been happening all over the country, where literally people come here illegally, commit crimes, and local entities decide not to enforce the law. We need to pass this bill. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ), a gentleman on the committee who has worked tirelessly with myself and Ms. LOFGREN to make this measure more understandable. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, ever since Donald Trump descended the golden escalators at Trump Tower to announce his candidacy by saying Mexican immigrants are rapists, murderers, and drug dealers, the Republican Party has had Mexican fever, and they have been working feverishly to paint immigrants all as criminals. And when something goes bad, they go back to their old favorite. When Trump’s Muslim ban was blocked in the courts, out came the Attorney General to say they were doing everything they could to do more roundups and that no immigrant was safe in America. The Russia investigation not going well for the dear leader at the White House? Hey, let’s whip out that Mexican thing, as VicePresident PENCE  said. Maybe it will keep our voters happy and distracted. Healthcare not going well? Let’s just hate some Mexicans today. Listen, almost 8 out of 10 Latinos in the United States are citizens, 1 out of 10 are legal permanent residents. That leaves 1 in 10 who are undocumented, but this policy is about going after all of us, whether we are citizens or not of the United States of America. These bills are nothing new, and they are not really about fighting crime. They are about racial profiling and putting Latinos ‘‘in their place.’’ Latinos, African Americans, Muslims, women, they know what it is like to be targeted. Ninetynine percent of the votes for this bill today will come from people who do not have to worry about racial profiling for themselves, for their children, or the people who they represent, but let’s be clear. Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona is the poster child for the kinds of policies the Republicans want to impose on every city and county in the country, and we know the results. Sheriff Arpaio embodies racial profiling and rounding up people because they are brown. Oh, we will sort out their papers later, he says, whether they are citizens or legal permanent residents or whatever. I have talked to U.S. citizens who were detained by Sheriff Arpaio because they didn’t carry with them their birth certificate or a passport at all times in the country in which they were born. Let’s be clear. Sheriff Arpaio has been sued successfully to stop his racial profiling, and he has been charged criminally in Federal court for his racial profiling tactics, and still the Republicans of the House want to make 
the law he is being sued for legal in the United States of America. Sometimes Democrats have to stand up for justice, for what is right when the chips are down. Well, the chips are down, and every immigrant family and every immigrant in America is going to remember who stood up for them when they needed Democrats to fight to keep families together when the chips were down. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President or Vice President. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman GOODLATTE for yielding and for his leadership on this legislation. It is an honor to serve with him on the House Judiciary Committee. And I am grateful to Representative KINGas well for producing Sarah’s Law. Today, the House of Representatives can pass a crucial piece of legislation to codify the tenets of two of President Trump’s executive orders on immigration enforcement. H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, will finally hold accountable States, cities, and local law enforcement agencies that provide safe haven to criminally violent illegal immigrants by refusing to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. You know what is astonishing and you know what is shocking, is that there are jurisdictions in this country that blatantly choose to endanger their communities by providing protection to criminals. Passage of H.R. 3003 ensures that these communities will no longer be given rewards for their dereliction of duty. Importantly, this bill also contains a section entitled Sarah and Grant’s Law, which recognizes two young Americans who were murdered by criminally violent illegal aliens who had no right to be on our streets. In January 2015, a 21yearold convenience store clerk and constituent of mine, Grant Ronnebeck, was working the graveyard shift at QuickTrip in Mesa, Arizona. Just before 4 a.m., an illegal alien with a long criminal record, awaiting deportation proceedings, walked in and demanded a pack of cigarettes. When Grant tried to count the money before handing them over, the man shot him and left him to die. Sarah and Grant are far from the only Americans who have been impacted by illegal immigration. In 2014, Mesa, Arizona, police officer Brandon Mendoza was killed in a wrongway car crash by an illegal immigrant driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Despite tragic stories like these, the Obama administration continued to promote policies that circumvented many of our immigration laws, allowing thousands of criminals to return to our communities. It is time for these reckless policies to end. H.R. 3003 specifically targets illegals who commit serious crimes by preventing them from being released onto our streets during their deportation proceedings. After 8 years of policies that have placed a priority on protecting all illegal aliens, including those who are violent criminals, over the rights and safety of Americans, it is refreshing to have a President who is willing to follow regular law and order. President Trump has taken active steps to reverse the failed policies of the previous administration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. BIGGS. I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, President Trump has taken active steps to reverse the failed policies of the Obama administration and has been vocally supportive of Congress’ efforts to do the same. Passing this bill is a positive step toward our duty of enforcing the Nation’s immigration laws, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this vital piece of legislation. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ), the ranking member of the Intellectual Properties Subcommittee. Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3003. This legislation would withhold needed law enforcement funding from cities that choose not to assist Federal authorities in enforcing the immigration laws. Besides being constitutionally suspect, this bill is also highly counterproductive. Recognizing that good policing depends on building trust with their residents, many cities forbid their law enforcement officers from questioning victims of crime or witnesses to a crime about their immigration status, and they do not share immigration information with Federal authorities. They believe that their communities are at greater risk when a victim of domestic violence is afraid to ask the police for protection from her abuser for fear of deportation, or when witnesses to a murder refuse to assist law enforcement in tracking down the perpetrator because they are afraid their immigration status will be discovered. These cities have concluded that taking on themselves the Federal responsibility to enforce immigration laws would destroy trust between immigrants and local law enforcement, which would make everyone less safe. Perversely, this bill would punish these cities by denying them the funds that they need to protect public safety. Funding to hire new police officers, grants to combat the opioid crisis, and money to reduce the rape kit backlog could all be taken away under this bill. Not only does this raise serious constitutional concerns, it is simply bad policy that will lead to more crime, not less. As if this were not bad enough, the bill would also authorize mandatory indefinite detention of certain categories of immigrants without sufficient due process even if they present no danger to their communities. Indefinite detention is repugnant to our values of fairness and individual liberty, but this bill perpetuates the ugly myth that immigrants are more dangerous and likely to commit more crimes than nativeborn Americans, and it erodes the fundamental protections that we guarantee to all who are present in this country. Instead of taking positive steps to improve communication between Federal, State, and local authorities, this bill demonizes immigrants, punishes communities that seek to build trust between immigrants and law enforcement, and authorizes indefinite detention of certain immigrants, all while making us less safe. For each of these reasons, this bill should be defeated, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST). Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about two very honorable lives, Paul Besaw and Lahiri Garcia, who were both taken from us far too soon by the criminal acts of one who was illegally in our country. A death of our innocent neighbors is especially devastating when it could have been prevented had our immigration laws been upheld and had they been working. Paul and Lahiri were paramedics in my community, dedicated to saving lives, but on January 1, a man illegally in our country, driving drunk, collided with their ambulance and killed both of them. Paul left behind his loving wife, Dawn, and his 6yearold daughter, Allison, who you see here behind me. When I spoke with Paul’s widow, she rightfully said that if our country wasn’t ‘‘too afraid or inept to enforce immigration law,’’ her husband would still be with her today, and she is absolutely right. Lahiri’s wife, Julie Garcia, told me how hard it was for her four children to not have their father this Father’s Day. She expected to grow old with her husband, but because this man wasn’t sent home the first three times he was pulled over, she will no longer have that opportunity. Both wives, both mothers, expressed to me sincere disbelief. They don’t understand why this was allowed to happen, and, for the life of me, I can’t understand why it is allowed either. The bottom line is that this should never happen to anyone. Sanctuary cities are a violation of the rule of law, they are absolutely unacceptable, they 
cannot be tolerated. We must enforce this rule of law. It is, in fact, the right of every American to be protected by this government. It is not the right of anybody to spend one day, one moment, in our country illegally or without invitation. Today, Congress is addressing this epidemic. Our bills, they crack down on dangerous sanctuary policies that put these kind of innocent lives at risk. So let us ensure that unlawful immigrants convicted of crimes are, in fact, detained and are, in fact, deported. Mr. Speaker, let’s pass these bills. More importantly, let us be convicted that what happened to Paul and what happened to Lahiri is never allowed to happen again. b1445 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), the ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I venture to say that none one of us who comes to this floor doubts that any local law enforcement, our neighbors, do any secondguessing to arrest drunk drivers, murderers, and others, and that they are held to the high calling of justice. I do not want to be associated with being mildmannered and weak on those who would do serious harm, kill, and maim, no matter who they are. That is not this debate. This debate is whether or not this bill interferes with the legitimate enforcement of the law and whether or not it takes away the mercy that we are known for in the United States. Let me tell you why. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter from the Fraternal Order of Police—which, by no means, is shy about enforcing the law—writing to oppose this legislation, saying that local police departments answer to local civilian government, and it is the local government which enacts statutes and ordinances. 
OFPOLICE , Washington, DC, 27 June 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. KEVIN O. M CCARTHY , Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY P. P ELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. STENY H. H OYER , Minority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER AND REPRESENTATIVES  MCCARTHY , PELOSI AND HOYER : I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to reiterate the FOP’s opposition to any amendment or piece of legislation that would penalize law enforcement agencies by withholding Federal funding or resources from law enforcement assistance programs in an effort to coerce a policy change at the local level. The House will consider H.R. 3003 on the floor this week and Section 2 of this bill would restrict the hiring program administered by the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (ByrneJAG) programs, as well as programs administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The FOP has been very clear on this issue: we strongly believe that local and State law enforcement agencies should cooperate with their Federal counterparts. That being said, withholding needed assistance to law enforcement agencies—which have no policymaking role—also hurts public safety efforts. Local police departments answer to local civilian government and it is the local government which enacts statutes and ordinances in their communities. Law enforcement officers have no more say in these matters than any other citizen and—with laws like the Hatch Act in place—it can be argued they have less. Law enforcement officers do not get to pick and choose which laws to enforce, and must carry out lawful orders at the direction of their commanders and the civilian government that employs them. It is unjust to penalize law enforcement and the citizens they serve because Congress disagrees with their enforcement priorities with respect to our nation’s immigration laws. The FOP issued a statement in January of this year regarding the approach of the Administration on sanctuary cities as outlined in President Trump’s Executive Order. The President recognized that it is unfair to penalize the law enforcement agencies serving these jurisdictions for the political decisions of local officials. It allows the U.S. Attorney General and Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to make an informed decision about the public safety impact without an automatic suspension from Federal grant programs. In Section 2 of H.R. 3003, there is no such discretion and it countermands the Administration’s existing policy. The FOP opposed several bills in the previous Congress, which were outlined in a letter to the Senate leadership, and we will continue to work against proposals that would reduce or withhold funding or resources from any Federal program for local and State law enforcement. If Congress wishes to effect policy changes in these sanctuary cities, it must find another way to do so. On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police, I want to urge the House to reject H.R. 3003’s punitive approach and work with law enforcement to find a better way to improve public safety in our communities. Sincerely, CHUCK CANTERBURY , National President. 
COMMITTEE ON MIGRATION , UNITED  STATES CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC  BISHOPS , Washington, DC, June 26, 2017. CATHOLIC CHARITIES USA, Alexandria, VA, June 26, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : We write on behalf of the Committee on Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB/ COM), and Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) to express our opposition to H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004. The Catholic Church holds a strong interest in the welfare of migrants and how our nation welcomes and treats them. Our parishes include those with and without immigration status, unfortunately some who have witnessed or been victims of crime in the United States, including domestic violence, armed robbery, and assault. We understand the importance of fostering cooperation and informationsharing between immigrant communities and local law enforcement. We oppose H.R. 3003 because it would impose obligations on local governments that we fear—and that many of them have warned—would undermine authority and discretion of local law enforcement. This, in turn, would hamper the ability of local law enforcement officials to apprehend criminals and ensure public safety in all communities. Furthermore, Section 2 of H.R. 3003 would deny to jurisdictions vital federal funding related to law enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, and naturalization if those jurisdictions are deemed to be noncompliant with H.R. 3003. The Catholic service network, including Catholic Charities, works in partnership with the federal government on a number of Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security initiatives, including disaster response and recovery, naturalization and citizenship services, and services for the immigrant, including victims of human trafficking, and domestic violence. These services are incredibly valuable to the protection and promotion of the human person and in some instances lifesaving. Cutting grants related to these important national objectives, or threat of such cuts, is not humane or just, nor is it in our national interest. Also, we oppose H.R. 3004 as it would lead to an expansion of incarceration and does not include adequate protections for people who reenter the U.S. for humanitarian reasons or seek protection at the border. While H.R. 3004 makes notable efforts to protect us from those convicted of violent criminal offenses, the legislation goes far beyond this goal by expanding the government’s ability to prosecute illegal reentry cases and heightening the criminal penalties in these cases. In an era of fiscal austerity, it is vital that important judicial resources are efficiently utilized to prosecute and convict the most violent offenders of violent crimes. Expanding who is eligible to be prosecuted for entry or reentry as well as enhancing sentencing requirements does not advance the common good nor will it ensure that communities are safer. Furthermore, we are concerned that, as introduced, H.R. 3004 would also prevent vulnerable asylum seekers and unaccompanied children, (who have presented themselves repeatedly at the U.S. border in the flight from violence), from being able to access protection, and instead face fines, imprisonment or both. We respectfully urge you to reject these bills in favor of a more comprehensive and humane approach to immigration reform; an approach that upholds human dignity and family unity and places a greater emphasis on balancing the needs and rights of immigrants with our nation’s best interests and security. The United States has a long and proud history of leadership in welcoming newcomers regardless of their circumstances and promoting the common good. We stand ready to work with you on legislation that more closely adheres to this tradition and appreciate your serious consideration of our views in this regard. Sincerely, MOSTREV. JOEVA´SQUEZ , Bishop of Austin, Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration. SR. DONNA MARKHAM , OP, P HD, President & CEO, Catholic Charities USA. 
[From the Houston Chronicle, Apr. 30, 2017] POLICE CHIEFS : SB 4 IS A‘LOSELOSE’ FOR TEXAS  (By Art Acevedo and James McLaughlin) No one believes in the ‘‘rule of law’’ more than the Texas Police Chiefs Association and the Texas Major Cities Chiefs, which besides Houston include Austin, Arlington, Dallas, 
Fort Worth and San Antonio. We work tirelessly to make our communities safer, within the confines of the U.S. Constitution, by arresting those who commit criminal actions that threaten our communities. We specifically target those individuals committing violent crimes and arrest anyone who threatens the safety of our communities, regardless of their immigration status. Police chiefs across the state work extremely hard to develop law enforcement agencies that build and maintain trust, communication and stronger relationships with minority communities through community based policing and outreach programs. So we know well that no good can come of Senate Bill 4, which the state House of Representatives, joining the state Senate, passed last week. SB 4 requires local law enforcement to take a more active role in immigration enforcement; this will tear down what we’ve worked so hard to build up. Officers will start inquiring about the immigration status of every person they come in contact with, or worse, only inquire about the immigration status of individuals based on their appearance. This will lead to distrust of police, less cooperation from members of the community and will foster the belief that they cannot seek assistance from police for fear of being subjected to an immigrationstatus investigation. This is a loselose situation for everyone. Distrust and fear of contacting or assisting the police has already become evident among legal immigrants. Legal immigrants are beginning to avoid contact with the police for fear that they themselves or undocumented family members or friends may become subject to immigration enforcement. Such a divide between the local police and immigrant groups will result in increased crime against immigrants and in the broader community, create a class of silent victims, and eliminate the potential for assistance from migrants in solving crimes or preventing crime. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Law enforcement officers have to be able to abide by the law. It is unjust to penalize law enforcement and the citizens they serve because Congress disagrees with the enforcement priorities with respect to our Nation’s immigration laws. And they are right. But they also say that they need to build trust in our communities. This bill destroys community trust. It also penalizes hardworking governments of mayors and county leaders who are, in fact, trying to run the government and ensure that victims of domestic violence and crime, even as immigrants, are able to be treated in a manner where justice is had. What about the National Sheriffs’ Association or the Texas Police Chiefs in Texas’ major cities who indicate that this bill will serve no good and no good can come to a similar bill in the States? Let me say to you, I stand with the Catholic church, and I am not Catholic. What are our values? This church opposes the idea of our values. Let me be very clear as I close. We are doing the sanctuary cities bill, but I want to know about the integrity of this place. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3003, the ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,’’ which requires state and local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, expands DHS detainer authority, and expands detention authority. I oppose this bill mainly because it directly violates the Constitution of the United States. If H.R. 3003 were to become law, it will coerce states and localities to cooperate with immigration enforcement, it will hurt victims and witnesses to crimes, and ultimately make communities less safe, which directly contravenes the stated and alleged goals of this bill. Police Chiefs across the nation are responding to less disturbances, not because crime is magically disappearing, but because immigrant communities are afraid to report them out of fear of being targeted. H.R. 3003 will completely strip state and local jurisdictions of their ability to enact commonsense policies that breed respect and trust and turn local law enforcement into an auxiliary arm of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). To ensure compliance, this bill coerces states and localities by imposing penalties that will deny federal funding for critical law enforcement, national security, drug treatment, and crime victim initiatives. This divisive and vindictive administrative policy abridges the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, which states: ‘‘The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.’’ H.R. 3003 also violates the Fourth Amendment’s proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures in respect to the changes it makes to DHS’s detainer authority. It expands upon current DHS detainer practice by broadening the ways in which DHS can determine it has probable cause to issue a detainer and it significantly expands the time an individual may be held by law enforcement. The Supreme Court has stated that the Fourth Amendment requires a judicial finding of probable cause, usually within 48 hours of arrest. H.R. 3003, however, allows law enforcement to hold a person up to 96 hours before DHS takes custody, and there is no mention of when the person will even see an immigration judge. H.R. 3003 compounds these constitutional violations by eliminating the ability for a detained individual to obtain an independent, individualized review of his or her bond determination by a neutral decisionmaker. This bill also authorizes DHS to detain individuals in removal proceedings without time limitation and it expands the categories of individuals who would be subject to such a detention on a mandatory basis. These provisions make it substantially more difficult, if not impossible, for individuals to obtain release on bond while removal proceedings are pending, thus increasing detention costs and separating families while they seek to litigate their immigration cases. H.R. 3003 is nothing but an antiimmigrant, enforcementonly proposal that represents another step in Trump’s mass deportation plan. Mr. Speaker, rather than forcing state and local officials into a onesizefitsall federal enforcement scheme, Congress and the administration should enact legislation and adopt policies that integrate unauthorized immigrants into our communities—approaches that the American public supports by a wide margin. For these reasons, I join with local law enforcement chiefs and faith community leaders in denouncing and opposing this meanspirited, illconsidered, and unAmerican legislation. I end, Mr. Speaker, by apologizing to Mika Brzezinski, to the press, for the horrible words that were said about a bleeding face. There is no way that we can entrust this law or any other laws to this President of the United States. He has lost the trust, and I will vote for nothing until he steps down. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. While we have heard a good amount of inflammatory rhetoric, my remarks will speak solely to the facts. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of keeping America safe. In less than 2 years, over 8,000 undocumented immigrants, all subject to ICE detainment, were released because of local noncooperation policies. Sixtythree percent of those illegal aliens had prior convictions or had been marked a public safety concern. After being released, they went on to be rearrested nearly 4,300 times, committing nearly 7,500 new offenses. The facts are clear: States and local governments that do not comply with our immigration laws are putting American citizens at risk. The U.S. Sentencing Commission found that, in 2014, 75 percent of all criminal defendants who were convicted and sentenced for Federal drug offenses were illegal immigrants. As of 2014, illegal immigrants made up roughly 3.5 percent of our population but committed over 10 percent of all murders. Refusing to turn over criminal illegal immigrants poses a threat to our society, our safety, and our economy. American citizens pay nearly $19 million a day to house and care for the 450,000 criminal immigrants in jails and prisons who are all eligible for deportation. When cities ignore Federal immigration laws, the results are often tragic. The sheriff of Travis County, Texas, decided she would only turn over illegal aliens who have committed a narrow list of crimes. Her policy allowed one illegal alien to be released on bail despite sexually abusing his girlfriend’s 9yearold daughter. A Cook County sheriff released an illegal immigrant after he served a brief domestic assault sentence, despite an ICE detainer. Soon after, he went on to kill a 15yearold girl. America wept as 32yearold Kate Steinle was killed by a stray bullet. The illegal immigrant who shot that gun had seven previous felony convictions. There are thousands more stories of innocent lives lost, of families destroyed, and of crimes that could have 
been prevented. Every day in America, another family grieves because of the policies of sanctuary cities. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the protection of our citizens, the safety of our communities, the defense of our country, and to ultimately see the end of sanctuary cities. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ), our Democratic Caucus chair. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Much of the same rhetoric we are hearing right now from the other side of the aisle is similar to the same rhetoric we heard back in the 1840s, 1850s, and 1860s against the Irish when they came to America. We heard it said about Italian Americans in the 1880s and 1890s. We continue to hear the same type of rhetoric about African Americans in our country in terms of the percentage of criminal activity that takes place. What we have seen happen is the further incarceration and enslavement of African Americans in our Nation today because of similar rhetoric. I want to make it very clear: ‘‘Immigrant’’ and ‘‘criminal’’ are not synonyms. You make it out to be that way by the passage of this legislation. Talking about law enforcement, in New York City, James O’Neill, the police commissioner, has said this law will make New York City less safe than it is today. I remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that 9/11 happened in my hometown, in my city. Since then, there have been no major incidents of terrorism in New York City because they have been able to collect information—much of it from the undocumented community in our city—to prevent similar events from happening again. That is why this bill is so egregious. The first responsibility of the Federal Government is to protect its citizens from foreign invasion, foreign attack, terrorist attacks. This bill will withhold terrorism money from New York City. It will prevent the city of New York from continuing to collect the information they and other cities around this country need to protect their citizens, to develop the trust that the community has to have in its police department and the police department in its communities. That is how law enforcement works, that is how they catch the criminals, and that is how they help the Federal Government deport criminals who have committed criminal offenses in a city like New York. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire at this time how much time is remaining on each side. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 12 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Michigan has 11 minutes remaining. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACK ), the chairman of the Budget Committee. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, across the country, more than 300 municipalities have adopted policies to limit local law enforcement cooperation with Federal authorities, making it harder to keep our families and communities safe. Back in my home State of Tennessee, the Nashville City Council has recently been advancing legislation to become one of these sanctuary cities. Giving Federal funds to sanctuary cities defies logic and it demands attention. Yesterday, I offered an amendment to expand the bill before us today so that sanctuary cities would no longer have access to Community Development Block Grants and certain other economic development grants, as well, that send more than about 300 billion taxpayer dollars a year to local communities. On its website, the Community Development Block Grant program says its purpose is to provide services to vulnerable communities and address issues that ‘‘pose an immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community.’’ What population is more vulnerable than a 6yearold girl in Lebanon, Tennessee, who was sexually molested while she was sleeping? Just last month, charges were brought against a criminal illegal immigrant for repeatedly breaking into her room at night and making videos while he assaulted her. The evil individual had been in police custody before. For Kate Steinle, who has been talked about many times on the floor, her killer had a criminal record of not one, two, or three, but seven felonies. He had been deported not once, twice, or three times, but five times. Is that who liberal legislators around the country want to give ‘‘sanctuary’’? We need more communication and cooperation between local, State, and Federal law enforcement officers who are trying to keep our communities safe, not less. It is time to stop giving taxpayer dollars to these cities. I am voting for this bill today to do just that. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ). Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the distinguished ranking member, for yielding. I don’t know what our friend from Tennessee was talking about. I am not here as a liberal legislator. I am here as a local government person. I spent 14 years in local government. We are not sanctuary cities. We are trying to solve crimes by seeking cooperation from the immigrant community. This bill will make it harder. Most of our local police chiefs would tell you that—if you would listen to them. Oddly enough, the Members supporting this bill are the same Members who sanctimoniously decry Federal mandates and overreach—except when they want one. Here we are, dictating how local governments should implement Federal immigration laws. At the local level, we know effective, communitybased policing relies on trust between the police and communities. This bill would erode that collaboration and that trust. How can we expect our Nation’s immigrants to turn to the police if they witness or fall victim to a crime if they are afraid of being deported or separated from their families? The bill will punish local police departments and those relationships. It should be defeated. This local government guy will oppose this bad policy bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. YOUNG ). Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I was at the White House with President Trump and the parents and relatives of those daughters and sons who were killed by those who are here illegally. The stories were very heavy. They should weigh on all of us. One story that was shared was given by Michelle Root about her beautiful daughter who was struck down and killed in a senseless way by someone here illegally. Michelle is in the gallery here today, and she is a great advocate. In late January 2016, Sarah’s parents, Michelle and Scott Root, started their day with joy. On that day, their beautiful daughter, Sarah, graduated. She had the whole world ahead of her. But for Michelle and Scott, the day ended with loss and tragedy. It was the unimaginable loss of their daughter. Sarah was killed by a drunk driver here illegally. It is so senseless. Sarah had her whole life in front of her. Through incompetence and uncertainty about the law or the policy, or both—but for sure, a lack of common sense—Sarah’s killer was released. Today, Sarah’s killer is free. Today, Sarah’s parents, Michelle and Scott, and Sarah’s brother, Scotty, fight for Sarah’s justice. They fight for her honor. They fight to make sure no other parent or loved one has to go through the tragic ordeal they had to go through. b1500 My vote today is about policy, but it is in honor of Sarah Root. It is hard to find a love stronger than a parent has for their child. Sarah will always be loved and certainly not forgotten by her family and friends and those who never even met her. She has touched their hearts. They continue to advocate, and so must we. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman, my colleagues in Iowa and across the border in Nebraska who support this legislation and fought for it to be incorporated into this bill. God is taking care of Sarah now. Her memory lives on. I urge the passage of this legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is not in order to refer to persons in the gallery. 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ), a former justice to the Texas Supreme Court. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, the only sanctuary involved here today is the sanctuary that this sorry bill provides for prejudice. This is the Trump counterpart to the outrageous SB4 that Governor Greg Abbott has been promoting in Texas. It all goes back to the rhetoric of last year about the ‘‘bad hombres’’ and the attacks on Mexico and Mexicans. I will tell you, I want the bad hombres off the street no matter where they come from, but I look to my local police chiefs, to my local sheriffs and law enforcement officers to tell me what the best way is to protect our families from crime. They say maintaining the confidence of the immigrant community is vital, and that measures like this, which simply have politicians in Washington interfering with and attempting to intimidate local law enforcement officers, do exactly the opposite of what all these speeches claim that they do. Antiimmigrant hysteria, what a way to leave for July Fourth from a Congress that has accomplished practically nothing but to attack immigrants as we depart instead of standing by and supporting local law enforcement and making our communities safe. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond and point out that many, many of the victims of these crimes are Hispanic, African American, and others, and they were seated around the Cabinet table at the White House yesterday pleading for this legislation because they had lost their loved ones. They would much rather have been able to rewind the tape and be with those loved ones who were killed by people who were illegally present in the United States. The victims would never have suffered if our laws had simply been enforced. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN). Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. Congress has a responsibility to protect the rule of law in our country and to provide for the safety of our citizens. The American people overwhelmingly oppose sanctuary cities and believe that we should be doing more to enforce our Federal immigration laws. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act clarifies the authority of the Department of Homeland Security to order the detainment of illegal immigrants arrested for crimes until they can be processed for deportation. It also cuts off certain Federal grants to cities and States that violate Federal immigration law. It is simple: If you don’t comply with the Federal immigration law, you are not eligible for certain Federal grants. It is time for us to enforce our immigration laws. National attention was brought to the consequences of the sanctuary city policies by the death of Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who had previously been convicted of seven felonies and deported five times. If the city of San Francisco had worked with the Federal Government to enforce the Federal immigration law instead of releasing this criminal, Kate Steinle would be alive today. Our current system of laws failed Kate and all those who have died at the hands of convicted felons in this country illegally. The people who I am honored to represent do not understand why some American cities get to flout the law and not cooperate with Federal officials. This legislation makes it clear that they don’t, that sanctuary cities are illegal. By holding these jurisdictions accountable and stopping sanctuary cities, we will make Americans of every background safer on our streets. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ), a dedicated civil rights leader. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3003. In jurisdictions within my district, Cook County, cities like Chicago, Evanston, and Skokie, which are immigrant rich, we have adopted sanctuary cities, sometimes called welcoming cities, ordinances in order to reassure immigrants that they can, with safety, talk to law enforcement within our jurisdictions. Skokie Mayor George Van Dusen said: ‘‘It has taken the Village of Skokie years—decades really—to form the bridges that we have of trust with our immigrant community.’’ These policies work. A January study found that sanctuary cities tend to be safer and have stronger economies than not. This bill would push communities to abandon sanctuary city policies, breaking down that hardearned trust between immigrants and law enforcement. Turning law enforcement into immigration enforcement makes cities less safe. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, it makes immigrants less likely to report crimes. This bill protects criminals in our communities and not victims. I urge my colleagues to vote for safer communities and vote against this bill. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ). Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman GOODLATTE for making sure this bill gets to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I am registering my support for Kate’s Law and H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals—for Criminals—Act. I support these bills for the sake of Kate Steinle and every single one of those who share her tragic fate. She was murdered in broad daylight by a violent, criminal illegal alien. This was an easily preventable and heartbreaking crime, and we simply cannot fail the American people by refusing to act on these bills. The government’s first responsibility is the security and protection of our homeland, a duty that should not be abdicated or yielded based on convenience. In 2011—2011—a GAO study found that aliens committed more than 25,000 homicides, more than 69,000 sexual offenses, 14,000 kidnappings, 42,000 robberies, and 213,000 assaults, among other offenses. Every single one of these is too many. Very few things in this world we can get at 100 percent, but these are 100 percent preventable if these people would not have been here. These are preventable crimes, completely preventable, and we must stop the willful neglect of complacency by government officials who refuse to enforce existing—this is not new. This is existing law we are asking them to enforce, we are requiring them to enforce. According to a March 2017 Washington Times article, nearly 500 jurisdictions have sanctuary policies that block—that block—that limit ICE from apprehending criminal aliens. A January 2017 article from the Washington Examiner reported that, from January 2014 to September 2015, sanctuary jurisdictions rejected 17,000 ICE detainers. Those are 17,000 criminals that are out on the street that we know about that we let go. Adding insult to injury, these sanctuary jurisdictions seek Federal funds to help them defy Federal law enforcement efforts to remove the dangerous criminal aliens from the streets. Mr. Speaker, it is time to put Americans first, and we support the restoration of law and order by supporting these proposals. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 71⁄2minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Virginia has 3
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOFGREN ) for a unanimous consent request. (Ms. LOFGREN asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD letters from the National Fraternal Order of Police; Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force; National League of Cities; U.S. Conference of Mayors; and the National Association of Counties in opposition to this bill. 
NATIONAL FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE, Washington, DC, 27 June 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. KEVIN O. M CCARTHY , Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY P. P ELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. STENY H. H OYER , Minority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER AND REPRESENTATIVES  MCCARTHY , PELOSI AND HOYER : I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to reiterate the FOP’s opposition to any amendment or piece of legislation that would penalize law enforcement agencies by withholding Federal funding or resources from law enforcement assistance programs in an effort to coerce a policy change at the local level. The House will consider H.R. 3003 on the floor this week and Section 2 of this bill would restrict the hiring program administered by the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (ByrneJAG) programs, as well as programs administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The FOP has been very clear on this issue: we strongly believe that local and State law enforcement agencies should cooperate with their Federal counterparts. That being said, withholding needed assistance to law enforcement agencies—which have no policymaking role—also hurts public safety efforts. Local police departments answer to local civilian government and it is the local government which enacts statutes and ordinances in their communities. Law enforcement officers have no more say in these matters than any other citizen and—with laws like the Hatch Act in place—it can be argued they have less. Law enforcement officers do not get to pick and choose which laws to enforce, and must carry out lawful orders at the direction of their commanders and the civilian government that employs them. It is unjust to penalize law enforcement and the citizens they serve because Congress disagrees with their enforcement priorities with respect to our nation’s immigration laws. The FOP issued a statement in January of this year regarding the approach of the Administration on sanctuary cities as outlined in President Trump’s Executive Order. The President recognized that it is unfair to penalize the law enforcement agencies serving these jurisdictions for the political decisions of local officials. It allows the U.S. Attorney General and Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to make an informed decision about the public safety impact without an automatic suspension from Federal grant programs. In Section 2 of H.R. 3003, there is no such discretion and it countermands the Administration’s existing policy. The FOP opposed several bills in the previous Congress, which were outlined in a letter to the Senate leadership, and we will continue to work against proposals that would reduce or withhold funding or resources from any Federal program for local and State law enforcement. If Congress wishes to effect policy changes in these sanctuary cities, it must find another way to do so. On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police, I want to urge the House to reject H.R. 3003’s punitive approach and work with law enforcement to find a better way to improve public safety in our communities. Please feel free to contact me or my Senior Advisor Jim Pasco in my Washington office if I can be of any further assistance. Sincerely, CHUCK CANTERBURY , National President. 
LAWENFORCEMENT  IMMIGRATION TASKFORCE , June 28, 2017. DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS : As law enforcement leaders dedicated to preserving the safety and security of our communities, we have concerns about legislative proposals that would attempt to impose punitive, ‘‘onesizefitsall’’ policies on state and local law enforcement. Rather than strengthening state and local law enforcement by providing us with the tools to work with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a manner that is responsive to the needs of our communities, these proposals would represent a step backwards. Attempts to defund socalled sanctuary cities regularly sweep too broadly, punishing jurisdictions that engage in wellestablished community policing practices or adhere to federal court decisions that have found federal immigration detainers to violate constitutional protections. We oppose these approaches and urge Congress to work to encourage—rather than compel—law enforcement agency cooperation within our federal system. We believe that law enforcement should not cut corners. Multiple federal courts have questioned the legality and constitutionality of federal immigration detainers that are not accompanied by a criminal warrant signed by a judge. Even though the legality of such immigration holds is doubtful, some have proposed requiring states and localities to enforce them, shielding them from lawsuits. While this approach would reduce potential legal liability faced by some jurisdictions and departments, we are concerned these proposals would still require our agencies and officers carry out federal directives that could violate the U.S. Constitution, which we are sworn to follow. Immigration enforcement is, first and foremost, a federal responsibility. Making our communities safer means better defining roles and improving relationships between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. But in attempting to defund ‘‘sanctuary cities’’ and require state and local law enforcement agencies. Local control has been a beneficial approach for law enforcement for decades—having the federal government compel state and local law enforcement to carry out new and sometimes problematic tasks undermines the delicate federal balance and will harm locallybased policing. Rather than requiring state and local law enforcement agencies to engage in additional immigration enforcement activities, Congress should focus on overdue reforms of the broken immigration system to allow state and local law enforcement to focus their resources on true threats—dangerous criminals and criminal organizations. We believe that state and local law enforcement must work together with federal authorities to protect our communities and that we can best serve our communities by leaving the enforcement of immigration laws to the federal government. Threatening the removal of valuable grant funding that contributes to the health and wellbeing of communities across the nation would not make our communities safer and would not fix any part of our broken immigraton system. Our immigration problem is a national problem deserving of a national approach, and we continue to recognize that what our broken system truly needs is a permanent legislative solution—broadbased immigration reform.

NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES , Cleveland, OH, June 28, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 19,000 cities and towns represented by the National League of Cities (NLC), I am writing to express our strong opposition to the ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act’’ (H.R. 3003). The bill, which was made public just recently, completely bypassed the House Judiciary Committee and includes provisions that will result in violations of due process and the Fourth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution. We are very troubled by the fact that the bill—which preempts local authority, jeopardizes public safety, and exposes local governments to litigation and potential liability—was drafted with no input from local officials. NLC has consistently opposed federal legislation that would impose harmful sanctions on local governments—sanctions that prohibit or restrict compliance when a detainer request is issued by the Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Specifically, NLC has significant concerns with the provisions in H.R. 3003 that: 1. Undermine local government’s authority to govern their public safety and local law enforcement programs. The bill would prevent localities from establishing laws or policies that prohibit or ‘‘in any way’’ restrict compliance with or cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. H.R. 3003 would strip local governments ability to enact commonsense crime prevention policies that ensure victims of crime will seek protection and report crimes. 2. Penalize local governments that fail to comply with federal immigration efforts with the denial of federal funding for critical law enforcement, national security, drug treatment, and crime victim initiatives, including the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and Byrne JAG programs that provide hundreds of millions of dollars to localities nationwide. 
3. Compel local governments to honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests, even though the federal courts have determined the that ICE use of detainers violates the Fourth Amendment, and that localities may be held liable for honoring them. 4. Expand ICE’s detainer authority requiring localities to hold undocumented immigrants for up to 96 hours, which is twice what is currently allowed even if probable cause has not been shown. The bill also does not provide any additional funding to local governments to cover the costs associated with detaining the undocumented immigrants. Requiring cities to shoulder the financial burden being forced upon them with no input impacts our ability to pay for essential infrastructure and services such as roads, schools and libraries. 5. Create a ‘‘private right of action’’ that would allow crime victims or their family members to sue localities if the crime was committed by someone who was released by the locality that did not honor an ICE detainer request. This provision could allow frivolous lawsuits against a local government by anyone who alleges that they were a victim of a crime committed by an immigrant. 6. Compel local governments to utilize their local law enforcement resources to implement federal civil immigration enforcement in violation of the Tenth Amendment’s ‘‘commandeering’’ principle. The Tenth Amendment does not permit the federal government to force counties and cities to allocate local resources, including police officers, technology, and personnel, to enforce federal immigration law. The federal government also cannot withhold funds from localities refusing to participate in federal efforts if the programs affected are unrelated to the purpose of the federal program, or if the sanctions are punitive in nature. Since the inception of the United States of America, lawful immigrants and refugees have played a vital role in the civic, economic and social life of cities. We recognize that local governments address issues associated with federal immigration laws in a variety of ways that best meet the needs of all their residents. Some cities provide greater leniency towards undocumented immigrants who do not violate state and local laws by not dedicating municipal resources to enforce federal immigration laws. Unfortunately, these cities are wrongfully characterized as safe havens for undocumented immigrants who violate state and local laws. We believe the power to enforce federal immigration laws remains exclusively a federal power and we strongly oppose federal efforts to commandeer our local law enforcement to take on the duties of federal immigration enforcement agents. Our nation’s local elected officials call on you to do the right thing and vote against H.R. 3003 when it is considered on the floor. We urge you to move beyond punitive bills like H.R. 3003 and work with us to develop a positive legislation that will fix our broken immigration system and make our cities safer. Thank you for your leadership and for willingness to stand up for America’s cities by voting against this legislation that would impose harmful sanctions on local governments. Sincerely, MATTZONE, President, National League of Cities, Ward 15 Councilman. THEUNITED STATES CONFERENCE  
OFMAYORS , Washington, DC, June 26, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : I write to register the strong opposition of the nation’s mayors to H.R. 3003, a partisan bill that seeks to punish socalled ‘‘sanctuary cities,’’ which is expected to be considered by the full House this week. The U.S. Conference of Mayors represents well over a thousand mayors and nearly 150 million people. Today, we concluded the 85th Annual Meeting of The U.S. Conference of Mayors and adopted policy that reinforces and builds on previous positions we have taken which oppose provisions in this bill. Specifically, the nation’s mayors: urge members of Congress to withdraw legislation that attempts to cut local law enforcement funding necessary to ensure the safety of our communities, indemnify conduct that violates the constitutional rights afforded to both United States citizens and immigrant populations, and further criminalizes immigration and infringes on the rights of immigrant; oppose punitive policies that limit local control and discretion, and urge instead that Congress and the Administration pursue immigration enforcement policies that recognize that local law enforcement has limited resources and community trust is critical to local law enforcement and the safety of our communities; oppose federal policies that commandeer local law enforcement or require local authorities to violate, or be placed at risk of violating, a person’s Fourth Amendment rights; expend limited resources to act as immigration agents; or otherwise assist federal immigration authorities beyond what is determined by local policy. H.R. 3003 would do all of these things and more: It would jeopardize public safety by withholding critical public safety funding from jurisdictions that tell their police officers not to ask an individual their immigration status. Many departments have such policies to encourage crime victims and witnesses to report crimes and to build trust with immigrant communities. It would put jurisdictions at risk of violating an individual’s Fourth Amendment rights by establishing probable cause standards for ICE’s issuance of detainers that do not require a judicial determination of probable cause. Numerous federal courts have found that continued detention under an ICE detainer, absent probable cause, would state a claim for a violation of the Fourth Amendment and subject the detaining officer or jurisdiction to civil liability. While it says it would provide immunity to jurisdictions which comply with detainers and hold them harmless in any suits filed against them, they would still be subject to Fourth Amendment challenges. Further compelling and expanding compliance with certain enforcement provisions, such as immigration detainers, and cutting off federal funding to jurisdictions which do not comply with these provisions likely conflict with the Tenth Amendment. H.R. 3003 is a bad bill for our cities and their residents and for our nation. It would jeopardize public safety, preempt local authority, and expose local governments to litigation and potential findings of damages. America’s mayors call on you to do the right thing and vote against H.R. 3003 when it is considered on the floor. The U.S. Conference of Mayors urges you instead to focus on positive legislation that will fix our broken immigration system and make our cities safer. The nation’s mayors pledge to work with you on bipartisan immigration reform legislation that will fix our nation’s broken immigration system. We need to move beyond punitive bills like H.R. 3003 and develop an immigration system that works for our nation, our cities and our people. To make our cities safer we urge you to consider legislation that will help us to fight crime and prevent terrorism. The U.S. Conference of Mayors and the Major Cities Chiefs Association agree that to make the streets of America safe, Congress must act to strengthen bonds between communities and police, expand homeland security grants, invest in mental health and substance abuse services, reduce gun violence, and reform the criminal justice system and strengthen reentry services. Sincerely, MITCHELL J. L ANDRIEU , Mayor of New Orleans, President. 
MAJOR COUNTY SHERIFFS OF AMERICA AND NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  COUNTIES , June 29, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY , Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. STENY HOYER , Minority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. S PEAKER , M AJORITY LEADER  MCCARTHY AND REPRESENTATIVES PELOSI AND  HOYER : On behalf of the Major County Sheriffs of America (MCSA) and the National Association of Counties (NACo), we write to express our commitment to work with Congress and the Administration on measures to prevent crime and violence, but are concerned that H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act is not an effective approach. While we applaud measures to protect the public from repeat, violent predators, we cannot support further cuts in funding that weaken crime prevention efforts, officer recruitment, and safety and wellness programs. Most sheriffs want to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) so that it may remove criminal illegal aliens from the United States, but sheriffs must follow the law that has rendered current ICE requests illegal. Without proper arrest authority, sheriffs cannot willfully disregard an individual’s 4th amendment rights as articulated in these court cases. Make no mistake, the American public has a right to know which jurisdictions are blatantly ignoring the rule of law and are endangering community safety and they should be held accountable. If a jurisdiction is following the law of its state or a binding court ruling, it is misguided for Congress to cut funding for programs that support State and local law enforcement agencies in nearly every jurisdiction in this country. ICE’s removal of illegal aliens who are committing crimes in our communities is important to ensure public safety. Their removal mitigates the drain on sheriffs’ resources by ensuring these criminals are not sitting in our jails and that our deputies are not continually investigating their crimes. As leaders in law enforcement, the MCSA been working collaboratively with the Department of Homeland Security to find an agreeable solution that is lawful, effects good public safety policy, and allows ICE to effectively do its job of removing criminal illegal aliens from our country. We know Members of Congress believe that efforts to stop violence in American cities 
must be strengthened, not weakened. While we appreciate Congress’ support for law enforcement, we strongly feel a law enforcement grant penalty solution would not only negatively impact law enforcement efforts across the country, but also not achieve its intended purpose. Very Respectfully, MICHAEL J. B OUCHARD , Sheriff, Oakland County (MI), Vice President—Government Affairs, Major County Sheriffs of America (MCSA). MATTHEW D. C HASE , Executive Director, National Association of Counties (NACo). 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. PANETTA ). Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to H.R. 3003 because, if this bill passed, it would punish our communities more than it would punish the criminals. As written, this bill would deny critical funding for our police departments. As a former 20year prosecutor in local counties, I know firsthand how much our local police rely on Federal funding not just to do their job, but to be safe when they keep our communities safe. Any decrease in any sort of funding would decrease the safety of our officers as they strive to protect and serve our communities. This law will not only affect our police officers’ safety, but it will negatively affect the sense of security in our communities. Yes, the underlying intent of the law is to make it easier for ICE to target undocumented people who are criminals—I get it—but it is not that simple. In the past few months, my district has seen two largescale raids by ICE. Yes, they swept up criminals, but they also snagged collaterals, lawabiding people who were here in the wrong place at the right time. Those operations cast a complete pall over the community that affected our ability to enforce our laws. As a gang prosecutor, over and over I experienced people who were afraid to come forward out of fear of retaliation. Now they are afraid of the police, afraid of the courts, and afraid of our government. That is why I am opposed to H.R. 3003. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOFGREN ), a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to reflect back on why localities adopt these community trust policies. The chairman of the committee mentioned somebody in San Francisco who is suing the city. In a way, that shows the efficacy of the trust policies. This man, Mr. FigueroaZarceno, was a victim of crime. His truck was stolen. He went into the police department to report that his truck was stolen. There was a removal order that was 10 or 20 years old. He has an American citizen child. He is a working person. When he went outside, he was picked up by ICE. I think what that tells other people who are victims of crime who might have an outstanding removal order is: Don’t report the crime. It is one thing if you have lost your truck. It has been stolen. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. CONYERS. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. Ms. LOFGREN. Not that I am for stealing trucks, but here is a bigger problem. The cities of Houston and Los Angeles report a dramatic dropoff in reports of sexual violence. Why? Because immigrants are afraid to report; and not just because they might be undocumented, but they might have a sister or a nextdoor neighbor or a spouse who is undocumented, even if they are a citizen. So what has happened is with these threats come an unwillingness of immigrants to report crime, to be witnesses to crime, to keep our communities safe. These stories that we have heard of the victims of crime are heartbreaking, but we are not without remedies under current law. The most important law in our country is the Constitution. The Constitution includes the Fourth Amendment. b1515 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again expired. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Ms. LOFGREN. The Constitution is the most important law we have. We read it aloud on the first day of our Congress. It includes the Fourth Amendment, which requires probable cause and warrants. A bunch of courts have made that ruling relative to detainers. Well, that doesn’t leave the Federal Government without remedies. Get a warrant. There is not a jurisdiction in the United States that will not honor a judicial warrant. Don’t blame the local police. Look to the Department of Homeland Security for why they have dropped the ball and been unwilling to take the steps that are well within their authority today to make sure if there is someone that they need, they get a warrant and they obtain that person for whatever is the next step in their process. To somehow suggest that this misguided bill is the answer is a big mistake. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ). Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of this bill today. I stand in support of the rule of law. I stand in support of our institutions. I also stand in memory of Sarah Root, a young woman who was murdered by a drunk driver on January 16. She was killed in my district—or Nebraska 02—a short time after graduating from Bellevue University with a 4.0 grade point average, with a bright future ahead of her. She was loved by her parents and her extended family. If you see her picture, that beautiful smile would warm any room. The perpetrator was here illegally from Honduras. He posted bail and never was seen again. ICE failed to hold him, and justice was denied. We can’t let this happen again. The bill today will fix this. We can’t let a travesty of justice like this ever happen again. Our systems have to hold people accountable. When ICE lets people go like this and they leave, a travesty of justice occurs. Today we stand with Michelle Root, the mother of Sarah Root, who is here, and we stand with Scott Root. We remember Sarah Root, and we say: Never again. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3003 is not making our communities safer. If it was, the bill’s sponsors would have heeded the strong opposition of organizations like the National Fraternal Order of Police, who stated that, ‘‘withholding needed assistance to law enforcement agencies—which have no policymaking role—hurts public safety efforts;’’ and the U.S. Conference of Mayors, who cautioned, ‘‘H.R. 3003 is a bad bill for our cities and their residents and for our Nation. It would jeopardize public safety, preempt local authority, and expose local governments to litigation and potential findings of damage.’’ Instead, this legislation is a down payment on the President’s and the Republican majority’s mass deportation plan. This bill, and the one that we will debate later today, is a portion of the mass deportation bill known as the ‘‘DavisOliver Act,’’ which has been cited as a priority for the Trump administration, and is supported by anti immigrant groups, such as NumbersUSA and the Center for Immigration Studies. I respectfully urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HILL). The gentleman from Virginia has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. First, let me be clear: the only law enforcement agencies that risk losing any Federal grants because of this legislation are those agencies that, without any outside compulsion, deliberately choose to violate Federal law by outright prohibiting their law enforcement officers from voluntarily communicating with ICE and cooperating with it in the enforcement of Federal law. 
Second, let me also be clear that this bill does not require State and local law enforcement agencies to comply with ICE detainers, and it does not seek to cut off any Federal grants to jurisdictions that choose not to comply. Finally, it is a longsettled principle of constitutional law. And let me remind you that all of these law enforcement officers vowed to defend the Constitution, and the Constitution grants supremacy to Federal immigration law. When there is a conflict with Federal immigration law, State laws that are in conflict are invalid, preempted by Federal law under the 10th Amendment. Under the 10th Amendment, State and local law enforcement agencies have no obligation to comply with unconstitutional provisions of State or local law that asks them to violate title 8, United States Code, section 1373. Then, again, getting back to the amazing news that we have, the city of San Francisco has just agreed to pay $190,000 to an illegal alien because the San Francisco sheriff complied with an ICE detainer and turned the alien over to ICE, apparently in violation of San Francisco policy. That individual, under Federal law, because he was the victim of a crime, will be eligible to apply for a U visa. Respect for the rule of law is the way to keep communities safe. Respect for the rule of law is the way to make sure that people like Kate Steinle are not murdered in the city of San Francisco, as we have heard of other murders all during the debate today, by people who are unlawfully present in the United States. Therefore, they are all preventable crimes. Law enforcement in this country needs to cooperate. Most law enforcement officers want that to be done. Let’s support them, let’s support this legislation, and make sure that the rule of law is upheld. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD the following additional letters in opposition to H.R. 3003. These are additional letters of opposition that I mentioned earlier on H.R. 3003. 
JUNE26, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : We write on behalf of the Committee on Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB/ COM), and Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) to express our opposition to H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004. The Catholic Church holds a strong interest in the welfare of migrants and how our nation welcomes and treats them. Our parishes include those with and without immigration status, unfortunately some who have witnessed or been victims of crime in the United States, including domestic violence, armed robbery, and assault. We understand the importance of fostering cooperation and informationsharing between immigrant communities and local law enforcement. We oppose H.R. 3003 because it would impose obligations on local governments that we fear—and that many of them have warned—would undermine authority and discretion of local law enforcement. This, in turn, would hamper the ability of local law enforcement officials to apprehend criminals and ensure public safety in all communities. Furthermore, Section 2 of H.R. 3003 would deny to jurisdictions vital federal funding related to law enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, and naturalization if those jurisdictions are deemed to be noncompliant with H.R. 3003. The Catholic service network, including Catholic Charities, works in partnership with the federal government on a number of Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security initiatives, including disaster response and recovery, naturalization and citizenship services, and services for the immigrant, including victims of human trafficking, and domestic violence. These services are incredibly valuable to the protection and promotion of the human person and in some instances lifesaving. Cutting grants related to these important national objectives, or threat of such cuts, is not humane or just, nor is it in our national interest. Also, we oppose H.R. 3004 as it would lead to an expansion of incarceration and does not include adequate protections for people who reenter the U.S. for humanitarian reasons or seek protection at the border. While H.R. 3004 makes notable efforts to protect us from those convicted of violent criminal offenses, the legislation goes far beyond this goal by expanding the government’s ability to prosecute illegal reentry cases and heightening the criminal penalties in these cases. In an era of fiscal austerity, it is vital that important judicial resources are efficiently utilized to prosecute and convict the most violent offenders of violent crimes. Expanding who is eligible to be prosecuted for entry or reentry as well as enhancing sentencing requirements does not advance the common good nor will it ensure that communities are safer. Furthermore, we are concerned that, as introduced, H.R. 3004 would also prevent vulnerable asylum seekers and unaccompanied children, (who have presented themselves repeatedly at the U.S. border in the flight from violence), from being able to access protection, and instead face fines, imprisonment or both. We respectfully urge you to reject these bills in favor of a more comprehensive and humane approach to immigration reform; an approach that upholds human dignity and family unity and places a greater emphasis on balancing the needs and rights of immigrants with our nation’s best interests and security. The United States has a long and proud history of leadership in welcoming newcomers regardless of their circumstances and promoting the common good. We stand ready to work with you on legislation that more closely adheres to this tradition and appreciate your serious consideration of our views in this regard. Sincerely, MOSTREV. JOEVA´SQUEZ , Bishop of Austin, Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration. SR. DONNA MARKHAM , OP, PHD., President & CEO, Catholic Charities USA. 
NATIONAL TASKFORCE TO END, SEXUAL AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE , June 27, 2017. The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence (NTF), comprised of national leadership organizations advocating on behalf of sexual assault and domestic violence victims and representing hundreds of organizations across the country dedicated to ensuring all survivors of violence receive the protections they deserve, write to express our deep concerns about the impact that H.R. 3003, the ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,’’ and H.R. 3004, or ‘‘Kate’s Law,’’ will have on victims fleeing or recovering from sexual assault, domestic violence, or human trafficking, and on communities at large. This year is the twentythird anniversary of the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act (‘‘VAWA’’) which has, since it was first enacted, included critical protections for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence. H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 will have the effect of punishing immigrant survivors and their children and pushing them into the shadows and into danger, undermining the very purpose of VAWA. Specifically, the nation’s leading national organizations that address domestic and sexual assault oppose H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 because: Community trust policies are critical tools for increasing community safety. Laws that seek to intertwine the federal immigration and local law enforcement systems will undermine the Congressional purpose of protections enacted under VAWA and will have the chilling effect of pushing immigrant victims into the shadows and undermining public safety. Immigration enforcement must be implemented in a way that supports local community policing and sustains community trust in working with local law enforcement. H.R. 3003 runs contrary to community policing efforts and will deter immigrant domestic violence and sexual assault survivors not only from reporting crimes, but also from seeking help for themselves and their children. While H.R. 3003 does not require that local law enforcement arrest or report immigrant victims or witnesses of criminal activity, the language in the bill provides no restriction prohibiting such practices. Perpetrators use fear of deportation as tool of abuse. Local policies that minimize the intertwining of local law enforcement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) help protect the most vulnerable victims by creating trust between law enforcement and the immigrant community, which in turn help protect entire communities. Abusers and traffickers use the fear of deportation of their victims as a tool to silence and trap them. If immigrants are afraid to call the police because of fear of deportation, they become more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Not only are the individual victims and their children harmed, but their fear of law enforcement leads many to abstain from reporting violent perpetrators or seeking protection and, as a result, dangerous criminals are not identified and go unpunished. As VAWA recognizes, immigrant victims of violent crimes often do not contact law enforcement due to fear that they will be deported. Immigrants are already afraid of contacting the police and HR 3003 proposes to further intertwine federal immigration and local law enforcement systems will only exacerbate this fear. The result is that perpetrators will be able to continue to harm others, both immigrant and U.S. Citizen victims alike. Since January of 2017, victim advocates have been describing the immense fear expressed by immigrant victims and their reluctance to reach out for help from police. A recent survey of over 700 advocates and attorneys at domestic violence and sexual assault programs indicate that immigrant victims are expressing heightened fears and concerns about immigration enforcement, with 78 percent of advocates and attorneys reporting that victims are describing fear of contacting the police; 75 percent 
of them reporting that victims are afraid of going to court; and 43 percent reporting working with immigrant victims who are choosing not to move forward with criminal charges or obtaining protective orders. In addition, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck, reporting of sexual assault and domestic violence among Latinos has dropped significantly this year, possibly due to concerns that police interaction could result in deportation. According to Chief Beck, reports of sexual assault have dropped 25 percent among Los Angeles’ Latino population since the beginning of the year compared to a three percent drop among nonLatino victims. Similarly, reports of spousal abuse among Latinos fell by about 10 percent among Latinos whereas the decline among nonLatinos was four percent. The Houston Police Department reported in April that the number of Hispanics reporting rape is down 42.8 percent from last year. In Denver, CO, the Denver City Attorney has reported that some domestic violence victims are declining to testify in court. As of late February, the City Attorney’s Office had dropped four cases because the victims fear that ICE officers will arrest and deport them. Both the City Attorney and Aurora Police Chief have spoken on the importance of having trust with the immigrant community in order to maintain public safety and prosecute crime. H.R. 3003 Will Unfairly Punish Entire communities. H.R. 3003 punishes localities that follow Constitutional guidelines and refuse to honor detainer requests that are not supported by due process mandates. H.R. 3003 likely covers more than 600 jurisdictions across the country, most of which do not characterize their policies to follow constitutional mandates as ‘‘sanctuary’’ policies. H.R. 3003 penalizes jurisdictions by eliminating their access to various federal grants, including federal law enforcement grants, such as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and other federal grants related to law enforcement or immigration, such as those that fund forensic rape kit analysis. Withholding federal law enforcement funding would, ironically, undermine the ability of local jurisdictions to combat and prevent crime in their communities. In addition, the fiscal impact of both H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 will result in limited federal law enforcement resources being further reduced as a result of shifting funding from enforcing federal criminal laws addressing violent crimes, including those protecting victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking, to the detention and prosecution of many nonviolent immigration law violaters. H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 Will Unfairly Punish Victims. By greatly expanding mandatory detention and expanding criminal penalties for reentry, H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 will have harsh consequences for immigrant survivors. Victims of human trafficking, sexual assault, and domestic violence are often at risk of being arrested and convicted. In recognition of this fact, existing ICE guidance cites the example of when police respond to a domestic violence call, both parties may be arrested or a survivor who acted in selfdefense may be wrongly accused. In addition, if the abuser speaks English better than the survivor, or if other language or cultural barriers (or fear of retaliation from the abuser) prevent the survivor from fully disclosing the abuse suffered, a survivor faces charges and tremendous pressure to plead guilty (without being advised about the longterm consequences) in order to be released from jail and reunited with her children. In addition, victims of trafficking are often arrested and convicted for prostitutionrelated offenses. These victims are often desperate to be released and possibly to be reunited with their children following their arrests or pending trial. These factors—combined with poor legal counsel, particularly about the immigration consequences of criminal pleas and convictions—have in the past and will likely continue to lead to deportation of wrongly accused victims who may have pled to or been unfairly convicted of domestic violence charges and/or prostitution. H.R. 3003 imposes harsh criminal penalties and H.R. 3004 imposes expanded bases for detention without consideration of mitigating circumstances or humanitarian exceptions for these victims. In addition, H.R. 3004 expands the criminal consequences for reentry in the U.S. without recognizing the compelling humanitarian circumstances in which victims who have been previously removed return for their safety. Victims of domestic and sexual violence and trafficking fleeing violence in their countries of origin will be penalized for seeking protection from harm. In recent years, women and children fleeing rampant violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, have fled to the United States, seeking refuge. Frequently, because of inadequate access to legal representation, they are unable to establish their eligibility for legal protections in the United States, resulting in their removal. In many cases, the risk of domestic violence, sexual assault, and/or human trafficking in their countries of origin remain unabated and victims subsequently attempt to reenter the U.S. to protect themselves and their children. Other victims of domestic and sexual violence and trafficking may be deported because their abusers or traffickers isolate them, or prevent them from obtaining lawful immigration status. They are deported, with some victims having to leave their children behind in the custody of their abusers or traffickers. Under H.R. 3004, these victims risk harsh criminal penalties for reentry for attempting to protect themselves and their children. On behalf of the courageous survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking and human trafficking that our organizations serve, we urge you to vote against HR 3003 and 3004, and to affirm the intent and spirit of VAWA by supporting strong relationships between law enforcement and immigrant communities, which is critical for public safety in general, and particularly essential for domestic and sexual violence victims and their children. Sincerely, THENATIONAL TASKFORCE TO ENDSEXUAL  
JUNE28, 2017. Re Vote NO on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003, and Kate’s Law, H.R. 3004. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 407 undersigned local, state, and national immigrant, civil rights, faithbased, and labor organizations, we urge you to oppose the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate’s Law, H.R. 3004, and any similar legislation that jeopardizes public safety, erodes the goodwill forged between local police and its residents, and perpetuates the criminalization and incarceration of immigrants. H.R. 3003 would strip badly needed law enforcement funding for state and local jurisdictions, runs afoul of the Tenth and Fourth Amendment, and unnecessarily expands the government’s detention apparatus. H.R. 3004 unwisely expands the federal government’s ability to criminally prosecute immigrants for immigrationbased offenses, excludes critical humanitarian protections for those fleeing violence, and doubles down on the failed experiment of incarceration for immigration violations. Over 600 state and local jurisdictions have policies or ordinances that disentangle their state and local law enforcement agencies from enforcing federal immigration law. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003, seeks to attack socalled ‘‘sanctuary’’ jurisdictions (many of whom do not consider themselves as such) by penalizing state and local jurisdictions that follow the Fourth Ameniment of the U.S. Constitution by refusing to honor constitutionally infirm requests for detainers. H.R. 3003 penalizes jurisdictions by eliminating various federal grants, including funding through the Cops on the Beat program, the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and any other federal grant related to law enforcement or immigration. Importantly, using the threat of withholding federal grants to coerce state and local jurisdictions likely runs afoul of the Tenth Amendment’s prohibition on commandeering, a position supported by over 300 law professors. ‘‘Sanctuary’’ policies are critical to promote public safety for local communities. Fearing referral to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, victims and witnesses of crime are significantly less likely to communicate with local law enforcement. Local law enforcement authorities have repeatedly echoed this sentiment, acknowledging that community policing policies are paramount to enhancing public safety. Indeed, ‘‘sanctuary’’ jurisdictions have less crime and more economic development than similarly situated non‘‘sanctuary’’ jurisdictions. Withholding criticallyneeded federal funding would, paradoxically, severely cripple the ability of state and local jurisdictions to satisfy the public safety needs of their communities. Kate’s Law, H.R. 3004, would further criminalize the immigrant community by drastically increasing penalties for immigrants convicted of unlawful reentry. Operation Streamline encapsulates our nation’s failed experiment with employing criminal penalties to deter migration. Under Operation Streamline, the federal government prosecutes immigrants for reentry at significant rates. By all practical measures, Operation Streamline has failed to deter migration, wasted billions of taxpayer dollars, and unfairly punished thousands of immigrants who try to enter or reenter the United States to reunite with their children and loved ones. We fear that H.R. 3004’s increased penalties for reentry would double down on this failed strategy, explode the prison population, and cost billions of dollars. Instead of passing discredited enforcement only legislation, Congress should move forward on enacting just immigration reform legislation that provides a roadmap to citizenship for the nation’s eleven million aspiring Americans and eliminates mass detention and deportation programs that undermine fundamental human rights. Legislation that erodes public safety, disrespects local democratic processes, and raises serious constitutional concerns represents an abdication of the Congress’ responsibility to enact fair, humane, and just immigration policy. In light of the above, we urge you to vote NO on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate’s Law, H.R. 3004. Please contact Jose MaganaSalgado, of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, if you have any questions regarding this letter. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely,

Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today not just as a Member of Congress, but as a 27year veteran of law enforcement and as a former police chief. As such, I am compelled to warn of the harm this bill, in its current form, will cause for our law enforcement agencies. As a police chief, it was my responsibility to reduce crime and maintain livable neighborhoods; neighborhoods where families can live in peace, and enjoy local parks, community centers, restaurants, and shopping; neighborhoods where children can walk to school and play in their front yard and backyard without fear. That is the kind of community that everyone in America deserves—one where they feel safe and secure. H.R. 3003 impedes on law enforcement’s ability to effectively do its job. It will create an environment that will erode the trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. The local police are the first ones to respond. They are the thin blue line that stands between those who are in this country, who are trying to live in peace, and those that would do them harm. We want our neighbors—immigrants—to call the police to report crimes without fear or hesitation. When they do not, Mr. Speaker, our community is at the mercy of the criminals. This does not make our communities more safe, yet that is what is at stake with the bill before us. Supporters of the bill claim that it has an exemption for victims and witnesses, but it is not a complete exemption. Law enforcement officers investigate and interview witnesses. Their goal is to solve crimes, regardless of the immigration status of victims and witnesses, including victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. I filed an amendment with the Rules Committee that would have exempted victims and witnesses from all of the bill’s intrusive requirements. The Rules Committee blocked me from offering that amendment, but the bill, in its current form, would undermine law enforcement’s ability to do its job, therefore, making our communities less safe. Mr. Speaker, don’t just take my word for it. The National Fraternal Order of Police stands against the bill. They represent over 330,000 law enforcement officers across the Nation. These officers are not responsible for creating laws, and eliminating Federal grant funding for political reasons impedes their ability to solve crimes. As the FOP writes: Withholding assistance to law enforcement agencies, which have no policymaking rule, will hurt public safety efforts. 
No one knows our communities better than the law enforcement officials sworn to protect their communities, which is why I have offered this motion which would exempt from the mandates and penalties in the bill those jurisdictions in which local law enforcement officials conclude that the mandates in this bill would endanger public safety. Politics should never impede public safety. The President has said that, when lawmakers vote on this bill, they should put America’s safety first. I strongly agree, and I urge my colleagues to support this motion and put our public safety first. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman is quite correct: everyone deserves to feel safe. Kate Steinle deserved to feel safe when she was walking down the pier with her father in San Francisco, when she was killed. Not enacting this legislation endangers public safety, not the opposite, as those on the other side have argued. How would you trust local government officials, who have instructed their law enforcement officers to not cooperate with Federal law enforcement officers to take dangerous criminals off of our streets, when this motion to recommit would say: ‘‘Oh, they will have to certify that such compliance would endanger public safety and then the law wouldn’t apply?’’ 
It is circular reasoning. The nonenforcement of immigration laws has led to the bolstering of sanctuary jurisdiction policies in communities throughout the United States. These policies hamper the enforcement of Federal law and do nothing to truly promote trust between law enforcement and U.S. citizens. This bill provides a commonsense approach to fixing the damage caused by sanctuary policies without mandating any affirmative duty. In order to be in compliance with section 1373 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended in this bill, States and localities have no affirmative duties to act. They have no obligations to cooperate or communicate, or even engage with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at any level. b1530 Instead, they simply may not affirmatively restrict a government entity, including law enforcement, from cooperating or communicating with ICE. So I am shocked that so many on the other side of the aisle view compliance with this provision as a condition for eligibility for certain grant programs as outlandish. This is not a novel concept. And compliance with section 1373 is already a condition of eligibility for these grant programs. As for detainers, H.R. 3003 creates the probable cause standard that so many have argued was lacking for so long. Once enacted, States and localities can look to Federal law to receive clarification on what probable cause standard is employed before a detainer request is placed. To further aid jurisdictions, the threat of expensive and timeconsuming frivolous litigation is abated by providing immunity for jurisdictions that exercise good faith in honoring a detainer. Finally, this bill ensures that dangerous criminal aliens convicted of drunk driving or not yet convicted of very serious crimes are prevented from freely walking the streets of our communities during their removal hearings. This bill is a strong first step in ensuring that our immigration laws are enforced. I urge my colleagues to vote down this motion to recommit, to vote for the base bill, and to send a message that sanctuary policies will not be tolerated so that the rule of law will prevail. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
KATE’S LAW Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 415, I call up the bill (H.R. 3004) to amend section 276 of the Immigration and Nationality Act relating to reentry of removed aliens, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 415, the bill is considered read. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3004 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
Section 276 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1326) is amended to read as follows: ‘‘
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks, and include extraneous material on H.R. 3004. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, for too long, illegal reentry of criminal aliens has been viewed as a minor felony with only a fraction of those repeat offenders ever seeing the inside of a Federal courtroom. Section 276 of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides Federal prosecutors with the tools necessary to truly deter criminal aliens from reentering the United States. Unfortunately, the section simply does not go far enough to act as a deterrent. Criminal aliens view the risk as worth the reward, as most charged under this section of law are given minuscule sentences that belie the severity of the crime. Aliens who reenter the United States after being removed, demonstrate a flagrant disregard for our immigration laws and pose a tremendous threat to public safety and national security in every community nationwide. This Congress has heard from countless victims and family members of victims whose lives were forever changed or completely destroyed by criminal aliens preying on our citizens. This bill is named in memory and in honor of Kate Steinle. On July 1, 2015, Ms. Steinle was enjoying an evening at a popular attraction in San Francisco with her father. As three shots were fired, Ms. Steinle collapsed screaming. Her father, Jim, performed CPR until paramedics arrived, but she ultimately succumbed to the severe damage caused by the bullet and she died hours later. Her murderer was arrested an hour later and identified as a middleaged criminal alien who had been removed from the United States and had returned at least five times. The gun used had been stolen from a Federal officer with the Bureau of Land Management. Mr. Speaker, these horrific events must be better deterred and prevented. No legislation can prevent every tragic situation, but this Congress has a duty to take every action possible to mitigate this harm and danger. It is in this vein that I am proud to bring Kate’s Law to the House floor today. This bill seeks to amend and greatly improve section 276 of the Immigration and Nationality Act by enhancing the maximum sentences for criminal aliens who seek to reenter the United States. While an alien reentering this country is subject to a sentence of up to 2 years, current law only subjects certain criminals to enhance penalties. Specifically, only criminal aliens previously convicted of an aggravated felony, as defined in our immigration laws, controlled substance violations, crimes against other persons, or certain felonies would trigger an enhanced sentence of either 10 or 20 years. Kate’s Law closes the loophole into which so many criminal aliens fall. The bill provides that a criminal alien, previously convicted of any three misdemeanors or any felony, would, upon conviction for illegal reentry, be subject to a maximum sentence of 10 years. Aliens previously convicted of a crime for which they were sentenced to at least 30 months, would, upon conviction for illegal reentry, be subject to a maximum sentence of 15 years. Aliens previously convicted of a crime for which they were sentenced to at least 60 months, would, upon conviction for illegal reentry, be subject to a maximum sentence of 20 years. Aliens previously convicted for murder, rape, kidnapping, a peonage offense, or any three felonies, would, under conviction for illegal reentry, be subject to a maximum sentence of 25 years. These are significant enhancements to our immigration laws and are long overdue. I would be remiss, however, if I failed to mention a caveat added to the bill. If enacted, Kate’s Law adds affirmative defenses for aliens charged under this section. If an alien can prove that they had the express consent of the Secretary of Homeland Security to reapply for admission, or that an alien previously denied admission and removed was not required to obtain such consent, then the alien may present that as an affirmative defense to the illegal reentry crime. This safeguard will ensure that only aliens who illegally reenter the United States may be convicted and sentenced to enhanced penalties under this section. This is missing from the current statute, and I am sure my colleagues on both side of the aisle would agree that due process protections such as these add to the efficacy of such a measure. Nothing that this Congress can pass will ever bring Kate Steinle back, nor take away the pain suffered by her family, and countless other victims of crimes committed by criminal aliens. Kate’s Law, however, will offer a deterrent against future criminal aliens who seek to illegally reenter the United States. Knowing they may face up to 2 years in Federal prison is one thing, but the possibility of a sentence of 10, 15, 20, or 25 years will have the desired effect. I agree with many of my colleagues on both side of the aisle that we must take many other steps to address our immigration system. This Congress must pass strong measures to ensure that immigration enforcement in the interior of the United States remains a priority. Kate’s Law is an essential component of that larger effort to bring about true enforcement of our immigration laws, and protect this Nation from criminal aliens. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3004 is an antiimmigrant enforcementonly proposal that represents yet another step in President Trump’s mass deportation plan. This legislation significantly expands the Federal Government’s ability to prosecute individuals for illegal entry and attempted reentry into the United States. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say this bill is about protecting us from criminals. But don’t be fooled about the ultimate effect of this bill. It does far more than target immigrants with criminal histories. For the first time, this legislation would make it a felony for an individual who has been previously removed or merely denied admission to come to an official port of entry to ask for reentry into the country legally. This is true even if the individual has no criminal history whatsoever. For instance, the expanded offense would apply to persecuted asylum seekers voluntarily presenting themselves at a port of entry to request asylum under our own immigration laws. It would reach desperate victims of sex trafficking who approach the Customs and Border Protection officer to seek protection. It would even extend to persons asking to enter on humanitarian parole to donate lifesaving organs to United States citizen relatives. Under H.R. 3004, all of these individuals could face up to 2 years in prison simply for coming to an official port of entry to request immigration benefits provided under our immigration laws. Finally, this bill perpetuates the fiction that immigrants are somehow inherently criminal. Nothing could be further from the truth. Numerous studies examining this issue conclude that immigrants actually commit crimes at a significantly lower rate than native born Americans. Given this legislation’s defects, it comes to us as no surprise that organizations across the Nation join with me in opposition. They include: The conservative Cato Institute, which called H.R. 3004, ‘‘a waste of Federal resources’’ that fails to safeguard ‘‘Americans against serious criminals.’’ Cities For Action, representing over 150 mayors and municipal leaders, warned the bill would place asylum seekers at further risk. And the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, which described how this measure, H.R. 3004, will punish victims of domestic and sexual violence merely for requesting protection. H.R. 3004 is not what its sponsors would like us to believe. In truth, it is a meanspirited bill that would have farreaching consequences by making it a crime to ask for benefits that our immigration laws provide. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this dangerous legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Iowa (Mr. K ING), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for working this legislation through and facilitating that it comes to the floor this week. This week, the event of ‘‘Hold Their Feet to the Fire’’ is being held where many of the families of those who have been killed by illegal aliens are here to contribute. They went to the White House, and the message has been sent across the country. They have gone and done radio shows, and they have been part of this for a long time. I think of how far back this goes, Kate Steinle’s law. From my perspective, she was murdered on the streets of San Francisco on July 1, 2015. It hit the news, I think, the next day. I sent out a tweet on July 3 that said it was a 100 percent preventable crime. Just enforce the law. This story will make you cry, too. And it happens every day. What we are trying to accomplish with Kate’s Law is sentencing that is enhanced for those who overstay or those who have been deported from the United States and come back into the United States. I want to compliment former Congressman Matt Salmon from Arizona, who, after her death on July 1, introduced legislation only 8 days later, which was the foundation for what we are talking about here with this bill. That was H.R. 3011, introduced on July 9, 2015. b1545 Matt is retired. I picked up that legislation in the first days of this year, and we have cooperated in this Judiciary Committee to get this here to this time. But, also, Bill O’Reilly, who made this a national issue, it hit my heart as soon as I saw the story. It hit the hearts of America when it went out over television, and it is too bad that we can’t look at data and come here and fix a massive problem that we have. It is too bad it has to be focused on individuals and personalities, when there are many other families out there that have suffered equally with that of the Steinle family and the other families we have talked about here today. Nonetheless, if that is what it takes to get America to move, we are here now. We are here this week. We have the right legislation in front of us. I urge its adoption. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOFGREN ), our senior Representative on the Judiciary Committee. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. The bill is part of a larger mass deportation bill marked up by the House Judiciary Committee earlier this month. I think the message it is intended to convey is that this bill is needed to keep us safe. We have heard the sad story of the murder of Kate Steinle, which was not news to any of us in northern California. That was a horrible murder, and the fact is, this bill would not have prevented that murder. The offender had been deported multiple times. He had served 16 years in Federal prison, so the idea that the 10year enhancement would have somehow fixed this is just misplaced. When we talk about the bill, it is as if we don’t have harsh penalties now for misbehavior in the law. If you take a look at the enhancements, it expands criminal sentences for individuals who reenter the country after removal. We already have very strong penalties against that. To say that this bill will keep us safe because, for example, we have a 20 year—under current law, a 20year sentence for a conviction for an aggravated felony, this would raise it to 25; I don’t think that is going to fix this problem. If it were only that, we could have a discussion which, unfortunately, we never did on a bipartisan basis. The bill does other things that are very damaging. It actually makes it a felony, punishable by up to 2 years, to attempt to reenter the country legally, in full compliance with our immigration laws; and this is true for individuals who have no criminal background whatsoever. Now, the sponsors of the bill may argue that is necessary, but I have seen no rationale for why that would make any sense, nor why it would certainly not have prevented the tragic murder of Kate Steinle. Now, let’s give some examples of who that could apply to. You have individuals who have lived here, we have met them, DREAMers, people who have been here all their lives, brought over as children, who were removed. If that person who has been removed becomes a victim of sex trafficking, the process is this: They can come and seek asylum. They can flee from their traffickers. And if they present themselves to our port of entry today, they are not trying to evade detection. No, they are trying to be found. They are turning themselves in, saying: I am fleeing from the sex traffickers; I want to make a claim for asylum; I need to be kept safe from the sex traffickers. This bill would make that act a felony. Now, the chairman has said how wonderful it is that we have created an affirmative defense in the act. What he has neglected to mention is that right now we don’t need an affirmative defense because it is not a crime to go to the port of entry and seek a benefit, either humanitarian parole for a purpose that is sometimes granted to travel if a member of your family is dying, to provide an organ donation to a member, an American citizen, who is in the U.S. who is dying. That is not a crime today, and you don’t need an affirmative defense because it is not a crime. Now, I think the fact that it eliminates an important constitutional provision is problematic. We all know we can’t change the Constitution by statute. The case of U.S. v. MendozaLopez basically says this: If you are going to prosecute somebody for entry after removal, which happens all the time—in fact, that is the single most prevalent Federal prosecution in the system today; that is number one—you have to—and you did not have an opportunity to actually contest the first removal because, for example, you were never notified at a hearing—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. CONYERS. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. Ms. LOFGREN. Since that is an element of the offense, the Mendoza case says you have to be able to at least collaterally attack that because you never had a chance to do so initially. This eliminates that constitutional case. You can’t do that by statute. So the point I am making is that the majority of those who enter the United States without inspection are coming back to try and get next to their families, their U.S. citizen kids, their U.S. citizen spouses. They are not criminals. They are not creating any kind of crime. We all oppose crime, but this remedy is unrelated to the horror stories that we have heard. You know, we are creating law here, not bumper stickers. I hope that we will vote against this misplaced law and work together to solve the real problems that we face. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ), a member of the Judiciary Committee and chairman of the Small Business Committee. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I especially want to thank him for his leadership on this. Nearly 2 years ago, Kate Steinle, a young woman with a promising future, had her life tragically taken away from her when she was brutally murdered by an undocumented criminal who had been convicted of a series of felonies and had been deported five times; five times, and then he kept coming back, and then he finally killed this innocent young woman, Kate Steinle. Sadly, this tragic event barely registered with the previous administration and other supporters of dangerous sanctuary city policies. During a July 2015 hearing, shortly after Kate’s murder, I asked President Obama’s Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson whether the White House had reached out to the Steinle family. I will never forget what the Secretary said to me. He responded: Who? He had no idea who Kate Steinle or her family were. I had to explain to him what had happened to Kate Steinle. It was embarrassing. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I have heard countless stories from families who, like the Steinles, have fallen victim to heinous crimes because of the failure 
to enforce our Nation’s immigration laws. We can and must do better to protect all the Kate Steinles all across America from being victimized by undocumented criminals who should never have been here in the first place. I really can’t emphasize enough how important this issue is, and H.R. 3004 will help address this problem finally and enhance public safety by toughening the penalties for criminal aliens who have been deported from our country, but then keep returning to the United States, and, again, far too many of them who commit crimes against innocent Americans like Kate Steinle. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ), a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. This draconian legislation would dramatically expand the penalties for illegal reentry into the United States, even for people who have committed minor and nonviolent offenses. Although most people who illegally reenter the country do so to reunite with their families or to flee violence or persecution, this bill considers them all dangerous criminals who deserve lengthy prison sentences. This bill is nothing less than fearmongering, based on the widely debunked myth that immigrants commit crimes at a higher rate than native born Americans when, in fact, we know it is just the opposite. Let me tell you about one of these supposed dangerous criminals who was mercifully released from ICE custody just yesterday, after 4 months in detention. In 1986, 17yearold Carlos Cardona illegally entered the United States, having fled threats of violence in his native Colombia. At age 21, he made a foolish mistake and committed a nonviolent drug offense. He served 45 days in prison, and, ever since then, for the last 27 years, he has lived a crimefree and a productive life as an active member of his community in Queens, New York. Not only that, after the September 11 attacks on this country, he volunteered as a recovery worker at Ground Zero. Like so many other workers there, due to his sacrifice, he developed acute respiratory issues from the toxic fumes and other illnesses that have put his life in jeopardy. Unfortunately, although he is married to an American citizen, he was unable to adjust his immigration status because of his decadesold conviction. However, he was allowed to stay in the country in recognition of his services after 9/11, as long as he checked in periodically with immigration authorities, which he did. But shortly after President Trump took office, Mr. Cardona was detained after appearing for a routine appointment with ICE, and he was placed in deportation proceedings and in custody. It was only thanks to a major public campaign and the compassion of Governor Cuomo, who pardoned his almost 30yearold drug conviction, that he was released. Under this legislation, had Mr. Cardona been deported and then illegally reentered the country to see his wife and daughter, he would face up to 10 years in prison because of his decadesold prior conviction. Even if he presented himself to border agents and sought asylum, on the reasonable basis that he had reasonable fears because, in fact, two of his brothers back in Colombia have been murdered, he would still be subject to prosecution and massive penalties, just for appearing at the border. This is both callous and irrational. This bill would dramatically expand the mass incarceration of immigrants, even for those with minor offenses and those who simply seek refuge in our country. It serves no purpose, increases no one’s safety, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this cruel legislation. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to quote from a letter from the Sergeants Benevolent Association that we received 2 days ago in support of Kate’s Law, and I want to read a sentence from it. ‘‘In recent years, the need to protect our citizens from those aliens who enter the United States illegally, commit crimes here, are deported, and who illegally return to the U.S. and commit additional crimes has become a top concern of the law enforcement community.’’ This is from the Sergeants Benevolent Association, Police Department, City of New York. I include it in the RECORD . 
OFNEWYORK, New York, NY, June 27, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMR. SPEAKER : I am writing on behalf of the more than 13,000 members of the Sergeants Benevolent Association of the New York City Police Department to advise you of our strong support for H.R. 3004, ‘‘Kate’s Law,’’ that will be considered by the House of Representatives later this week. We are grateful that the Congress is moving expeditiously to take up this important legislation. In recent years, the need to protect our citizens from those aliens who enter the United States illegally, commit crimes here, are deported, and who illegally return to the U.S. and commit additional crimes has become a top concern of the law enforcement community. It is a problem that was exemplified in the horrific murder of the young woman in whose honor H.R. 3004 is named, Kate Steinle. In 2015, Ms. Steinle was shot and killed on a San Francisco pier while out for a walk with her father. Her murderer was a career criminal who had already been deported five previous times, had a long criminal history, had served multiple prison sentences, and was on probation in Texas at the time of the shooting. Nearly two years has passed since Steinle’s murder, and little has been done to address the scourge of violence perpetrated by those who break our laws and continue to illegally reenter the United States. That is why prompt congressional action on ‘‘Kate’s Law’’ is so critically important. H.R. 3004 will ensure that those deported aliens with criminal histories who decide to illegally reenter the U.S. will face stiff prison sentences upon their return. First, the bill provides for monetary fines and between 10 and 25 years in prison for those aliens deported or removed who illegally return, depending on the severity of their prior crimes. In addition, this legislation provides for up to 10 years in prison for any alien who has been refused entry, deported, or removed from the U.S. three times or more, but who returns or attempts to reenter the U.S. Finally, for any criminal aliens who were removed from the U.S. prior to the completion of a prison term and who then attempt to reenter, H.R. 3004 requires that such individuals be incarcerated for the remainder of their sentenced prison term without any possibility for parole or supervised release. The passage of ‘‘Kate’s Law’’ is critical to ensuring that deported aliens with criminal records are deterred from illegally reentering the U.S., and will help law enforcement protect our communities from violent criminals and suspected terrorists who are illegally present in the U.S. On behalf of the membership of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, thank you again for your efforts on this and other issues important to law enforcement across the nation. Sincerely, EDMULLINS , President. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ). b1600 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I rise today in support of Kate’s Law and No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. These important bills represent an important step towards keeping Americans safe. Yesterday, I participated in a roundtable discussion at the White House with the President and family members of individuals who were murdered by criminal illegal immigrants. The stories I heard were heartbreaking. Sadly, they are not uncommon. See, when I was mayor of Hazleton, I sat with the victims’ families and listened to their stories. These stories have changed my life. Everyone talks about the illegal immigrant, but very seldom do we ever talk about the victims. I sat with the family of Derek Kichline, a 29yearold Hazleton city man and father of three young children who was murdered by the head of the Latin Kings while working on his pickup truck in his driveway. Derek’s killer was arrested and let go in New York City, a sanctuary city. I also talked with the father of Carly Snyder, a beautiful 21yearold girl who was studying to be a veterinarian. Her father told me that Carly was brutally stabbed 37 times and murdered by her next door neighbor. She had knife wounds on the palms of her hand and knife wounds in her back as she died on the kitchen floor. An illegal immigration and Federal fugitive with a long history of gang violence and drug use killed Carly. 
Carly’s killer was apprehended trying to cross the southern border but was released on $5,000 bond and disappeared into the United States until one day he showed up at Carly Snyder’s doorstep. I have never forgotten these stories. I understand that there is nothing that we can do to bring these people back. I know there is nothing we can do to relieve the pain that their families still feel. But by passing these bills, we can prevent these crimes from happening to other families. Let me be clear: violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants are preventable. The illegal immigrant who committed these violent crimes should not have been present in this country and certainly should not have been walking around free. Too many mayors and local governments think that they are above Federal law, and we have a chance to change that today. We can send a clear message to the American people that their government is serious about keeping them safe. I thank the President today for standing up for the victims of these preventable crimes, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same by voting ‘‘yes’’ on these important bills. This is a test of the willingness of Congress to stand for families across this country who have lost loved ones to crimes committed by criminals who had no business being in this country in the first place. It is time that we side with the victims like Derek Kichline, Carly Snyder, and Kate Steinle instead of criminals. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ). Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I want to speak about H.R. 3004, but let me first talk about two of my constituents, Officer Jose Vargas, one of the most decorated police officers in the State of California, and the other, Jose Angel Garibay, a young marine that made the ultimate sacrifice for America. In 1977, Jose Vargas was named as 1 of the 10 most outstanding police officers in America by the International Association of Chiefs of Police. But it wasn’t always that way. At age 16, Jose Vargas headed north to the border for a better life. Officer Vargas crossed the border 15 times over 4 years. Officer Vargas was probably the only police officer who we know that spent time in a Federal holding cell. America today is better because of Jose Vargas. Jose Vargas added to the greatness of this country and to the security of this country. Jose Angel Garibay, a young marine, was the first soldier from Orange County, California, to make the ultimate sacrifice in the Middle East. He also came to this country undocumented and became a U.S. citizen posthumously. Mr. Speaker, yes, we must keep out the bad hombres. We don’t welcome those who would do us harm, but America must continue to welcome those who come to America to work hard and to contribute. This bill fails to make this critical and important distinction. At the end of the day, we are all immigrants and we are all part of this great country, and I urge my colleagues today: do not brand millions of immigrants as criminals when their only crime is searching for the American Dream. I urge Members to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 3004. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and members of the House Judiciary Committee for their work on this issue. And as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, the issues being debated and voted on this week are an area of critical importance when it comes to keeping our Nation and our people safe. Mr. Speaker, we are a nation of immigrants. I am the grandson of Irish immigrants. We are also a nation of laws. Both must be respected and honored by all of us. Left, right, or center, we can all agree that our immigration system is broken, and given that broken status, it is the responsibility of this body to fix it. This goal cannot be achieved by selectively choosing which laws we enforce and which laws we ignore. As a former FBI agent, I worked each day to keep Americans and keep our Nation safe. And as a Federal prosecutor, I prosecuted cases that resulted in the removal of violent felons who were in our country illegally in order to keep our communities safe. I have seen firsthand the threats our Nation faces from a fragmented and broken immigration system and a porous border. We cannot and must not allow partisanship to prevent sensible fixes from being implemented. Our Nation’s security depends on us. Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today is one borne of a preventable tragedy. Kate Steinle was a bright, aspiring, 32yearold woman with a life of possibilities ahead of her. Let this bill be her legacy. Let this bill result in Kate Steinle saving the lives of others. Let us do her that honor. Kate’s Law will increase penalties for those who reenter our country following their removal from the U.S., including Federal prison sentences up to 25 years for those previously deported who have criminal records. Moreover, this bill supports our brave women and men in law enforcement as they work to keep violent gangs and criminal cartels, including the likes of MS–13, out of our communities. I am a cosponsor of this legislation, and I am proud to advance it. Mr. Speaker, the time is now for us to step up and protect those who elected us to serve on their behalf, and I urge all of my colleagues to make a bold bipartisan statement to our communities back home today. Join me in support of H.R. 3004. Let’s get this done for Kate Steinle and her family. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD letters of opposition to H.R. 3004, namely, the Federal Defenders of New York and 407 local, State, national immigrant civil rights, faith, and labor organizations. 
and almost three quarters (74.5%) had worked here for more than a year at some point before their arrest. These are not hardened criminals. 
I. THE BILL WOULD MAKE IT A CRIME TO OPENLY  
AND DIRECTLY PRESENT ONESELF TO IMMI GRATION OFFICIALS , SEEKING ASYLUM , TEMPORARY PROTECTION , OR FOR OTHER INNO CENT REASONS , AND WOULD THUS INCENTIVIZE  
IN VIOLATION OF LAW  The bill would create a new crime for an alien who has been denied admission, excluded, deported or removed three or more times who subsequently enters, attempts to enter, crosses the border, attempts to cross the border, or is found in the United States, subject to punishment for up to ten years. This would criminalize, for the first time, repeated efforts to seek asylum that are genuine but unsuccessful, as each attempt counts as a denial of admission or removal. As noted above, border patrol agents are increasingly turning away asylum seekers without referring them for appropriate screening as required by law. Human rights organizations have documented at least 125 cases of asylum seekers being turned away without proper safeguards to protect their right to seek protection between November 2016 and April 2017, often repeatedly. For example, a Honduran family whose son was murdered by a gang after he was denied asylum, another Honduran family whose son showed the agent a bullet hole wound in his chest, and a Mexican woman whose father, son, grandfather and uncle were all killed within seven days, were repeatedly turned away without referral for protection screening or asylum adjudication. Agents informed people seeking refuge that the United States no longer gives asylum, threatened them with force, or threatened to call Mexican immigration authorities to deport them to the country they were fleeing. A person who presents himself at a port of entry without a valid visa is subject to denial of admission or expedited removal. But if such a person expresses fear of return, he is entitled by law not to be expelled but to be interviewed by an asylum officer. When border patrol agents simply expel people who express fear without allowing them a chance to be interviewed and to press their claims, the agents are breaking the law and giving these people a removal order or a denial of admission that they should not have. Thus, bona fide asylumseekers—those most likely to accumulate ‘‘three strikes’’—would face criminal prosecution rather than what they are entitled to—a nonadversarial interview with an asylum officer that could ultimately lead to persecutionbased relief. III. THE BILL WOULD PURPORT TO UNCONSTI TUTIONALLY PROHIBIT CHALLENGES TO THE  
IV. THE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES WOULD BE UN AVAILABLE TO MOST , DO NOT ADDRESS ANY  
WITH TRULY PETTY CRIMINAL RECORDS  While it appears that the statutory maxima would increase for most defendants under the bill, there is no evidence that any increase is needed to reflect the seriousness of these offenses, or that such increases would be effective in deterring illegal immigration. At the same time, the cost of additional incarceration would be steep—approximately 
$32,000 per prisoner per year. If each of the 16,000 persons convicted of illegal reentry in 2016 received one additional year, it would cost the taxpayers an extra half a billion dollars. Increasing sentences for these offenders is also unnecessary and unfair because noncitizens suffer much harsher conditions of confinement than other federal prisoners. BOP contracts with private prison companies to detain noncitizens convicted of immigration offenses and other federal crimes. A recent analysis shows that many persons incarcerated in ‘‘immigrant only contract prisons’’ suffer serious medical neglect, in some cases leading to death. An investigation done by the American Civil Liberties Union found that ‘‘the men held in these private prisons are subjected to shocking abuse and mistreatment, and discriminated against by BOP policies that impede family contact and exclude them from rehabilitative programs.’’ Two of the penalty increases are particularly unwarranted. The bill would increase a defendant’s statutory maximum from two to 10 years if he was removed subsequent to conviction of any three misdemeanors, whereas the 10year maximum currently applies only if the three misdemeanors involved drugs, crimes against the person, or both. This would apply to a reentrant with a truly petty criminal record. If the defendant had three misdemeanor convictions for driving without a license, a common scenario for undocumented immigrants and other impoverished people, his maximum sentence would more than triple. And because the bill does not require that the three misdemeanors stem from three separate occasions, a 10year statutory maximum would apply to a reentrant with convictions from a single incident for disorderly conduct, public intoxication and public urination. Likewise, the 25year maximum for any three felonies would increase the maximum sentence by 15 years for garden variety felonies, such as felony possession of a small quantity of drugs. Worse, if the definition of ‘‘felony’’ means any offense ‘‘punishable by a term of more than 1 year under the laws of’’ the convicting jurisdiction, it would punish defendants who were never convicted of a felony by up to 25 years, because the maximum punishment is more than one year for misdemeanors in many states, including Colorado, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Vermont. We are also concerned that definition of ‘‘felony,’’ by mistake or by design, indicates that if a particular kind of offense is punishable by more than one year in any jurisdiction, it is a felony; it states that ‘‘any offense’’ is a felony if it is punishable by more than one year ‘‘under the laws of the United States, any State, or a foreign government.’’ 
RISK THAT DEFENDANTS WOULD BE PRES SURED INTO ADMITTING PRIOR CONVICTIONS  
THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE  The bill would require that prior convictions upon which increased statutory maxima are based be alleged in an indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt at trial or admitted by the defendant. Records of prior convictions are notoriously unreliable and national criminal databases that generate ‘‘rap sheets’’ frequently contain purported convictions that have been misrecorded, expunged, or even belong to other individuals. In border districts where the great majority of illegal reentry prosecutions take place, reentry cases have often been rapidly ‘‘processed’’ in batches of up to eighty defendants at once, with 99% of cases ending in guilty pleas. Given the way these cases are handled on the border, and the fact that many if not most of the defendants speak little or no English and have little or no education, this provision carries a significant risk that defendants will be pressured to admit to convictions they do not have and thus significantly raise their sentencing exposure. VII. THE BILL WOULD IMPINGE ON STATES ’ SOVEREIGN INTERESTS IN MANAGING THEIR OWN  
Instead of passing discredited enforcement only legislation, Congress should move forward on enacting just immigration reform legislation that provides a roadmap to citizenship for the nation’s eleven million aspiring Americans and eliminates mass detention and deportation programs that undermine fundamental human rights. Legislation that erodes public safety, disrespects local democratic processes, and raises serious constitutional concerns represents an abdication of the Congress’ responsibility to enact fair, humane, and just immigration policy. In light of the above, we urge you to vote NO on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate’s Law, H.R. 3004.

Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOFGREN ) for a unanimous consent request. (Ms. LOFGREN asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD letters in opposition to this bill from the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, the CATO Institute, Church World Service, and the ACLU. 
NATIONAL TASKFORCE TO END SEXUAL & DOMESTIC VIOLENCE , June 27, 2017. The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence (NTF), comprised of national leadership organizations advocating on behalf of sexual assault and domestic violence victims and representing hundreds of organizations across the country dedicated to ensuring all survivors of violence receive the protections they deserve, write to express our deep concerns about the impact that H.R. 3003, the ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,’’ and H.R. 3004, or ‘‘Kate’s Law,’’ will have on victims fleeing or recovering from sexual assault, domestic violence, or human trafficking, and on communities at large. This year is the twentythird anniversary of the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act (‘‘VAWA’’) which has, since it was first enacted, included critical protections for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence. H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 will have the effect of punishing immigrant survivors and their children and pushing them into the shadows and into danger, undermining the very purpose of VAWA. Specifically, the nation’s leading national organizations that address domestic and sexual assault oppose H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 because: Community trust policies are critical tools for increasing community safety. Laws that seek to intertwine the federal immigration and local law enforcement systems will undermine the Congressional purpose of protections enacted under VAWA and will have the chilling effect of pushing immigrant victims into the shadows and undermining public safety. Immigration enforcement must be implemented in a way that supports local community policing and sustains community trust in working with local law enforcement. H.R. 3003 runs contrary to community policing efforts and will deter immigrant domestic violence and sexual assault survivors not only from reporting crimes, but also from seeking help for themselves and their children. While H.R. 3003 does not require that local law enforcement arrest or report immigrant victims or witnesses of criminal activity, the language in the bill provides no restriction prohibiting such practices. Perpetrators use fear of deportation as tool of abuse. Local policies that minimize the intertwining of local law enforcement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) help protect the most vulnerable victims by creating trust between law enforcement and the immigrant community, which in turn help protect entire communities. Abusers and traffickers use the fear of deportation of their victims as a tool to silence and trap them. If immigrants are afraid to call the police because of fear of deportation, they become more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Not only are the individual victims and their children harmed, but their fear of law enforcement leads many to abstain from reporting violent perpetrators or seeking protection and, as a result, dangerous criminals are not identified and go unpunished. As VAWA recognizes, immigrant victims of violent crimes often do not contact law enforcement due to fear that they will be deported. Immigrants are already afraid of contacting the police and H.R. 3003 proposes to further intertwine federal immigration and local law enforcement systems will only exacerbate this fear. The result is that perpetrators will be able to continue to harm others, both immigrant and U.S. Citizen victims alike. Since January of 2017, victim advocates have been describing the immense fear expressed by immigrant victims and their reluctance to reach out for help from police. A recent survey of over 700 advocates and attorneys at domestic violence and sexual assault programs indicate that immigrant victims are expressing heightened fears and concerns about immigration enforcement, with 78% of advocates and attorneys reporting that victims are describing fear of contacting the police; 75% of them reporting that victims are afraid of going to court; and 43% reporting working with immigrant victims who are choosing not to move forward with criminal charges or obtaining protective orders. In addition, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck, reporting of sexual assault and domestic violence among Latinos has dropped significantly this year, possibly due to concerns that police interaction could result in deportation. According to Chief Beck, reports of sexual assault have dropped 25 percent among Los Angeles’ Latino population since the beginning of the year compared to a three percent drop among nonLatino victims. Similarly, reports of spousal abuse among Latinos fell by about 10 percent among Latinos whereas the decline among nonLatinos was four percent. The Houston Police Department reported in April that the number of Hispanics reporting rape is down 42.8 percent from last year. In Denver, CO, the Denver City Attorney has reported that some domestic violence victims are declining to testify in court. As of late February, the City Attorney’s Office had dropped four cases because the victims fear that ICE officers will arrest and deport them. Both the City Attorney and Aurora Police Chief have spoken on the importance of having trust with the immigrant community in order to maintain public safety and prosecute crime? 
COMMUNITIES  H.R. 3003 punishes localities that follow Constitutional guidelines and refuse to honor detainer requests that are not supported by due process mandates. H.R. 3003 likely covers more than 600 jurisdictions 
across the country, most of which do not characterize their policies to follow constitutional mandates as ‘‘sanctuary’’ policies. H.R. 3003 penalizes jurisdictions by eliminating their access to various federal grants, including federal law enforcement grants, such as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and other federal grants related to law enforcement or immigration, such as those that fund forensic rape kit analysis. Withholding federal law enforcement funding would, ironically, undermine the ability of local jurisdictions to combat and prevent crime in their communities. In addition, the fiscal impact of both H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 will result in limited federal law enforcement resources being further reduced as a result of shifting funding from enforcing federal criminal laws addressing violent crimes, including those protecting victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking, to the detention and prosecution of many nonviolent immigration law violators. 
H.R. 3003 AND H .R. 3004 WILL UNFAIRLY PUNISH  
VICTIMS  By greatly expanding mandatory detention and expanding criminal penalties for reentry, H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 will have harsh consequences for immigrant survivors. Victims of human trafficking, sexual assault, and domestic violence are often at risk of being arrested and convicted. In recognition of this fact, existing ICE guidance cites the example of when police respond to a domestic violence call, both parties may be arrested or a survivor who acted in selfdefense may be wrongly accused. In addition, if the abuser speaks English better than the survivor, or if other language or cultural barriers (or fear of retaliation from the abuser) prevent the survivor from fully disclosing the abuse suffered, a survivor faces charges and tremendous pressure to plead guilty (without being advised about the longterm consequences) in order to be released from jail and reunited with her children. In addition, victims of trafficking are often arrested and convicted for prostitutionrelated offenses. These victims are often desperate to be released and possibly to be reunited with their children following their arrests or pending trial. These factors—combined with poor legal counsel, particularly about the immigration consequences of criminal pleas and convictions—have in the past and will likely continue to lead to deportation of wrongly accused victims who may have pled to or been unfairly convicted of domestic violence charges and/or prostitution. H.R. 3003 imposes harsh criminal penalties and H.R. 3004 imposes expanded bases for detention without consideration of mitigating circumstances or humanitarian exceptions for these victims. In addition, H.R. 3004 expands the criminal consequences for reentry in the U.S. without recognizing the compelling humanitarian circumstances in which victims who have been previously removed return for their safety. Victims of domestic and sexual violence and trafficking fleeing violence in their countries of origin will be penalized for seeking protection from harm. In recent years, women and children fleeing rampant violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, have fled to the United States, seeking refuge. Frequently, because of inadequate access to legal representation, they are unable to establish their eligibility for legal protections in the United States, resulting in their removal. In many cases, the risk of domestic violence, sexual assault, and/or human trafficking in their countries of origin remain unabated and victims subsequently attempt to reenter the U.S. to protect themselves and their children. Other victims of domestic and sexual violence and trafficking may be deported because their abusers or traffickers isolate them, or prevent them from obtaining lawful immigration status. They are deported, with some victims having to leave their children behind in the custody of their abusers or traffickers. Under H.R. 3004, these victims risk harsh criminal penalties for reentry for attempting to protect themselves and their children. On behalf of the courageous survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking and human trafficking that our organizations serve, we urge you to vote against H.R. 3003 and 3004, and to affirm the intent and spirit of VAWA by supporting strong relationships between law enforcement and immigrant communities, which is critical for public safety in general, and particularly essential for domestic and sexual violence victims and their children. Sincerely, THENATIONAL TASKFORCE TO ENDSEXUAL  
[From the CATO Institute] KATE’SLAW: A WASTE OF FEDERAL  RESOURCES  (By David Bier) The House of Representatives will vote on a bill this week titled ‘‘Kate’s Law’’ (H.R. 3004). While it is nominally an ‘‘immigration’’ bill, its principal aim relates to criminal justice—namely, an increase in the maximum sentences for immigrants who reenter the country illegally after a deportation. The bill is a waste of federal resources. It would likely balloon America’s population of nonviolent prisoners, while not protecting Americans against serious criminals. 
KATE ’S LAW WOULD NOT HAVE HELPED KATE  The bill’s namesake is Kate Steinle, a 32 yearold medical sales rep killed in San Francisco in 2015. Her killer was Juan Francisco LopezSanchez who was in the country without status after five removals. Proponents of this bill—providing lengthier prison sentences for people who reenter the country after a removal—believe that this would have somehow helped Kate Steinle. This assertion cannot withstand a moment’s contact with the facts of the case, which I have previously laid out in detail here. After his last three apprehensions, the government prosecuted LopezSanchez for felony illegal reentry. He served 15 years in federal prison in three fiveyear increments. None of the facts of this case would have changed if he had served those 15 years consecutively. Indeed, because LopezSanchez never actually made it across the border without being caught since 1997, the only reason that he ended up in San Francisco is because the Bureau of Prisons inexplicably decided to ignore a request for transfer from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Instead, it shipped him to the city based on a 20yearold marijuana charge—an offense no longer even exists in the city. Thus, deterrence against reentry has no relevance whatsoever to this case. 
THE PROVISIONS OF KATE ’S LAW  This legislation introduced by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R–VA) should not be confused with other bills of the same name introduced in the House and the Senate by Rep. Steve King (R– IA) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R–TX), respectively. The entire purpose of the prior iterations of ‘‘Kate’s Law’’ was to create mandatory minimum sentences for crossing the border illegally after a removal. Indeed, the alternate title for the bills was the ‘‘Establishing Mandatory Minimums for Illegal Reentry Act.’’ This new Kate’s Law, however, mercifully contains no mandatory minimum sentences—a sign that criminal justice reformers’ criticisms of them (including Cato’s) have started to penetrate the mainstream. But the purpose of the law in the broader sense remains: trying to lock up more immigrants for longer periods. Most of the actual text comes from section 3705 of the Senate comprehensive immigration reform bill (S. 744) passed in June 2013, but the Kate’s Law authors have added several odious provisions. The heart of the bill would create a new 10year maximum sentence for any person removed or denied entry more than two times who reenters. The current maximum for regular reentry is just 2 years. It would increase the maximum sentences for people who reenter after being convicted of various criminal offenses—including for immigration offenses—to up to 25 years. Kate’s Law deletes two important provisions from the 5.744 language that would have protected from prosecution nonfelon juveniles (p. 772–73) and humanitarian groups that provide immigrants caught in deserts or mountains food, water, or transportation to safety, which are sometimes the target of the ‘‘aiding and abetting’’ statutes (p. 774). Kate’s Law would also prohibit challenging the legality or validity of a prior removal order, which is a common defense in these cases. If the earlier removal was not valid, as in at least one case where a U.S. citizen was deported, it should not be the basis of prosecution. Kate’s Law also would allow for prosecutions of immigrants who attempt to enter the United States unsuccessfully. Under current judicial interpretation, an alien must be ‘‘free from official restraint’’—that is, not in the custody or control of a government official. The 9th Circuit has interpreted to include even chases along the border. Thus, the bill would significantly expand the number of people eligible for prosecution for the criminal reentry statute. KATE ’S LAW WOULD FURTHER OVER  
CRIMINALIZATION  The U.S. Sentencing Commission estimated that the original mandatory minimums version of Kate’s Law would increase the federal prison population by almost 60,000 in 5 years—a massive 30 percent increase in the total federal prison population. Unfortunately, the House is moving this new version—revealed late last week—without an estimate of either its financial impact or its impact on the federal prison population. But the law would likely completely reverse the recent 5 percent decline in the federal prison population, the first reduction since the 1970s. Immigration offenses are already the top reason for a federal arrest, composing half. of all federal criminal arrests up, a share that has doubled since 2004. From 1998 to 2010, 56 percent of all federal prison admissions were for immigration crimes. Locking up immigrants requires taxpayers to pay to watch, house, clothe, and feed them, and unlike U.S. citizens who are released into the interior, their incarceration does not prevent other U.S. residents from being exposed their criminal behavior (assuming illegal crossing is a concern in that regard). While naturally locking people up has some deterrent effect on future crossing, Border Patrol doesn’t bother to keep good data on this impact compared to its other efforts. Given the costs of incarceration—both to the person incarcerated and to the U.S. taxpayer—this seems like a critical insight. In any case, if Congress was serious about discouraging illegal immigration, it would make legal immigration significantly easier. As I have shown, the availability of work permits has a major impact on illegal immigration. 
It’s not clear that the motivation for Kate’s Law is reducing illegal immigration per se, but rather the belief that illegal immigrants are more likely to commit serious crimes and so should be singled out. Yet as my colleagues’ recent paper demonstrates, illegal immigrants are much less likely to end up behind bars than U.S.born citizens. Because unauthorized immigrants are required to serve sentences before their removal, this is the best indication that they are less likely to commit crimes that require jail time. In the end, Kate’s Law is an improvement on its prior versions, but still an unjustifiable use of federal resources. CWS STATEMENT TO OPPOSING H.R. 3003, THE NOSANCTUARY FOR CRIMINALS ACT, AND H.R. 3004, KATE’SLAW As a 71year old humanitarian organization representing 37 Protestant, Anglican, and Orthodox communions and 34 refugee resettlement offices across the country, Church World Service (CWS) urges all Members of Congress to support the longstanding efforts of law enforcement officials to foster trusting relationships with the communities they protect and serve. As we pray for peace and an end to senseless acts of violence that are too prevalent in this country, CWS encourages the U.S. Congress to refrain from politicizing tragedies or conflating the actions of one person with an entire community of our immigrant brothers and sisters and oppose H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law. H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, would target more than 600+ cities, counties, and states across the country and threaten to take away millions of dollars in federal funding that local police use to promote public safety. Communities are safer when they commit to policies that strengthen trust and cooperation between local law enforcement, community leadership and institutions, and all residents, regardless of immigration status. The Federal government should not hurt intentional, communitybased policing efforts that are vital in communities across the country. Many cities have already recognized that requests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold individuals beyond their courtappointed sentences violate due process and have been found unconstitutional by federal courts. This bill would raise profound constitutional concerns by prohibiting localities from declining to comply with ICE detainer requests even when such compliance would violate federal court orders and the U.S. Constitution. Local police that refuse ICE detainer requests see an increase in public safety due to improved trust from the community. It is precisely this trust that enables community members to report dangerous situations without the fear of being deported or separated from their families. When local police comply with ICE detainer requests, more crimes go unreported because victims and witnesses are afraid of being deported if they contact the police. This bill would also undermine local criminal prosecutions by allowing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ignore state or local criminal warrants and refuse to transfer individuals to state or local custody in certain circumstances. This bill would reduce community safety by preventing state and local jurisdictions from holding people accountable. The United States already spends more than $18 billion on immigration enforcement per year, more than all other federal law enforcement agencies combined. H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law, would expand the federal government’s ability to prosecute individuals for ‘‘illegal reentry’’ and impose even more severe penalties in these cases—even though prosecutions for migrationrelated offenses already make up more than 50% of all federal prosecutions. Yet, this bill does not include adequate protections for individuals who reenter the U.S. in order to seek protection, which would place asylum seekers at risk of being returned to the violence and persecution they fled. We have seen how Border Patrol’s current practices violate existing U.S. law and treaty obligations by preventing viable asylum claims from moving forward. DHS has found that in some areas, Border Patrol refers asylum seekers for criminal prosecution despite the fact that they have expressed fear of persecution. In May 2017, a report was released highlighting that many asylum seekers, who had expressed a fear of returning to their home countries are being turned away by CBP agents. New barriers to protection are unnecessary and would dangerously impede our obligations under international and U.S. law. Federal, state, and local policies that focus on deportation do not reduce crime rates. Individuals are being deported who present no risk to public safety and who are longstanding community members, including parents of young children. Immigrants come to this country to reunite with family, work, and make meaningful contributions that enrich their communities. Several studies over the last century have affirmed that all immigrants, regardless of nationality or status, are less likely than U.S. citizens to commit violent crimes. A recent report found a correlation between the increase in undocumented immigrants, and the sharp decline in violent and property crime rates. Immigration is correlated with significantly higher employment growth and a decline in the unemployment rate, and immigrants have high entrepreneurial rates, creating successful businesses that hire immigrant and U.S. citizen employees. As communities of faith, we are united by principles of compassion, stewardship, and justice. CWS urges all Members of Congress to oppose H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law. What we need are real solutions and immigration policies that treat our neighbors with the dignity and respect that all people deserve and affirm local law enforcement officers’ efforts to build trust with their communities. AMERICAN CIVILLIBERTIES UNION, Washington, DC, June 27, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Re ACLU Opposes H.R. 3003 (No Sanctuary for Criminals Act) and H.R. 3004 (Kate’s Law) DEARSPEAKER RYAN AND MINORITY LEADER  PELOSI : On behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (‘‘ACLU’’), we submit this letter to the House of Representatives to express our strong opposition to H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law. 
NO SANCTUARY FOR CRIMINALS ACT (H .R. 3003) H.R. 3003 conflicts with the principles of the Fourth Amendment. H.R. 3003 defies the Fourth Amendment by amending 8 USC Section 1373 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (‘‘INA’’) to force localities to comply with unlawful detainer requests or risk losing federal funding. This is despite the fact that an ‘‘increasing number of federal court decisions’’ have held that ‘‘detainerbased detention by state and local law enforcement agencies violates the Fourth Amendment,’’ as recognized by former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in 2014. Disturbingly, H.R. 3003 seeks to penalize the 600+ localities that abide by the Fourth Amendment. These jurisdictions have recognized that by entangling local authorities and federal immigration enforcement, immigration detainers erode trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement. In this way, immigration detainers ultimately undermine public safety, as entire communities become wary of seeking assistance from police and other government authorities that are supposed to provide help in times of need. Thus, by forcing jurisdictions to comply with unlawful detainer requests, H.R. 3003 will only make communities less safe, not more. H.R. 3003 would also amend Section 287 of the INA to allow the Department of Homeland Security (‘‘DHS’’) to take custody of a person being held under a detainer within 48 hours (excluding weekends and holidays) ‘‘but in no instance more than 96 hours’’ following the date that the individual would otherwise be released from criminal custody. This, again, raises serious Fourth Amendment concerns, as the Supreme Court has stated that the Constitution requires a judicial finding of probable cause within 48 hours of arrest. This provision would disregard the Court’s ruling entirely and allow a local law enforcement agency to hold a person for up to 7 days before requiring DHS intervention—and never requiring the person be brought before a judge for a probable cause hearing. Protection against unreasonable detention by the government is the bedrock of the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment, which provides that the government cannot hold anyone in jail without getting a warrant or approval from a neutral magistrate. This constitutional protection applies to everyone in the United States—citizen and immigrant alike. Immigration detainers, however, do not abide by these standards. Detainers are one of the key tools that DHS uses to apprehend individuals who come in contact with local and state law enforcement agencies. An immigration detainer is a written request from DHS to that local law enforcement agency, requesting that they detain an individual for an additional 48 hours after the person’s release date, in order to allow immigration agents extra time to decide whether to take that person into custody for deportation purposes. DHS’s use of detainers to imprison people without due process, without any charges pending, and without probable cause of a criminal violation flies in the face of our Fourth Amendment protections. Policies that allow DHS to detain people atwill are ripe for civil and human rights violations and have resulted in widespread wrongful detentions, including detentions of U.S. citizens. That is why many of the 600+ localities targeted by H.R. 3003 have decided not to execute a DHS immigration detainer request unless it is accompanied by additional evidence, a determination of probable cause, or a judicial warrant. Unfortunately, H.R. 3003 does nothing to address the fundamental constitutional problems plaguing DHS’s use of immigration detainers. Rather than fix the constitutional problems by requiring a judicial warrant, the bill perpetuates the unconstitutional detainer practices and forces the federal government to absorb legal liability for the constitutional violations which will inevitably result. This is irresponsible lawmaking. Instead of saddling taxpayers with the liability the federal government will incur from Fourth Amendment violations, Congress should end the use of DHS’s unconstitutional detainer requests. 
KATE ’S LAW (H .R. 3004) H.R. 3004 is piecemeal immigration enforcement that expands America’s federal prison population and lines the coffers of private prison companies. Increasing the maximum sentences for illegal reentrants is unnecessary, wasteful, and inhumane. H.R. 3004 envisions a federal criminal justice system that prosecutes asylumseekers, persons providing humanitarian assistance to migrants in distress, and parents who pose no threat to public safety in returning to the U.S. to reunite with children who need their care (individuals with children in the United States are 50 percent of those convicted of illegal reentry). Current law already imposes a sentence of up to 20 years on anyone convicted of illegally reentering the country who has committed an aggravated felony. U.S. Attorneys’ Offices aggressively enforce these provisions. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, immigration prosecutions account for 52 percent of all federal prosecutions—surpassing drugs, weapons, fraud and thousands of other crimes. Nearly 99 percent of illegal reentry defendants are sentenced to federal prison time. H.R. 3004 would drastically expand America’s prison population of nonviolent prisoners at a time when there is bipartisan support to reduce the federal prison population. It offends due process by cutting off all collateral attacks on unjust prior deportation orders, despite the Supreme Court’s contrary ruling in United States v. MendozaLopez. Profiteering by private prison companies has been the main consequence of bordercrossing prosecutions, which the Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office of Inspector General have criticized as lacking sound deterrent support. H.R. 3004 is an integral part of this administration’s mass deportation and mass incarceration agenda. Longer sentences for illegal reentry are not recommended by any informed federal criminaljustice stakeholders; rather they represent this administration’s antiimmigrant obsession and would expensively expand substandard private jail contracting despite the lifethreatening conditions in these facilities. In conclusion, H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 are fraught with constitutional problems that threaten the civil and human rights of our immigrant communities, undercut law enforcement’s ability to keep our communities safe, and would balloon our federal prison population by financing private prison corporations. Rather than taking a punitive approach to local law enforcement agencies that are working hard to balance their duties to uphold the Constitution and to keep their communities safe, Congress should end DHS’s unconstitutional detainer practices or fix the constitutional deficiencies by requiring judicial warrants for all detainer requests. Congress should also repeal mandatory detention so that all immigrants receive the basic due process of a bond hearing and reject any attempt to unfairly imprison individuals who are not a threat to public safety.

Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDYCHU), a former member of the House Judiciary Committee. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law. This is politically driven legislation intended to create a fear of immigrants, even though repeated studies have shown immigrants commit less crimes. It enhances criminal penalties against immigrants, the vast majority of whom have come here peacefully to rejoin loved ones. All that, and it doesn’t even do what it claims to, address the situation that led to the tragic death of Kate Steinle. There are those who might imply that this bill came from H.R. 15, the comprehensive bipartisan immigration bill that could have passed the House if allowed to vote on the floor, but this is not true. I know, because I was one of the lead sponsors of this bill. Our bill would have vastly improved the pathways to immigrate legally to the U.S. This bill makes no distinction between those immigrants trying to rejoin their families and those who may be prone to commit crimes. Instead, it treats all immigrants attempting to reenter the U.S. as criminals and significantly expands sentences for persons with misdemeanors such as driving without a license or loitering. Even asylum seekers, who present themselves at the border to escape deadly gang violence in their home country, could be subject to criminal prosecution. Turning our backs on asylum seekers and refugees doesn’t make us safer. It makes us weak, and it is just plain wrong. We were horrified by Kate Steinle’s murder, but the provisions in this bill would not have prevented it. The man charged with killing her was convicted for multiple illegal reentry offenses, serving more than 16 years in prison. He had been caught each time he attempted to cross the border. His presence in San Francisco was not due to lax penalties for reentry or weak border security. I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided legislation ripped from the pages of Donald Trump’s mass deportation and antiimmigrant playbook. I include in the RECORD five documents from organizations that are opposed to this bill as well as the sanctuary bill, and that is the 15,000 immigration lawyers and law professors who are members of the American Immigration Lawyers Association; the 1.6 million members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or AFSCME; the 2 million members of the Service Employees International Union, SEIU; the Asian Americans Advancing Justice; and the Fair Immigration Reform Movement. 
AMERICAN IMMIGRATION  LAWYERS ASSOCIATION , Washington, DC, June 27, 2017. Statement of the American Immigration Lawyers Association Opposing the ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act’’ (H.R. 3003) and ‘‘Kate’s Law’’ (H.R. 3004) Contact: Gregory Chen, Director of Government Relations. As the national bar association of over 15,000 immigration lawyers and law professors, the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) opposes ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act’’ (H.R. 3003) and ‘‘Kate’s Law’’ (H.R. 3004). AILA recommends that members of Congress reject these bills which are scheduled to come before the House Rules Committee on June 27 and to the floor shortly thereafter. Though Judiciary Chairman Goodlatte stated that the bills will ‘‘enhance public safety,’’ they will do just the opposite: undermine public safety and make it even harder for local law enforcement to protect their residents and communities. In addition, the bills which were made public less than a week before the vote and completely bypassed the Judiciary Committee, include provisions that will result in violations of due process and the Fourth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution. At a time when over 9 out of 10 Americans support immigration reform and legalization of the undocumented, Republican leadership is asking the House to vote on enforcement only bills that will lead to more apprehensions, deportations, and prosecutions of thousands of immigrants and their families who have strong ties to the United States. Instead of criminalizing and scapegoating immigrants, Congress should be offering workable reforms that will strengthen our economy and our country. 
3003 H.R. 3003 would undermine public safety and interfere with local policing. H.R. 3003 would amend 8 U.S.C. §1373 to prevent states or localities from establishing laws or policies that prohibit or ‘‘in any way’’ restrict compliance with or cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The bill dramatically expands 8 U.S.C. §1373 which is more narrowly written and prohibits local law enforcement from restricting the sharing and exchange of information with federal authorities, but only with respect to an individual’s citizenship or immigration status. Rather than empowering localities, the extremely broad wording of H.R. 3003 would strip localities of the ability to enact commonsense crime prevention policies that ensure victims of crime will seek protection and report crimes. The bill would also undermine public safety by prohibiting DHS from 
honoring criminal warrants of communities deemed ‘‘sanctuary cities’’ if the individual being sought by local law enforcement has a final order of removal. Under H.R. 3003, localities that fail to comply with federal immigration efforts are penalized with the denial of federal funding for critical law enforcement, national security, drug treatment, and crime victim initiatives, including the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and Byrne JAG programs that provide hundreds of millions of dollars to localities nationwide. In an effort to force localities to engage in civil immigration enforcement efforts, including those against nonviolent undocumented immigrants, the bill would make it far more difficult for many localities, including large cities, to arrest and prosecute potentially dangerous criminals. The bill could even offer criminals a form of immunity, knowing that any crimes they commit in a designated sanctuary city would result, at most, in their removal from the country as opposed to criminal prosecution. H.R. 3003 would run afoul of constitutional safeguards in the Fourth Amendment. By prohibiting localities from restricting or limiting their own cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, H.R. 3003 effectively compels localities to honor ICE detainer requests—a controversial and constitutionally suspect practice that is nonetheless widelyused by ICE. Federal courts have found that ICE use of detainers violates the Fourth Amendment, and that localities may be held liable for honoring them. The bill also expands detainer authority by establishing that ICE may issue detainer requests for localities to hold undocumented immigrants for up to 96 hours—twice what is currently allowed—even if probable cause has not been shown. Courts have concluded that localities cannot continue detaining someone unless ICE obtains a warrant from a neutral magistrate who has determined there is probable cause, or in the case of a warrantless arrest, review by a neutral magistrate within 48 hours of arrest. The expansive provisions in H.R. 3003 would force localities to choose between detaining people in violation of the Constitution or being punished as a ‘‘sanctuary city.’’ Furthermore, this bill provides government actors and private contractors with immunity if they are sued for violating the Constitution. Provisions in this bill transfer the financial burden of litigation by substituting the federal government for the local officers as the defendant. If H.R. 3003 becomes law, American taxpayers would be stuck paying for lawsuits brought by those who are unjustly detained. The bill goes even further by creating a private right of action allowing crime victims or their family members to sue localities if the crime was committed by someone who was released by the locality that did not honor an ICE detainer request. H.R. 3003 would violate the Tenth Amendment. H.R. 3003 would compel states and localities to utilize their local law enforcement resources to implement federal civil immigration enforcement in violation of the Tenth Amendment’s ‘‘commandeering’’ principle. The Tenth Amendment does not permit the federal government to force counties and cities to allocate local resources, including police officers, technology, and personnel, to enforce federal immigration law. The federal government also cannot withhold funds from localities refusing to participate in federal efforts if the programs affected are unrelated to the purpose of the federal program, or if the sanctions are punitive in nature. H.R. 3003 would expand detention without due process. H.R. 3003 would increase the use of detention without ensuring those detained have access to a bond determination. Under the bill, nearly anyone who is undocumented, including those who have overstayed their visa would be subject to detention without a custody hearing. The bill also establishes that DHS has the authority to detain individuals ‘‘without time limitation’’ during the pendency of removal proceedings. These provisions would dramatically expand the federal government’s power to indefinitely detain individuals, and would likely result in ever growing numbers of undocumented immigrants held in substandard detention facilities. 
AFSCME, Washington, DC, June 28, 2017. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 1.6 million members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to oppose the punitive and unnecessary No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003) and its companion bill that increases penalties for certain immigrants (H.R. 3004). These bills together weaken the rights of immigrants, cut funding to vital state and local programs, and further criminalize immigrants. H.R. 3003 and 3004 are deeply flawed pieces of legislation that would add chaos to an already broken immigration system when comprehensive reform is what is needed. The bills undermine state and local policing strategies that have worked well for many communities. Implementing this ‘‘one size fits all’’ approach, as proposed in these bills, jeopardizes the trust that diverse communities have placed in their police force and undermines federal grants that are aimed at helping law enforcement and that support the very programs needed to reduce crime. H.R. 3003 forces communities to devote local resources to enforcing federal immigration law and penalizes them if they don’t comply. H.R. 3004 mandates increased penalties on immigrants for reentry, which could lead to a large increase in the prison population without additional resources. This would create new financial liability for federal, state, and local governments, that are already cash strapped, at a time when funding is urgently needed for investments in public safety, infrastructure and other vital community needs. We urge the House to reject both H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004. Sincerely, SCOTT FREY, Director of Federal Legislative Affairs. 
SEIU, Washington, DC, June 28, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the two million members of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), I urge you to vote no on H.R. 3004 and H.R. 3003, which are currently scheduled to come to the House floor this week. These meanspirited and unwise bills would waste taxpayer dollars, shackle local law enforcement efforts to 
protect the public, and make our nation’s immigration laws even meaner and less reasonable than they already are. H.R. 3004, ‘‘Kate’s Law,’’ would increase the prison population of nonviolent offenders who pose no public safety risk, without evidence that its harsh provisions would have any impact on unlawful immigration, and without any other justification of its cost or impact on prison overcrowding. Those affected would include immigrants who have only committed minor misdemeanors such as driving without a license or other traffic related offenses, and others who have never committed any crimes besides unauthorized entry. H.R. 3004 would also penalize persons fleeing persecution who voluntarily present themselves at the border to apply for asylum, and it would short circuit the current minimal due process protections that protect persons whose previous deportation was unlawful. H.R. 3003, the ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,’’ is intended to commandeer state and local law enforcement resources to perform federal deportation activities. It is one part of the ongoing effort to villainize immigrants by unfairly—and against all available evidence—painting them all with a criminal brush for the misdeeds of a few. Rather than protecting the public, the provisions of H.R. 3003 would frustrate policies by states and localities that increase public safety by encouraging cooperation between law enforcement and the communities they serve. There is mounting evidence that localities with such policies experience lower crime because they build trust between the police and those they serve, thereby inspiring the community collaboration and assistance that is a key ingredient to maintaining safe neighborhoods. It should be pointed out that the provisions of H.R. 3003 are sufficiently radical that even those who do not support sanctuary cities should vote no. The bill would deny important law enforcement funding to localities that are unwilling to honor any and all federal immigration detainer requests, including requests that courts have said are unconstitutional. It would empower private individuals to sue a locality if they or their family are victimized by a crime committed by an individual who was released despite a federal detainer request. It would render local governments powerless to prioritize local needs over immigration enforcement, even for local agencies funded by local taxes. And, if that weren’t enough, a separate provision would significantly increase the categories of individuals subject to mandatory detention and prolonged detention without bond, thereby filling local jails and private prisons with individuals who pose no danger to themselves and no flight risk. For the reasons listed above, both of these bills should be defeated. SEIU therefore asks you to vote no, and may add votes on any of them to our scorecard. If you have any questions, please contact Josh Bernstein. Sincerely, ROCIO SA´ENZ, Executive Vice President. 
ASIAN AMERICANS  ADVANCING JUSTICE , June 28, 2017. FIVECIVILRIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSE  LATEST IMMIGRATION ACTIONS IN THE HOUSE  
HOUSE REPUBLICANS INTRODUCE TWO ANTI IMMIGRANT BILLS DURING IMMIGRANT HERITAGE  
MONTH  WASHINGTON , DC.—Representative Bob Goodlatte (R–Va.) introduced a set of anti immigrant bills that are scheduled for a vote later this week. These are the latest in a line of bills that outline a clear antiimmigrant strategy by House leadership and this administration. H.R. 3003 seeks to authorize the Federal Government to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding for localities with limited detainer policies, sanctuary city policies, and community trust policies aimed at complying with the Constitution and making communities safer. H.R. 3004 would expand the Federal Government’s ability to prosecute people for illegal reentry into the U.S., excludes humanitarian exemptions for people fleeing violence, and heightens penalties in those cases. Asian Americans Advancing Justice, an affiliation of five civil rights organizations, issues the following statement in response: ‘‘Asian Americans Advancing Justice strongly opposes H.R. 3003 (the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act), H.R. 3004 (known as Kate’s Law), and the passage of any immigration enforcement legislation that would increase indiscriminate enforcement, further the criminalization of immigrants, and instill more fear in already terrified communities. Approximately 40 percent of all immigrants come to the U.S. from Asia, and 1.6 million of those immigrants are undocumented. Antiimmigrant policies create a climate of fear for all immigrants, regardless of status. We are horrified and dismayed that House leadership has chosen to line up behind the administration in its scapegoating of immigrants. Both of these bills further the administration’s goals of criminalizing all immigrants and expanding mass incarceration. Since the administration failed in its attempt to strip funding from municipalities with sanctuary and community trust policies in federal court, it is looking for Congress to fulfill its antiimmigrant agenda. There is abundant evidence that sanctuary and community trust policies make communities safer. As Arizona and Texas have shown us, forcing local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws increases racial profiling and distrust of law enforcement by communities of color. Rapidly pushing these bills through the House as America looks toward a holiday that celebrates the best of our American ideals is clearly an effort to slide this legislation under the radar of anyone who would oppose it, including millions of Americans who support immigrants’ rights. Vilifying and punishing immigrants who may be fleeing violence or seeking a better life for their families does not makes us safer, just inhumane. We call on Congress to reject this latest antiimmigrant strategy. This vote will be a test for Members of Congress to show which side of justice they are on.’’ Asian Americans Advancing Justice is a national affiliation of five leading organizations advocating for the civil and human rights of Asian Americans and other underserved communities to promote a fair and equitable society for all. The affiliation’s members are: Advancing Justice/AAJC (Washington, DC), Advancing Justice–Asian Law Caucus (San Francisco), Advancing Justice–Los Angeles, Advancing Justice–Atlanta, and Advancing Justice–Chicago. FAIRIMMIGRATION  REFORM MOVEMENT , June 29, 2017. HOUSE GOP C ONTINUES CRUEL CRUSADE  AGAINST IMMIGRANTS  WASHINGTON .—Kica Matos, spokesperson for the Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM), issued the statement below after the House voted on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate’s Law: ‘‘Republicans in the House are hell bent on criminalizing the hard working immigrants who contribute so much to our country. This week they voted on two heartless bills that do nothing more than continue to fuel Trump’s deportation machine. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act punishes ‘‘sanctuary cities,’’ local jurisdictions addressing immigration issues without federal interference, and expands the government’s inhumane practice of indefinite detention of immigrants. The second bill, ‘‘Kate’s Law’’ is a thinly veiled attempt to give prosecutors more power to continue the vicious mass incarceration of black and brown people by expanding on legal penalties for reentry. The bill also limits the already limited protections for people reentering the country for humanitarian reasons. The attacks on brown and black people by Republicans are not going unnoticed. The people are on our side—they marched with us on May 1st, they showed up after Trump issued the first refugee ban and they called out elected officials at town halls. Our message to Congress is clear: the only solution to fix the broken immigration system is a pathway to citizenship. These two bills are the antithesis of our values and should be condemned by everyone. The Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM) is the nation’s largest immigrant rights coalition, with grassroots organizations fighting for immigrant rights at the local, state and federal level. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ). Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and his committee for their diligent work on this extremely important and timely law. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law. Our immigration system here in the United States is the most generous in the world. Good people from all over the globe who understand the American Dream seek to join us, and we are better for it. Alexander Hamilton, Levi Strauss, Albert Einstein, and so many others have called themselves Americans because of it. But as we continue to draw on that spirit of understanding and acceptance, we have to remember that a nation without borders is not a nation. We have a responsibility here in Congress to be proactive and protect our communities and our citizens from unlawful and criminal immigrants, and that is what this legislation does. Kate’s Law, named in honor of 32 yearold Kate Steinle, who was shot and killed in the prime of her life by an unlawful immigrant who had accumulated seven felony convictions, been deported five different times—you have heard this many times said—aims to strengthen public safety by imposing hasher mandatory prison sentences for deported felons who return to the U.S. and increasing penalties for unlawful immigrants who have been convicted of nonimmigrationrelated crimes. Mr. Speaker, this legislation just makes sense, and I am confident that we can continue to welcome the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free in our country without giving free rein to dangerous convicted criminals in any of our communities. 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ). Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, for almost 100 percent of the people who would go to jail if this bill is enacted, they are not criminals and have no brush with the law. They were people who lived here for years, who had no chance of coming legally in the first place, and no way to get legal once they were here. Most have lived here for 10, 20, 30 years. They live in families with children, and their children are citizens of the United States just like you and me and our children. They have mortgages and car notes. The problems these moms and dads are trying to solve is if they get deported, how do I make sure my kids are safe in the country in which they were born, the United States? How do I keep a roof over their head and get them ready for school? How do I keep my business open or my career continuing in the U.S. where I have lived, in some cases, for decades? That is the problem they have, and guess what, they come back after they are deported. That person, to me, is not a felon, never committed a crime. That person is not a hardened criminal, never killed anyone. b1615 That is a parent fighting for their family. So in painting a picture of all immigrants as resembling a career criminal, like the guy who killed Kate Steinle, Republicans are doing the old bait and switch. The people we are hitting with this bill come back to the lives they have built over decades by the only means we have made available, and now we are going to add a felony and 15 years to that. Let’s give moms and dads different alternatives. The people who would go to jail if this bill were enacted would rather have come with a visa. They would get in line for hours to get legal if there were a line to get in, but there isn’t, and most Americans believe we should create such a line for them. They would come back legally if they could, but they can’t. We should be looking at how to solve that problem. We should be looking at ways to eliminate illegal immigration, and stop hoping that our strategy of the last 30 years of deportation, more restriction, and more criminalization would somehow miraculously start working. It hasn’t. It won’t. It is time for us to enact comprehensive immigration reform in the Congress and to fulfill our responsibility to the Nation. Look, the question today isn’t whether or not this bill is going to pass. It is going to pass. The Republicans are making it a primary purpose. The question really, for me, is: Are Democrats going to participate? Are Democrats going to participate in allowing this to pass? I have just got to say that I know it is difficult. Some people say: Well, I might not come back. It will be difficult. My constituents demand this. Well, let me just say that when I was elected in 1986 to the Chicago City Council, I was there but a month and they had the human rights bill for the gay and lesbian community. I remember the banner headlines: ‘‘Cardinal Says ‘No.’’’ Here I was a Catholic all my life, an altar boy, had three of the seven Catholic rites: communion, baptism, and marriage. Ten years later, I got to the Congress and was confronted here with the Defense of Marriage Act. We passed it. There were only about 70 of us who voted against it. But guess what. Thirty years after I took that vote for gay rights in the Chicago City Council, the Supreme Court said that marriage equality was the law of the land and discriminating against them was against the Constitution of the United States of America. That is the way you create social justice, not by doing a poll and not by trying to figure out what the next election consequences are going to be. I say to my Democratic colleagues: Stand up for social justice today. It wasn’t easy as a Democrat to stand up for reproductive rights for women. I remember going to church and I remember being chastised by the priest. I remember being booed by some of the congregants as I left that church. But I stood up for what I believe are women’s rights. My children were chased down the street during Halloween by pro choice people who said I didn’t deserve to be trickortreating with my children, that I was a bad father and I was a murderer. We stood up, and women have rights in this country. That is the way we do that, Democrats. We stand up for what is right. We don’t take a poll, and we don’t think of the next election. We do what is right. The immigrant community is looking for champions today, and it is my hope that, as Democrats, we, too, will stand up. When hate visits you, you need to repudiate it. You need to repudiate it because that hate might visit you in some personal way and it might cause you to hate yourself ultimately. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a statement in opposition to the bill from the Tahirih Justice Center. 
TAHIRIH JUSTICE CENTER , Falls Church, VA, June 27, 2017. STATEMENT OF THE TAHIRIH JUSTICE CENTER  
ACT’’ (H.R. 3003) AND ‘‘KATE ’S LAW ’’ (H.R. 3004) The Tahirih Justice Center (‘‘Tahirih’’) respectfully submits this statement to the United States House of Representatives as it considers ‘‘The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act’’ (H.R. 3003; ‘‘The Act’’) and ‘‘Kate’s Law’’ (H.R. 3004). The House Rules Committee is set to review these bills today, followed by the full House in the near future. Tahirih is a national, nonpartisan organization that has assisted over 20,000 immigrant survivors of genderbased violence over the past 20 years. Our clients include women and girls who have endured horrific abuses such as rape and human trafficking and are in dire need of humanitarian relief. Tahirih urges members of Congress to oppose H.R. 3003 and 3004: By further entangling federal and local immigration enforcement, H.R. 3003 will not only put survivors of human trafficking and domestic violence at greater risk of criminal harm, but will embolden violent criminals who pose a danger to us all. H.R. 3004 will unjustly punish asylum seekers who sought safe haven in the U.S., but were improperly denied access to the asylum process the first time around. H.R. 3003: The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act: The Act seeks to erase the distinction between federal and local immigration enforcement. Such measures erode immigrant community trust of police, who rely on victims and witnesses to help get dangerous criminals off the streets. When immigrants know they can call 911 without fear of deportation, it is perpetrators—not victims or their children—that are deterred and punished. Abusers and traffickers deliberately manipulate and isolate victims to limit their access to information about their legal rights. Despite longstanding protections under the Violence Against Women Act, even victims who hold lawful immigration status succumb to intimidation, and remain afraid of deportation if they come forward. For some survivors, deportation means sentencing a US citizen child to the custody of a violent abuser. Following the recent passage of a state law to increase local immigration enforcement, a client aptly noted, ‘‘This is exactly what [my abuser] has been waiting for.’’ We are all less safe when we make it easier for perpetrators to commit crimes. The Act will also increase prolonged detention of survivors, resulting in further traumatization, separation from young children, and limited access to legal assistance and due process. The Act also punishes localities that refuse to comply, by revoking critical funding for core programs that address gun violence, gang violence, and other criminal activity. When local agencies must ‘‘choose’’ between continuing these programs and compromising community trust, it is the public that pays the steepest price. H.R. 3004: Kate’s Law: Tahirih and other advocates routinely assist clients whose initial requests for asylum at the border are met with hostility, intimidation, and coercion. These individuals are unlawfully denied access to the asylum process by U.S. officials. With their lives in grave danger, women and girls in this situation have no choice but to request safe haven in the U.S. a second or even third time. They are not asking to appeal denial of their claims; rather, they are merely seeking a threshold determination that they may apply for asylum or related protections. Our domestic laws and international humanitarian obligations require that they have this opportunity. H.R. 3004 will punish women fleeing horrific abuse who persist in their quest for asylum by limiting their ability to challenge initial, unlawful removals, and by unnecessarily and unjustly subjecting them to criminal prosecution. We appreciate the opportunity to offer this statement in opposition to H.R. 3003 and 3004, and we urge Congress to unequivocally reject these harmful bills that undermine the safety of survivors of genderbased violence. ARCHI PYATI, Director of Policy and Programs. 
Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the Human Rights First: American Ideals. Universal Values. 
HUMAN RIGHTS FIRST, June 28, 2017. Re H.R. 3004—115th Congress (2017–2018). Hon. PAULD. R YAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : We write to urge you to oppose H.R. 3004 (‘‘Kate’s Law’’) and any similar legislation that would have severely negative consequences for asylum seekers and refugees fleeing persecution. H.R. 3004 seeks to expand the scope of immigrants who may be prosecuted for unlawful reentry and further expands penalties for those who are convicted. But the criminal prosecution of asylum seekers for offenses such as illegal entry, illegal reentry, and document fraud violates U.S. treaty obligations and risks sending genuine refugees back to their countries of persecution. For one, many asylum seekers are forced to ‘‘reenter’’ the United States because they were wrongfully deported in the first place through the expedited removal system. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), as well as Human Rights First and other groups, has long documented deficiencies and flaws in the implementation of the expedited removal process, a summary process which gives immigration officers the authority to order noncitizens deported without a hearing. In its 2005 report on expedited removal, USCIRF found that in a significant number of cases, border agents failed to follow U.S. law and refer asylum seekers to the ‘‘credible fear’’ process, even when USCIRF researchers were present during the secondary inspection process. Even when border agents make the proper referral for a credible fear screening, asylum seekers are often traumatized and exhausted by their experiences in their home countries, their flight to the United States, and their arrest by U.S. authorities. They are often interviewed by telephone by an officer they cannot see and are at the mercy of interpretation problems and other arbitrary factors that hinder communication. As a result, some may incorrectly be found to not have a credible fear, and may be deported as a result. These asylum seekers must then ‘‘reenter’’ the United States after facing continuing persecution in their home countries to seek protection yet again. Moreover, H.R. 3004 would redefine ‘‘reentry’’ to encompass an even broader group of individuals, as it will define reentry as including cases of individuals who had been previously denied admission. Human Rights First release a report in May 2017, titled Crossing the Line, which documents cases of asylum seekers who have been turned back at U.S. ports of entry, despite stating to border agents that they had a fear of persecution or intended to seek asylum. While DHS officials have acknowledged that border agents should be following U.S. law and referring asylum seekers to the asylum process, Human Rights First and other groups have found that this practice continues. H.R. 3004 seeks to penalize an overly broad group of individuals that would even include those who were wrongfully turned away from our ports of entry in violation of U.S. law. Secondly, prosecuting asylum seekers for their illegal entry or presence—even in the case of ‘‘reentry’’—is a violation of U.S. treaty obligations under the Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Article 31 of the Refugee Convention requires that states refrain from imposing ‘‘penalties’’ on refugees on account of their illegal entry or presence in the country where they are seeking asylum. For this reason, in 2015, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General found that prosecutions under ‘‘Operation Streamline’’ may place the United States in violation of its treaty obligations. If Congress passes H.R. 3004, more asylum seekers like Maria will be subjected to wrongful criminal prosecutions. ‘‘Maria,’’ a transgender woman from Honduras, who had been raped and subjected to other sexual violence, fled to the United States in 2014. U.S. immigration officials failed to respond to her requests for asylum and she was deported back to Honduras through expedited removal without ever seeing an immigration judge or having her fear of persecution assessed by an asylum officer. Facing ongoing persecution in Honduras, she fled to the United States again in 2015, and was apprehended upon entry. U.S. border agents referred her for criminal prosecution and she was convicted of illegal reentry. After she was transferred back to immigration custody, she was determined to be a ‘‘refugee’’ who qualified for withholding of removal. Yet, the United States had already penalized her for ‘‘illegal entry’’ despite being a refugee. Please contact Olga Byrne at Human Rights First if you have any questions regarding this letter. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, ELEANOR ACER, Senior Director, Refugee Protection. 
Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter opposing the bill from Cities for Action. 
CITIES FOR ACTION , June 28, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMEMBERS OF CONGRESS : Cities for Action (C4A) is a coalition of over 150 mayors and municipal leaders that advocates for policies to promote the wellbeing of our foreign born residents. Our coalition, representing over 50 million residents, has a considerable interest in protecting all our residents and ensuring that immigrants are not unjustly criminalized. We are writing to you today to urge that you oppose Representative Goodlatte’s bill, H.R. 3004, Kate’s Law. Kate’s Law expands already tough penalties for illegal reentry and allows the government to detain immigrants indefinitely without bond or a court hearing. It also mistakenly implies that illegal reentry cases are underenforced. Indeed, illegal reentry prosecutions already account for 52 percent of all federal prosecutions. H.R. 3004 would make the criminal sentences for reentry extremely harsh. Additionally, it would impose severe sentencing enhancements on people with minor offenses who reenter the country. H.R. 3004 would also limit the ability to challenge the validity of any prior removal order that forms the basis for a prosecution for illegal reentry, subjecting people to prosecution even in cases where the prior order was issued without due process or was otherwise flawed. In addition, the bill does not provide adequate protections for people who reenter the United States for humanitarian reasons or those who seek protection at the border, putting asylum seekers and families at risk. Cities and counties are opposed to this bill because these measures do not improve public safety and it is based on a false premise that immigrants pose a threat to our communities. Local governments have a strong interest in protecting all residents and maintaining public safety. Therefore, we urge you to oppose Kate’s Law and stop its passage into law at every possible turn. Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter, CITIES FOR ACTION . 
Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter opposing the bill from the Committee on Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Catholic Charities USA. 
JUNE26, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : We write on behalf of the Committee on Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB/ COM), and Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) to express our opposition to H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004. The Catholic Church holds a strong interest in the welfare of migrants and how our nation welcomes and treats them. Our parishes include those with and without immigration status, unfortunately some who have witnessed or been victims of crime in the United States, including domestic violence, armed robbery, and assault. We understand the importance of fostering cooperation and informationsharing between immigrant communities and local law enforcement. We oppose H.R. 3003 because it would impose obligations on local governments that we fear—and that many of them have warned—would undermine authority and discretion of local law enforcement. This, in turn, would hamper the ability of local law enforcement officials to apprehend criminals and ensure public safety in all communities. Furthermore, Section 2 of H.R. 3003 would deny to jurisdictions vital federal funding related to law enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, and naturalization if those jurisdictions are deemed to be noncompliant with H.R. 3003. The Catholic service network, including Catholic Charities, works in partnership with the federal government on a number of Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security initiatives, including disaster response and recovery, naturalization and citizenship services, and services for the immigrant, including victims of human trafficking, and domestic violence. These services are incredibly valuable to the protection and promotion of the human person and in some instances lifesaving. Cutting grants related to these important national objectives, or threat of such cuts, is not humane or just, nor is it in our national interest. Also, we oppose H.R. 3004 as it would lead to an expansion of incarceration and does not include adequate protections for people who reenter the U.S. for humanitarian reasons or seek protection at the border. While H.R. 3004 makes notable efforts to protect us from those convicted of violent criminal offenses, the legislation goes far beyond this goal by expanding the government’s ability to prosecute illegal reentry cases and heightening the criminal penalties in these cases. In an era of fiscal austerity, it is vital that important judicial resources are efficiently utilized to prosecute and convict the most violent offenders of violent crimes. Expanding who is eligible to be prosecuted for entry or reentry as well as enhancing sentencing requirements does not advance the common good nor will it ensure that communities are safer. Furthermore, we are concerned that, as introduced, H.R. 3004 would also prevent vulnerable asylum seekers and unaccompanied children, (who have presented themselves repeatedly at the U.S. border in the flight from violence), from being able to access protection, and instead face fines, imprisonment or both. 
We respectfully urge you to reject these bills in favor of a more comprehensive and humane approach to immigration reform; an approach that upholds human dignity and family unity and places a greater emphasis on balancing the needs and rights of immigrants with our nation’s best interests and security. The United States has a long and proud history of leadership in welcoming newcomers regardless of their circumstances and promoting the common good. We stand ready to work with you on legislation that more closely adheres to this tradition and appreciate your serious consideration of our views in this regard. Sincerely, MOSTREV. JOEVA´SQUEZ , Bishop of Austin, Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration. SR. DONNA MARKHAM , OP, PHD, President & CEO, Catholic Charities USA. 
Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter opposing the bill from Friends Committee on National Legislation: A Quaker Lobby in the Public Interest. 
FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON  NATIONAL LEGISLATION , June 27, 2017. FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL LEGISLA TION STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO THE NO SANCTUARY FOR CRIMINALS ACT(H.R. 3003) 
ANDKATE’SLAW(H.R. 3004) The Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) is a Quaker lobby in the public interest committed to pursuing policies that build just societies, peaceful communities, and equitable relationships among all people. FCNL looks to Congress to legislate on immigration in a manner that honors the value of immigrants and American citizens alike and urges congressional representatives to reject any legislation which would undermine immigrant families and communities. Congress is tasked with creating lasting solutions for our nation. FCNL therefore urges members of Congress to oppose H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 which together further criminalize immigrants, expand detention, undermine community wellbeing, and offer no legislative remedy for a punitive and outdated immigration system. H.R. 3003 is an extreme interior enforcement proposal that would affect over 600 cities, counties, and states and raises serious fourth and tenth amendment concerns. Effective policing depends on building authentic trust between police officers and the communities they serve; blurring the lines between federal immigration enforcement and local police results in fewer reported crimes and makes communities with large immigrant populations more vulnerable. Perpetrators of crime, assault, and abuse know that these communities are less likely to report the crime if they legitimately fear it will result in the deportation or detention of an immigrant neighbor, a loved one, or themselves. Law enforcement officials and advocates for survivors of domestic violence agree that the proposals included in this bill would be damaging for the communities they serve. FCNL heeds this call to ensure safety for the most vulnerable among us, and urges members of Congress to oppose H.R. 3003. H.R. 3004 would expand grounds for indefinite detention and decrease legal opportunities for certain migrants challenging their removal. Our call as Quakers to welcome the stranger does not rest on the legal status of any individual. Criminalizing entire immigrant communities based on the senseless actions of a few individuals tears at the moral fabric of our society and will not make our communities safer. H.R. 3004 could prevent migrants from adequately accessing asylum and would increase family hardship through separation by offering no meaningful opportunity for family members to pursue a legal route when seeking reunification across borders. These provisions will only fuel the brokenness of our system, which is already heavyhanded on indefinite detention and dangerous deportations at great expense to U.S. taxpayers and our collective moral conscience. Thousands of faith leaders have urged members of Congress to reject similar proposals in the past and live up to our call to minister to all those in need, especially those who have been marginalized. In keeping, FCNL urges members of Congress to oppose H.R. 3004. FCNL looks instead for legislation that proceeds from a recognition of the inherent worth of all individuals, as acknowledged in our Quaker faith, as well as in our shared Constitution, laws, and American values. We call on Congress to reform the U.S. immigration system so that it is in line with the Quaker principle to answer to that of God in everyone and ensures we live up to our legacy as a country that thrives because we are a nation of diverse peoples and immigrants. Congress has the opportunity to enact practical solutions for comprehensive reform that includes clear and workable processes for legal entry and eventual citizenship. FCNL is eager to partner on such efforts, and seek the fundamental policy changes we need to help U.S. communities truly prosper. 
Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter opposing the bill from the NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice. 
JUNE27, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE CONYERS : NET WORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice stands in strong opposition to the ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act’’ (H.R. 3003) and ‘‘Kate’s Law’’ (H.R. 3004) to be considered this week by the House of Representatives. We urge Congress to reject these bills. In a county that prides itself on being the land of welcome and opportunity, we must ensure that our immigration laws reflect our shared values. As Congress continues to delay comprehensive immigration reform and a permanent solution for the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants, we are left with the status quo—an enforcementonly approach that tears apart families and keeps people in the shadows. Despite the gridlock in Congress, localities across the country still have the responsibility to uphold safety and peace in their communities. To fulfill this goal, local police and residents have fostered mutual trust to root out crime and promote public safety, encouraging community members to cooperate with local authorities. The ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act’’ (H.R. 3003) does nothing to promote public safety and instead will make communities more dangerous while striking fear in the hearts of our immigrant families. Likewise, ‘‘Kate’s Law’’ (H.R. 3004) would criminalize immigrants who simply want an opportunity to succeed in the United States, and often are simply trying to be reunited with their family. Punishing immigrants for wanting to provide for their families with fines and imprisonment is harsh and cruel— we, as a nation, are called to be better than that. Again, we ask Congress to abandon the ‘‘enforcement first’’ policies that have been the de facto U.S. strategy for nearly thirty years, yielding too many costs and too few results. Our antiquated system that does not accommodate the migration realities we face in our nation today does not serve our national interests and does not respect the basic human rights of migrants who come to this nation fleeing persecution or in search of employment for themselves and better living conditions for their children. Pope Francis cautions that ‘‘migrants and refugees are not pawns on the chessboard of humanity’’ and he asks political leaders to create a new system, one that ‘‘calls for international cooperation and a spirit of profound solidarity and compassion.’’ This is a holy call to embrace hope over fear. Congress should recognize the Godgiven humanity of all individuals and uphold our sacred call to love our neighbor and welcome the stranger in our midst. Any action that further militarizes our borders, criminalizes assistance to immigrant communities, or weakens legal protection of refugees is neither just nor compatible with the values that we, as Americans, strive to uphold. Sincerely, SR. SIMONE CAMPBELL , SSS, Executive Director, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PITTENGER ). Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, the previous administration’s biggest homeland security failures were the lack of prosecution and enforcement for crimes committed by illegal immigrants. For far too long, the Obama administration failed to adequately punish illegal immigrants who committed felonies in the United States. A simple deportation is not enough. The United States must prosecute and sentence all individuals who commit crimes and hurt Americans. When we enforce the law, we create a deterrent mechanism for future bad behavior. Failure to enforce the law is a failure to the American people. That is why I support Kate’s Law. I thank Chairman GOODLATTE for his strong work and leadership on this issue for the safety and security of the American people. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ). Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman GOODLATTE for yielding. I appreciate his boldness in protecting the citizens of America with great legislation. Mr. Speaker, when the father of Kate Steinle, Jim, testified before Congress, he said: ‘‘Everywhere Kate went throughout the world, she shined the light of a good citizen from the United States of America. Unfortunately, due to unjointed laws and basic incompetence of the government, the United States has suffered a selfinflicted wound in the murder of our daughter by the hand of a person that should have never been on the streets in this country.’’ Well, today we can resolve that. Two years ago this weekend, Kate’s life was ended when she was gunned down by a fivetime deported criminal illegal alien with seven prior felony convictions. 
Kate’s Law would stiffen penalties, helping to stop these preventable tragedies. Additionally, today the House will pass the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act as well. You just heard: Will Democrats participate? Well, 80 percent of Americans support ending sanctuary cities, and no citizen should be in danger because politicians think they are above the law. So will Democrats participate? Will they listen to their constituents? Eighty percent of Americans feel pretty good about this law. Both pieces of legislation serve the basic functions of our government by keeping the people of our States and country safe from those who wish to do us harm. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. YODER ). Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule of law, of strengthening the enforcement of our immigration system, and of improving the security of our Nation’s borders. The safety and security of our constituents should be our absolute top priority for this Congress. Sanctuary cities are a direct threat to our safety. That is why I led an effort to defund sanctuary cities through the appropriations process, and those sanctuary cities and their threat to our safety is why we are here today. What happened to Kate Steinle was a tragedy. No parent should have to go through the anguish of losing their child, especially when it could have been avoided. Unfortunately, the deadly toll of sanctuary cities is not limited to Kate. Last year, in my own community back in Kansas, Master Deputy Brandon Collins, a Johnson County sheriff’s deputy with nearly 21 years of service, was struck and killed by a drunk driver while he was performing a routine traffic stop. Deputy Collins was a devoted and caring husband, father, son, brother, uncle, and friend whose life was tragically cut short. The drunk driver, who fled from the scene of the crash, was an undocumented or an illegal immigrant who had prior convictions for DUI in California in 2001, and was also arrested for driving without a license in 2013. He should have never been behind the wheel of that car when he killed Deputy Collins. Despite his prior offenses, the man was able to remain in the country. He was able to be here to commit this crime because of the failure to enforce the law, and it ultimately led to Deputy Collins’ death. No nation of laws should tolerate this. For these reasons—for Deputy Collins and the many other victims and their loved ones dealing with an unspeakable loss—for them, I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in its passage. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WOMACK ). The gentleman from Michigan has 7
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOFGREN ), and I ask unanimous consent that she may control that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ). Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, this is a really tough bill because this is a really difficult subject. We mourn the loss of Kate Steinle, and we have an obligation to take action to keep our streets safe. But this bill doesn’t do that. Our goal has to be to remove dangerous criminals from our streets so that they don’t harm people. That has got to be our focus. That is why I am so frustrated that we are taking out of a comprehensive immigration reform bill—which could have done just that—a provision that would have addressed this issue in a more rational way; in a way that doesn’t go after people seeking asylum; in a way that doesn’t say, ‘‘If you have been convicted of three nonviolent misdemeanors, you go to jail for 10 years;’’ and in a way that doesn’t punish people who are victims of human trafficking who—if they spent time in our prisons as a result of what they were forced to do, go back to their country, come back seeking asylum—could be forced to go to jail. These victims could be forced to go to jail for 20 years. None of that is going to keep our communities safer. We ought to work together. I urge my Republican colleagues to work with us to move forward with comprehensive immigration reform that will include provisions—like what is in this bill—that are still humane, provisions that will help keep American citizens safe, but that don’t demonize immigrants. It is possible to do both. My friends on the other side of the aisle know that it is possible to do both, and we ought to work together to get that done. That is the best way to keep our communities safe and to respect our values as Americans. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I have only one speaker remaining, and I am prepared to close. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 6 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 9 minutes remaining. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, one of the things I think is worth addressing is the provision of this bill that changes current law relative to unlawful entry or attempted unlawful entry. Under 8 U.S.C. 1326, this is a crime if the individual evaded detection. This has been the principle in Federal law for more than 100 years. Since 1908, the Federal courts have recognized that illegal entry and illegal reentry require entry free from something called official restraint, otherwise known as detention. Now, this bill would change that longstanding law. The bill amends U.S.C. 1326 to make the physical act of crossing the border a crime for any individual who has been previously removed or denied admission regardless of whether the individual was ‘‘free from official restraint’’ when doing so. Now, why is this a problem? As I mentioned earlier, individuals who, for one reason or another, need to come into the United States go to a port of entry, and they ask to see the Border Patrol agent. Under this law, that is a crime. Now, let me give you some examples of what that would mean. I will just talk about the case of Juliza, who was a GuatemalanIndian woman. She faced violent persecution really based on her ethnicity. She was raped by family members who referred to her as a dirty Indian as they assaulted her. As she went to report this assault to the police, she was sexually propositioned by the officers. After a family member threatened her with sexual violence and death, she fled to the United States. She sought asylum, but she was promptly deported—turned away—by the Customs and Border Patrol. Within a month of returning to Guatemala, she was drugged, raped, and thrown into a river. She fled to the United States for a second time and, once again, was turned away without seeing an immigration judge or speaking to an asylum officer. Finally, the third time she came, her 8yearold son had been threatened by gang members, and she was finally allowed to make her case and was granted asylum. b1630 Or the case of Carla. In June of 2016, Carla, who was from Mexico, and her children sought asylum after her father, son, grandfather, and uncle were killed in a span of 7 days, targeting her family. She went to the border to turn herself in. She was turned away by CBP agents twice. After the family sought assistance from an attorney, they went back to the border, to the port of entry, and the CBP officers finally processed them appropriately under American immigration law. This was their third attempt. The U.S. immigration judge in Texas ruled that they were indeed refugees and granted asylum. 
Now, I raise these two cases because you think deported, if you are turned away at the border, it counts for removal under the law. These individuals would be felons under this bill. Making Juliza and her 8yearold son or Carla a felon does not save an American from crime; it just doesn’t. The two are not connected. And so to think that this bill, which does such harm to asylum seekers, is necessary to save Americans from threats is simply incorrect. It is important to stand up for our longterm values in international law. There are other ways that one could become a criminal by showing up at the border. It is not uncommon that young people who have a valid visa issued by a U.S. consulate or Embassy come. They fly into the country and they are interviewed by a Customs and Border Patrol agent. Now, if that person on the visitor visa is a 20yearold young man who is unmarried, doesn’t have a job in the country he is from, doesn’t own a home, and is from kind of a poor country, it is not all that uncommon for the Border Patrol agency to make a decision that that person is not a good risk for entry, that they might overstay their visa and not return home. I am not questioning that exercise of judgment, but if that same individual, 20 years later, is now a doctor and he has got a J visa to come in and be a doctor in the middle of America where there is a doctor shortage, he lands at Kennedy Airport with his visa to be a doctor, that would be a felony. So the point I am making is there is much in this bill that does nothing about crime but to make criminals of people who have done nothing wrong. That is one of the reasons why we should vote against this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. Mr. Speaker, we are a nation of immigrants. There is not a person who has participated in this debate today who cannot go back a few years, a few generations or several generations and find someone in their family who came here to the United States, but we are also a nation of laws. The loss of respect for the rule of law is absolutely a serious problem in this country, and the stepbystep approach to restoring respect for the rule of law and reforming our immigration laws starts with these bills, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate’s Law. We are all about today, in this legislation, enhancing public safety, securing our borders, and restoring the rule of law. We give discretion to Federal judges—discretion to Federal judges, I would add—to make sure that people who have entered this country previously illegally and who reenter the country can be given enhanced sentences. It is not mandatory by any means, and, in fact, in many instances, it would be better to send the person outside the country and not have the taxpayers bear the expense. But in the case of the individual who murdered Kate Steinle and had reentered the country five times and had committed other crimes while in the United States, having that additional time that the judge could impose on that individual who was just being released for having been convicted of illegally entering the country, Bureau of Prisons should have turned him over to ICE to send him out again. But if the ICE agents wanted to, when he entered illegally the previous time, recommend that he be given more time than the sentence he just served, he would have still been in prison when Kate Steinle walked down that pier with her father and was murdered by him. So when those on the other side say this was not preventable by this law, they are entirely wrong. This law would have prevented that if a judge had chosen to impose that additional time that we are today providing in these cases. We also clear up some uncertainty regarding this current law, and I think it is entirely appropriate to do so. It will deal with some of the situations that those on the other side have discussed, but most importantly, it will discourage people from entering the United States illegally, particularly when they have already entered illegally earlier and have been convicted of a crime for doing so. So, to me, this is absolutely the beginning point of restoring to law enforcement at every level in our country the necessary tools to enforce our immigration laws, to work together to keep American citizens safe, like Kate Steinle and many, many others. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet with about a dozen representatives of families who lost loved ones to the criminal acts of people who were not lawfully present in the United States. And so it is also entirely true to say that, had those individuals not been present in the United States, those crimes would not have been committed, those, in most instances, murders, in all instances, killings, would not have taken place. Therefore, when you enforce our immigration laws, unlike laws applying to American citizens who also commit crimes, in the case of people who are not lawfully present in the United States, these crimes are entirely preventable if we enforce our immigration laws. Therefore, I would urge my colleagues to support Kate’s Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act to make sure that we go down this road of restoring the trust of the American people in their system of government, in their protection by their government, and in their own respect for the rule of law and know that their government is upholding that with regard to other individuals as well. This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD the following additional letter of opposition to H.R. 3004. This is a letter I mentioned earlier on the bill. 
NATIONAL IMMIGRANT JUSTICE  CENTER , June 27, 2017. H.R. 3003 
AND3004 U NDERMINE AMERICAN VALUESNIJC O PPOSES THE ‘‘NOSANCTUARY FOR  CRIMINALS ACT’’ AND‘‘KATE’SLAW’’ This week the House of Representatives will vote on two bills that attempt to re write our nation’s immigration laws to reflect a dangerous philosophy of governance. For decades now, elected officials across the bipartisan divide have joined together calling for a compassionate and common sense approach to immigration legislation. These bills move us further away from that goal. H.R. 3003, ironically named the ‘‘No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,’’ will endanger the safety of our communities by forcing local police to abandon community policing efforts and become a full partner with the administration’s massive deportation force. H.R. 3004, known as ‘‘Kate’s Law,’’ will result in the unnecessary incarceration of countless immigrants for the mere act of migration. The National Immigrant Justice Center calls on elected officials to reject such nonsensical and harmful legislation. In the face of hateful rhetoric, now is the time to stand with immigrant communities. 
TRUST IN LOCAL POLICE AND PUT OUR COMMU NITIES IN DANGER  H.R. 3003 amends 8 U.S.C. §1373 to prohibit states and localities from enacting policies that in any way limit cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), even when federal courts have ruled such cooperation unconstitutional. The law would strip localities of vital discretion to enact immigrationenforcement related laws and policies that are smart and effective for their communities. Specifically, it prohibits localities from declining to comply with requests from ICE to jail individuals under detainer requests even when doing so will put them in blatant violation of binding federal court orders. Our communities are safer when residents feel safe calling for help and assisting police in investigating and prosecuting cries. By effectively forcing localities into the business of federal immigration law, this law will preclude cities and counties from using their limited local resources to address public safety concerns in the ways they deem most appropriate and effective. On top of the danger the bill poses to community safety, this law arguably violates the ‘‘anticommandeering’’ principle of the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. H.R. 3003 punishes jurisdictions for engaging in smart community policing. The law would punish jurisdictions that choose to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement by stripping federal funding that fulfills vital law enforcement needs, including the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), the ‘‘Cops on the Beat Program,’’ the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program, and any other grant administered by the Departments of Justice or Homeland Security that are deemed ‘‘substantially related to law enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, or naturalization.’’ In addition to running further afoul of the Tenth Amendment, this law cruelly forces jurisdictions to choose between maintaining critical funds, including 
for community policing, or exposing themselves to the significant legal and financial liability that accompany compliance with detainer requests under the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment. H.R. 3003 upends the criminal justice system by permitting and in some cases requiring ICE to ignore criminal warrants issued by state and local jurisdictions that it deems in noncompliance with other provisions of the bill. H.R. 3003 vastly expands ICE’s authority to force localities to detain immigrants with no regard for the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and gives local actors immunity for resulting constitutional violations. The law makes a mockery of the Fourth Amendment by giving lip service to the notion of ‘‘probable cause’’ but in reality allowing ICE to ask localities to detain immigrants longer than they would otherwise be held simply on the basis of a belief that the individual is removable from the United States. The law then goes on to provide local actors immunity for resulting constitutional violations. In practice, this piece of the law essentially requires local actors to violate the constitution and then gives them immunity for doing so. It is legislative overreach at its worst. H.R. 3003 demonizes immigrants by creating a new private right of action for victims of crime solely on the basis of the citizenship status of the perpetrator of the crime. The law provides that an individual or surviving relative can bring a lawsuit against a state or locality if the perpetrator of the offense is a noncitizen and was released from custody pursuant to a trust policy. This provision allows the worst kind of scapegoating, manipulating individual tragedies to demonize all immigrants. H.R. 3003 expands the already damaging ‘‘mandatory detention’’ provisions of immigration law, requiring nobond detention for large categories of undocumented individuals for the duration of deportation proceedings against them. The law thumbs its nose at the basic due process protections of our United States Constitution, explicitly approving of indefinite detention for individuals in immigration custody regardless of their community ties to the United States or necessity for detention. Specifically, the law expands greatly the categories of immigrants who are denied access to any individualized bond determination throughout their time in immigration jail. With deaths in immigration detention occurring with alarming frequency and rates of representation in detention alarmingly low, these provisions are nothing but cruel. 
H.R. 3004, ‘‘KATE ’S LAW ,’’ WILL FURTHER THE  
MASS INCARCERATION OF IMMIGRANTS —INCLUDING ASYLUM SEEKERS —BY INCREASING  
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. LOFGREN. I am. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. Lofgren moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3004 to the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Add, at the end of the bill, the following: 
Mr. GOODLATTE (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues across the aisle insist that today’s bill is intended to keep Americans safe by enhancing penalties for criminals who reenter illegally or attempt to do so. I am offering an amendment that takes Republicans at their word. This amendment would make clear that H.R. 3004 would not be used to criminally prosecute and incarcerate sex trafficking victims merely for seeking protection at ports of entry. As should be evident at this stage of debate, the provisions of this bill extend well beyond immigrants with criminal histories; in fact, they reach many of the most vulnerable and persecuted members of society. Perhaps most egregiously, H.R. 3004 authorizes, for the first time, the prosecution of individuals who voluntarily present themselves at points of entry to seek relief consistent with our immigration laws, and that includes individuals seeking protection as victims of sex trafficking. Let’s be clear on the law. Today, it is not a crime for an individual who has been previously denied admission or removed to voluntarily present herself at a port of entry seeking to reenter the country legally. This bill changes that by making the simple act of going to the port of entry, which itself requires the physical act of crossing the border, a felony offense for such individuals. These are not individuals attempting to evade immigration agents. They are not trying to sneak into the United States. They are simply exercising the right to lawfully approach a U.S. port of entry to seek permission to enter. Under this bill, the act of approaching CBP agents now becomes criminally prosecutable as an illegal reentry. Anyone with a prior removal order or even merely denied admission commits a crime by so much as stepping into the port of entry. I mentioned the two asylee seekers a few moments ago. These are people who are fleeing danger and under our laws have the right to present their cases. Now, H.R. 3004 would do this to the women I mentioned: It would make them criminals, and it would allow for the prosecution and imprisonment for up to 2 years. Now, even if our immigration system awarded these victims protection, such as a T visa for human trafficking, the criminal justice system could take away her liberty. I strongly hope that my colleagues across the aisle would not seek to punish women who are fleeing from sex traffickers, because there are thousands of women who are innocent, abused, sexually trafficked by the worst of civilization, and instead of offering help to these women, this bill would put them in prison. It would prosecute them for asking, of all things, that their life be saved. I mentioned earlier, we put in the RECORD , the opposition of the Tahirih Justice Center to this bill. They advocate for victims of trafficking and genderbased violence, and they oppose this bill with all their strength. Here is what they say, and it is a quote: ‘‘H.R. 3004 will punish women fleeing horrific abuse. . . . ‘’ 
Now, I disagree with some of the elements of this bill, and I have tried to make clear why, but I take Mr. GOODLATTE at his word that he wants to make sure that we have a safe society. I think, if that is his hope, we will make clear that sex trafficking victims are not going to be prosecuted or considered criminals when they enter a port of entry and present themselves to U.S. officials. This amendment is the chance for Republicans to show that they really are for the rule of law. It would stipulate that this bill would not subject sex trafficking victims to criminal prosecution merely for voluntarily presenting themselves at the border to request protection from the unspeakable harm that they have suffered. I will close with this. Years ago, we worked together on a bipartisan basis to fight sex trafficking. We created the U and T visas. It was a broad bipartisan coalition. I remember now Governor Sam Brownback and others, people who are at other ends, opposite ends of the ideological spectrum, but we came together to fight sex trafficking. We should do the same thing today. Let’s not forget that we can work together to do the right thing. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit not only changes the bill before us, but it also changes current law. It has long been Federal law that an alien who has been deported and who returns to the U.S. is subject to possible criminal prosecution. b1645 Under this bill, an alien who has received consent from the Department of Homeland Security to return or is not required to seek consent from DHS has an affirmative defense. Obviously, such an alien will never be prosecuted. Never has, never will. In fact, because this is current law—and the gentlewoman was the chairman of the Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee for 4 years and never offered such an amendment to current law—I see no reason to address it in this legislation. I will say that we have all been committed in a very bipartisan fashion to combating sex trafficking. We passed several bills through this House, some with the gentlewoman’s support, some without, that do indeed combat sex trafficking. But back to the issue before us today. Criminal aliens are reentering the United States after being removed all the time. Without stronger enforcement measures in place, this government cannot provide an appropriate deterrence for these reentries. Kate’s Law takes a tough approach to dealing with criminal aliens who reenter the United States. Instead of the majority being subjected to no more than a 2year maximum sentence, this bill takes an individual’s criminal history into consideration and provides enhanced penalties accordingly. While the 2year sentence may not deter illegal reentry, a potential 25year sentence certainly would. Nothing can bring Kate Steinle back and nothing can absolutely prevent such crimes from occurring in the future. This legislation is meant to honor her memory and clearly demonstrate that this Congress will act. This legislation is another step in bringing stronger enforcement measures to improve our immigration enforcement capabilities. Longer sentences for those criminal aliens who reenter the United States illegally is an important aspect of that mechanism. I urge my colleagues to vote down this motion to recommit, vote for the underlying bill, and to truly deter criminal aliens from reentering the United States. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. LOFGREN.

Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY RICHARD ‘‘THE KING’’ PETTY (Mr. WALKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, our country will celebrate our independence and the rebuke of the British monarchy. Even still, we know across America, but especially in the great State of North Carolina, we have our own king, who turns 80 on Sunday. Richard ‘‘The King’’ Petty is the most decorated and respected driver in the history of motor sports. His legendary 43 car dominated race tracks for decades. He has even been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George H.W. Bush. More importantly than Mr. Petty’s work on the track are the lives that he has impacted. The Petty family, through the work of multiple charities and the impactful Victory Junction Camp, has served children with disabilities in incredible ways. Mr. Petty, you and Kyle and the rest of the family even showed what grace and dignity looks like in the loss of a grandson. We wish you a happy birthday today, Richard ‘‘The King’’ Petty. Thank you for all you do for the people of North Carolina, and I will be looking for that hat, those sunglasses, and that bright smile for years to come. 
TRANSFORM STUDENT DEBT TO HOME EQUITY (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Transform Student Debt to Home Equity Act. Today, 40 million Americans have Federal student loan debt totaling $1.3 trillion. Additionally, at the end of 2016, 17.2 million habitable homes sat vacant in our country. These two trends are intertwined. Student debt is prohibiting millions and millions from buying their first home. We must find a solution, or thousands more will be saddled with sunk debt depriving them of building wealth through building home equity. The Transform Student Debt to Home Equity Act offers us a road forward. This bill allows the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Housing Finance Agency to start a pilot program that connects creditworthy Federal student debt holders with habitable homes for sale from the Federal ledger. By recalculating financing terms and interest rates, some student debtors can transition their debt into homeownership. Eventually creditworthy participants would pay off debt and help strengthen neighborhoods simply by maintaining their home mortgage. We must use our power and resources to transform debt to equity. Transforming a student debt to home ownership is a pathway forward for the aspiring generation. I encourage my colleagues to support our measure, and let us unleash the stranglehold of debt on the next generation and allow them to build wealth through homeownership. f 
CONGRATULATIONS CASSY LESTER AND ALL ART COMPETITION WINNERS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today this House welcomes the winners of the Congressional Art Competition to the Nation’s Capital. Students from all over the country have traveled to Washington to proudly display their works of art in the tunnel to the Capitol for the next year. The Congressional Institute hosts the nationwide competition each year to showcase and inspire the artistic talent of high school students from each congressional district. I am proud of the 37 students from my district who submitted entries. I am thrilled to welcome our first place winner, Cassy Lester of Reynoldsville, for her acrylic painting titled ‘‘Chocolate Lab.’’ Cassy attends Jeff Tech, and it is an honor to recognize a career and technical education student as our winner this year. She was honored with her fellow winners from the States across the Nation at this afternoon’s luncheon, and earlier today, I was able to give Cassy and her family a tour of the Capitol. Congratulations to Cassy and all of this year’s winners. We are grateful to have your art brighten the walls of the tunnel of this Capitol for the year ahead. 
HONORING ANDREW ROGERS (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give special recognition to Andrew Rogers, the last surviving member of the heroic 1941 Willamette University Bearcats football team. The 1941 season was a tremendous success for the team, going 8–2, capturing the Northwest Conference title. But we remember that Bearcats historic season for far more than just athletics. At the end of the season, Willamette University was invited to play the University of Hawaii on December 6, 1941. The following morning, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor began. Rogers, the entire team, and visiting Willamette supporters volunteered to guard the Punahou School for 10 days while others helped with the injured. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Rogers volunteered to join the United States Marine Corps, where he served as an infantry platoon leader for the 3rd Marine Division throughout the Second World War. He served meritoriously during the final phase of the recapture of Guam, as well as during the Battle of Iwo Jima. Rogers reminds all Americans of the impact we can have when we step up in times of need. His military service during a dark, uncertain time in our history is another shining example of the Greatest Generation. I am proud to share his story and offer this small piece of recognition for all that Andrew Rogers has done for this great country. f 
NO CITY IS ABOVE THE LAW (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. Many cities across America have adopted sanctuary policies over the past few years. This is an obvious disregard of Federal law and puts American lives at risk. In my home State of Georgia, sanctuary cities have been outlawed since 2009. Last year, Georgia’s law was amended to require local governments to certify they are cooperating with Federal immigration officials in order to get State funding. The way I see it, the law is the law. Sanctuary cities’ policies are dangerous to all American communities as they can shield unlawful and criminal immigrants from Federal immigration enforcement. President Trump promised to end sanctuary cities, and this is the first step toward keeping that promise. How many more innocent American lives need to be stolen because our immigration laws are not being enforced? No person or city is above the law, and that is why my colleagues and I passed this very important bill today. 
OPPOSE DANGEROUS SENATE VERSION OF TRUMPCARE (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the dangerous and shameful Senate version of TrumpCare. According to the new Congressional Budget Office estimate, this bill will leave 22 million Americans without insurance by 2026. In my district, that amounts to over 91,000 of my constituents, and over 2 million Floridians in total. TrumpCare would allow insurers to charge seniors up to five times more than younger people. In addition, we have more than 1.3 million Americans who are in nursing homes, and 62 percent of those pay for their stay and their care with Medicaid dollars, including three in five Floridians who are in a nursing home. The majority promised Americans that they would fix TrumpCare in the Senate. Instead, 13 men made a backroom deal and they left seniors out of it. Make no mistake, while billionaires reap huge tax breaks in this bill, older middle class Americans will suffer. I urge my Republican colleagues to find their backbone—and look for their hearts while they are at it—and stand up for our seniors. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a student from my district who has achieved something truly remarkable. More than half a million students from around the world participated in this year’s National History Day contest, each one making a film, exhibit, website, or other presentation on this year’s theme, which was ‘‘Taking a Stand in History.’’ Joanna Harlacher, a graduate of Donegal High School, took first place for her website. Her website focused on someone we all know and love: fellow Pennsylvanian Fred Rogers. Joanna used to watch reruns of his PBS show and wanted to showcase his impact on Americans during his life and his career. I would also like to recognize retired Donegal teacher Elizabeth Lewis, who helped Joanna create the awardwinning website. Mr. Speaker, I couldn’t be prouder to represent this exceptional young woman and thousands of students across my district who impress us each and every day. Congratulations, Joanna Harlacher, her family, Mrs. Lewis, and Donegal High School on this globally recognized accomplishment. f 
HONORING JUDGE RYAN REINHOLD (Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, it is with respect and admiration that we honor Judge Ryan Reinhold for his outstanding legacy and service to the State of Arizona. This week, Ryan retires after 41 years as Navajo County justice of the peace, municipal court judge, White Mountain Apache tribal judge, and Navajo County constable. Throughout his career, he has been known for his tireless efforts to benefit his community in every aspect. I want to take a moment to share some of the highlights of his career. Ryan was first selected as justice of the peace in 1978. In 1984, he received the Kenneth L. MacEachern Award for Outstanding NonLawyer Judge in the United States. He was reelected five times and honorably led the court for 22 years before retiring in 2000. He was appointed Navajo County constable for precinct six in 2003 and elected in 2006. He has led hundreds of volunteers as the district chairman of the Boy Scouts of America, and he serves as the president of the Blue Ridge High School Scholarship Fund and Lions Club. In retirement, I hear that he plans to be making regular scuba diving trips, traveling the world, and spending quality time with his beloved family and friends—all well deserved. Mr. Speaker, Ryan Reinhold is a pillar of his community and has done so much for Arizona. I extend my best wishes as Ryan begins the next chapter of his life. 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, AMERICA (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, July 4, 1776, Philadelphia, 56 misfits, rebels, and freedom fighters all filled a small room with the intent to form a new nation. They pledged their lives, their honor, and their futures on one simple idea: that all people are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among those are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. As these ideas were put forth on paper, it was clear to the Founders that governments are instituted among men to preserve those rights. In that hot room, these 56 men put together the first foundation of our government, declaring independence from King George III. From July 4, 1776, forward, the term ‘‘independence’’ has defined America. After 7 long, grueling years of war, America gained that independence. So Tuesday, as Americans across the Nation watch parades packed with patriotic red, white, and blue and families gather for picnics, hot dogs, barbecue, and fireworks, all small towns and big towns throughout the country will remember and pay tribute to our Founders who instilled those three principles in our government: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Stars and Stripes are forever. Happy birthday, America. Happy Fourth of July. And that is just the way it is. f 
b1745 THE SENATE’S BETTER CARE RECONCILIATION ACT (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, this week, it was confirmed that the Senate’s Better Care Reconciliation Act is not just mean, it can’t even be passed by the majority party. The nonpartisan CBO revealed that if that bill did pass, in our Nation, 22 million people would lose their healthcare coverage over the next 10 years. That means in my district, on the central coast of California, 49,000 people would lose their insurance, and 16,000 people would lose their coverage they gained due to the Affordable Care Act. So because of that score, the Senate couldn’t pass the bill, and they delayed the vote on it. So now, we have the time. So now, let’s slow down. Let’s do something the American people are yearning for. Let’s come together, Republicans and Democrats, not just to repair our Nation’s healthcare, but to find bipartisan solutions for what is best for all of our constituents and all of our communities for healthcare all across our country. 
EDEN PRAIRIE BOYS BASEBALL CHAMPS (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Eden Prairie Boys Baseball team on becoming high school State champs recently. They secured a 5–1 win over Forest Lake. After a challenging first four innings, the Eagles, led by senior pitcher Jack Zigan, came back to win their very first State Championship since 2010. Jack threw a complete game, surrendering only three hits and one unearned run, with an impressive 11 strikeouts. This marked the end of a fantastic season for the Eagles, who finished the year 18–9 after entering the State tournament without a seed. They were never expected to get this far. They 
were never expected to win, but they defeated the number 1, the number 2, and the number 4 seed teams by a combined score of 25–2. So, Mr. Speaker, once again, I would just like to congratulate this hardworking team of student athletes, their coaches, and their parents for their State Championship win. This really does go to show that perseverance and hard work pay off. 
RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF HONG KONG’S TRANSFER TO CHINA (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, in 1984, before the United Kingdom handed Hong Kong over to China, the Chinese Government promised ‘‘a high degree of autonomy’’ for the territory in the Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong: providing for an independent executive, legislature, and judiciary; ensuring the freedom of speech, press, assembly, and religion; prohibiting the central government from interfering into the affairs that Hong Kong administers on its own according to the Basic Law; and pledging a path to universal suffrage. In 1997, when the handover occurred, America was hopeful that the people of Hong Kong would achieve the free, democratic future they deserved. But 2 decades later, we see China’s promise of ‘‘one country, two systems’’ is not being met. The Chinese have not honored that promise, and the British Government has ignored it. Since 2014’s ‘‘Umbrella Revolution,’’ the people of Hong Kong have faced a barrage of unjust and harsh restrictions on their freedoms. Hong Kong’s proBeijing government is slapping democratically elected opposition lawmakers with expensive lawsuits in a backhanded attempt to disqualify them from their seats. Peaceful activists are being rounded up and detained by the hundreds for exercising their right to protest the new government. Five booksellers were abducted, smuggled across the border to China and forced to confess—socalled confess—their socalled crimes on national television, simply because their employer sold books critical of Beijing. And, just this week, the democracy activists and heroes of the ‘‘Umbrella Movement,’’ Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, were arrested while peacefully protesting the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping, where they unfurled a banner in support of Liu Xiaobo. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend this body, especially our colleague, Congressman CHRIS SMITH of New Jersey, for the resolution that he put forth earlier, a resolution that recognized Liu Xiaobo’s contribution to democratic freedoms as a global hero, and urging the Chinese Government to allow him to seek medical care wherever, including in the United States. In mainland China, Mr. Speaker, the Chinese Government continues to jail journalists, human rights lawyers, those fighting to practice their own religion, and democracy activists at an alarming rate. And the Chinese Government is brutally trying to erase the religion, culture, and language of the Tibetan people. America has a moral duty to speak out in defense of the legitimate political aspirations of the people of Hong Kong. If we do not speak out for human rights in China because of economic concerns, then we lose all moral authority to talk about human rights in any other place in the world. As we mark this solemn 20th anniversary, we must stand up for all who are demanding the promises of ‘‘one country, two systems’’ be honored. INTRO —JOINT DECLARATION  
In 1984, before the United Kingdom handed over Hong Kong to China, the Chinese government promised ‘a high degree of autonomy’ for the territory in the Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong: —providing for an independent executive, legislature and judiciary; —ensuring the freedom of speech, press, assembly and religion; —prohibiting the central government from interfering in the affairs that Hong Kong administers on its own according to the Basic Law; —and pledging a path to universal suffrage.

But two decades later, we see China’s promise of ‘one country, two systems’ is not being met. The Chinese have not honored that promise, and the British have ignored it. 
Since 2014’s ‘Umbrella Revolution,’ the people of Hong Kong have faced a barrage of unjust and harsh restrictions on their freedoms.

And, just this week, the democracy activists and heroes of the ‘Umbrella Movement’, Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, were arrested while peacefully protesting the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping—where they unfurled a banner in support of Liu Xiaobo. This egregious attempt at smothering free speech is alarming, illegal and deserves the swift condemnation of the international community. We must honor the protestors’ chant—‘the world is watching’—and condemn the arrest of Wong and the other demonstrators. Unfortunately, Beijing shows absolutely zero signs of ceasing its aggressive campaign of intimidation against democracy and human rights activists. CLOSE  
In Mainland China, the Chinese government continues to jail journalists, human rights lawyers, those fighting to practice their own religion and democracy activists at an alarming rate.

THE LAST BATTLE FOR DEMOCRACY IN VENEZUELA (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, as we plan to celebrate Independence Day on the Fourth of July, it is important for us also to recognize a human rights tragedy and an abomination of democracy as totalitarian rulers of Venezuela are suppressing their people in our southern hemisphere. To call attention to this tragic situation where thousands of people are being suppressed, where armed mobs are running around the streets intimidating people, and where Venezuelans cannot achieve the basic necessities of life, I include in the RECORD an article that recently appeared in The Wall Street Journal, ‘‘The Last Battle for Democracy in Venezuela,’’ and to call attention to the human rights tragedy which is occurring in South America. 
[From The Wall Street Journal, June 23, 2017] THELASTBATTLE FOR DEMOCRACY IN  VENEZUELA  Under Nicola´s Maduro, a county that had been one of Latin America’s wealthiest is having its democratic institutions shredded amid rising poverty and corruption (By David Luhnow and Jose´de Cordoba) Almost two decades after Venezuela’s late president, Hugo Cha´vez, came to power in an electoral landslide, his country’s transformation seems to be taking an ominous new turn. A country that was once one of one America’s wealthiest is seeing its democratic institutions collapse, leading to levels of disease, hunger and dysfunction more often seen in wartorn nations than oilrich ones. Mr. Cha´vez’s successor, President Nicola ´s Maduro, has called for a National Constitutional Assembly to be elected on July 30 to draft a new constitution, in which illdefined communal councils will take the place of Venezuela’s traditional governing institutions, such as state governments and the oppositiondominated Congress. The new assembly appears to be rigged to heavily represent groups that back the government. The Maduro government says that the new assembly will find a peaceful way forward for 
a country enduring an economic depression and standing on the brink of civil conflict. The government says it is building on the legacy of Mr. Cha´vez, a military man who vowed to fight corruption, dismantle the venal old political establishment and be a voice for millions of poor Venezuelans. But the opposition, which is boycotting the assembly vote, calls it a naked attempt to end democracy and turn the country into a Cuba style communist autocracy. The government’s own attorney general calls the vote illegal. The 545member assembly, a modernday soviet, would hold unlimited power while it writes a new governing charter, which could take years. Meantime, the assembly is widely expected to scrap next year’s presidential elections. ‘‘This is the last battle for democracy in Venezuela,’’ says David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at Tulane University. For the U.S., the prospect of a new Cuba sitting atop trillions of dollars of oil reserves is profoundly unpleasant. For the past decade, Venezuela has aligned itself with Russia, China, Iran and Syria. Whether it thrives or implodes, Mr. Maduro’s petrostate could cause far greater headaches to the U.S. and Latin America than isolated Cuba. An implosion could mean bigger shipments of cocaine to Central America and the U.S., as well as a massive increase in the current flow of tens of thousands of refugees already fleeing the country for the U.S., Colombia, Brazil and elsewhere. And a consolidation of power could let Mr. Maduro deepen his partnership with U.S. adversaries. The Trump administration has criticized Mr. Maduro’s plans to change the constitution, urging ‘‘respect for democratic norms and processes.’’ The U.S. has called for Venezuela to free political prisoners, respect the oppositioncontrolled congress and ‘‘hold free and democratic elections.’’ Mr. Maduro’s move has aggravated Venezuela’s political crisis. The opposition, sensing a doordie moment, plans to ramp up daily street protests. Some 80 people have died in such demonstrations in the past three months, and the president is unlikely to ease off on the tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons. ‘‘Maduro’s ultimate aim is to turn Venezuela into Cuba. And we will not accept being put in that cage,’’ says Julio Borges, the head of the oppositiondominated National Assembly. Venezuela’s momentous new step isn’t taking place amid the kind of revolutionary euphoria that Mr. Cha´vez may have imagined before he died of cancer in 2013. Rather, it is being pushed by an unpopular government trying to keep power amid an economic implosion. By year’s end, Venezuela’s economy will have shrunk by nearly a third in the past four years—a plunge similar to Cuba’s after the fall of the Soviet Union, and one rarely seen outside of conflict zones. In a nation estimated to be sitting on as much oil as Saudi Arabia, it is common to see poor families rummaging through garbage for food, even as the wealthy pack nearby gourmet restaurants. Inflation was estimated by the International Monetary Fund at 720% this year; it is expected to surpass 2,000% next year. Shortages are so acute that three out of four Venezuelans lost an average of 18 pounds last year, according to a survey by Venezuelan universities. Diseases not seen there in decades, such as malaria, are back. ‘‘The government is desperate because they know the next presidential election will be their last,’’ says Ce´sar Miguel Rondo´n, a popular radio host. When the host recently tried to leave Venezuela on a business trip to Miami with his family, he had his passport seized. ‘‘I’m a hostage in my own country,’’ he said. Amid the economic crisis and protests, the government has headed down an increasingly authoritarian path. It has raised the number of political prisoners over the past year to 391, according to the Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal—nearly four times the total from a year ago. Most are being tried in military courts. And the government is seeking to remove its rebellious attorney general through a case in the supreme court. The government didn’t answer requests for comment. The socalled Bolivarian revolution has become less about ideology and more about money. Venezuelans often call it a ‘‘robolucio´n’’ rather than a ‘‘revolucio´n,’’ using the Spanish word for robbery. If Cuba is an ideologically motivated communist dictatorship, Venezuela is something different; as oilrich as Saudi Arabia, as authoritarian as Russia and as corrupt as Nigeria. Spectacular accusations of drug trafficking and corruption have sullied Mr. Maduro’s own family. Two nephews of Venezuela’s first lady, Cilia Flores, are awaiting sentencing in New York after being found guilty last year of conspiring to import 800 kilos of cocaine to the U.S. through Honduras. They pleaded not guilty. The interior minister, Gen. Ne´stor Reverol, has been indicted in the U.S. for drug trafficking; Vice President Tareck El Aissami is on the U.S. Treasury Department’s kingpin list for allegedly protecting drug traffickers; and the head of Venezuela’s supreme court is on another Treasury blacklist far gutting the country’s democratic institutions. They all say that they are innocent and accuse the U.S. of trying to destabilize Venezuela. In some ways, analysts say, the extent of these accusations has made a negotiated solution to Venezuela’s crisis more difficult. ‘‘The regime’s connection to crime and drugs is what makes it difficult for them to give up power,’’ says Harold Trinkunas, an expert on Venezuela at Stanford University. ‘‘Many have to be worried that if they step down, they will be put on a plane to the U.S.’’ In Cuba, the Castro dynasty has kept power despite decades of disastrous economic policies due to devotion to the charismatic Fidel, popular achievements such as universal free health care, ideological loyalty to Marxism, discipline enforced by security forces, and the nationalist frisson of facing off against the U.S. In Venezuela, aside from a similar devotion to Mr. Cha´vez, the glue that has held the regime together is simpler; oilsoaked corruption on an epic scale. Former planning minister Jorge Giordani, one of Mr. Cha´vez’s closest confidantes, said in 2015 that of an estimated $1 trillion in oil revenue received during the Cha ´vez years, twothirds had been distributed to workers through subsidies and cash transfers. The rest, more than $300 billion, had ‘‘fallen through the cracks,’’ he said. Mr. Giordani quit Mr. Maduro’s government in disgust in 2014 and now lives in a quiet neighborhood of Caracas. This year, the U.S. Treasury Department put Samark Lo´pez, a Venezuelan businessman, on a blacklist, accusing him of being a frontman for Vice President El Aissami, an alleged drug trafficker. Announcing the seizure, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the U.S. had frozen assets worth ‘‘tens of millions’’ of dollars when it seized a slew of properties and firms owned or controlled by Mr. Lo´pez in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere. In a statement, Mr. Lo ´pez de nied any wrongdoing and called the accusations ‘‘politically motivated.’’ The government didn’t respond to requests for comment, but in the past, Mr. Maduro and other officials have dismissed accusations of corruption, economic mismanagement and repression as part of an ‘‘economic war’’ being waged by Venezuela’s private sector, in cahoots with the U.S., to destabilize and overthrow the socialist government. As in many petrostates, oil accounts for 95% of Venezuela’s foreigncurrency earnings. Since the government administers the oil, one sure way to get ahead is not by creating a new business but by getting close to the government to secure access to oil rents. Venezuelans call the enterprising class following this model ‘‘los enchufados’’—the pluggedin ones. The path to power in Venezuela is often said to run through the army and oil. Once in power, the populist Mr. Cha´vez went after the oil, eventually firing 19,000 employees of the staterun oil firm Petro´leos de Venezuela to stack the company with his yesmen. After a brief and unsuccessful coup against him in 2002, he also cleaned out the barracks, handing over indoctrination and training to his Cuban allies. In the following years, oil prices rose sharply, and Mr. Cha´vez spent lavishly. He saved none of the windfall, ran large budget deficits even at peakoil prices, raided the country’s rainyday oil fund, and borrowed heavily, first from Wall Street and then from the Chinese and the Russians. He handed out billions of dollars worth of cutrate oil to Cuba, Nicaragua and even Boston and London to show off Venezuela’s growing energy clout. The number of government employees doubled, to five million, and spending skyrocketed. Printing so much money caused inflation, so the government set prices, sometimes below the cost of production. Companies that refused to sell at a loss were seized, aggravating shortages. Less local production made the country ever more reliant on imports. But once the price of oil began to drop in 2014, Venezuela could no longer afford the imports, which have fallen from $66 billion in 2012 to about $15.5 billion this year. And there is little domestic industry left to pick up the slack. ‘‘It is classic Latin American populism on steroids, and now we have the worst hangover in history,’’ said Juan Nagel, a Venezuelan economist living in Chile. Beyond some new public housing, little was built. Mr. Cha´vez left Venezuela littered with the bones of ambitious, halffinished publicworks projects. Among them was a $20 billion scheme to build a train network, which now lies abandoned. In Caracas, a new subway line ended up being just one additional stop on an existing line, prompting local wags to call it the Centi Metro (centimeter) rather than just a plain Metro. Unperturbed, the flamboyant leader focused on projects like changing Venezuela’s time zone by half an hour. He renamed the country the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. And to mark the shift in Venezuela’s political course, he changed the direction of a wild stallion on the country’s coat of arms, making the horse gallop left instead of right. Mr. Cha´vez’s revolution attacked the old elites, sending nearly two million Venezuelans—and billions of dollars—packing in the past 10 years. But in their stead rose a new elite: the socalled Boliburgueses, or Bolivarian bourgeoisie, who enjoyed a life of premium wines, Scotches and cars as poverty levels rose. ‘‘You don’t see that in Cuba or Vietnam. But here, you see Hummers, private jets and obscene new mansions,’’ says Miguel Pizarro, an opposition leader whose father was a Marxist guerrilla in Venezuela and whose mother served in Mr. Cha´vez’s first political party in the mid1990s. ‘‘These guys literally bought the homes where Venezuela’s elite lived, tore them down and built even bigger ones.’’ 
Few enjoyed la dolce vita of Caracas more than Wilmer Ruperti, a businessman who earned Mr. Cha´vez’s loyalty in 2002 when he helped break an oil strike. Mr. Ruperti was a familiar sight in Caracas, riding in an armored Jaguar accompanied by two North Korean bodyguards. The magnate cemented his friendship with Mr. Cha´vez by buying a pair of Simo´n Bolı´var’s pistols for $1.7 million in a New York auction and presenting them to the Venezuelan leader. Last year, Mr. Ruperti paid the multimilliondollar legal fees for the criminal defense of Mr. Maduro’s nephews. At the same time, Mr. Ruperti’s firm won a $138 million contract from the state oil company. Mr. Ruperti said it was his patriotic duty to pay the nephews’ legal fees as a way of relieving the pressures on Mr. Maduro. He denied any link between the payment of the fees and the state oilfirm contract. Corruption helps the government maintain political control. And no tool has been more effective than exchange controls, initially adopted by Mr. Cha´vez in 2002 during a national strike to control capital flight. Fifteen years later, they have reshaped Venezuela’s economy and given the government enormous power to pick who gets dollars from the country’s oil wealth—often at absurdly low rates. For instance, firms and others who import food get dollars at the official rate of 10 bolivars. But they can turn around and sell those dollars on the black market for 8,300 bolivars. Venezuela’s army recently got the rights to set up its own mining and oil companies, and the armed forces are in charge of most critical imports. In 2016, 18 generals and admirals were tasked with importing key foods and sanitary items. One brigadier general was put in command of acquiring black beans; another was charged with acquiring toilet paper, feminine napkins and diapers. Logically, an admiral was placed in charge of acquiring fish. No one knows how much money has been lost. Mr. Giordani estimated that a third of the $59 billion that the government handed out to companies to bring imports into the country in 2012 might have ended up in fraudulent schemes. ‘‘It’s a terrible economic model, but it’s great for politics and power,’’ says Asdru ´bal Oliveros, a prominent Venezuelan economist. The opposition and the regional governments don’t know how to turn the tide. An Organization of American States resolution this week urging Venezuela to return to democracy was supported by every major country in the hemisphere but blocked by Venezuelan allies like Nicaragua and a handful of statelets like St. Kitts and Nevis. Many in Venezuela hope that parts of the army haven’t been tempted by money and will want to honor the country’s democratic past. Ibsen Martı´nez, who helped write some of the country’s most beloved soap operas, says that hope is likely in vain. ‘‘The army is now a criminal organization,’’ he said in an interview from Bogota ´, where he now lives in exile. ‘‘But in every culture, there are mythical creatures. In Venezuela, it is the idea of an institutional military man, who will come out like Captain America to resolve everything.’’ That instinct, he added, led to Mr. Cha ´vez in the first place. His revolution’s mournful impact can be seen everywhere. Venezuela’s national baseball league now plays to empty stadiums and is considering suspending this year’s season. The Teresa Carren˜o theater, an architectural masterpiece in Caracas, used to produce some of the region’s best operas and dramas; it now mostly hosts government rallies. In the nearby Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art, water drips into buckets near paintings by Picasso and Mondrian. The museum is so empty that a thief replaced a Matisse portrait with a fake without anyone noticing for several years. Alberto Barrera, the author of a biography of Mr. Cha´vez who now lives in Mexico City, thinks that the time is fast approaching when he and the opposition may need to say goodbye to their hopes. ‘‘I wonder when I will wake up and realize, ‘They beat us.’ That it’s all over and the county I knew is gone,’’ he said. 
Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, it is vitally important that we stand up on this Fourth of July, not just for democracy here in the United States, but for democracy in other parts of the world as people are struggling. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, and Happy Fourth of July to all of our countrymen around the United States of America. 
TRUMPCARE IS A DEVASTATING BILL (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as we go home to commemorate the birth of this Nation, to wish all well, we would hope we would be able to go home by feeling comfortable that the administration was taking care of the American people. We have come to find out that the EPA is reversing a decision of the Obama administration to allow a pesticide by the name of—trade name Lorsban, that is chlorophyllbased, to be utilized on fruits and vegetables. I understand the needs of farmers, but there are documented studies that indicate that it may have a significant impact on the brain function of little children as young as 7 years old. Where is the care of the Nation by this administration? And then, they are planning a healthcare bill that will see this young lady lose her healthcare. In my district, 89,000 people will lose their insurance when they cut $854 billion out of Medicaid; 16,000 will be children. Where will the hospitals survive if they are closed in rural and urban America, and where will the seniors be when their nursing home puts them out because the Medicaid that has been for working seniors but now retired in nursing homes who rely on Medicaid? The TrumpCare bill in the Senate is a devastating bill. We need to have an administration that takes care of the American people. 
RECOGNIZING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UTICA OBSERVER DISPATCH (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 200th anniversary of the Utica ObserverDispatch. Founded in 1817, the Utica OD was one of only 421 papers in the country, and the fifth newspaper founded in New York State. For the past 200 years, the Utica OD has kept our region informed through quality reporting on important issues impacting our local community. As an unwavering member of the fourth estate, the Utica ObserverDispatch had a leading role in exposing the inner workings of our once organized crimeinfluenced city. For this dedicated service on this very issue, and its campaign for justice against corruption, the Utica ObserverDispatch was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1959. I commend the Utica OD for its 200 years of steadfast reporting, and I encourage the ObserverDispatch and its committed members of the fourth estate to continue with its stated mission, to keep our citizens informed through impartial investigative reporting. Also, on a personal note, when I was a teenager, I actually delivered the Utica ObserverDispatch, and it was an honor to do it and a small way for me to start off my earning a living. So I just want to thank the Utica OD and congratulate them again on 200 years. f 
THERE IS NO HEART IN THE SENATE HEALTHCARE BILL (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, the Senate version was supposed to be the one, according to the President, with heart. There is no heart in this bill. Sixty percent of my constituents live in Los Angeles County which, in total, has about 5 percent—one county in the country has about 5 percent—of this country’s Medicaid recipients. The proposed Senate bill cuts to Medicaid would put more than a quarter of those currently receiving Medicaid assistance in L.A. County, nearly 900,000 people, at risk for losing health insurance. This is not a healthcare bill. This is a tax cut for the wealthy, dressed up to look like serious legislation. The rich get richer, while everyone else is left to get poorer and sicker. This is not who we are as Americans. 
A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today, I will become the first House Democrat in Congress to introduce a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. My bill will prohibit the Federal Government from spending more than it receives except in the case of war or recession. 
Democrats and Republicans may not always agree on the best way to balance the budget, but we all care about our country and our children, and both are at risk unless we rein in our unsustainable deficits and debt. In 45 of the last 50 years, the Federal Government spent more than it received. The Federal debt has ballooned to over $14 trillion. That is 77 percent of GDP, a figure that is expected to reach 150 percent in 30 years if we do not change course. Just as every family is expected to balance their budget, so, too, should the Federal Government. This is about taking responsibility and making tough decisions, exactly what our constituents elected us to do. A balanced budget amendment will compel Congress to walk the walk, not just talk the talk, when it comes to being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. I hope my colleagues on both sides of aisle will support this bill. 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to address you here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives and have an opportunity, in this great deliberative body, to bring up the subject matters of my choice, and the purpose is to inform you and the American people. Before I go into the topics that I am prepared to speak of, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ). 
Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for kindly yielding and allowing me to take a few minutes to have a little bit of reflection with the American people as we head into the Fourth of July weekend. Mr. Speaker, despite widespread cynicism from Washington elites and those in the media, the 115th Congress and President Trump have taken meaningful action over the past 6 months to improve the lives of hardworking Americans. According to a recent analysis, this Congress has been the most productive in the modern era. By June 8, we had passed 158 bills, compared to the 60 bills by the 103rd Congress under Bill Clinton, 67 bills by the 107th Congress under President Bush, and 131 bills by the 111th Congress under President Obama. President Trump has signed 39 bills into law, including 14 bills passed under the Congressional Review Act, stopping harmful regulations handed down by the previous administration. According to one analysis, repealing these rules could save the economy millions of hours of paperwork, nearly $4 billion in regulatory costs to the Federal agencies, and an astounding $35 billion in regulatory costs for the private sector. We sent to the President, and he signed, legislation to bring accountability to the Veterans Administration. And the House has acted to stop ObamaCare’s job and freedomcrushing mandates, and acted to put a critical safety net program on a sustainable path. The House also voted to repeal and replace Washington’s Financial Control Law, DoddFrank, to get capital flowing to our small businesses and to improve choices for consumers. The past 6 months have been a strong start, and I look forward to the House continuing its work to advance important goals of strengthening our economy and creating jobs. CELEBRATING OUR NATION ’S BIRTHDAY  
Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, every year at this time, our Nation celebrates our birthday. It is the perfect time to reflect on the founding of our country and the principles that made our Nation exceptional. b1800 At the height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, President Kennedy, in his inaugural address, reflected on our founding principles. JFK said: ‘‘And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe—the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the State, but from the hand of God.’’ President Kennedy understood the words of our Declaration of Independence: ‘‘We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.’’ A little more than 100 years before President Kennedy’s inauguration, our 16th President, Abraham Lincoln, defended the Declaration and taught all those around him, as well as future generations, how to revere and embrace unwaveringly the sacred and transcendent truths expressed in this monumental document. Lincoln said in 1858: ‘‘Now, my countrymen, if you have been taught doctrines conflicting with the great landmarks of the Declaration of Independence, if you have listened to suggestions which would take away from its grandeur, and mutilate the fair symmetry of its proportions; if you have been inclined to believe that all men are not created equal in those inalienable rights enumerated by our chart of liberty, let me entreat you to come back. Think nothing of me, take no thought for the political fate of any man whomsoever, but come back to the truths that are in the Declaration of Independence. You may do anything with me you choose, if you will but heed these sacred principles.’’ Today, Mr. Speaker, let us recommit to the principles set forth in our Declaration, that all are endowed by your Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And let those who have admired the leaders of our country who have reasserted these principles, from Lincoln to Kennedy, join together and continue to fight for the protection of these Godgiven rights, especially the first right, ‘‘the right to life.’’ Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me this opportunity to speak. I thank the gentleman from Iowa for having extended to me this opportunity to share these thoughts with the American people. Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his presentation in bringing this topic together in a way that he has. And in his method of addressing the Declaration of Independence on the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, I would expound on that as well. Life is the most paramount. It is a priority right, and our Founding Fathers knew what they were doing. They set up life as the first priority, liberty as the second priority, and the third priority was the pursuit of happiness. Mr. Speaker, I will start from the bottom because, of the three, I think it deserves the most explanation. That pursuit of happiness is often viewed as maybe a fun tailgate party or a bliss of some kind or maybe a barbecue outdoors with the family, the things that we love. That is the enjoyment of our life. The pursuit of happiness, as it was understood by our Founding Fathers, came from the Greek word ‘‘eudaimonia.’’ And that is spelled, E UDAIMONIA. And under the Greek word ‘‘eudaimonia,’’ it means developing the whole human being. And it is not just the mental well being, but it is developing the intellectual human being, the physical human being, the knowledge base that is there, and the spirit within us, and our theology and our souls—the whole package of what we are as human beings, developing that to the maximum, these Godgiven gifts, developing them for his glorification, and that is the concept of the pursuit of happiness that our Founding Fathers understood. So the principle is that we have a right to pursue happiness, developing our whole human being, which includes the human enjoyment that we think of when we say pursuit of happiness. But no one in their pursuit of happiness can trample on someone else’s liberty because liberties are Godgiven. And the liberties that we have cannot be subordinate to the pursuit of happiness, but they are subordinate to the life of others because life is the most sacred. Human life is sacred in all of its forms. It is the number one paramount right. So the protection of human life is the principle and is the highest priority in the Declaration of Independence. 
And the liberties that we have—freedom of speech, religion, the press, the right to keep and bear arms, a jury of our peers, no double jeopardy, the whole list in the Bill of Rights—those are Godgiven liberties, as conceived by our Founding Fathers and enshrined in the Bill of Rights, and, of course, in our Constitution. The rights that we have cannot be trampled upon or subordinated to someone else’s pursuit of happiness. Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, a wellthoughtout, prioritized list in our Declaration that gives us the inspiration that was the foundation for our Constitution and the principles of our lives in America today. So I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his explanation of this and for giving me an opportunity to flesh this out a little bit in the concepts of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But the segue that he has served up to me is this: that our debates today here in this Congress on the immigration bills that have now just passed the Congress have been focused on the right to life—the right to life versus the criminals that took the liberty to take them. They have violated the very foundations of our Declaration, and, of course, they violated our laws in a number of ways. But I think, especially, of the onset of this discussion, and I think of Sarah Root. And her legislation that is Sarah’s Law was introduced by me in this Congress. I have a copy of this bill today. We introduced it last year also, but in this Congress, it became H.R. 174, and it came about, and then we incorporated it into the broader bill today that we call the sanctuary cities legislation, Mr. Speaker. Sarah Root had just graduated from Bellevue University in Omaha. Her hometown is Modale, Iowa. She had just finished her graduation the day before with a perfect 4.0 grade point average, and her major was in criminal investigation. She would, today, be investigating criminals if it hadn’t been for the criminal that killed her the day after she graduated. And the individual who is responsible here, Eswin Mejia, who ran her over, ran into her vehicle on the streets with triple the blood alcohol content that is legal. Eswin Mejia was on a firstname basis with at least two of his immigration attorneys. When he was taken into custody, interestingly, as bad as the accident was, Sarah was rendered unrecognizable and she was on life support for a little while while the parents were deciding what decision to make. And she was also an organ donor. Sarah saved six. And many days I wear this bracelet that says, ‘‘Sarah Root saved six.’’ And this bracelet hangs on the antlers in my man cave. And when I walk down there in the morning, I often say a prayer for all of those bracelets that are hung on the antlers in my man cave that represent those individuals whose lives have been lost at the hands of criminal aliens who were unlawfully present in the United States and perpetrated violence against generally American citizens but others that are generally those that are at least lawfully present in America. Sarah Root was one of those victims, a stellar young lady with a 4.0 grade point average and a fresh diploma from Bellevue University; her whole life and a world ahead of her, and run down on the streets. Her father came to testify here in the Judiciary Committee in Congress, and he said: ‘‘The judge bailed Eswin Mejia, this perpetrator, out of jail for less money than it cost to marry my daughter, and he was back home in his home country before we could bury my daughter.’’ Those were some of the most powerful and moving and memorable words that I have heard in my time here in Congress. We think Eswin Mejia went back to Honduras, his home country. He had been incarcerated before. He had been encountered by law enforcement before, and they turned him loose on the streets. This happens again and again in America every day, local law enforcement picking up people that are unlawfully present in America, violating our immigration laws. The law requires that they be placed into removal proceedings. That is the law, but they turn them loose anyway and turn them out on the streets because we have sanctuary cities and sanctuary cities policies. Some local jurisdictions that don’t have a written policy, but they just simply—it is a practice that they have evolved into accepting. So when I say every one of the Americans who died at the hands of someone who is unlawfully present in America, illegal aliens, generally speaking, every one of those are a preventable death. If we enforced the law, they wouldn’t have been in America in the first place to commit the crimes they committed against our American citizens, our innocent people like Sarah Root, this beautiful young lady with a perfect grade point average, the world ahead of her, a happy, joyful young lady that, today, would be living, loving, laughing, and learning and contributing to our society. But she is in her grave today because Eswin Mejia got triple drunk, was unlawfully in the United States, and ran her car down and killed her on the streets and absconded for a $5,000 bond. What we did with Sarah’s Law—this is H.R. 174, the original language—and I wanted to assure the family of Sarah Root that this language is incorporated into the bill we passed today. It is incorporated into sanctuary cities legislation that we passed today. And what it does is it prohibits the judge from releasing an illegal alien on bond if they have been charged with or subject to a homicide or a crime where there is serious bodily injury. Once this issue came up in Omaha, Nebraska, and the public knew about this, we tried to unseat the judge that released this criminal that may have done damage again. But the judge that had let him out on $5,000 had a similar case. The next time, the bond went way up into six or even seven figures. So I think he got the message, but the public got the message, too. And I don’t know whether he will be able to hold his seat or not, but we have got to bring the right things. We have got to put the fixes in place. You would think we would have a judge that would understand this, yet, somehow in the political culture of America, we are watching criminal aliens be turned loose on the streets over and over again. I recall, Mr. Speaker, sitting in on immigration hearings in the Judiciary Committee. This is over a number of years now, and I suppose there are a couple of people in this Congress that have sat through more, not many. The witnesses would be—every week or so we would have a hearing and there would be witnesses that would testify about how many people died in the Arizona desert trying to sneak into America. And that number would be 200 in a year, 250 in a year, maybe the next year it went to 300. I remember that number going to 400 or more who died in the Arizona desert on the way into trying to sneak into America. Finally, with this parade of witnesses that were experts on why we ought to open the border so they didn’t have a difficult time getting into America— that is the lunacy that we have heard in the debate today over on this side of the floor, from my view, Mr. Speaker. I began to ask the witnesses this question: You are an expert on immigration and you have come to testify on how many didn’t make it through the desert. Could you tell me how many Americans died at the hands of those who did make it through the desert? And I would ask the witnesses—generally four witnesses—and they would go down the line: I don’t know the answer; I don’t know the answer; I don’t know the answer. And that went on for a while. And the fourth witness in one of those days was a former INS agent, Michael Cutler. And we are just a few years after September 11, 2001, when I asked him this question: How many Americans died at the hands of those who made it through the desert? Which is the phrase to imply how many Americans died at the hands of those who were unlawfully present in America. And Michael Cutler’s answer was: I don’t know the answer to that, but I can tell you it is in multiples of the victims of September 11. Now, think of that. Three thousand Americans were killed that day. Multiples of that would be at least 6,000. If he is right—and he is confident he is right, and now I am confident he was right—that started me thinking. 
b1815 So shortly after that, I commissioned a GAO study. That GAO study dug down deeply into the records that we had access to. It is hard to get this Congress to compare apples to apples, so I began to ask the questions: Of the people in the prisons of America, what are they in prison for? How many of them are criminal aliens? We did a report on that. They sliced and diced it and narrowed it down. It never actually became apples to apples, but it did come down to this substantial number that has been supported a couple of other times in other studies, in one subsequent that I had done in 2011. The number is very close to 28 percent of the inmates in our Federal penitentiaries are criminal aliens—28 percent. So it is reasonable to do a calculation and an extrapolation off of this, if 28 percent of these inmates are criminal aliens, what percentage of the murders are they committing? What percentage of the rapes are they committing? What percentage of the violent crimes are they committing? Or are they in jail for just simply violating a law of immigration? You will find out very few are in prison for violation of immigration law. They are the reflection on criminal aliens. They are similar, a very similar, if not identical, proportion of the crimes that are committed by others. So when you put that on there and hit the calculator—I am not going to speak those numbers into the RECORD  here, Mr. Speaker, because it is shocking and stunning how many Americans have lost their lives at the hands of people who shouldn’t have been here in the first place—Sarah Root included, Kate Steinle included, and many more. A few days after Sarah Root was killed, I sent out a tweet that just said: Sarah Root would be alive living and loving life if the President had not violated his oath and ordered ICE to stand down. That is what happened during the 8 year period of time President Obama asserted that he had this thing called prosecutorial discretion. Now, that is something that is established in law, at least in precedent, but it has to be done on an individual basis, and he delivered it in a blanket basis. Janet Napolitano delivered the document. I questioned her on it in the committee. They decided that prosecutorial discretion can be defined. They created four categories of people and essentially granted amnesty to all of them and turned them loose. They turned criminals loose on the streets in America—36,007 of them in one bunch. Some of them were murderers out on to the streets of America. You can see what happens to the crime in this country. If you are importing people from the most violent countries in the world, and when they are encountered by law enforcement turning them loose, or if they are picked up for a taillight or speeding or getting in a fight or shoplifting, whatever the case may be, failure to signal, running a stoplight, they are picked up for that. When local law enforcement encounters them, they look at their identification. They ask them a few questions. It isn’t hard to figure out whether they are legal or not. Some are good enough liars. But any time that law enforcement encounters people unlawfully present in America, they are to put them in removal proceedings, and ICE is to do it. Yet thousands have been turned loose on the streets. At least 300 cities in America have established sanctuary policies that they turn them loose. Some of the cities have passed policies that refuse to allow their law enforcement to even gather information or accept information on illegal aliens that they encounter. So, for example, this is how bad it is even in a place like Iowa. One of my staff people who was involved in a car accident that was caused by an illegal alien who had no license and had no insurance but he did have an illegal job in the town where he caused the accident crashed into my staff and wrecked my staff’s car. So when I got the phone call on that, I turned to my thenchief of staff who is a lightsouts, University of Chicago School of Law lawyer. I said: I want you to go to this town and stay there until you can get this resolved. And I want to find out: What can we get accomplished to enforce the law? This was our opportunity to learn if a Member of Congress’ staff can be run into by an illegal alien without a driver’s license and without insurance with an illegal job in town and owning a car, and I have a topnotch lawyer chief of staff to go up there and communicate with law enforcement to try to bring the law enforcement in place so we could at least deport the guy. After 3 or 4 days up there and a number of phone calls from me down here, I finally got the message back that finally convinced me we couldn’t crack through the code of local law enforcement to be able to deport the individual who was clearly illegal. He was unlawfully working—no driver’s license and no insurance. The practice of simply staying out of immigration law because they were local law enforcement and didn’t want to touch it was so ingrained that we could not move the bubble off the center. Finally, I said: Okay, we have got other people to take care of. We are not going to get this solved, so let’s turn our focus back to other things. That is so very frustrating. I tell this, Mr. Speaker, to let the world know the frustration of families who had a loved one who was killed by illegals and watched them turned loose on the streets, and then have them abscond and go back to their home country or go back into the shadows and hide. That is the thing that happened with Sarah Root. Today, we did honor to her and her life by passing Sarah’s Law as part of the sanctuary city law. How utterly appropriate to bring a ban on sanctuary cities, to pass it off the floor of the House, and wrapped up in the same bill is Sarah’s Law to respect her; her life; the sacrifice of her life; the sacrifice of her mother, Michelle; her father, Scott; and her only sibling, her brother, Scotty, who carries the whole load now for the next generation—all of that. Finally, Congress did some justice for Sarah Root. It is only a small piece of justice. It is the least we can do, but it is the right thing for us to do. What her family wants is that no other families have to suffer like they have suffered. This is the story of Sarah Root whose name was elevated on the national stage by President Trump. As much as I push things out of this Congress, I don’t come close to having as big a megaphone as Donald Trump. So I want to thank the President of the United States for picking up the case of Sarah Root when he came to Iowa to campaign for the nomination of the Presidency of the United States. When he began to make his immigration cases and lay out the platform for his immigration policy, I noticed that it mirrored mine very closely. I mentioned to him one day: Mr. President, I have market tested your immigration policy for 14 years in Iowa. It shouldn’t have been a surprise that they understand these issues. They support the rule of law, they support securing the border, they support building a wall, and they support banning sanctuary cities. That is not just Iowa values, that is at least heart of the heartland values. Those are American values—American values that want to live in a country that has the rule of law, a country where our children can be safe, and where they can play in the streets and they don’t have to be looking over the shoulder; or a mother or a father doesn’t have to keep them indoors because the streets are too dangerous. This morning, we have heard from Jamiel Shaw who has been in to this Congress and testified before my committee maybe as far as back as 8 or 9 years ago. He is from Los Angeles. His son, who was a star football player, Jazz Shaw, was shot down and killed by an illegal alien gang member who went on the hunt that day with an assignment, as I understood it, to go shoot a Black person. Jazz Shaw was murdered on the streets close enough to his father, Jamiel’s, house that his father said this morning on FOX News that he could hear the gun shots. He went out there to see his son laying on the street in the blood pooling in the street. A ghastly murder for the sake of what? A gang challenge and a race label. That would not be the case if that murderer had been deported back to his 
became 3 million people because they probably counted a little wrong, and there was a lot of fraud, a lot of people who presented themselves and alleged that they were to be included. This was a faster track to citizenship for them. Three million people received amnesty in 1986, and I said then that none of them should have, that they should not be rewarded for breaking the law. Yet they got their amnesty. The signature that Ronald Reagan put on that amnesty legislation was supposed to be in exchange for enforcement of the law, but the law didn’t get enforced. The amnesty was delivered triple what was expected. And I knew then that we would have a long, hard slog restoring the respect for the rule of law, but I have set about doing that since that period of time. More than 30 years later, we are here on the floor strengthening the rule of law after all this time, after the amnesty that has been advocated by others. Each decade we seem to have to have a battle. They want to come with what they now call comprehensive immigration reform. Just about anybody in America knows if you say ‘‘comprehensive immigration reform,’’ you really mean amnesty. I say to them: Just be honest. If you think amnesty is a good idea, why do you say all those three words when you can say ‘‘amnesty’’ and be honest? People know what you mean. If the public is ready for amnesty, then you can pass it. If we are not, you can’t. The American people understand this intuitively, that we have got to stop the lawbreaking and that we cannot be rewarding those who break the law. Now, there are those who think that we should somehow find a path of amnesty for those individuals identified unconstitutionally by Barack Obama in his DACA program—Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. They aren’t all innocent little waifs who have been brought in by their mother against their will, as many would say. Instead, many of them are prime gangage recruitment, young men. I have gone down there and watched that flow of epic humanity coming out of Central America, coming through Mexico, some from Mexico—a diminishing number from Mexico—coming into the United States. The numbers we looked at were 81 percent male. And if they are under 18, they are coming on their own—if they are 14, 15, 16 or 17 years old. And they don’t always tell you the truth either, Mr. Speaker. So this large group of people are prime gangage recruitment youth. And these youth are coming from some of the most violent countries in the world. And 11 of the 13 most violent countries in the world are south of the Rio Grande, and one of those countries is not Mexico. So when they come into America, they bring with them the violence and the culture that is part of it, and we can expect our crime rates to go up. The people from the inner cities, who generally sit over on that side of this Congress, want to get them out of places like El Salvador and Guatemala and put them into the inner cities, in places like east St. Louis and Detroit and Newark, and a number of other cities where the violent crime rate is very high, to get them away from the violence that is part of their neighborhood. I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that we may be putting them into neighborhoods that are more dangerous than the countries that they come from, but we don’t log those crime statistics very clearly because it is so sensitive to the people in the inner city, they don’t want to talk about it. So crime has been pervasive in these countries. They are sending young men especially that are prime gangage recruitment. They are being recruited to MS–13. Judge Jeanine Pirro said the other day that 30 percent of them become MS–13 members. Mr. Speaker, let me inquire, if I could, the amount of time I have remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 20 minutes remaining. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that response. I wanted to roll through what our sanctuary cities legislation does that we just passed today, and it goes a pretty good, long, comprehensive way. I pointed out that I brought the first sanctuary cities legislation into this Congress that I could find a record of. It was in 2005 when I brought an amendment through the Homeland Security appropriations to cut all funding to sanctuary cities. 2005. And then along the way, each opportunity that was there, I brought an amendment to cut off funding to sanctuary cities. Most of the time it was in the Judiciary, the justice appropriations bill. And I see a number of them here scattered in my memo that I asked staff to put together. So as far back as 12 years ago, I have been working to end Federal funding going to sanctuary cities that defy local law enforcement. And we have gotten resistance from the other side of the aisle consistently. Barack Obama was never going to sign anything like that, but I kept beating the drum every year to cut off funding to sanctuary cities. Finally, I introduced the legislation on sanctuary cities in 2015, and then again at the beginning of this Congress. And Chairman BOBGOODLATTE  was gracious enough to pull that together so we could bring it to the floor today. And we have had a lot of cooperation from many others on this. I see the first date I introduced the sanctuary cities legislation as a standalone bill was November 4 of 2015, and here we are today finally passing it. I thought I had been at it for a long time, Mr. Speaker, and it added up to 12 years that I have been actively engaged, at least—maybe 14—until I talked to Congressman LOUBARLETTA  from Hazleton, Pennsylvania, who, as a mayor in 1999, began to raise the issue and made it a national issue. He was selected to this Congress. He has been at it 18 years. Others have been at this a long time, too. So many of us are grateful today that the sanctuary cities language has passed and that Sarah’s Law, Kate’s Law, all of that that I was able to introduce into this Congress has passed out of the House of Representatives and messaged to the Senate. And I hope the Senate picks it up. The sanctuary cities language does this: It bans their policies, for starters, Mr. Speaker. It blocks the Department of Justice grants to the sanctuary cities that defy Federal law and refuse to cooperate with Federal law enforcement on immigration. And those grants would be generally grants that have to do with law enforcement that would be effected by DOJ. It allows the Department of Homeland Security to refuse warrants from the sanctuary cities. The sanctuary cities might serve a warrant to someone in custody, and DHS can say: We are not going to hand this person over to you because we are pretty confident you are just going to turn them loose on the streets. So that piece in there is a protection that keeps some from being released. And then it requires ICE to take custody of these criminal aliens within 48 hours of the notice that comes from the State or local government that would have them picked up. It also establishes a good faith provision that holds local government harmless for honoring ICE detainers. Now, that is something that was undermined on February 25 of 2015 by thenActing Director of ICE, Dan Ragsdale, who sent a letter out that just simply advised local law enforcement that an ICE detainer is a suggestion, not an order. Well, the law and the rule says that it is an order, not a suggestion. This statute clarifies it and firms it up with respect to detainers. And then if a local jurisdiction is sued by, say, the ACLU, as they are wont to do, it gives them a protection, and it lets the Department of Justice and the Federal Government substitute itself for local government, and it holds local government harmless when it comes to the case of ICE detainers. Here is a very powerful piece, Mr. Speaker, and it is this: the sanctuary cities legislation passed today, H.R. 3003, provides a cause of action against any jurisdiction that releases an alien who subsequently commits a felony. Now, that is a powerful provision, and it is something that moves me in my heart. As a former crime victim, it occurred to me when they announced the name of the case that I wasn’t involved in that equation at all even though it nearly destroyed my business, and I began to think about how this is. 
Our criminal law comes from old England. And in old England, if you committed a crime—the king owned everything. If you killed one of his serf, you killed the king’s serf. That was the murder that took place. If you shot a deer, you shot the king’s deer. If you stole something, it was a violation against the crown. And we transferred the criminal law into America, and the State has replaced the crown. So when you commit a crime, that crime is committed against the State as if you had killed one of the king’s deer, but it doesn’t consider the victim hardly at all. We are doing a little better in recent years, but this allows the crime victims to have a recourse, Mr. Speaker. And I think we will hear a lot about this provision in the sanctuary cities law as this moves over to the Senate. I think we made a lot of progress today. It has been a good day to do honor to the lives of Sarah Root, a beautiful young lady whose mother is here in this Capital City today and speaking and testifying and doing radio and meetings. And one day I hope we hunt down Eswin Mejia, the killer of this beautiful young woman. And one day I hope we have the relationship with his home country where they will hunt him down and extradite him to the United States of America. That is, of course, a law we need to have in a civilized world. And Kate Steinle, I thank not only Matt Salmon for bringing this forward, but Bill O’Reilly and the President of the United States. Something this President has done is he asked the family members of the victims of criminal aliens in America to step up on the stage with him around the campaign trail over and over again. One would think that they were props for a campaign. That kind of criticism flowed out. But here is what he has really done: he illuminated the pain that they went through over and over again. When he came back to Iowa on a ‘‘thank you’’ tour, he had some of the crime victims there. He brought them up on the stage. You can tell by the look in his eye that they moved him. He has said the thing that moved him the most in the entire campaign were the families who had an illegal kill their daughter, their son, their family member. That moved him the most. He has done honor to that. He has asked that we bring this legislation to the floor. We have done so. We have passed it out of the House. And the President, yesterday, met with a dozen or so of these families at the White House. He will continue to push this legislation till it becomes law. And I expect at the bill signing ceremony, these families will be invited back to the White House and they will get a closure on the pain that they are going through this day. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1845 HONORING WILBERT AUSTIN The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FLORES ) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor Reverend Wilbert Austin of Waco, Texas, who passed away on June 19, 2017. Wilbert grew up poor in a small shack in the southern part of Waco in a racially segregated area called Sandtown. His father was a day laborer who picked cotton for a living, while his mother was a laundress and cafe worker. Wilbert used to play by the old rendering plant that was next to the cemetery in Sandtown. Even in their poverty, Wilbert’s parents were able to raise five children. His meager upbringing is something that would shape him for the rest of his life and molded him into a great servant. During his life, Wilbert worked many jobs, including working for a glass bottle manufacturer, OwensIllinois, and as a leader of the local chapter of the NAACP. During his time at the NAACP, he was known for advocating for civil rights in Waco. Always seeking to make Waco a better place, he would often make sure that children and families had a safe area to play and enjoy by keeping out drug dealers, doing so on a facetoface basis, if needed. Wilbert was a passionate advocate for his Christian faith and decided to share his faith in the pulpit. He became a pastor of Moody’s Peaceful Rest Baptist Church, where he would serve for 38 years. He was known to his congregation and around Waco as someone with a servant’s heart. Wilbert would mow lawns for the elderly and collect gift cards at Christmas to distribute to needy families. In 1974, Wilbert led an effort to change local city government, and that made him an important part of Waco’s history. In the 1950s, the city had adopted an atlarge district after an African American individual nearly won a city council seat. As a result of his tireless and dedicated efforts, Waco dropped the atlarge system and divided its city into five districts, with each district having a single elected representative. His perseverance changed the atlarge system because it did not fairly represent the electoral choices of the AfricanAmerican areas of Waco. Though he never believed he would run for city council, Wilbert’s desire to serve eventually led him to campaign for a seat. Wilbert showed great perseverance as he ran for city council five times, ultimately winning a seat in 2006. He went on to serve as the councilman for District One for 11 years before having to step down earlier this year due to declining health. Today’s Waco is a diverse and inclusive city because of his community service. Wilbert was also a devoted and loving husband to his late wife of 50 years, Annie Pearl Austin, who passed away from breast cancer in 2012. Annie was supportive of her husband’s efforts to help Waco and would often tell her children: ‘‘No matter what or why he’s out in the public, always love your dad and support him.’’ They were blessed with 5 children, and they were the grandparents to 10 grandchildren. During the last years of his life, Wilbert fought a battle with cancer that he ultimately lost. Throughout his battle, he never lost sight of where he was going. In a farewell address at his retirement party, Wilbert stated: ‘‘I’m all packed up. When you hear of my passing, don’t grieve for me. I’m just another soldier going home to be with the Lord.’’ Mr. Speaker, Wilbert Austin worked tirelessly to better our central Texas community and did so by serving his congregation, his community, reducing crime, and serving in elected office. He is loved by our community and certainly left an enduring impression on the greater Waco area. He will forever be remembered as a community leader, pastor, civil rights activist, servant, husband, father, grandfather, and friend. My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the Austin family. We also lift up the family and friends of Wilbert in our prayers. I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the United States Capitol to honor the life and legacy of Reverend Wilbert Austin. As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our country during these difficult times, for our military men and women who protect us from external threats, and for our first responders who protect us here at home. 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor General Joe Hanover of Woodway, Texas, who passed away on May 22, 2017. Joe was born in McGregor, Texas, on February 10, 1918. He grew up in a farming community and attended grade school in Wheelock before graduating from Franklin High School in 1938. Wheelock was a special place to Joe because it is where he met the love of his life, Lucille, in the first grade. During his high school years in Franklin, Joe became interested in engineering, an interest that would guide much of the rest of his life. Upon graduation from high school, Joe went to Texas A&M University in College Station, where he would go on to earn a bachelor of civil engineering degree in 1940. In 1941, he married Lucille and started his engineering career by working for the Texas Highway Department in Hearne. World War II interrupted Joe’s early career and family life, as he was called 
into Active Duty in 1941. He was commissioned into the U.S. Army 10 months prior to Pearl Harbor and still carried his original orders to report to Camp Wallace, Texas, until the day he passed away. During his service in World War II, George served in the European theater, notably in Belgium and France. He served in the 54th Coastal Artillery, a division that had 3,000 AfricanAmerican soldiers in it. At the conclusion of the war, Joe was given command of a German prisoner of war camp in Marseilles, France. In an interview with the local newspaper, Joe was quoted as saying: ‘‘I started as a commander of Black soldiers, fighting against the world’s greatest racist, Adolph Hitler, and finished as the commander of a prison holding German soldiers who had tried to carry out Hitler’s plans.’’ Joe’s enlistment lasted 5 years, and he was given orders to go home in February 1946. He also joined the Army Reserve, from which he retired in 1971 with the rank of brigadier general. When he returned to the United States, he went back to work for the Texas Highway Department, embarking on a career that would last for more than 35 years. Joe worked on numerous projects throughout the State and is best known in College Station for overseeing the completion of the University Drive overpass. On the 50year anniversary of the opening of that structure, the City of College Station declared March 21 of each year going forward to be Joe Hanover Day. Texas A&M played a large role in Joe’s life, and he was known for his great love of the university. He regularly attended Fightin’ Texas Aggie sporting events, especially baseball and football games. When recounting the best days of his life, Joe would routinely tell you that the day he married Lucille and the day he was baptized were the two greatest days of his life. Mr. Speaker, Joe Hanover fought in service of our country and worked tirelessly to better the BryanCollege Station area. He is loved by our community and certainly left an enduring impression on the Brazos Valley. He will be forever remembered as a hero, community leader, husband, and friend. My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the Hanover family. We also lift up the family and friends of Joe Hanover in our prayers. I requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol to honor the life and legacy of General Joe Hanover. As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our country during these difficult times, for our military men and women who protect us from external threats, and for our first responders who protect us here at home. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. PERSECUTION OF CHRISTIANS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) for 30 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, tonight I want to talk about persecution, worldwide, of people of the Christian faith. We don’t hear much about Christian persecution through world media, and I think it is important that Americans understand that persecution of minority religious groups throughout the world continues, and especially continues against Christians. Each month, Mr. Speaker, 332 Christians are killed, 214 churches are destroyed, and 772 forms of violence are committed against Christians. Once again, every month, 332 Christians are killed, 214 churches are destroyed, and 772 forms of violence are committed against individuals of the Christian faith. In 2013, Christians faced persecution in 102 out of 190 countries. For the second year in a row, Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the entire world. In 2016, 90,000 Christians were killed for their faith worldwide. In 2016, roughly 600 million people were prevented from practicing their faith through intimidation, forced conversions, bodily harm, or even death. Many Christians are brutally murdered simply for their belief in Jesus. Oppression is not limited to Christians worldwide. Religious minorities throughout the world are restricted in their practices or persecuted for their beliefs. Eightytwo countries, worldwide, require people in minority religious groups in that country to register with the government, while 99 countries restrict their practicing of religion. Here are the top 10 Christian persecution countries in the world. It is no surprise that North Korea is number one on the hit list that wants to punish and persecute Christians. Little Kim takes delight in torturing people, especially people of religious beliefs, including Christians. Christians are often sent to prison camps for just owning a Bible. Those Bibles are smuggled in through other countries, but generally they come from South Korea. Approximately 80,000 to 120,000 are imprisoned in labor camps for their religious beliefs. That is 80,000 to 120,000 people are in prison camps, labor camps, because of their religion in little Kim’s dictatorship of North Korea. So, number one is North Korea. I will give you the other nine, Mr. Speaker. Somalia is number two; number three is Afghanistan; Pakistan is number four; Sudan is number five. Of the 10 worst countries for Christian persecution, number six, no surprise, is Syria. Iraq is number seven; Iran is number eight; Yemen is number nine; and Eritrea is number 10 of the top 10 countries that persecute Christians for simply believing in the Christian faith. The Pew Research Council says 95 percent of the countries in the Middle East and North Africa have instances of government harassment or use of force against religious groups; 75 percent had instances of government harassment against even Muslims, people that believe differently than the government faith. In Asia, there has been an uptick in persecution by governments in Islamic extremism. Christians in this region are targeted by national religious movements—the Muslim, the Hindu, and the Buddhist—in countries like Pakistan, India, and Myanmar. Christians around the world routinely face blasphemy laws for simply speaking about their faith. A country that I haven’t mentioned yet is Communist Vietnam. Yes, Mr. Speaker, whether we leave off that phrase Communist Vietnam, they are still a communist country, an atheistic country. New laws led by the government punish anyone who dares to practice their religion or speak out against the authoritarian regime. New laws are being used to crack down on citizens’ basic human right of the right to believe and practice their religion. New rounds of arrests this year are proof. Human Rights Watch says 110 people are prisoners of conscience or imprisoned in harsh conditions after unfair trials. These prisoners are not criminals, but the government thinks they are criminals because they practice their religion. They are advocates for human rights and social justice. They are pastors and priests. They are in jail for believing in the Almighty. Pastor Nguyen Cong Chinh has been in prison in Vietnam since 2011. b1900 Mr. Speaker, I might add here that prisons in Vietnam haven’t changed much over the years. It is still a Communist country, and when you go to jail in Vietnam, you are in a prison like no other. Those prisons still exist, and they house people because the government puts people of Christian faith in jail. Pastor Nguyen has been tortured and beaten. He has no contact with his family. They give him food, and they make fun of him because in the food they give him, they break up glass and put the glass in that food. He is being held in solitary confinement, and all because he took a stand for Christianity and he told officials— and he told officials from the United States—about his treatment in jail. The security officials not only give him physical torture, they give him mental torture as well. His wife has also suffered for her faith. Last year, she was beaten and jailed while peacefully campaigning for religious freedom. You see, Mr. Speaker, when they go out in Vietnam and advocate the human right of religious freedom, the Government of Vietnam persecutes 
them for that—beats them, tortures them, and puts them in jail. Americans need to be aware of what is taking place in this country and others. His wife suffered for her faith, but she continued to preach the word even against this evil injustice. Even to this day, the Vietnamese Communists harass her as well as her husband who is incarcerated. Indonesia is the world’s largest Muslim majority nation. But there are communities of Hindus and Christians and Buddhists. These three groups of religious individuals are persecuted because they are not the faith of the government. There is an alarming shift in tolerance. Indonesia used to claim and be, to some extent, tolerant of other religious faiths other than the Muslim faith. They were proud of that. But there is a shift in the government to not tolerate religious minorities. Recently, the governor of Jakarta was sentenced to prison for 2 years for blasphemy against the Muslim faith. His charge is based on statements the governor made about the Koran that were seen as offensive to Islam, therefore offensive to the government, and there he goes, off to jail in Indonesia. Religious tolerance and free speech is being lost, while in Indonesia hard line Islamic forces are encouraging this persecution. Pakistan. Pakistan is a country I have talked about frequently on this House floor, but Pakistan churches have been bombed and people have been killed. In one town, a 14yearold Christian boy, because he was a Christian, was beaten and set on fire. Persecution of the young. Persecution of the elderly. All because of their religious faith. In Pakistan, Pakistan not only persecutes Christians, they persecute other Muslims who don’t agree with the government position on Islam, including the Murji’ah. In the Middle East, Egypt has recently come under scrutiny because of the increase in attacks from Islamic extremists who target Christians. In May, gunmen forced Coptic Christian pilgrims from buses, took them out of the buses, and executed 28 of them because they were Coptic Christians. Palm Sunday this year, twin bombings on Christian churches in Egypt killed almost 50 people. A man cloaked in explosives snuck through security and detonated his bomb, killing 28 and wounding 70. At the same time, another suicide bomber attacked St. Mark’s Church in Alexandria, Egypt, killing another 17 people, and injuring scores more. Over a 3day period in 2013, Coptic Christians experienced the worst attack against their churches in 700 years in Egypt. Forty churches were destroyed, and more than 100 other sites were severely damaged. One boy was beaten to death for wearing a cross around his neck. He is walking down the street, he has got a cross around his neck, and, lo and behold, he is attacked, beaten to death because of his religious belief. Tens of thousands of Coptic Christians have fled the country. Well, no kidding. They are leaving because their lives depend on it. ISIS has decimated ancient Christian communities in the Middle East as well. We have this issue of governments persecuting Christians or allowing persecution to exist. But alongside this, we have this terrorist group ISIS that it is part of their mission wherever they are in the world to kill people who don’t agree with their religion. And, of course, that includes Christians as well. In Iraq, before there was ISIS, there were approximately 300,000 Christians who lived in Iraq. No one knows how many remain today, but hundreds of thousands have left the country or been killed. In Mosul, for example, 10 years ago, about 35,000 Christians lived in Mosul— 10 years ago. Now there are 20, maybe 30 Christians. They have been killed, tortured, or fled the country. ISIS’ campaign to destroy historic sites and monuments of Christians is now something that the world media is talking about. ISIS destroyed the monastery of St. Elijah outside Mosul. This monastery stood there in Mosul for 1,400 years, and here comes the terrorist group ISIS that tears it down because it is a site where Christians practiced Christianity. ISIS has been so fervent in their killing of Christians that this House even passed legislation stating that ISIS is committing genocide against Christians. And they are. So you got ISIS in different parts of the world. One of their goals is to kill religious folks who disagree with them, especially Christians. And to some extent, they have been very successful at that. When we talk about destroying and eliminating ISIS, we need to remember that we will eliminate their genocide against Christians as well, if we destroy ISIS. In Iran, Open Doors USA ranked the persecution level of Christians in Iran as extreme. Religious police move about the city kind of like the Gestapo, and when they suspect Christians are gathering for worship, they raid the homes, arrest the leaders, and destroy Bibles. That is what the religious police, the Gestapo police as I call them, in Iran do. Iranians who come to study in the United States and become a Christian, they can’t go back to Iran. They go back to Iran, Iran puts them in jail, and they suddenly disappear. Converts to Christianity face charges of apostasy and possible death sentences if they ever return. People who become Christians in Iran, who make that choice as a believer, also know that their days are numbered in Iran if the religious police catch them. In Libya, the Islamic State captured and beheaded 21 people because they were Christians. I don’t think that we should be insensitive to this act of beheading folks altogether because of their religious faith. We shouldn’t be insensitive because it continues on in Libya as well. In Libya, where they murdered the 21 people, the victims’ families wanted to build a church in their honor. Well, as they were building the church, they were beaten by people who were of the Muslim faith to make sure that that church did not exist. And that is Libya. In Syria, the head of the Franciscans in the Middle East has reported that of the 4,000 inhabitants of the village of Ghassanieh, no more than 10 people remain in that town, and they have been killed by Assad’s thugs and the militant groups like ISIS. Christians have really got it bad in Syria because everybody is after them. You got ISIS that is after them, and then you got Assad the dictator, the brutal dictator, he kills them as well. Moving on, I want to mention Russia. Russia seems to be something everybody wants to talk about. Why don’t we talk about Russia and what they are doing to Christians today. I went to the Soviet Union back in the 1980s, when it was the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union persecuted people who were religious at all. I mean, if you owned a Bible, you are going to jail. If you tried to worship, you are going to jail. They constantly did that under the Soviet regime of people of any religious faith. Primarily it was Orthodox Christians, and it was also Jews. The wall came down, and now we have Putin in charge. The world needs to understand that Putin is moving in the direction of persecuting people of religious beliefs just like when he was a member of the KGB under the Soviet Union. Putin. I call him the Napoleon of Siberia. So what are they doing? Well, they are starting out with laws requiring missionaries to have a permit, and they make house churches illegal. What is a house church? A house church is where two or three are gathered together in a house in the Lord’s name and try to worship. You can’t do that. That is against the law. If you are going to worship, you have to get a permit to worship in a structured building, and only certain religious groups get a permit to even practice any religion. That is difficult in itself. So you have to be in a structured building approved by the government, and that particular denomination or religious faith has to have a permit to do so. If you are in Russia, you cannot practice religion online. You know, that online happens all over the world except if you are in Russia, you are not going to be able to promote any type of religion or you are going to jail. This is the greatest threat to Christianity in Russia since the Soviet days. We haven’t heard much about that. We 
have heard other things, but this is something that we need to be aware of, the persecution of people because of religious faith. One of my daughters recently went to Russia, and she experienced and saw this very thing that I am talking about. No home church worship services, only structured buildings where you have the Russian police watching what takes place. So they are moving in a direction like they were under the Soviet days of persecuting people who have religious faith. Putin is taking Khrushchev’s—I am older than you are, Mr. Speaker. I remember when Khrushchev was here. He made the comment when he was the dictator of the Soviet Union that Christianity will never exist in the Soviet Union. It cannot. I don’t think it can be legislated out, but Khrushchev was determined to make sure that Christianity and other religious faiths did not exist in the Soviet Union. Of course, I believe it will continue whether or not Christians are persecuted anyway. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 12 minutes remaining. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have always thought that people from Texas should get more time because we talk slower, and might even think slower. But, anyway, I appreciate the 12 minutes, and I will use it. Mr. Speaker, I am a cosponsor, and other Members are cosponsors, of a bill that will provide expedited visa protection and processing for Christians and Yazidi refugees from the Middle East. They are targets of genocide in Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, Iran, and Libya, and we hope to expedite visas for those people who are trying to flee religious persecution. Hopefully, the President of the United States will address the issues of human rights violations in Vietnam. Members of Congress, including myself, have asked the President to address this when he deals with the country of Vietnam. And, of course, there is other legislation sponsored by Mr. TRENT FRANKS  from Arizona which calls upon the U.S. to use its influence in the United Nations to condemn the ongoing sexual violence against women and children of religious faith. These young women and girls are being sexually assaulted because of their religious faith or their religious beliefs. A lot of that is being done by ISIS. b1915 Mr. Speaker, just a couple of other things. Watchdog groups report that each month 332 Christians are killed by their faith and 214 churches and Christian properties are destroyed. Of course Christians, like other religious minorities, have been persecuted for years. A little history is in order here, Mr. Speaker. In this country, we have religious freedom. We are a nation that believes that all people should have religious freedom. When our Forefathers got together and they declared independence from Great Britain, which we will celebrate next Tuesday, and they got together and they wrote the Constitution, they added 10 Amendments to the Constitution. The First Amendment of the Constitution is not first by accident. It is first because it is the most important of all rights, and there are five rights in the First Amendment. The first right in the First Amendment is the most important right. Here is what it is, and I will read just a portion of the Constitution, Mr. Speaker: ‘‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.’’ Religious freedom is the number one right of Americans. It doesn’t just say to believe what you want to believe. It says you have the right to practice it, to get out there and practice it, even in public, number one. Number two, ‘‘Congress shall make no law . . . prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress. . . .’’ There are five rights in the First Amendment. The first one: religious freedom. Many, many people came to this new world seeking religious freedom. That is why they came here, primarily Christian religious freedom. They were being persecuted in Europe. They came to the United States and made sure that we do not persecute people of religious faith. The opposite is true. It is a right. I feel very strongly, as I think most people do, that it is the first right, and it is the most important right. And it is a human right. It is not just a right for Americans. It is a right for all people. People in Syria, Iran, North Korea, Yemen, and all those countries I mentioned, those people—who we don’t know who they are—have the right, the human right, of religious freedom. That is a basic right of all people everywhere. I hope that we as a people encourage other people and governments throughout the world: Let folks worship the way they want to worship because it is a human right, and, I believe, that we have gotten it from the Almighty. And the last thing I would comment on is we need to be careful in this country that we don’t end up persecuting by legislation or by the judiciary, infringing upon the First Amendment, the first right, of the free exercise of religion. That is a story for another day, Mr. Speaker. So, as we get close to the Fourth of July, the Declaration of Independence—our ancestors got together and said they wanted freedom, and they pledged to themselves and to others their sacred honor. Many of them lost everything, the war between us and England, the biggest and most powerful empire that had ever existed. It took over 7 years, but it was worth it. That is why the Fourth of July is important, because it is a declaration of independence. And it is also, as Thomas Jefferson said in the Declaration of Independence, a statement of human rights—life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that governments are instituted among men to secure those rights. Mr. Speaker, on the Fourth of July, we need to remember our country, remember the people who lived here and gave us this country, and it is our job to make sure we keep it. And that is just the way it is. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f 
DEVASTATING IMPACTS ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROW OPERATIONS ARE HAVING ON OUR NATION’S PUBLIC LANDS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ) for 30 minutes. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I have a presentation here, but, first, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), my friend, who has a very important topic to cover as well. I appreciate his friendship and his strong leadership on the things that really count around here. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my very good friend from California for his graciousness in yielding me this time and for his wonderful work as a Member of Congress on human rights and prolife issues. I thank him for that leadership. Mr. Speaker, tonight, I rise and note to my colleagues that the news of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo’s diagnosis of terminal liver cancer was a jarring shock to everyone who admires this champion of freedom and democracy. Tonight, the House has under consideration an urgent resolution, a truly urgent resolution, H. Con. Res. 67, which I introduced, joined by Ms. PELOSI , and several of the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, she and I together, some bipartisanship in a place where we have had little of it lately. But here we are joined, and we are joined very strongly on behalf of Liu Xiaobo and his dire, dire situation, and that of his wife. The legislation urges the Government of the People’s Republic of China to unconditionally release Liu Xiaobo, together with his wife, Liu Xia, to allow them to freely meet with friends, family, and counsel, and seek medical treatment wherever they desire. The operative language of the resolution makes it very clear that it recognizes Liu Xiaobo for his decades of 
peaceful struggle for basic human rights and democracy and, again, urges that he be able to seek medical care, including treatment in the United States or wherever else he would like to receive it. I want to thank Majority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY . This resolution was introduced yesterday. The majority leader made sure that this legislation came to the floor just a few hours ago to ensure that we went on the record as a Congress showing our solidarity of Liu Xiaobo and his wife and our deep, deep compassion and concern for the plight that he finds himself in. I want to thank Speaker RYAN, who also expressed strong concern for Liu Xiaobo, and, of course, NANCY PELOSI  and STENY HOYER because this required bipartisan support to bring it up on the UC; and also EDROYCE , the chairman of the full Committee on Foreign Affairs, the famous gentleman from California, and, of course, the ranking member, ELIOT ENGEL . Mr. Speaker, in February of 2010, I led a bipartisan group of lawmakers nominating Liu Xiaobo for the Nobel Peace Prize and, at the same time, nominating two other persecuted Chinese human rights advocates, Chen Guangcheng and Gao Zhisheng, to be joint recipients of this most prestigious award. Others, including the great Vaclav Havel, also pushed for Liu to get this important recognition which we had hoped would help push the human rights agenda in China. The Nobel Peace Prize Committee agreed and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo for his ‘‘long and nonviolent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.’’ I attended the Oslo ceremony, at the invitation of the family, along with Leader PELOSI . It was a moving ceremony, Mr. Speaker. The now famous empty chair spoke volumes about the Chinese Communist Party’s abiding fear that human rights and democracy will undermine its power. There, on the stage, was this chair without the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. After that, I held several hearings both in the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations and also on the CongressionalExecutive Commission on China, which I cochair with MARCO RUBIO. And again, we always had a picture of the empty chair where Liu Xiaobo should have been rightly honored and hopefully freed to pursue the righteousness of his human rights work. He said, in absentia, that day: ‘‘Freedom of expression is the foundation of human rights, the source of humanity, and the mother of truth. To strangle freedom of speech is to trample on human rights, stifle humanity, and suppress truth.’’ Chinese authorities have gone to great lengths to stifle Liu Xiaobo’s ability to speak truth to power. In 2009, he was given an 11year prison sentence for ‘‘inciting subversion of state power.’’ His wife, Liu Xia, also was detained in de facto form ‘‘house arrest’’ since 2010. She is in urgent need of medical care, as well, having been hospitalized for a heart condition. Over the past year, authorities have allowed her to visit her husband only on a very few occasions. According to Chinese authorities, Liu’s conviction was based on Charter 08, a treatise signed by over 300 intellectuals and activists. That document states that freedom, equality, and human rights are universal values of humankind, and that democracy and constitutional government are the fundamental framework for protecting these values. Sadly, Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, his wife, are not alone in facing unjust repression. As of September 2017, the CongressionalExecutive Commission on China, which collects and maintains probably the most effective and comprehensive political database for any country—and this is on China—contains information on at least 1,400 cases of known political or religious prisoners. According to the annual report, the government of President Xi Jinping has engaged in an extraordinary assault on the rule of law, human rights, ethnic minority groups, and civil society in recent years. Under Xi’s leadership, the Chinese Government has pushed through new laws and drafted legislation that would legitimize political, religious, and ethnic repression, further curtail civil liberties, and expand censorship of the internet. And the whole issue of the one child, now maybe two child per couple policy, coercion and population control, continues to harm women and children with extreme hurtfulness. It is just beyond the pale of what a government should be doing to its own people. It is tempting to be pessimistic about China’s future and the future of U.S. relations. Frankly, I am not pessimistic, despite the circumstances, because I do believe Liu Xiaobo is the future, and people who have his belief in fundamental human rights. Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by just saying I believe that someday China will be free; someday the people of China will be able to enjoy all of their Godgiven rights, and a nation of free Chinese men and women will honor and celebrate Liu Xiaobo as a hero. He will be honored, along with all of the others like him, who have sacrificed so much for so long for freedom. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. SMITH for standing up for that important issue and making that known. So, I thank him, and I appreciate him joining with us tonight. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to discuss the devastating impacts that illegal marijuana grow operations are having on our public lands—even private lands, as well. As pictured here, this is not an uncommon scene in my district in northern California, in many of the Western States, or anywhere where people think they can get away with it, where someone may not be paying attention. We see that very often on our Federal lands because, honestly, regretfully, they are not managed very well and they are not managed very often. We hope to see that turn around under this new administration, this new leadership, that U.S. Forest Service lands have more attention to them, that they are managed more with timber harvest, thinning, things of that nature, to make the forests healthier. This certainly does not cause a healthier situation for our forests, as you see pictured here, the amount of damage that can come from that. I will tell you a little bit about it here. The devastating effects inflicted on the habitat and wildlife due to the nonpermitted water diversions, extensive grading of the terrain—which, people in agriculture and construction have to get permits to do grading—and use of illegal toxicants and pesticides purchased outside of the United States— chemicals, products you can’t even use here, that haven’t been subjected to an EPA label process that ag chemicals and household chemicals have to do— this is what is coming in and being used on our public lands, poisoning them, poisoning the wildlife, and making it very dangerous for any people that might go in there. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, many threatened and endangered species which we are bending over backwards to try to recover, to try to protect, have tested positive for these poisons and other contaminants used at these illegal grow sites. b1930 Preliminary tests of game animals, including birds and deer, have also tested positive for these illegal pesticides, again, that are banned by the EPA, not allowed to be used in the United States, haven’t been subject to the labeling requirements that are legal materials that we use in agriculture and other things that they have gone through. So it is difficult to understand how the Federal Government can spend extensive resources going after farmers, ranchers, miners, whoever for doing legal operations. In agriculture, it might be disking or plowing. In mining, it might be panning for gold or normal mining operations. So we have people cultivating their land for food. We have people extracting minerals that are needed for our daily lives, whether it is paving a road, driveway, concrete, whatever it might be. We have people legally doing these actions. They are the ones who have been—at least until recent months with the new administration—harassed with rules that hadn’t even been subject to congressional attention. But at the same time, until recent months, this blatant criminal activity has been allowed to stand. Is it because law enforcement can’t go into those—areas they are not authorized? 
I know local law enforcement is really interested in doing this. But it has been a handsoff approach by some of our Federal officials who have either not wanted to put the resources together or haven’t had the wherewithal to put enough of the resources together to go out and enforce on these foreign nationals doing these devastating things to our lands and the danger they cause. What good are these Federal laws and statutes if we do not properly enforce the law to protect our public lands? We are protecting, on one hand, again, the wrong people by inaction; and we are criminalizing normal activity, people farming, ranching, mining, et cetera. The priorities have been backwards. I hope to see a big change in that with the new direction of the new administration. As if the environmental effects are not disturbing enough, the safety of the general public is at risk. Heavily armed drug cartels are using our National Forest to engage in largescale illegal grow operations. You can see the haul on some of the weapons that have been taken from some of the raids that have been successfully done. This is pretty dangerous stuff. Somewhere in the picture are people who have grenadelaunching devices, if I am not mistaken. So what kind of situation do we have going on where this kind of heavy armament is coming into our forests? And on the other hand, lawabiding, Second Amendmentloving Americans are subject to confiscation, threatening high cost of ammunition, multitudes of antigun rhetoric that, again, makes you ask the questions: Who are we protecting and who are we criminalizing? U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for example, has been forced to temporarily close refuge units during hunting season to protect the public from stumbling on to an illegal grow that might be guarded heavily by these criminals with these weapons. In 2012, the DEA’s Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Report indicated more than 10,000 or more illegal firearms seized nationwide in raids. This is the people’s property. The public should be able to hunt, fish, camp, recreate with their families on it as they wish, safe from this criminal activity. Unfortunately, the number of illegal grow sites on Federal lands continues to rise at an alarming rate. Even in States that have legalized marijuana for recreational use, like California— regrettably—and Colorado, they still are doing the illegal grows in lands that are in States that have so far legalized marijuana. According to the U.S. Forest Service, in 2016, the Pacific Southwest region saw a 52 percent increase in marijuana production on Forest Service lands compared to a previous year. So maybe the answer hasn’t been in legalizing marijuana grows. The activity is still going on. It is still a sought after market for those people who want to be using it. While the statistics seem staggering, it is believed that the true number of illegal grows on Federal lands is actually much higher than that 10,000 figure, much higher than what has been documented, much higher than the 52 percent increase that we are talking about. So with the heavy rainfall that the Western States saw this winter— thankfully, we have gotten the rain— the regions are expecting an even higher surge of illegal marijuana production on the people’s public lands. The law enforcement capabilities of the U.S. Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management are not currently equipped to handle an issue of this high magnitude. These law enforcement officers are doing what they can with the resources allotted and the permission they are allowed by their higherups, but we need much more additional means and support to develop a coordinated approach to enforce against these foreign nationals and others that are doing these illegal grows, despite what the public might be wanting with legalized marijuana in their own grows. While confronting the challenges of illegal marijuana cultivation in our National Forests is a large undertaking, it is important that we face this head on. Strong enforcement needs to come from the Federal Government that is supposed to be overseeing these lands. So we are talking about scenes like this right here. This is what is allowed to happen. That is why criminalizing people doing legal activities, such as farming, ranching, mining, what have you, for tiny, very narrow occasional violations, this is what is being fostered out there. Look at this. The trash that is allowed to happen; empty chemical containers; everything else involved in the grow; people camping up there illegally, because the Federal Government, until recently, does not seem to have an interest in enforcing against these illegal grows. Protecting our public lands from these destructive environmental threats, making sure our National Forests are safe for the public’s use, for the habitat, for the wildlife, these are of key importance. This is what the public demands that we do. It is our job to keep the public safe and the lands, as well, in good stewardship. Much more needs to be done. The Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, they have immediate jurisdiction over these. They need to allow and partner with local law enforcement as well, who knows the lands better than anybody in Washington, D.C., ever would. And I don’t need to remind you once again that marijuana is still classified, Federally, as an illegal drug. So these States—no matter how the voters have been duped, coerced, overwhelmed with dollars at the ballot box and on campaigns, this is still an illegal drug. It is an illegal activity that has been going on. So I hope what we are hearing from the Department of Justice—they will be looking really hard at whether this is even a legal activity in States that have been legalizing marijuana, and the harmful effects it is going to have on society as this stuff gets more powerful, more potent, and more available to kids. We have a job to do. It all starts right here: taking care of these lands, the habitat and environment for wildlife that we all care about, the habitat for people, and the water quality. What is going to come out of here as the water runs downstream through this stuff? What is that going to mean for our streams, rivers, lakes, to the water supplies that the people draw from here, that the animals draw from here? It is not good. So the Federal Government needs to take a stronger approach, whether it is DOJ, in concert with the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture, and that input from local law enforcement in local communities. This could be a very good team operation if we are allowed to do it and we aggressively go after that. I am seeing the seeds of that in the conversations that are coming out of our agencies here in Washington, D.C. Let’s push forward on that and let’s hear from the American public on making this happen as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
