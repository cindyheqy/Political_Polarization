Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, prescription opioids and heroin addiction are ravaging our Nation, causing heartache and pain for millions of American families, and destroying our communities. This is no secret. In my own home State of Illinois, opioids contribute to nearly 1,200 overdose deaths in 2016. Heroin played a role in those deaths of another 1,000 people, many of whom started with prescription drugs. According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, more people die from opioid drug overdose than from homicide and motor vehicle accidents. These aren’t just numbers or statistics. The people battling addiction are moms and dads and neighbors and students. Addiction doesn’t care about your race, your gender, your income, your political leanings. It is an issue that affects everyone because it impacts every community and every person we love. Congress took an important step last year in passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This bipartisan legislation, which was signed into law, created a coordinated and balanced strategy for communities to tackle issues regarding prescription and opioid abuse in their communities. Just last month, Congress voted to fund programs designed to prevent and treat opioid and heroin use. But the real leaders of this effort will be citizens in our local community. Many local police departments now offer drug drop boxes. Parents, especially, are on the front line of this issue and are responsible to educate our children about the dangers of prescription medication. If you see someone struggling with addiction, please encourage them to speak to their local drug and alcohol commissioners. Completely ending addiction nationwide may not be possible, but together we can save lives and begin to put hope back in our communities. DO THE RIGHT THING The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, when someone keeps something secret, it is often because it is embarrassing or negative or damaging or unsupportable. Mr. Speaker, over in the Senate, Leader MCCONNELL and some of these Republican Senators are doing just that: crafting a healthcare repeal bill in secret because they know what it contains would deeply embarrass anyone who supports it openly. They know it is going to be a hard sell to convince even their own Republican colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to get behind a bill that even President Trump called mean. That was the House American Health Care Act to which he was referring. He called it mean for the harm it does to Americans. They know it is going to be difficult in the Senate to convince Senators to support a bill that raises healthcare costs for working families and kicks millions of Americans off their coverage, including those who are covered by their employers; a bill that makes millions of individuals with preexisting conditions uninsurable and reinstitutes annual and lifetime limits; a bill that imposes an age tax on those between ages 50 and 64, increasing premium costs by as much as 800 percent; a bill that forces States to cut benefits and kick millions of people off Medicaid, whether it is next year, in 3 years, or in 7 years, those times that are to try to get by elections so that perhaps people will not be held accountable for voting for such draconian legislation. Mr. Speaker, such a bill ought to be very embarrassing indeed, which is why Senator MCCONNELL , I believe, and his allies don’t want anyone to see it until they are asked to vote on it. We have a similar problem, of course, in the House. Whatever happened to transparency, to openness, to reading the bills, to posting it for all to see in advance? Where are all those people who wanted everybody to read the bills and see the bills? Where are they today in demanding that bills be fully and thoroughly vetted, read, heard, and voted on? It is no wonder even Republican Senators who haven’t seen the bill are getting angry with their leader and those drafting it in secrecy. Republican Senator RONJOHNSON  said last week, Mr. Speaker: ‘‘I want to know exactly what is going to be in the Senate bill. I don’t know it yet.’’ And then he concluded: ‘‘It is not a good process.’’ And Senator MARCO RUBIO said: ‘‘The Senate is not a place where you can just cook up something behind closed doors and rush it for a vote.’’ But, Mr. Speaker, what we hear is exactly what is happening, cooking it up in secret and rushing it for a vote. Now, Mr. Speaker, they are not the only ones who want to know what is in this bill. Millions of Americans are deeply worried about its contents. Last week, I sat down with two courageous Americans who shared their personal healthcare stories with me. I want to thank them for doing so, and I want to share their stories today. Their names are Ola Ojewumi and Megan Foley. Ola lives with a preexisting condition. As a young child, she received a heart and kidney transplant. She is also a cancer survivor. She is a young woman. She told me about how the Affordable Care Act saved her life. She was able to access affordable coverage because of the ban on denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions. Ola also told me how frightened she is that these protections could be taken away for her under the Senate’s secret TrumpCare bill. If it is enacted, Ola and others with preexisting conditions may not be able to access the coverage needed to keep them alive and healthy, or they may simply not be able to afford it. When I spoke with Megan Foley, she shared her courageous story of struggling with mental illness and addiction. She told me how she overcame her addiction. Despite her recovery, before the Affordable Care Act came into effect, she was denied coverage again and again because her addiction was considered a preexisting condition. Those were difficult months, cutting back on expenses and accruing debt just to pay for her medication until the Affordable Care Act kicked in and allowed for Megan to obtain coverage. b1015 But she made it, and now, the law protects Megan and millions and millions of others like her struggling with addiction who were given a second chance. At a time when this country is plagued, Mr. Speaker, with an unprecedented opioid addiction crisis, the Republican repeal bill is an insult to courageous Americans for whom recovery is a lifelong process and access to care is essential. They, and so many Americans, are now living with uncertainty and fear for their future. Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my interviews with Ola and Megan on social media, and I encourage all Members of this House to sit down with their constituents and listen to their stories and hear about their concerns. Americans deserve to know what is in the Senate’s secret TrumpCare bill and how it would impact them and their loved ones. Americans deserve to know. Senators who represent those Americans need to know, and they have not seen it yet, yet there is some discussion that they may have to consider the bill as early as next week. Senators and Members of this House deserve to know. End the secrecy. Pull back the curtain. Let us see what is in that bill that these Senators think is so embarrassing that it must be hidden from us all. 
I will remind Republicans, both in the House and in the Senate, and the Republican President in the White House, that their party’s control of our government is complete, and they will be held responsible for whatever happens to our healthcare system on their watch. CBO tells us that 23 to 24 million people, as a result of the House bill, would lose their insurance; the preexisting conditions would be put at risk; and over $800 billion would be cut from Medicare and Medicaid. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of us to listen to Americans, to hear how beneficial the Affordable Care Act has been. I hope they will listen to Ola. I hope they will listen to Megan and all those who are concerned for the future and not huddle in a secret backroom making decisions that will negatively impact millions and millions and millions of our fellow citizens. Do the right thing. Do it for Ola. Do it for Megan. Do it for all of our citizens. 
UNAUTHORIZED SPYING ON AMERICANS AND 702 REAUTHORIZATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, once again, Americans’ privacy is under attack, this time by the spying eyes of our own U.S. Government. And people across the U.S. are wondering what is this section 702 issue. Well, Mr. Speaker, section 702 is a provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. We call it FISA. It permits government to monitor the communications of suspected foreign agents, including terrorists, and to find out, in that communication, if that foreign agent wants to hurt us. However, sometimes these individuals under surveillance communicate with American citizens, and this surveillance allows the conversations of ordinary citizens to be recorded, and that includes text messages, emails, and the conversation itself. But what many Americans don’t realize is these secret communications are not destroyed by the intelligence agencies. They are kept and kept forever. In fact, the government stores this data, and often goes back into that data and searches it, without a warrant, in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, for information on American citizens. What we do with the foreign agents, hey, it is okay. But government then takes that information they have seized on Americans and then goes back and looks through it without a real warrant. That includes the IRS, the FBI. And they get the NSA to give those conversations on Americans, unrelated to the conversation with the terrorist, and they use that information to maybe prosecute them for some unrelated offense years later. Usually, this subsequent search is for reasons wholly unrelated to the original collection. Essentially, the government uses this procedure to spy on Americans who may have done no wrong, and the search is not based on probable cause, not based on a real warrant from a real judge. The National Security Agency is designed to keep a close watch on terrorists and foreign agents, not Americans. NSA surveillance is supposed to keep us safe from those foreign agents who wish to do us harm. But before the Federal Government decides to invade the privacy of Americans, they should obtain a real warrant. Under current law, FISA courts, those are secret courts that operate in secret and issue secret warrants—I have got a whole issue problem with secret courts in this country anyway, based upon the history of the Star Chamber in England. However, those secret courts allow government to search and collect that data, and the FISA courts almost always grant the requested warrant on the foreign agent. Our Founders feared that a government powerful enough to commit unreasonable searches and seizures on Americans should be closely watched. That is why they crafted the Fourth Amendment, to protect our right to privacy. As a former judge, I heard issues on the Fourth Amendment every day. And let me read it again, especially for those folks in NSA. ‘‘The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, effects’’—that would be conversations— ‘‘against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.’’ That applies to the NSA. If they can get a warrant from a real judge based on probable cause to search that data on Americans, go for it. But they can’t. They just seize the information and peruse it later and get information on Americans and then prosecute them. This kind of reverse targeting on Americans is not what Congress intended under 702 of the FISA authorization bill. Technology may change, but our Constitution never changes, and spying on Americans just has to stop. Americans should not be forced to sacrifice liberty and constitutional rights for security, especially for overreaching Federal bureaucrats. Regardless of the result surrounding the alleged incidental capture of campaign officials’ conversations, the American public must realize the implications of this little provision called 702. Reverse targeting of Americans without a search warrant based on the Fourth Amendment has got to stop. Can’t do it. But right now Congress has the ability to reform overreaching law as part of the larger FISA reauthorization process that will take place this year. Opponents of 702, the concept that you can’t spy on Americans, are wishing for what they call a pure reauthorization of FISA, without any new safeguards. They argue that these mass invasions of privacy will make us safer. Those who preach we must sacrifice the Constitution on the altar of false security are wrong. We must never abdicate our rights because the national spy agency, NSA, demands it. In fact, even a FISA court judge found that NSA analysts had been collecting searches that violate the procedures under FISA ‘‘with much greater frequency than had previously been disclosed to the court’’. The FISA court called this a very serious Fourth Amendment issue. Well, no kidding. It is a violation of current law, but the NSA violates current law and spies on Americans. After these findings were released and NSA was caught, the NSA pledged to stop the warrantless surveillance of Americans. But, Mr. Speaker, their promise is useless. FISA and 702 must be fixed by inserting the specific language that prohibits reverse targeting on Americans without a valid search warrant. If government wants information on Americans, get a warrant. Without clear and specific language, our intelligence agencies will continue these unconstitutional searches, even if they promise to end their procedure. But we can’t trust the NSA not to spy on Americans, so Congress needs to have an open debate on the spying of Americans and not reauthorize the FISA procedure unless we make sure that the American right of privacy is protected. Congressional action must be taken on this issue. It is time to end spying on Americans. If you want to spy on an American, get a real warrant from the Fourth Amendment. Continue that surveillance of foreign nationals. That is a different issue. But you can’t do both. You must protect the American right of privacy. Congress has that obligation because that is our job to enforce the Fourth Amendment right of privacy. And that is just the way it is. 
CONTINUE PRAYING FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE SHOOTING IN ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, before I start, I just want to ask America to continue praying for our good friend, STEVE SCALISE , who was injured last week in the horrific targeting of Republican members of the congressional baseball team over in Alexandria. I had been there moments before the shooting started. I want to ask America to continue praying for those in law enforcement 
that, every day, run toward the danger when we are fleeing the danger, to protect us, our families, and our property; two brave Capitol Hill police officers who helped stop an active assassin last week, Crystal Griner and David Bailey, wounded in the act of fulfilling their role; two congressional staffers, Matt Mika and Zack Barth, injured on that baseball field, just participating in America’s pastime, the game of baseball, a charity game to raise money for inner city children. It is tough. It is tough on Members of Congress. It is tough on our families and our staffs who are all questioning their security. I just ask America to take a deep breath before you utter a word or write a Facebook post or send an email, make a phone call. Remember, Scripture says to take the log out of your own eye before you try to take the fleck out of someone else’s, words that we should remember. 
Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the reason I came down to the well today is today is June 21. It is the summer solstice, the first day of summer. It is the longest day of the year, from sunup to sundown. And the Alzheimer’s Association has picked today, the longest day of the year, to recognize and raise awareness toward and for Alzheimer’s and Brain Awareness Month, the month of June. I am wearing a purple tie today, and many are wearing purple in support of those impacted by Alzheimer’s disease; more than five million people currently living with Alzheimer’s disease in America, and it is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S. These numbers are remarkable. We passed recently, in the last Congress, the 21st Century Cures Act. It is now a law, and I pray that it will serve as a jump start on moving medical research and development closer to finding a cure for such a mysterious disease. You know, this is a deeply personal issue with me. April of 2015, I lost my father to Alzheimer’s. And as my family was going through struggling with my father’s Alzheimer’s and dementia, we found out that, in many cases, it is the caregivers who pass before the Alzheimer’s patient because of the toll that Alzheimer’s takes on the caregiver, hence, the name ‘‘the longest day.’’ For many of those caregivers, dealing with an Alzheimer’s loved one is a long day, a lot of repetition, a lot of forgetfulness. We see our Alzheimer’s loved ones doing things, saying things that they never would have done or said in their right mind. Alzheimer’s is something that needs to be on our minds today, the longest day. The Alzheimer’s Association needs to be supported. Alzheimer’s research needs to be supported by Congress, by government at all levels so we can find a cure for this and end Alzheimer’s. Today, the longest day, I ask America to join me in thinking about those Alzheimer’s patients, those families and caregivers, the Alzheimer’s Association, and let’s end Alzheimer’s. We can do that. We can do that, America. The longest day. f 
b1030 EXPAND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING EMOTIONAL TRAUMA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MURPHY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last week’s shooting in Alexandria left our friend and colleague Mr. STEVE SCALISE badly wounded. Two brave U.S. Capitol Police officers and a young congressional staffer were also injured. We continue to pray for their quick and their full recovery. I know that other Members, other staff members, their friends, their families have been affected by this, too. Too often, after a shooting or some other traumatic event, we focus on those injuries that are physical, the ones we can see, while forgetting about those injuries we can’t see. I continue to practice psychology in the Navy at Walter Reed Hospital in Bethesda, where I work with veterans who suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, and traumatic brain injury. These veterans come back from witnessing traumatic events while in combat, and some have come close to committing suicide. These brave men and women fight every day against the horrific images that replay in their minds. The wound is invisible; the damage is often long term. They can and do recover with help. Since last week, I have thought about other groups who witness trauma in their homes and in their neighborhoods. These are the forgotten ones: young kids in Chicago who have become desensitized to the sound of a gunshot or the sounds of police sirens throughout the night, victims of sexual assault on college campuses and elsewhere, children who witness domestic abuse, and youth in foster care. Most youth in foster care have traumatic family histories and life experiences, including their removal from the birth family, resulting in an increased risk for mental health disorders. A recent study published in Pediatrics found that children placed in foster care were three to five times more likely to suffer from mental health problems such as depression and attention deficit disorder than children who were never in foster care. Another study revealed that PTSD was diagnosed 60 percent of the time in sexually abused children and 42 percent of the time in physically abused children. A staggering 18 percent of foster children have never been the primary victim of abuse, yet they still suffer from PTSD probably because they witnessed domestic or community violence. The American Academy of Pediatrics Healthy Foster Care America initiative identifies mental and behavioral health as the ‘‘greatest unmet health need for children and teens in foster care.’’ And since most of these kids are not receiving mental health treatment, their problems carry on into adulthood. Adults who formerly were placed in foster care, known as foster care alumni, have disproportionately high rates of emotional and behavioral disorders; 21.5 percent of foster care alumni suffer from PTSD compared to just 4.5 percent of the general population. Each year more than 20,000 young people age out of foster care without being ready to live independently. Discharged from care without social support or assistance, these youth are at higher risk for drug use and mental illness, depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress, and others. Too often they experience higher rates of unemployment, homelessness, and dependence on public assistance programs. A lack of a comprehensive mental health screening of all children entering outofhome care and the need for more thorough identification of youth with emotional and behavioral disorders contribute to these dismal statistics. As well, insufficient youth access to highquality mental health services highlights our Nation’s shortage of providers, in that half the counties in America have no psychologists, no psychiatrists, no clinical social workers, or workers who are licensed as substance abuse providers. Given the evidence from studies indicating that children in care have significant developmental, behavioral, and emotional problems, quality services for these children are an essential societal investment. Mr. Speaker, I am proud that the House yesterday took up legislation to address this important issue. H.R. 2847, the Improving Services for Older Youth in Foster Care Act, expands and improves the John H. Chafee Independence Program, which helps current and former foster care youth achieve self sufficiency. Specifically, the bill will widen the age range of foster youth who can receive assistance under the program. I am proud to support this bill and will continue to shed light on those who suffer from trauma, who, as a consequence, suffer from either PTSD, depression, or other emotional sequelae. These bills we voted on will continue to give our foster children both help and hope. 
PROMOTING TECHNICAL EDUCATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, while meeting with Kansas farmers during wheat harvest, I visited with a family where one spouse farmed full time and the other worked from 
home, an increasingly common arrangement, especially in the tough farm economy we have today. But at the moment, a reliable broadband connection is out of their reach. To keep and grow these jobs in our rural areas, we must make smart infrastructure investments that connect our rural residents: investments that don’t duplicate what private enterprise has done, and investments that will carry far into the future. For most businesses, including agribusiness, broadband services allow companies to access the global electronic marketplace. For consumers, broadband allows people to connect via social media, to download apps and stream videos, and to manage everything from a bank account to a college application. Beyond just access to resources, building out broadband in rural areas increases the quality of life for most citizens and promotes job creation and economic development. As you think about infrastructure and technology, Mr. Speaker, and as the Small Business Subcommittee on Agriculture, Energy and Trade hears testimony on the topic this week, I encourage my colleagues to keep in mind the value of our small rural telecom providers that connect rural Americans with the rest of the world and make every effort to connect rural consumers and businesses with a wide array of services. Mr. Speaker, the House will take up the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. Education supported by career and technical education programs are vital to addressing gaps in workers’ skills and employee needs. Employers across the Nation and in my district in Kansas continue to stress the need for well trained workers, often citing the lack of workers as a key constraint for their own growth. Luckily, there are great educational programs in my district. I am so proud that many community colleges and technical colleges offer 2year degrees in technical education that lead to highpaying, steady jobs across Kansas. About 30 FFA students recently visited me on Capitol Hill. They talked about their desire to enter a wide array of careers and trades. Their pride in the work they are pursuing is contagious. H.R. 2353 seeks to align CTE programs and indemand industries, while allowing local programs more flexibility to address the needs of local labor markets. The bill further highlights the importance of employability skills to student access. Career and technical education is foundationally important to economic growth and innovation. These are the jobs that sustain our economy. We must always keep this curriculum at the top of our minds as we look to preparing our students for success and our economy for stability. I look forward to voting in favor of H.R. 2353 and ask my colleagues to do the same. CONGRATULATIONS TO PENNSBURY HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL TEAM ON WINNING STATE TITLE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Pennsbury High School baseball team on winning their first State title on June 16, 2017. After withstanding a rain delay of nearly 3
R.J. Huth, Jake Martell, Christian Buchler, Gary Minnes, Vaughn Ward, Alan Wolf, Josh Tesarck, Max Crawn, Bryan Nagy, Justin Ward, Ryan McCarty, Josh Arruda, Alec Wilson, Nick Price, Tommy Erickson, Shane Ostrowsky, Nate Derry, Ben Spadea, Justin Massielo, Kyle Dear, Dave Murphy, Billy Bethel, Tyrone Hodges Jr, Alex Ritter. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, these young men have shown us what success can look like on the baseball field, and I am confident that they will succeed in all of their future endeavors, continuing to make all of us in Bucks County proud. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF WILLIAM CHAD MULDER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to a friend and an American hero. Chief Special Warfare Operator William Chad Mulder was a Navy SEAL and a highly decorated combat veteran receiving, among other honors, three Bronze Stars with Valor. He was a brother; he was a husband; he was a father; and he was a friend. William Chad Mulder, or ‘‘Bill,’’ as his friends knew him, concluded his mission here on this Earth June 9, 2017. If anybody was ever born for battle, it was Bill Mulder. He seemed to come hardwired with a soldier’s spirit. All who knew him felt safer on account of his service to our country. Bill was the ultimate warrior. Those of us who grew up with Bill in my hometown of Plainview, Texas, also knew him as the epitome of a Plainview Bulldog. He was tenderhearted, but he was tough. He was as caring as he was courageous, and he was as fun loving as he was fearless. To his wife, Sydney: Thank you for loving Bill so well. To his children: His tender heart and his warrior spirit will live on through each of you. We are praying for all of you, and on behalf of Plainview High School, the class of 1989, and all of us who were fortunate enough to call Bill our friend, we are proud of you, Bill. You served with distinction and honor. Thank you for dedicating your life to keeping us safe. We will miss you, buddy. f 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. SHIMKUS ) at noon. 
PRAYER Rabbi Hershel Lutch, MEOR Foundation, Baltimore, Maryland, offered the following prayer: Almighty God, we pray this day for wisdom, humility, courage, and Your beneficence. We pray that You endow the distinguished Members of this House with the wisdom to develop legislation that advances the noble aims of our Nation and the honorable needs of her citizens. Lord, we pray that You grant us humility to know that we are Your subjects and it is Your children for whom we toil. We pray for steadfast courage to champion justice with fortitude and to battle tyranny with vigor. O Lord, we pray this day that Your blessings of safety, success, and serenity rest on each Member, staff, and security officer of this House, and we pray that we might make continued room for Your presence in our hearts and in the soul of our great Nation. Gracious God, we thank You today and every day for the profound gift that these United States represent in our lives. Both for those here at home and for people around the world, America stands as a beacon of hope and leadership in times of challenge and conflict. 
May God bless this House of Representatives and may God bless the United States of America. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENE GREEN ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING RABBI HERSHEL LUTCH The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my friend, Rabbi Hershel Lutch, and to thank him for reading the opening prayer here on the House floor today. Rabbi Lutch has devoted his life to working for the Jewish community in the United States and around the globe. I met Rabbi Lutch on a trip to Israel that he and his organization, Aish HaTorah, helped to coordinate. That special trip showed me firsthand how our ally in Israel fights to survive and thrive every day. In addition to his work for Aish HaTorah, Rabbi Lutch is the CEO of the MEOR Foundation, an organization that strives to inspire Jewish students on college campuses to learn more about their history and heritage. In his personal life, Rabbi Lutch is a husband and a father and a son. He is an asset to his community and our country, and I am pleased we could hear from him on the floor today. Thank you, Rabbi, for blessing us here today and for your continued dedication to the Jewish people and to people of all faiths. It is an honor to know you. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Elsie Johnson, who passed away last week at her Raleigh home. Elsie was born in Puerto Rico to Gilbert and Maria Figueroa, and it was there during World War II that she met her husband, Carl Johnson, a North Carolinian and a U.S. Navy sailor stationed at Roosevelt Roads Naval Base. Elsie and Carl lived the American Dream. Together, they started a small business, a motor shop, which grew into a franchise automobile dealership in New Bern, North Carolina, and, under the leadership of their son, David, now spans dealerships from Maryland to Florida. David learned from his parents the value of hard work and excellent customer service. Elsie was a woman of incredible faith in God. She was strong, wise, and honest. Mr. Speaker, she made a difference and she leaves a legacy. May God bless her family. f 
NATIONAL ASKING SAVES KIDS DAY (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, today, June 21, is National Asking Saves Kids Day, or ASK Day. Every 6 days in our country, a child under the age of 15 dies from an accidental gunshot. Each year, more than 600 children sustain nonfatal injuries from an unintentional gunshot, and 80 percent of all unintentional firearm deaths of children under the age of 15 occur in a home. This is a national crisis, and we need to stop it. Since 2000, the ASK Campaign has encouraged parents to ask before their child visits another home whether there is an unlocked gun in the House. Today is the first day of summer, the season when kids spend more time at a friend’s house, so later today I will be introducing a resolution to officially designate June 21 as National ASK Day, to promote children’s health and gun safety. This is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is an issue important to every family all across our country. Let’s get the job done and do something that will save the lives of children all across our country. Just ask. 
NATIONAL POLLINATOR WEEK (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week is National Pollinator Week, and it is a time when we encourage the protection of pollinator species, such as honeybees, native bees, birds, bats, and butterflies as essential partners of farmers and ranchers in producing food. These pollinators are vital to keeping items like fruits, nuts, and vegetables in our diets. As vice chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, I know that healthy pollinator populations are critical to the continued economic wellbeing of rural America and our U.S. economy as a whole. It is important to recognize how critical it is to protect the health of pollinators and celebrate the significance that they play in our everyday lives. The number of honeybee hives has declined from 6 million in the 1940s to about 2.5 million today. We need to increase those habitats. American farmers have no better friends than the honeybee. More than onethird of U.S. crops require pollination. As someone who has a beehive in his backyard, I fully support efforts to raise awareness and keep our pollinators buzzing for generations to come. f 
SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE CRAFTING THEIR HEALTHCARE BILL IN SECRET (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Senate Republicans are continuing to craft their healthcare bill, TrumpCare, in complete secrecy, behind closed doors, no hearings, no bill text, no transparency whatsoever, and they expect to bring this bill to the floor next week. The bill is secret, but it is pretty clear why they are keeping this legislation secret: because it is a lousy piece of legislation and the American people reject it because it takes away healthcare from 23 million Americans. For those who are fortunate enough to have healthcare, they will pay more for worse care. You will pay an age tax if you are an older American just to have access to healthcare. Even President Donald Trump says this healthcare bill is mean. And let’s just face the obvious. If Donald Trump says something is mean, you have got a real problem. This legislation should go through the process of open debate and dialogue, not be crafted in secret because it is such a bad piece of legislation that the people offering it are embarrassed for the folks in America to know what it says. We have to shut this down. 
HONORING SAILORS LOST AT SEA (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the USS Fitzgerald collided with a cargo vessel in the Sea of Japan on Saturday, resulting in the loss of life of seven patriotic sailors. Each of the deceased sailors was dedicated in the service to their Nation and exemplified the U.S. Navy’s motto, ‘‘Not for self but for country.’’ 
As the grateful father of an orthopedic surgeon currently serving in the United States Navy, the sailors and their families are in my thoughts and prayers.

DO NOT REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in the last month, Republican Senators have worked in secrecy on a bill that will repeal the Affordable Care Act. Now they are preparing to vote on that bill next week without any public hearings, no debates, no open forums. Instead, the Senate Republican majority have failed to be transparent with their constituents and the American people. No one knows what is in the bill. Based on the last CBO score, we know that TrumpCare will lead to 23 million more Americans uninsured and gut protections for Americans with preexisting conditions and force hardworking Americans to pay higher costs for less care. Mr. Speaker, in the words of President Trump, this bill is a mean bill. Even our former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, has said to slow down. Why must this bill be so secretive? Because our colleagues across the aisle know that the more light that is shed on their true intentions, the more people will realize this is not a healthcare bill at all, but a massive tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, and it will be paid for by our elderly and our poorest constituents. Mr. Speaker, that bill is a bad bill. 
REMOTE AREA MEDICAL (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, this morning I met, once again, with representatives from Remote Area Medical, its founder and president, Stan Brock, and its leaders, Jeff Eastman and Anabel Evora. Remote Area Medical, also known as RAM, is an organization that helps medical professionals volunteer their services to our Nation’s neediest. Over its 32 years, RAM has provided free healthcare to almost 1 million people over the course of 862 weekend events so far. Their largest clinic was in Los Angeles, where over 7,000 people showed up to receive free dental care, eyeglasses, women’s health services, and other free medical services. Unfortunately, only 12 States currently allow RAM to host these free clinics with volunteer medical professionals from all over the country. That is why I introduced H.R. 860, the HEALTHIER Act, so that people nationwide can have access to free healthcare clinics like RAM’s. RAM is willing to provide these free healthcare services to several million more people across the Nation if only we will allow them to do so. Mr. Speaker, I commend Stan, Anabel, Jeff, and all the others who work with RAM for their great work, and I urge my colleagues to help to support my bill, the HEALTHIER Act, to help many more people receive free medical care. f 
HOW TRUMPCARE WILL AFFECT AMERICANS (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I worked in healthcare for a decade. I have seen up close how healthcare impacts families. That is why I began a short video series that we call ‘‘Hear from the Heartland’’. In this, I listen to families about how TrumpCare would affect them. I have spoken most recently with a woman named Anastasia. She has a little boy named Gryphon. They are from a town called Elizabeth, Illinois, just a small town. Gryphon was born with cerebral palsy, and because of TrumpCare, Gryphon’s family might not have anywhere to turn for affordable coverage and would be at risk of reaching their lifetime limits on their insurance. Anastasia said it best when she said that her son’s preexisting condition was simply being born. Whether it is at a grocery store or small business, I hear it: people talking about their grave concerns about TrumpCare and what it would do to them. I want us to work together on healthcare and make sure that we focus on lowering the costs for American families, but, instead, take a look at this. TrumpCare would raise costs, it would rip health insurance away from 23 million Americans, and it is so bad that, in the Senate, they are hiding their bill away. That is not what we were elected to do. I want to work with my colleagues to improve the healthcare that we deliver to American families. 
b1215 HONORING THE LIFE OF RICHARD UNDERWOOD (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Richard Underwood, a veteran, a member of our Nation’s Greatest Generation, an educator, and this is his 90th birthday. Richard was born in Korea to his Presbyterian missionary parents and was a natural native speaker of the Korean language. After the attacks on Pearl Harbor, he was repatriated from Japaneseheld Korea and attended high school in Brooklyn, New York, before enlisting in the U.S. Army and joining the Office of Strategic Services. In World War II, he served behind Soviet Russian lines in Korea and the liberation and division of Korea. After his service in World War II, he returned to the United States, only to reenlist in the Army following North Korea’s invasion of South Korea. As an interpreter in the Korean war, Richard and as his brother helped interpret peace talks at the end of the war. After this military career, Richard returned to Korea in 1957 to head the America Korea Foundation; and in 1962, he joined the Korean mission of the Presbyterian Church and was assigned to the Seoul Foreign School as its principal and, later, headmaster. Richard currently lives in Urbana, Illinois, with his wife of 65 years, Carol. Richard, happy birthday, and thank you for your years of selfless service and sacrifice to this Nation. f 
SENATE VOTE ON HEALTHCARE (Mr. EVANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, Republicans say they want a healthcare system that cuts costs and covers more Americans, yet this bill does no such thing. Right now, Senate Republicans are having a backdoor meeting about this bill. I may be new to Congress, but I have been around politics long enough to know that you don’t hide something that you are proud of. Right now, they are keeping a bill that would impact the lives of millions a secret. They refuse to let those same millions of people weigh in on the process. What do we have to lose? In this equation, we have a lot to lose: 23 million Americans stand to lose their healthcare. I will say that again: 23 million stand to lose their healthcare. They are veterans, seniors, students, children, young and old. We all have a lot to lose. I have said it before; I will say it again. There is a big difference between campaigning and governing. It is time to govern. Philadelphians deserve a healthcare bill that guarantees quality, affordable care. Now is the time to resist. Together we will speak up and speak out to make our voices heard loud and clear. Philadelphians have not forgotten healthcare. We know we have a lot to lose. 
The President talks about putting the country first, but this healthcare bill does no such thing. American people deserve better. Together we will fight back and build stronger neighbors block by block. 
ALZHEIMER’S & BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the month of June as Alzheimer’s & Brain Awareness Month and to highlight the need for continued investment, innovation, research, and lifesaving cures for diseases like Alzheimer’s that affect every family and every neighborhood in America. Right now, more than 5 million Americans are living with this terrible disease, with someone new developing symptoms every 66 seconds. Studies have shown that number could rise as high as 16 million people by 2020. This year, the cost of treating Alzheimer’s and other dementias will cost Americans nearly $260 billion. By 2050, estimates are that those costs will rise to more than $1.1 trillion. To put that in perspective, as a nation, we are only spending slightly more than $30 billion, total, in researching cures for not only Alzheimer’s, but cancer, heart disease, Parkinson’s, diabetes—literally, all other diseases combined. So this month serves not only to raise awareness about Alzheimer’s, but also for us to renew our commitment to research. Mr. Speaker, we must find a cure for the millions of Americans struggling with Alzheimer’s, and it is up to us to provide the resources to do it. 
STATEHOOD FOR PUERTO RICO (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 10 days ago, Puerto Rico held a vote on its future political status. Although the ballot was not preapproved by the U.S. Department of Justice as envisioned by a 2014 Federal law, the ballot was fair. It included Puerto Rico’s three valid options: statehood, nationhood, and the current territory status. Each option was accurately described. In our democracy, only those who cast ballots are counted, and those who voted in Puerto Rico overwhelmingly chose statehood. It is now up to Puerto Rico’s elected officials, especially its Governor and Delegate in Congress, to determine how best to move forward. They can count on my full support. As I see it, in the wake of this vote, the question is not whether but, rather, when Puerto Rico will become a State. After 119 years, it is well past time for the U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico to have the same rights and responsibilities as their fellow citizens living in Florida and in other States. Puerto Rico has made countless contributions to this Nation for generations. It has earned its own star on the American flag. f 
CONGRATULATING CARLY CLAUCHERTY (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Carly Claucherty for being named a Presidential Scholar in Career and Technical Education. Carly recently graduated from Springport High School and was nominated for her outstanding work in their CTE agriscience program. She is one of just 20 students from around the country to receive this distinguished award. In high school, Carly was active in Springport’s Future Farmers of America chapter, served as president of the National Honor Society, and was involved in student council. This fall, Carly will be attending Michigan State University, where she tentatively plans to study crop and soil sciences. Carly’s selection as a CTE Presidential Scholar puts her in an elite group, but I suspect it is just a starting point for many more exceptional things to come. Mr. Speaker, career and technical education provides valuable handson experience, and this week we will be voting for strengthening these important programs to help more students find their sweet spot, just like Carly did. 
HONORING NAVY SEAMAN BOBBY TEMPLE (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor U.S. Navy Seaman Bobby Temple, a 19yearold who died during the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. He was one of 400 sailors who lost their lives aboard the USS Oklahoma and whose remains were buried in a mass grave. In 2015, the Navy started a project to identify each of the remains and bring closure to the families after 75 years. Bobby’s bravery was honored during a memorial service in O’Fallon, Illinois, last week before his remains were laid to rest in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii. As a veteran myself, it is with heavy heart that I honor Bobby’s heroic service and pray God’s blessing for his peaceful rest. 
REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL IS A DISASTER (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, we hear the Senate is finally releasing a bill, a bill that would, sadly, take away healthcare from millions of Americans. Apparently, this bill will go straight to the Senate floor without a hearing, without a markup, without the opportunity for any public input. This Republican healthcare bill is a disaster. It removes guarantees of coverage that the Affordable Care Act created, allowing States to determine health insurance options and discriminate against people with preexisting conditions. Under the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, Colorado, alone, will lose billions of dollars of funding. Coloradans will no longer be covered by Medicaid, leaving many more people uninsured and a further burden on the rest of us, driving up our rates because we have to cover the uninsured. Even Colorado schools would be affected because many schools serve as Medicaid providers to students with disabilities, and they would lose that funding. While the Affordable Care Act isn’t perfect, I strongly oppose this Republican plan to take away insurance coverage and raise rates for Coloradans. Not only is the bill disastrous, the secretive process undermines the institution of Congress and the American people that have elected every Member of this body. Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to oppose the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. f 
SUPPORT DEFERMENT FOR ACTIVE CANCER TREATMENT ACT (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, Representative EDPERLMUTTER and I will be introducing the Deferment for Active Cancer Treatment Act. In 2017, more than 1.6 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer, and many of them are currently repaying their student loans. For these individuals, a cancer diagnosis goes beyond the exhaustive treatment and increased medical expenditures and often leads to unemployment or underemployment. As a response to this growing problem, I have introduced the Deferment for Active Cancer Treatment Act. This commonsense bill will enable cancer patients to defer payments on their public student loans while actively receiving treatment without interest accruing during this difficult period, helping them, thusly, to avoid defaults. This measure will also help lenders by empowering borrowers to continue repaying their public loans after their treatment ends, leading to fewer defaults. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join Mr. PERLMUTTER and me in standing with cancer patients 
throughout our Nation and supporting the Deferment for Active Cancer Treatment Act. 
DON’T DISMANTLE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the ACA and all it has done to protect the health of our country’s young people. As we gather today, everyone seems to be analyzing yesterday’s elections results. Other folks have taken a deep dive to analyze whether or not Russia elected our President. And as all of this is happening, the Senate has been meeting in secrecy to dismantle the Affordable Care Act that, for millions of young people and millions of young Americans, has been a lifesaver. Since its enactment, the ACA has cut uninsured rates for Americans age 18 to 34 by more than 40 percent. Guided by political expediency instead of principle, my Republican colleagues are jamming this bill through an approval process without hearings or input from healthcare professionals and with no regard to millions of Americans whose lives will be affected by it. This is a shocking breach of our constituents’ trust. The ACA lifted a heavy burden off the shoulders of millions of Americans, and now is not the time to kick these individuals to the curb. We are better than that, America. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington? There was no objection. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, before I begin the rule on the two measures that are before us today, let me just make a couple of comments that have come to mind in light of the events over the last week. Mr. Speaker, you may know that this is the first formal debate that we have had as a legislative body since last Wednesday morning’s shooting. I think 
it is appropriate that we take a minute to reflect and remember those who were injured and are still struggling to recover from their injuries as well as those who did not receive physical injuries on last Wednesday morning but who are still recovering. Let me also say, if I could be so presumptuous, Mr. Speaker, I believe that perhaps some people in the United States look to us here in Congress— their Representatives—and look and see how we act towards one another and how we conduct ourselves in our interaction with each other. Let me just say that if we are disrespectful to each other, others may see that and think that it is okay; that if Congress can be that way to themselves, maybe we can act that way, too. They may not even realize that. It may be just a subconscious thing. I ask how can we expect others to have a high opinion of us if we don’t even show each other the respect that we should and that we deserve? I believe that we must all remember that we are—before we are Republicans, before we are Democrats or Independents—all Americans. We are all here trying to do what is right, what is right for our country, certainly what is right for our constituents, and we shouldn’t say that someone is not here for those purposes. I don’t know your district, Mr. Speaker, and I might say that you don’t know mine. So let’s argue, which is what we are here for. As ugly as sometimes it can be, that is our job, to debate on the merits of ideas. But it is not our job to win a debate by degrading the ones who are making the arguments against. I think we all have this obligation to win debates or to argue debates on the merits of the issue. Last Wednesday reminded me that it is up to us, if we want changes, to make them and to begin them here in this body. I was heartened in our meeting as a Congress in the auditorium over at the Capitol Visitor Center that there were several Members asking for a change in tone—a change in tone in how we interact with each other. It is important that we act civilly, that we be polite, and that we be respectful—kind of like how we treat each other on the journey over here from our offices in the elevators and in the hallways. I would assert that this is also something that is the responsibility of our President, our country’s leader, someone who can set the tone for our country, someone who can describe our hopes and our dreams and help us aspire to reach those things. It is also the responsibility of our media and for those advocacy groups that we all have and that we all work with. It is up to our parties. I think it is up to every single American. We need to rediscover the faith that we should have in each other, our respect for each other and those bonds that make us one nation under God. Now, it is simple to state, but how do we accomplish this? It can start right here on this floor. Say something positive. We all call each other lady and gentleman. We all start off that way, and then sometimes the gloves come off. I can assert to you that not every idea that is presented here is all good or all bad. What is the risk of acknowledging a good part of a larger idea even if you may disagree with that larger idea? I believe we have some very articulate people in this body who can figure out quite easily how we can accomplish that. We shouldn’t impugn the motives of others. We don’t assign blame. We don’t get personal. In fact, if you look in the rules that were adopted by this Congress, in section 363 of Jefferson’s Manual of Parliamentary Practice, it says: ‘‘The consequences of a measure may be reprobated in strong terms; but to arraign the motives of those who propose to advocate it is a personality, and against order.’’ So it says in no uncertain terms that we should not make this personal. We can object without being objectionable, and maybe—just maybe—others will see this and discover a tone that we need and a change in America. I believe that we can start this right here, today, with our very first debate right now. Will we agree on everything? Absolutely not. In fact, this is where our disagreements should show the most. We are dutybound to shape legislation by pointing out weaknesses but also by accentuating strengths. Mr. Speaker, every debate, every speech on the floor or in committee, our interactions with the media, in townhalls, or press releases, we are being listened to and being watched. I hope that we can change our tone and begin to change the tone in the United States of America. With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to announce that, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 392, providing for consideration of two important bills: H.R. 1873, which is the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act; and H.R. 1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act. This combined rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1873 under a structured rule, making three amendments in order, all of which were submitted by Democratic Members of our Chamber. H.R. 1654 will also be considered under a structured rule, with one Democratic and one Republican amendment made in order. H.R. 1873 will help ensure reliable electric service and reduced wildfire hazards, which can result from inadequate vegetation management near power line rightsofway on Federally owned and operated lands. Mr. Speaker, over the past several decades there have been numerous electricity outages as well as incidents of wildfires due to contact between power lines and trees on Federal lands. In 1996, my home State of Washington was impacted when three power lines in the Pacific Northwest sagged onto overgrown trees, leading to a massive electricity blackout that impacted 7.5 million people across 14 Western States, two Canadian provinces, and even parts of Mexico. Then, in August of 2003, an outage left 50 million electricity customers without power when a falling tree came into contact with transmission lines. These are not isolated incidents. According to the U.S. Forest Service, in 2012 and 2013, contact between power lines and trees on Forest Service lands led to the outbreak of 113 and 232 wildfires, respectively. This legislation would reduce such wildfires in part by promoting Federal consistency, accountability, and timely decisionmaking to protect electricity transmission, grid reliability, and distribution lines on Federal lands from overgrown and undermaintained trees and vegetation. H.R. 1873 will cut red tape to create a streamlined and consistent process for removing hazardous trees and vegetation without wasting time and money before they cause a wildfire or an outage. Preventing forest fires and maintaining a reliable electrical grid for our communities is an obvious priority for all of us here in Congress, which is why I was pleased to see this bill pass through the House Natural Resources Committee with bipartisan support. I have seen countless catastrophic wildfires devastate Western communities just in the past several years, which is why this issue must be addressed and resolved. However, due to existing regulations, it is extremely difficult for utility companies to remove hazardous vegetation or trees that have the potential of falling on these power lines. The scope of this problem is evident when considering the U.S. Forest Service manages 155 national forests and 20 national grasslands—encompassing over 192 million acres—that include 2,700 authorized electric transmission and distribution facilities. b1245 Similarly, the Bureau of Land Management administers 245 million acres, including over 71,000 miles of electrical transmission and distribution lines on its Federal lands. In order to perform infrastructure inspections and operate and maintain power lines on these lands, electric utilities must seek permission and approval from the appropriate Federal land management agency, which typically use processes under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to assess whether the proposed vegetative management measures comply with Federal environmental laws. This often leads to delays and cumbersome bureaucratic requirements, which often prevent utilities from carrying out important vegetative management activities on a consistent and 
timely basis. Yet the costs of operating, maintaining, and repairing these electric lines on Federal lands fall to the utility companies and their customers, which can lead to higher electricity costs for ratepayers. Mr. Speaker, the rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act. This legislation will streamline the permitting process for new surface water storage projects, which is critically important for many Western and rural communities that have endured severe droughts in recent years. Currently, the regulatory process for constructing new surface water storage projects often involves applying for a host of Federal, State, and local permits, as well as approvals from various agencies, which can be a very cumbersome, costly, and timeconsuming undertaking. Additionally, conflicting permit requirements and agency reviews can add time to the project, the planning, and implementation process while also increasing the potential for lastminute surprises that could endanger the success of a project or require significant additional work. In order to address this problem, H.R. 1654 creates what is seen as a onestop shop permitting process to expedite construction of both new and expanded nonFederal surface water storage projects. The measure establishes the Bureau of Reclamation as the lead agency for purposes of coordinating all reviews, analyses, permits, licenses, or other Federal approvals as required by law, which will streamline the current multiagency permitting process and eliminate unnecessary delays for job creating construction projects that directly benefit local communities and economies. As the lead agency, Reclamation will be required to coordinate and prepare the unified environmental documentation that will serve as the basis for Federal decisions authorizing the use of Federal lands, as well as to coordinate project development and the construction of qualifying projects. Additionally, H.R. 1654 will allow the Secretary of the Interior to expedite the evaluation of permits for qualifying projects through the use of funds contributed by a nonFederal public entity. Mr. Speaker, the rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of two bills that will have positive and lasting impacts for the American people, ratepayers, rural communities, and many Western States, as well as our entire country’s economy. H.R. 1654 will provide the type of coordination and streamlining that is essential to the development and construction of muchneeded water storage projects, certainly benefiting my home State of Washington, as well as waterstricken communities across the country. H.R. 1873 will create a framework for vegetation management near transmission and distribution lines on Federal lands while also providing electric companies with muchneeded clarity and defined authority to remove hazardous trees that pose a risk of falling into power lines. Managing this vegetation is a critical component in ensuring the safety and reliability of the electrical grid, which will benefit all of our constituents. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this rule as well as the underlying legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. First, I want to rise in agreement with my friend from Washington’s statement about civility in this Chamber and beyond. I think that, while it is extremely important that those of us who are elected to represent 700,000 to 800,000 people reflect the passions that we bring to our service, at the same time, we need to make sure that nothing that we say in these walls or outside is used to incite those who hear those words in a different way than they are intended. That is the fine line that we walk as elected Representatives who are passionate about our ideals and our values, and it is one that I encourage the President to walk, as well as other opinion leaders who we often see on the cable talk shows hurling inciteful phrases back and forth that could be used to further incite the American people. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the two underlying bills: H.R. 1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act; and H.R. 1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act. Frankly, both of these bills are trying to address real problems that have bipartisan solutions that I support, but neither of these bills solve the problems in a thoughtful, effective way without creating collateral damage that, in many ways, is as damaging as the problem that they are designed to solve. The majority will claim that similar bills received hearings last Congress, but I want to point out from a procedural perspective that neither of these bills have had hearings. These bills have not gone through the committee process. But what they won’t say is there are dozens of new Members of Congress. New members of the Natural Resources Committee didn’t have hearings at all, but it was rushed through a markup in committee and to the floor without any hearings in this session, without the new members of the National Resources Committee having a chance to ask questions about these bills. There is a reason we have regular order. It is so that we elected Representatives can use the passion we bring to service to ask the difficult questions to find out how to get at these very real problems that we are trying to solve. Unfortunately, this secrecy, lack of hearings, and lack of participation appears to be the norm, and, in fact, the standard that Republicans are setting in both Chambers of Congress right now. It is how the Republicans handled the healthcare bill in the House. It is how the Republicans are handling the secret healthcare bill behind a closed door somewhere over in the Senate. We know some things about the Republican healthcare bill. We know it will increase healthcare costs, throw people off their insurance, reduce access for the American people. We know it will burden small businesses and the middle class. We know it will hand hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. But there is also a lot we don’t know because the process has been closed. This type of secret backroom deal is, unfortunately, becoming the norm of the way Republicans are running their agenda in Washington. The rule for this bill is another example. It blocked at least three amendments from being considered on the floor. Why can’t we discuss the ideas of all Members, especially since there was no hearing on this bill? Representative MCEACHIN from Virginia, Representative SCHNEIDER from Illinois, and Representative TORRES  from California all offered amendments, all had good ideas and were not even allowed to discuss those on the floor for 10 minutes, 5 minutes, not even for 1 minute, to offer or discuss any of those amendments. If my colleagues on the Republican side don’t think they are good ideas, let’s at least have a vote. They can vote against them. If they defeat them, that is the process. But they are not even allowing a vote on these amendments. Unfortunately, the process of this bill is typical of the Republican process on healthcare and the way they have approached so many other issues. Republicans are working in secret and limiting debates so the American people won’t see the horrible things they are trying to do, like throwing tens of millions of Americans off of healthcare. Now, getting to these bills. First, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act has the goal of preventing forest fires and disruptions to power distribution; something that I strongly agree with. I represent a district that has over 60 percent public land and a number of rural power districts. It is an admirable goal. We are a district that is at risk for forest fires. We had several devastating fires in the last several years alone. In fact, I am representing a State that is getting even more ravaged by fire, in light of the changing climate. We need to take action to prevent them and allow additional work with 
regard to preventing the forest fire risk. Unfortunately, this bill is not a positive step, but I am glad to say there is an alternative out there. Representative CRAMER from North Dakota and I, along with five of my Colorado delegation colleagues, recently introduced bipartisan legislation that will decrease these types of fires and protect power lines and transformers the right way—a way that Democrats and Republicans can agree on; a way that we can probably run the bill as a suspension and get 410 votes; a way that the stakeholders are involved and utilities, fire prevention experts and firefighters, environmentalists all agree on. My legislation, known as the National Forest System Vegetation Management Pilot Program Act of 2017, gives power and electricity companies the ability to remove dead trees, but without the recklessness included in the bill that we are considering today. It is a stark contrast. We can actually solve this problem in a way that would bring the country together, or there can be a divisive bill—maybe against one Democrat, maybe against five; I don’t know, but it is not a broadly bipartisan bill. It is not one that has the support of the communities that are most affected by forest fires in my district. It is not even a bill that has the support of our main utility company in Colorado that actually sought the ability to reduce forest fire risks, which is done by Representative CRAMER ’s and my bill. This bill we are considering today simply lacks the protections that we need to have confidence. In this bill, the company can come up with a plan to remove vegetation, and then it can be accepted with no questions asked. They can’t require them to fix obvious problems, like the power company cutting down trees for no reason other than to sell it for timber. They can’t even deny an application. Frankly, I think this legislation’s real goal is to take a small step toward turning management of public lands over to private industry. Once this plan that they would submit under this bill is approved—because the plans have to be approved— the utility companies would be able to do massive devegetation and clearing work without any reason related to fires and without any risk of liability. On the other hand, the bipartisan legislation I introduced with Mr. CRAMER gives that liability waiver that the utility companies need to do the additional work, but only if there is no gross negligence by the utility company and has something to do with actually reducing the risk of fires, as well as putting reasonable limits on the distance that the work can be done from the power lines or transformers themselves. Mr. CRAMER ’s and my bill has some of the most conservative and some of the most liberal Members of this body as cosponsors. So I just wonder and I ask the majority leader why we aren’t bringing that bill to the floor—a bill that lacks controversy, that helps prevent forest fires, that saves American people time and money, a bill that this body could be proud of advancing with, if not all, almost near unanimity. I would suggest that, instead of bringing the bill we are considering today to the floor, we should have been focused on fixing something that we know needs to be fixed: the Forest Service’s problem with fire borrowing. Fire borrowing means the Forest Service has to spend all their money fighting fires and little money to reduce the risk of forest fires, deal with climate change, or clear the extensive backlog of maintenance. We can do that today by bringing to the floor the bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act that Representative SIMPSON and I introduced, along with my colleague, Mr. SCHRADER . These are the types of commonsense measures that would actually reduce the risk of forest fires, put the right parameters around utility companies doing additional work, and free up additional resources to prevent forest fires from occurring, rather than simply doing the cleanup after they occur. H.R. 1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act, also is an admirable and needed goal, one that there is potential for bipartisan cooperation to speed up the process of approval of water projects and hydro dams. There truly is a problem with the speed of which some of these problems are approved. I represent a district and a State where we understand how difficult and important water is, and we also believe in the new renewable energy economy. Unfortunately, this bill also does it the wrong way. It circumvents and undermines important input from experts and scientists that actually understand the reviews that are being made by the Clean Water Act. It even circumvents tribal sovereignty in the Native American Tribes and their sacred lands by overriding their input. That is why a wide spectrum of organizations are opposed, from conservation groups like Oceana and League of Conservation Voters to sportsmen’s groups like Trout Unlimited and The Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations. Dozens are opposed to this reckless bill. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter of opposition. 
JULY20, 2017. PLEASE OPPOSE H.R. 1654 DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the undersigned organizations, we write to urge you to oppose H.R. 1654 (McClintock, R–CA), a bill that would significantly limit meaningful public and environmental review of new dams and other surface storage projects throughout the west. H.R. 1654 would likely reduce protections for fish and wildlife, and could lead to further damming and destruction of western waterways. Similar provisions were included in H.R. 2898 and H.R. 23— antienvironmental bills from 2015 and 2017, respectively—and the Department of Interior has previously expressed opposition to these efforts. H.R. 1654 would undermine existing laws by making the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (‘‘Reclamation’’) the lead agency for all environmental reviews, including reviews under the Endangered Species Act. Giving Reclamation this unprecedented power over project permitting could undermine the ability of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and N.O.A.A. Fisheries to share expertise and inform the development of major infrastructure investments, placing imperiled fish species at risk. H.R. 1654 also establishes strict projectreview timelines, including provisions that could require expedited review under the National Environmental Policy Act. These fasttracking provisions could make it difficult for responsible agencies to meaningfully analyze proposed projects, and could limit the public’s ability to weigh in on infrastructure that could affect communities for decades. Further, the bill permits nonfederal public entities to contribute funds to expedite project permitting, raising questions about the fairness of the federal review process. This damaging bill would affect states throughout the west, and could even impact how state agencies are able review proposed projects within their jurisdictions. H.R. 1654 allows states to subject state agencies to the bill’s procedures, thereby requiring those agencies to cede control to Reclamation and comply with Reclamation’s timelines. Consolidating project review in this manner could weaken the essential role that states play in reviewing water infrastructure projects within their jurisdictions. As we recently learned from the emergency at Oroville Dam in California, careful planning and design for major infrastructure projects is critical for ensuring public safety and protecting the environment. Environmental review of surface storage projects is also essential for protecting endangered and commercially important salmon runs and the thousands of jobs that depend on healthy salmon populations. With so much at stake, the streamlining provisions in H.R. 1654 are unwise and irresponsible. Instead of fast tracking dam projects in the West, we should be investing in fiscally sound, environmentally friendly water supply solutions like conservation, water use efficiency, wastewater recycling, and stormwater capture. For these reasons, we respectfully urge you to vote no on H.R. 1654.

Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, the letter is signed by a number of sportsmen and environmental organizations, the very groups that we should seek to work with, the very groups that actually support, as I do, hydropower, facilitated permitting of hydropower, the right way. We need to speed up the process. In Colorado, we have had water projects that have been waiting on a decision for far too long. b1300 But instead of going around experts, rolling over tribal sovereignty, why don’t we fund the agencies doing the reviews so that they have the manpower and time to look at an application, give feedback, and make a decision quickly? Again and again we have underfunded the Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA, not acknowledging that that is what is causing and contributing to this very slowdown. We can solve these issues that we are facing. We can expedite permitting for water projects and hydropower. We can allow utilities to do additional work to reduce the risk of forest fires. I call upon this body, please, let’s do it in a way that brings Democrats and Republicans together, proudly gets a bill to President Trump’s desk in a fast and effective way involving input from Democrats and Republicans, not just Republicans. Mr. DOGGETT. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. POLIS. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I would just ask the gentleman a couple questions to underline a couple of the really important points you made about the context in which this bill is considered, because while I think every Democrat agrees with our colleague from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ) about the importance of civility and the importance of us each taking responsibility for the tone here and certainly condemning violence, condemning anyone who would suggest that if you come to the rally and you protest that you ought to be beaten up by the people that are there, the kind of thing that happened, unfortunately, last year, that we should condemn all of that. Does the gentleman agree that the House exercising vigorous oversight of the Administration when it breaks its promises, when it mixes personal business with public business, that this remains an important aspect of our job and no way suggests a breach of civility? Mr. POLIS. Absolutely. I agree with the gentleman from Texas. This House and the institution of Congress, as a separate agency of government in Article I, section 1 of our Constitution has the responsibility to exercise oversight of the executive branch. Mr. DOGGETT. If the gentleman would further yield, I heard a rather bizarre comment last week in the aftermath of these shootings suggesting that, in the aftermath of them, Democrats would be reaching out to Republicans on healthcare, and I couldn’t quite understand how that could occur. Indeed, your comments about this particular set of bills and the healthcare bill, isn’t it a part of civility that we have respect for one another and don’t try to force through a bill with an all night, unnecessary session, not force through here a bill that Republican Members say they didn’t have time to read but then leave it up there on the Speaker’s desk for a month before even sending it to the Senate? And if you have a legislative process where the majority leader in the Senate says he won’t even guarantee 10 hours to see a huge bill that affects this much of the economy and the lives and the livelihoods of millions of Americans, that that in itself is a breach of the respect and the civility that we need to have in this Congress? Mr. POLIS. It absolutely is. Sometimes the American people in the backandforth say: Hey, why aren’t Democrats participating in the healthcare debate? And the reason, as the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ) articulated, is we have never been invited into this room. I would ask the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ): Have you seen the Republican healthcare bill in the Senate? I yield to the gentleman. Mr. DOGGETT. No. I served on the Ways and Means Committee. We could not see the Republican House bill until hours before it came up. Mr. POLIS. Isn’t that too short a period of time to even come up with a thoughtful amendment? Mr. DOGGETT. It was under police guard downstairs so that even Republicans, like Senator RAND PAUL, couldn’t get in and see the bill. Then we have an allnight session without a single member of the Trump Administration coming to respond to questions about it, while every healthcare professional group that I have heard of opposed the bill, not letting any of those people come to a hearing. I just suggest that this is a breach of civility. That is a breach of respect. It is a breach of the democratic process which we are all about. That needs to be on the table and is as important as whether someone uses strong language here in the House. Mr. POLIS. I have one more question on that. I am a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, one of the three committees that had original jurisdiction over the Affordable Care Act. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ) is a member of the Ways and Means Committee, one of the two committees with jurisdiction under the budget reconciliation for this healthcare bill. I want to ask: Have you ever been invited by President Trump to discuss your ideas for healthcare reform? I yield to the gentleman. Mr. DOGGETT. No. I think he has only wanted to listen to one side, and I don’t begin to think that even the Republican Members of this House can contain President Trump. They seem to have sealed their lips about it, and I wish they would speak out more. But I think they can effect the processes in this House, and when they pass a bill that President Trump says is ‘‘mean, mean, mean,’’ they need to go back and look at that process. And I see the same thing happening, from what you have told us, about the two bills that are up here. Why is it that we have a process that is designed to exclude almost half of the people in this House, to exclude their amendments, to give them no opportunity to be heard at a markup, to bring in no witnesses to defend the bill or to allow discussion of that bill? That is not only not civil, not the democratic process, but it leads to worse public policy. Even if they have a majority to pass it, their ideas need to be tested, and it allows them to perfect their legislation. That is the way the democratic process is supposed to work. But with all the secrecy, all the forced action, the tight timetables that are applying here, they thwart our democratic process in a way that hurts all sides and certainly impairs civility. Mr. POLIS. I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ) and would just add, look, fire prevention, expediting water projects and hydropower, these are not partisan issues; and to prove that point, there are bipartisan bills sponsored by conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats that would solve these issues. Rather than moving either of those bills through the floor, they are moving a divisive ideological bill with unintended consequences—or, perhaps, intended consequences—that would devastate a lot of our natural resources that sportsmen and recreationists rely on for our quality of life in the mountain West and across the country. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, the beauty of having a diverse membership in this body is that we have people from all over the country who live and breathe the issues that are before us. We are privileged today to have the young lady from Wilson, Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ) here to speak on these bills. I appreciate her offering to help in these arguments. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY), my young colleague. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank very much my colleague from Washington particularly for calling me ‘‘young.’’ I appreciate that always. Mr. Speaker, I have enjoyed listening to the colloquy taking place among my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. We see this repeatedly now day 
in and day out as we work hard in the majority to continue the progress that we have made so far in this Congress, really recordbreaking progress of passing legislation, putting bills on the President’s desk, having those bills signed into law. Mr. Speaker, I believe we are now at the point where we have presented more bills to the President and had more bills signed than in any Congress in the first term of any Presidency since Harry Truman. It is a record we are very proud of over here. It is clear that as we continue to put commonsense reform legislation forward that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would sometimes like to distract and talk about other things. In terms of the healthcare conversation that is going on and the talk of unintended consequences, I would just point out, Mr. Speaker, that we now know the consequences of ObamaCare. We have had to live under ObamaCare now for many years. We are in a situation where the system is absolutely failing the people of this country, and we have an obligation as a body, an obligation we take seriously here in the House, to make sure that we do what is right for the people of this country, that we provide them relief, that we provide them the kind of healthcare reform that is going to lower their costs, that is going to provide better access to care and put people back in charge. We have tried the Democrats’ way now for the last 7 years and fundamentally seen that the government cannot mandate effectively what people need. It doesn’t have the consequences that many on the other side of the aisle thought it would, and the consequences have been devastating. Mr. Speaker, the same is true in terms of the challenge that we are here dealing with today with these two bills. As my colleague from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ) so eloquently put it, those of us across the West—and Mr. POLIS knows this well, too—have had to live under this situation of absolutely devastating forest fires, forest fires that have been caused in too many instances by mismanagement by the Forest Service, mismanagement by the Federal Government. These bills—and in particular, H.R. 1873, which is a bill that I am honored to cosponsor with Representative LAMALFA —will begin to impose the kind of commonsense reforms that we need so that our power grid is no longer threatened by mismanagement of our Federal Forest Service, of our Federal forestlands. On our federally managed forest in Wyoming, when we have overgrowth around a power line, it is a direct risk to the people, the property, and the power grid, as well as to the wildlife that those on the other side of the aisle claim to care so much about. Our local leaders understand this. Our local leaders are in the very best position to do something about this and to do it quickly. That is why we put in place these provisions in these bills that will allow the local utilities, allow local officials, to make the kinds of decisions that have to be made quickly. H.R. 1873 will allow our utilities to submit their own management facility inspection plans, their own operation and maintenance plans, and it will also ensure that our Federal land managers have consistent and accountable policies to reduce hazards in electricity rightsofway, including they, themselves, will be held accountable for managing the land. The bill does adjust the liability framework for these rightsofway to ensure that the utilities and the Federal Government have the incentive to respond quickly and effectively to these hazards. Nobody in Wyoming or in any other State ought to feel that they have to go without affordable, reliable power, ought to feel that the power grid is threatened simply because the Federal Government fails to do its job. We have simply seen that too much. Our local coops are willing and able to step up to the plate. Solving this problem is crucial to those who live in Wyoming, where bark beetlekilled trees and poorly managed overgrowth of Federal forests pose true threats to the safety and health of our communities and to our power reliability. Mr. Speaker, that is why H.R. 1873 is supported by the Wyoming Rural Electric Association, the Tri State Generation and Transmission Association, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Black Hills Energy, the Edison Electric Institute, the American Public Power Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Western Governors Association, and many others who care so much about our lands out West. Wyoming supports this bill. Wyoming utility coops know best how to manage the provision of electricity and how to handle these rightsofway and also how to provide healthy and sustainable forest management as they do so. Mr. Speaker, I request immediate passage of this bill. It is hugely important that we get back on track, that we stop the kind of mismanagement from Washington that has been so damaging for so many years, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to act quickly on its passage. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, President Trump campaigned on a promise to bring, somehow, jobs back home. He said he was going to overhaul the Tax Code, introduce an infrastructure package, and remove barriers to job creation. Unfortunately, we have yet to hear specifics on any of the administration’s plans to accomplish that. My colleagues will be happy to hear that in my hand I have an amendment that will help to accomplish this goal by providing tax incentives to companies that bring overseas jobs back home. What a great idea. Mr. Speaker, when we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative PASCRELL ’s Bring Jobs Home Act, H.R. 685. This bill closes a tax loophole that actually rewards companies for moving jobs overseas while providing a tax credit to companies that move jobs back home to our country, the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. SIMPSON ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ) to discuss our proposal. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. Here we are again. We are debating a bill to roll back regulations that protect the public, if I am not mistaken, Mr. Speaker. I think we are a little bit tone deaf. Here is a news flash: The whole country is focused on defending bluecollar jobs, bolstering our industrial manufacturing base. Americans broadly agree that keeping United States jobs from moving overseas is a top priority. Yet despite campaign promises, the administration has awarded government contracts to companies that continue to offshore. b1315 You can’t make this up. So we say one thing and then we do another. Now, look, both parties do it. Neither party is privy to virtue. But let me tell you something, there is a plethora of these before us on saying one thing when you are campaigning and not following through. That is not good. The flow of jobs overseas is not stopping. Just this week, it was announced that Ford is canceling plans to build the Ford Focus in Mexico, ending North American production entirely and making the model almost completely in China beginning next year, as soon as its output ends at a plant in Michigan. Yet, right now, when companies move overseas, as the gentleman from Colorado just said, we actually give them a reward. We give them a tax break for the cost of moving. Do you think that is going to impede or help people deciding whether they should stay or go? A tax break for leaving. The average citizen never gets that kind of a break. I mean, that is the law. I am not making it up. I will stand corrected, if need be, Mr. Speaker. We need to stop offshoring these jobs. And this Congress should start by defeating the previous question and bringing up the Bring Jobs Home Act. Around 5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs have been lost since 1994. Just ask folks in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania who have seen steel mills and rubber factories shipped overseas. 
Come to my hometown of Paterson, New Jersey, formerly the hub of the textile manufacturing industry. My bill eliminates this tax deduction to those companies and those corporations who want to bring their jobs overseas, and it gives a tax credit of up to 20 percent of the cost to U.S. businesses that bring jobs back to the United States of America. The companies would have to add jobs to claim the tax benefit. So let’s stop subsidizing companies that ship jobs overseas and start bringing jobs back to our shores. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, it doesn’t get much simpler than that. This is not a new idea. President Obama and Democrats in Congress have raised this bill for years, and the Republican Congress has blocked our bill at every turn. Senator STABENOW  of Michigan leads this bill in the Senate, where it cleared a procedural vote 93–7 in 2014. I challenge you, today, to take up and pass this bill to stand up for American manufacturing and the workers here at home. Talk only goes so far. Let’s act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, isn’t it good to hear good news? I just got this on my electronic device here. The MedStar: ‘‘Congressman Steve Scalise continues to make good progress. He is now listed in fair condition and is beginning an extended period of healing and rehabilitation.’’ Isn’t that good news? Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, let me just say that it is good news that our brother from Louisiana is in fair condition. I appreciate that news report. And I also want to take up the previous speaker’s offer to work with us on tax reform. We look forward to his assistance in moving that issue forward. I might say that he is mistaken. The bill that we are talking about today is about protecting public interests. The last time I checked, people who I know like green trees, not black ones; they like their electricity to be there when they turn their light switch on; and they like water. These are three issues that we are looking to protect and make sure that people in the United States can enjoy all of these attributes. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) to talk about exactly that. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ), my colleague on the Rules Committee, for yielding. Mr. Speaker, in the West, water is life. Coloradans must wisely steward the precious water flowing through our lands. That is why we are so focused on water storage projects. Unfortunately, many water storage projects in my State face significant setbacks in permitting due to a long list of regulatory checkboxes. Local, State, and Federal agencies all have their own requirements. For the past several years, I have followed multiple important water storage projects on the front range of Colorado that deeply impact Coloradans. Year after year, the shovels remain untouched as the water projects inched their way through the regulatory permitting process. Water projects should not take over 10 years to permit and then only a few years to build. Much of this delay occurs because each level of government—local, State, and Federal—requires their own studies and permitting checklists, even though many of those requirements are the same or only slightly different. H.R. 1654 makes this process more efficient, allowing the Bureau of Reclamation to coordinate the Federal and State permitting processes, so that we can avoid unnecessary duplication and so that we can better unify the approval requirements. H.R. 1654 offers a more streamlined approval process for our water projects but still empowers State and Federal governments to fulfill our duties to protect communities and the environment. This is a good government bill. We are simply asking different levels of government to work together so that our water projects can earn the permits they rightfully qualify for. No water project should take 10 years to gain approval, but too many have. H.R. 1654 ensures that projects on Federal lands will have a clear, more efficient permit application process. We owe this bill to the people of Colorado; we owe this bill to the people of the West. We owe this bill to everyone in this country who relies on fresh, clean drinking water. We owe it to the farmers who need water for their crops, to the ranchers who need water for their livestock, to the anglers who need water for their recreation. I am supporting H.R. 1654 for these people. I ask my colleagues to support this important legislation as well. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK), my friend, that there is a problem here we are trying to solve. Unfortunately, these are not the bipartisan bills that Democrats and Republicans from both sides of the aisle have worked hard to put together to do. Of course, Democrats, myself, and so many others want to expedite water projects permitting for hydro renewable energy projects. Of course, we want to free up utilities to do extra mitigation work around power lines to reduce the risk of fires. We have solid bipartisan bills that would do that. We could put them on the floor today or tomorrow, and they would have over 400 votes. There are liberal Democrats, conservative Republicans, and firefighters who support them. Utilities, Democrats, Republicans, and sportsmen support them. That is a route we could go. We could get those bills to President Trump’s desk by next week and actually start preventing forest fires and facilitate the permitting process around hydro projects. But, no, instead, we are doing a very divisive bill, one that has a lot of problems that it creates, in addition to solving some of the problems that it sets out to address. I encourage my Republican friends— they are in charge; they control the agenda—to take a look at pragmatic, smart, and thoughtful ways to reduce forest fire risk, speed up water project approval, such as the bipartisan National Forest System Vegetation Management Pilot Program Act, which is a bipartisan bill. Look, this bill around the expedited water projects would circumvent a lot of the public input process that is actually so important to the success of these projects. My colleague from Colorado was referring to several water projects. One that we both care deeply about, the Northern Integrated Supply Project, NISP, is currently with the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. I strongly supported extending the public comment period from 30 to 60 days—a very reasonable time to allow people more input, which actually changed how the project was done and planned. It was a very meaningful form of input to build additional public support for the project; and, when the project is completed, will lead to a better, more meaningful project, serving the water needs of our communities, as well as the impact on the lives of those who live in and near it. So, look, whether it is fixing fire borrowing, giving utilities a liability waiver while not giving them a free pass, making sure that our agencies doing water project reviews have the men and women power they need to actually get them done quickly, these are reasonable, good ideas that I think we could pass with unanimity, or near unanimity. I promise the Republicans, if you would just work with us and have an open process, we could find common ground. Let’s start with these small things. Let’s start with preventing forest fires around electrical fires. We will get to healthcare. We can find common ground with you on that, too. But let’s start on finding common ground around reducing forest fire risk around electrical wires, Mr. Speaker. There is a path to do that. Let’s solve our small problems, and let’s build a pathway to work together on the big problems our country faces. I urge everyone to vote ‘‘no’’ on this restrictive rule, this rule that goes to the floor with no hearing, this rule 
that rules out Democratic amendments, doesn’t even allow discussion of them, and has a controversial piece of underlying legislation, when there is no need for controversy around such an important aspect of life in the American West, and, nationally, reducing forest fire risk and facilitating water projects and hydroelectric projects. Please join me in voting ‘‘no,’’ so we can get this House back to working on commonsense legislation that is bipartisan, with the full support of the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the time of my colleagues, who have joined me on the floor today, to speak in support of these underlying bills, as well as for the hard work of the House Natural Resources Committee. First of all, H.R. 1873 is a bipartisan bill by any measure—five Democratic cosponsors, passed bipartisanly through the committee. This will reduce the threat of electricity outages caused by contact between overgrown trees and power lines. It is that simple. Existing Federal regulations and red tape can make it extremely difficult for utilities to gain the access that they need to their rights of way in order to perform needed maintenance. Before taking this action, they must receive approval from Federal agencies. They have been criticized for not allowing these utilities to carry out vegetative management policies on a consistent and timely basis. Mr. Speaker, as you know, just one down tree on a transmission line can have devastating impacts, causing blackouts for thousands or millions of homes as well as businesses, or it can ignite fires that consume entire forests. Yet it can take months to remove one single tree, due to our outdated Federal regulations and cumbersome bureaucracy. H.R. 1654 streamlines the current multiagency permitting system, which creates significant delays for project construction and completion, by creating a onestop shop, a permitting process at the Bureau of Reclamation. Mr. Speaker, the Bureau was created to oversee water resource management in the West and to prevent water shortages by building dams and conveyance systems. Yet, over the past 40 years, Federal regulations and policies have slowly made it increasingly difficult to build dams and reservoirs throughout the Western United States. Presently, it is nearly impossible to even expand the storage capacity at existing facilities. The Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act establishes a framework where the Federal agencies with jurisdiction over new surface water storage projects must work together, coordinate their schedules, share technical information and data, and publish their findings publicly. This important measure will allow water providers to better manage their systems to modernize and enhance their water storage infrastructure and optimize water resource management in preparation for future droughts and shortages, which we know will come. b1330 The Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act will prevent wildfires and power outages while enabling utilities to safely supply electricity to rural and Western communities. H.R. 1873 will ensure that practical measures are taken to protect power lines and conserve our public lands, which is especially important in Western States where overgrown Federal forests are too often the norm rather than the exception. Mr. Speaker, I believe the rule provides for consideration of two commonsense measures that will implement much needed improvements to the Federal management of our water resources, our Federal lands and forests, and electricity infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to support this rule as well as the underlying bills. The material previously referred to by Mr. POLIS is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of the House and offer the resolution that was previously noticed, asking that it be read in full concerning President Trump’s tax returns. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution. The Clerk read as follows: 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President shall immediately disclose his tax return information to the House of Representatives and the American people. Whereas, President Nixon explained that ‘‘People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook’’ when he invited the Joint Committee on Taxation to audit his returns after the Internal Revenue Service gave him an unwarranted tax discount; Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed his tax return information to the public; Whereas, the Chairmen of the Committee on Ways and Means, Joint Committee on Taxation, and the Committee on Finance have the authority to request the President’s tax returns under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; Whereas, pursuant to Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the Constitution, often referred to as the Origination Clause, the House of Representatives has the sole authority to initiate legislation that raises revenue for the national government, and the Committee on Ways and Means is considering a comprehensive reform of the Tax Code; Whereas, according to media reports analyzing President Trump’s leaked 2005 tax return, we know that had his own tax plan been in place, he would have paid an estimated mere 3.48 percent rate instead of a 24 percent rate, saving him $31.3 million; Whereas, according to The New York Times, the President used a legally dubious tax maneuver in 1995 that could have allowed him to avoid paying any Federal taxes for 18 years; Whereas, President Trump holds ‘‘interests as the sole or principal owner in approximately 500 separate entities,’’ according to his attorneys, and the President’s tax plan proposes to cut the tax rate on such ‘‘pass through’’ entities from 39.6 percent to 15 percent; Whereas, one analysis estimated that President Trump would personally save $6.7 million from two tax breaks included in the Republicans’ first tax cut, which they misleadingly call the American Health Care Act; Whereas, without the President’s tax returns, the American people cannot determine how much he will personally benefit from proposed changes to the Tax Code; Whereas, an ABCNews/Washington Post poll found that 74 percent of Americans would like President Trump to disclose his tax returns and the mostsigned petition on the White House website calls for the release of the President’s tax return information to verify compliance with the Emoluments Clause, with more than 1,097,000 signatures as of date of this resolution; Whereas, disclosure of the President’s tax returns could help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election better understand the President’s financial ties to the Russian Federation, Russian businesses, and Russian individuals; Whereas, after breaking his pledge to make his tax returns available, President Trump instead presented a onepage letter from a law firm giving him a clean bill of health on any business dealings with Russians, but failed to note that the very same law firm boasted of the ‘‘prestigious honor’’ of being named ‘‘Russia Law Firm of the Year’’ for 2016; Whereas, former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, before he was fired by President Trump, publicly confirmed that the Bureau has been investigating potential ties between President Trump’s campaign and Russia since July and that the Russian President Vladimir Putin favored a Trump electoral victory; Whereas, President Trump’s soninlaw and senior advisor, Jared Kushner, met during the Presidential transition at the behest of the Russian Ambassador with Sergey N. Gorkov, a graduate of a school run by the successor to the KGB and who was appointed by Vladimir Putin to head a Russian state owned bank that is on the U.S. sanctions list; Whereas, Mr. Kushner proposed establishing a secret back channel of communications directly to Vladimir Putin, even considering the use of Russian embassy facilities to do so; Whereas, Attorney General Jeff Sessions falsely stated during his Senate confirmation hearing that he ‘‘did not have communications with the Russians,’’ when in fact he met at least twice during the campaign with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak; Whereas, former Director Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that President Trump had asked him in the Oval Office about ‘‘letting Flynn go,’’ referring to the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s business ties to Russia; Whereas, President Trump stated on May 11, 2017, that he had decided that he was going to fire Comey because of ‘‘this Russia thing’’; Whereas, former Director Comey, on June 8, 2017, testified that Special Counsel Robert Mueller could investigate whether President Trump’s actions with regard to Director Comey and the Flynn investigation constituted obstruction of justice; Whereas, in 2013, President Trump said, ‘‘Well, I’ve done a lot of business with the Russians. They’re smart and they’re tough,’’ and President Trump’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., told a news outlet in 2008 that ‘‘Russians make up a pretty disproportionate crosssection of a lot of our assets’’; Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses; Whereas, the Director of the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics said that the President’s plan to transfer his business holdings to a trust managed by family members is ‘‘meaningless’’ and ‘‘does not meet the standards that . . . every President in the past four decades has met’’; Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the Constitution for the express purpose of preventing Federal officials from accepting any ‘‘present, Emolument, Office, or Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state’’; Whereas, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., has hired a ‘‘director of diplomatic sales’’ to generate highpriced business among foreign leaders and diplomatic delegations; Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the information public; Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means used the authority under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers; Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means has now voted three times along party lines to continue to coverup President Trump’s tax returns; Whereas, the House of Representatives has now refused nine times to act on President Trump’s tax returns; Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to international affairs, tax reform, Government contracts, or otherwise; Whereas, the House of Representatives undermines its dignity and the integrity of its proceedings by continuing the coverup of President Trump’s tax returns: Now, therefore, be it; Resolved, That the House of Representatives shall— 1. Immediately request the tax return and return information of Donald J. Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015, as provided under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as well as the tax return and return information with respect to the President’s businesses of each business entity disclosed by Donald J. Trump on his Office of Government Ethics Form 278e, specifically each corporation and each partnership within the meaning of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 where he is listed as an officer, director, or equivalent, or exercises working control; and 2. Postpone consideration of tax reform legislation until the elected Representatives of the American people in this House have obtained President Trump’s tax returns and return information to ascertain how any changes to the Tax Code might financially benefit the President. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Texas wish to present argument on the parliamentary question whether the resolution presents a question of the privileges of the House? Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I do wish to address the parliamentary question and would appreciate the opportunity to speak at this time about it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized on the question of order. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, you can certainly observe, as all the Members can, the many troubling events that are reflected in the resolution we just had read and why they do arise to the privileges of the House. Under clause 1 of rule IX, questions of the privileges of the House are: ‘‘those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.’’ This resolution seeks to protect the integrity of the proceedings of the House, and I believe that it is therefore privileged. There is just not an issue that is more fundamental to the integrity of this House, the people’s House, than the faith the American people have in our democracy. That sacred faith is being undermined. It is under assault right now by President Trump. This House must act to protect the integrity of its proceedings. 
Now, I know that there are many Members here who are eager to avoid a direct upanddown vote on the specific question of covering up the Trump tax returns, and that there have been nine previous times when Members have come to the floor and presented resolutions that were focused on trying to get those returns and to end the coverup. Recognizing the Speaker’s prior rulings nine times against considering this measure, I have, today, offered a different resolution, taking a new approach that I bring to the Speaker’s attention. Unlike the last nine resolutions, my resolution does not direct the Committee on Ways and Means to meet and consider action on these secreted tax returns. I believe it should not be ruled out of order on the grounds that were used the previous nine times that this type of resolution was blocked. This coverup of the Trump returns must end, and that is why I have taken a different approach. Pursuant to Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the United States Constitution, what we know as the Origination Clause, the House of Representatives has the sole authority to initiate legislation that raises revenue for the national government. As the Speaker knows, that means the House Ways and Means Committee, on which I serve, on which Mr. PASCRELL , who I know wants to comment on this point of order, is concerned, for this House to exercise with integrity its authority to originate tax legislation. This is authority that it solely possesses. The American people should know how the President and his family might personally benefit from the tax legislation, either in their direct personal income or through the many business intermediaries with which they work. I believe some 500plus entities reported on their financial disclosure statement. President Trump, we know, has bragged publicly about his ability to bend the Tax Code to his whim in the past. He has said only he can ‘‘fix it.’’ And the question is: Will he fix it for himself, or fix it for working families? Will he enrich the middle class with jobs, or simply enrich himself and other billionaires like him? While recently Mr. Trump has provided us a single page of clues concerning the contents of his tax plan that they now say will be provided fully in September, he has not given us much detail. But he does give us a few clues off that one page. One is his proposal to repeal the alternative minimum tax. We know if that had been the law, if that Trump proposal had been in effect for the one year, 2005, that we have his return, he would have paid about the amount that an employee does on their Social Security. It would have saved him $30 million. I understand that there are many here that simply don’t want to look under the rock to see what is contained in those returns. And there are many who believe that Mr. Trump is the golden ticket to more prized tax breaks, to more ending of consumer protection, and they have been rather quiet about the tax return issue, about the conflicts of interest, and about the potential foreign collusion. But after all the resolutions presented here on the floor, nine, plus the amendments that I have offered in the Ways and Means Committee that have been rejected, I can say that, while there has not been progress yet on the House floor, there has been progress. Mr. Trump has responded. He provided a onepage letter from a lawyer that reviewed his tax returns, and that lawyer gave a Good Housekeeping ‘‘seal of approval’’ to assure us—‘‘to assure America he had no business dealings with the Russians as a result of reviewing the returns.’’ What he did not say was that the same law firm had boasted of what they call the prestigious honor of being named the ‘‘Russia Law Firm of the Year.’’ I would just say today, in response specifically to the point of order, that it is not sufficient to preserve the integrity of this House to rely on the ‘‘Russia Law Firm of the Year’’ to be the only entity that reviews these returns. b1345 I believe that we can do better; that we must protect the dignity of the House. According to Mr. Trump himself, he is already being investigated for obstruction of justice. It is important for us to have the tax returns on tax reform. It is important to have it on the Russia investigation. And, you know, there is hardly an hour that goes by, certainly a day that goes by, that there is not some additional information. When I opened The Washington Post this morning, right there on the front page—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman must confine his remarks to the question of privilege. Mr. DOGGETT. Certainly. And one of those aspects of the question of privilege is how conflicts of interest interface with what we are doing here in the House. I mentioned the tax returns and the Russia investigation, but there is a new one out today, and that is in the budget. I assume eventually we are going to have a budget resolution presented here, though it is very late this year. But when we take up that budget resolution and we take up the appropriation bills, The Washington Post reports that, while there have been significant cuts in the Housing and Urban Development budget, as many people cannot afford housing— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman must confine his remarks to the question of the privileges of the House. Mr. DOGGETT. I would do nothing else, Mr. Speaker. And this particular example shows how the proceedings of the House would be impaired if the only aspect of the budget that increases HUD is one from which Mr. Trump personally benefits, which is what the Post is reporting, and so we need the returns in order to see that. Like so many other broken promises, we will not get these returns voluntarily. I believe that the House needs to act. Unlike Sally Yates, unlike the U.S. attorney in New York, and unlike James Comey, he can’t fire us, and we don’t have to be accessories to a coverup. I call on this House to protect the integrity of its proceedings, including the integrity of our unique constitutional authority over tax legislation, by declaring that this resolution is in order. This resolution simply calls on the House to secure the tax return and return information on Mr. Trump and his businesses. It further declares that, in order to preserve the integrity of the House, we will not be taking up tax reform legislation, which we certainly need to take up, and we have ideas to offer and to cooperate in trying to see reform of our taxes, but not do it until we have had an opportunity to review thoroughly Mr. Trump’s tax returns and return information to ascertain how he may personally benefit. I would hope that the Speaker, considering my comments, as well as those that I know Mr. PASCRELL wants to offer, would be ruling that we can have that straight upanddown vote, no hiding behind a rock, let us look under the rock. I appreciate the Speaker giving me this opportunity to emphasize the very significant importance of this question to the integrity of the House and to the future of the American people and our democracy. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the question of order? Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, how are you today? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from New Jersey wish to be heard on the question of order? Mr. PASCRELL. Yes, I do, thank you. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I think we need to define a few terms here what we are talking about. We are talking about tax returns. What does that mean? It doesn’t mean the 1040. It doesn’t mean the 278. In this particular case, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about close to 12,000 pages of tax returns; that is what we are talking about, the integrity of the House, the integrity of myself and you. I know you are a person of integrity. And I say it like it is, so I am not blowing smoke. That is why this is important. So a 2page, 3page 1040 doesn’t mean anything to what we are doing; 12,000 pages, just on this President’s tax returns. The stunning potential conflicts of interest are piling up. Every day, we 
all read about it. The President was told by the Ethics Commission, divest yourself of your holdings. That doesn’t mean you give your money away, your assets away. It means what it says, you divest. But I think that there is nothing more of a threat to the integrity of our House than ignoring our duties, to provide a check and a balance to the executive branch. To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to request the President’s tax returns. Give the American people the transparency that they deserve. In addition, it is reported that the President’s hotel in Washington received $270,000 from Saudi Arabia when they were here to lobby against the bill allowing families of 9/11 victims to sue the Saudi Government. Now, last week, the District of Columbia and Maryland filed a lawsuit against the President, arguing that he is violating the anticorruption clauses in the Constitution by allowing his businesses to accept payments from foreign governments and other government entities. We have no way of knowing whether the President or his firms have received Russian income or loans or entered into Russianlinked partnerships. In fact, you are going to read a lot about that this week. There are hearings going on as we speak. A certified letter from paid attorneys does nothing to assuage these concerns. Two weeks ago, we heard from the former Director of the FBI, James Comey, who confirmed that the President tried to influence him to stop the Russian investigation. Isn’t it great that we live in a body where they can’t stop us? The President can’t stop us. We can only stop ourselves. The legislative branch has the responsibility and authority to check the executive branch, and section 6103, you have heard me say that number many times, section 6103 of the Tax Code, which allows for the examination of tax returns—that authority, put in place specifically so Congress could examine conflicts of interest following that scandal which we all know about in 1923. Nothing could be more of a threat, to me, to the integrity of the House and our Members, than ignoring our duty to fully examine the personal financial entanglements of this President or any President, and particularly those, at this time, which we are reading about, that he may have with the Russian entities and individuals or whether he abused the tax laws of this country. We have a right to know who our public officials are and what investments they have made, and every member of the executive branch of government—and this was made clear in the decision in 1924, particularly Interior Secretary Fall at that time, to examine his tax records, and that is how people were brought to justice in 1924. It also protects the privacy of the very taxpayer. And we are having exceptions. We have exceptions to that. Three years ago, we had an exception in the Ways and Means Committee. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman have any further argument on whether this resolution constitutes a question of the privileges of the House? Mr. PASCRELL. Yes, it does constitute a question of privilege, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Then the gentleman will confine his remarks to the question of the privileges of the House. Mr. PASCRELL. Yes, I can, Mr. Speaker. May I continue? The SPEAKER pro tempore. As long as the gentleman confines his remarks to the question of privilege. Mr. PASCRELL. Very good. Thank you. Just let me say this in conclusion: if and when, if and when such conflicts are revealed, I don’t want to say to you, my constituents, that we had the power to review the conflicts, but we chose not to. I, for one, do not want my integrity or the integrity of my brothers and sisters on this floor to be demeaned by a shameful failure. To restore the dignity of the House is what this privilege is all about. I have a question of the Speaker at this particular time, if I may. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman may inquire. Mr. PASCRELL. I think that I would like to present today what Congress should do immediately about the question of privilege before us. May I proceed? The SPEAKER pro tempore. As long as it pertains to the question of privilege. Mr. PASCRELL. The Chair is good on that answer, Mr. Speaker. I think that we should do this. I think we should require the President and the Vice President, whomever that will be in the future, for now, and their families, to resolve their conflicts of interest by selling their assets, using a truly independent asset manager. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman’s remarks are wandering from the question of privilege. Mr. PASCRELL. I don’t believe so, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. You might not believe so, but the Chair does. Mr. PASCRELL. But I am compelled to follow your direction. The SPEAKER pro tempore. If the gentleman has no further argument on the question of privilege, the Chair is prepared to rule. Mr. PASCRELL. Well, my final comment is this: I know you don’t take the question of integrity lightly. That is not a joking matter at all. Nor do I take the integrity of the President of the United States lightly. I have an obligation and a responsibility. As I said on February 1, I will not yield. This is important to all of us, and it is not partisan. Read my letter of February 1. I thank the Chair for his indulgence. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is prepared to rule. The gentleman from Texas seeks to offer a resolution as a question of the privileges of the House under rule IX. In evaluating the resolution under rule IX, the Chair must determine whether the resolution affects ‘‘the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.’’ The first resolving clause of the resolution offered by the gentleman from Texas seeks tax returns and tax return information of the President and certain of his business entities. Section 702 of the House Rules and Manual states that ‘‘rule IX is concerned not with the privileges of the Congress, as a legislative branch, but only with the privileges of the House, as a House.’’ As the Chair ruled on March 28, 2017, a resolution offered under rule IX seeking information from actors entirely extramural to the House, such as the President and certain business entities in which the President may be involved, is not uniquely concerned with the privileges of the House, as a House. Accordingly, the resolution offered by the gentleman from Texas does not constitute a question of privilege under rule IX. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I most reluctantly, after the Speaker’s careful consideration of this, must appeal the ruling of the Chair. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the House? 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Newhouse moves that the appeal be laid on the table. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15 minute vote on the motion to table will be followed by 5minute votes on ordering the previous question on House Resolution 392; and on adoption of House Resolution 392, if ordered.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:

SPEAKER : I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy of the Certificate of Election received from the Honorable Corey Stapleton, Secretary of State of Montana, indicating that, at the Special Election held on May 25, 2017, the Honorable Greg Gianforte was duly elected Representative in Congress for the AtLarge Congressional District, State of Montana. With best wishes, I am Sincerely, KAREN L. H AAS, Clerk. Enclosure. 
CERTIFICATE OF ELECTION  I, Steve Bullock, Governor of the State of Montana, hereby certify that at the Special Election held on the 25th day of May 2017, Greg Gianforte was elected to the office of United States Representative, to serve for the balance of an unexpired term that commenced on January 3, 2017. Said candidate received the highest number of votes cast, as appears from the official canvass of returns of the Special Election. In witness whereof, I have hereunto subscribed my name and affixed the Great Seal of the State of Montana this 15th day of June 2017. STEVE BULLOCK , Governor. ATTEST: COREY STAPLETON , Secretary of State. [State Seal Affixed] f 
SWEARING IN OF THE HONORABLE GREG GIANFORTE, OF MONTANA, AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER. Will Representative elect GIANFORTE present himself in the well. All Members will rise and the Representativeelect will please raise his right hand. Mr. GIANFORTE appeared at the bar of the House and took the oath of office, as follows: 
Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which you are about to enter, so help you God. 
The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you are now a Member of the 115th Congress. 
WELCOMING THE HONORABLE GREG GIANFORTE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, G REG GIANFORTE is a family man and a businessman. He has been a husband for 29 years, and he is a father of four. He is a founder with his wife, Susan, of RightNow Technologies, which employs over 500 fellow Montanans. It is good to have another businessowner in this House, somebody who knows the way the economy works, who has created jobs, and who cares about his local community. Now, Montana may only send one Member to this body, but out West, it is not about how many of you there are, it is about how much you do. GREGis a doer, and we are happy to have him here. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ), who is the dean of Montana. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank you and Majority Leader MCCARTHY . I am humbled and honored to have been elected by the people of Montana to represent them here in this House. I am joined today by my wife, Susan, who is in the gallery. We have been married 29 years. We have four grown children. Two of them are with us today, along with our daughterinlaw. We raised them hunting, fishing, and hiking on the great public lands in Montana. I am a business guy and an electrical engineer. I am trained to solve hard problems, not to argue about them, just to get things done. Susan and I did start a computer software company in our home over 20 years ago in Bozeman, Montana, and it grew to over 500 employees there and became one of the State’s largest employers. I am Montana’s lone voice here in this House, sent by the people to do the work of the people. The MT comes before the R or the D after my name. I promised the people of Montana that I 
would come back and drain the swamp. That is why today three of my first actions are bills: no balanced budget, no pay; term limits; and a ban on lobbying by Members of Congress after being out of office. We need to bring accountability to Washington, D.C. I feel a deep sense of obligation to serve, and I look forward to being a strong voice for all of Montana. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5minute vote. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—ayes 230, noes 185, not voting 16, as follows:

b1442 So the resolution was agreed to. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. Stated for: Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote on rollcall No. 313. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea.’’ 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I was absent during roll call votes No. 311, No. 312, and No. 313 due to my spouse’s health situation in California. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘nay’’ on the Motion to Table the Appeal of the Ruling of the Chair. I would have also voted ‘‘nay’’ on the Motion on Ordering the Previous Question on the Rule providing for consideration of both H.R. 1873 and H.R. 1654. I would have also voted ‘‘nay’’ on H. Res. 392—Rule providing for both H.R. 1873—Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act and H.R. 1654—Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2131, the DHS FIRM Act, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2131, or the DHS FIRM Act, seeks to ensure greater consistency and transparency in how discipline is administered across the Department of Homeland Security. Discipline administered in a fair and equitable manner has a huge implication on job satisfaction. Since 2003, DHS, a diverse, multimission Federal Department, has struggled with low morale. At the end of the prior administration, there was evidence that the DHS workforce was starting to feel a more fair and cooperative and supportive DHS. In 2016, the Office of Personnel Management reported a 3 percent increase in the annual Employee Viewpoint Survey, which indicated that DHS supported fairness and protection of employees from arbitrary action. While the OPM survey results are positive indicators, more must be done by the current DHS leadership. This bill seeks to give the Department’s Chief Human Capital Officer a more prominent role in ensuring that discipline is handled in an equitable and fair manner. Specifically, this bill charges the Chief Human Capital Officer with oversight of how employee misconduct is managed across all components. To ensure fairness and transparency, the bill requires each component to accomplish a matrix of offenses and penalties that is tailored to the needs of that organization, and upon approval by the Department’s Chief Human Capital Officer, such information to be shared with the workforce. While it is essential that seniorlevel human capital personnel at DHS have a structure to address discipline, it is equally important that such discipline be administered in a fair and equitable manner. This is what this bill actually does. Mr. Speaker, the implementation of a Departmentwide discipline and adverse action policy should improve employer and employee relations and communication. Enacting this legislation will send a message of support for the Department’s workforce who, every day, do things big and small to guard our country against terrorists and other bad actors. These Department personnel are entrusted with the security of our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 2131, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his wisdom and counsel. I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2131, as amended. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2131, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DHS ACQUISITION REVIEW BOARD ACT OF 2017 Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1282) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish Acquisition Review Boards in the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1282 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘DHS Acquisition Review Board Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GARRETT ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. 
Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to implore my colleagues to join in supporting our bill, H.R. 1282, the DHS Acquisition Review Board Act of 2017. This legislation provides commonsense reform and saves the taxpayers’ dollars. The Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office of Inspector General have reported the longstanding challenges the Department of Homeland Security faces in managing its major acquisition programs. These programs are those costing more than $300 million, which cost the Department about $7 billion in 2016 alone. Since the Department’s creation, the GAO has placed DHS management functions, including acquisition management, on its highrisk list of programs that are highly susceptible to fraud, waste, and abuse. Mismanagement is present or in need of transformation, and the DHS still struggles to ensure that major acquisition programs stay on budget, are delivered on schedule, and provide capabilities as originally intended. Homeland Security is a unique committee insofar as it affords the opportunity for folks on both sides of the aisle to work in a bipartisan manner for things that we can all concede are in the best interest of our Nation. A recent GAO report found that 9 of 26 major acquisition programs experienced cost growth or schedule slips. The amount of cost overruns totaled nearly $1 billion and are scheduled to slip by an average of 6 months per program. The GAO also found that half of the major acquisition programs it reviewed deployed capabilities before meeting all key performance parameters, which are the most important requirements a system must meet in order to do the jobs that they are intended to do. It is unacceptable for waste and dysfunction to continue, and it is imperative that the DHS take acquisition management seriously. This bill makes that the case. We must provide strong accountability mechanisms to ensure major acquisition programs with challenges are caught up, found early, and that solutions are quickly implemented. This bill ensures that DHS provides that accountability and consistency needed to manage major components, acquisition programs, et cetera, by authorizing the Secretary to establish an Acquisition Review Board. The Acquisition Review Board would then strengthen the accountability and uniformity in DHS’ acquisition process, review major programs, and evaluate the use of best practices. This bill essentially codifies the already existing Acquisition Review Board to ensure that that board continues and has the oversight authority 
it needs under law to make sure that the dollars that we take from the taxpayers are sufficiently and adequately managed and not wasted. The Acquisition Review Board would be chaired by the Under Secretary for Management and would require at least two component heads or their designees to be permanent members. This would ensure participation from all DHS components. The Board would be required to meet regularly and would be responsible to determine if a proposed acquisition has met planning requirements needed to proceed to production and deployment, oversee major acquisitions as a business strategy, and review programs in a cost benefit analysis format to determine performance objectives and ensure that our dollars are well spent. Mr. Speaker, a recent news story pointed out that nine individuals on the planet Earth control as much wealth as 50 percent of the population of the planet Earth. That means that these nine people control as much wealth as 3.5 billion people. And yet, Mr. Speaker, if you were to take the amalgamated wealth of those nine individuals and add it to those 3.5 billion and apply it to the United States’ national debt, we could pay off a mere 9.4 percent. Given that our national debt is almost $20 trillion dollars and rising, it is imperative that we take this bipartisan step to ensure that our homeland is secured but that the dollars spent doing so are spent effectively, efficiently, and with good stewardship. This legislation helps to ensure that tax dollars are safeguarded, but it also helps to ensure that DHS personnel receive the tools they need to keep us safe. Mr. Speaker, I implore and urge my colleagues on each side of the aisle to join in this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our tax dollars are well shepherded but that our Nation is as secure as can be possible. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1282, the DHS Acquisition Review Board Act of 2017, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in recent years, the Department of Homeland Security has strengthened the management of its major acquisition programs, which historically has been weak. H.R. 1282 authorizes the key mechanisms from the previous administration to ensure acquisitions valued at more than $300 million, which account for over $7 billion of DHS’ annual budget, receive ongoing scrutiny—let me repeat, receive ongoing scrutiny. Since 2008, the Acquisition Review Board has brought leaders together from across the Department to validate foundational acquisition documents such as cost and schedule estimates and performance requirements. The Department has had to learn the hard way about the importance of adhering to its acquisition best practices, including the establishment of realistic requirements in cost estimates that take into account the life cycle of costs. An example is the SBInet program, started in 2006, that was supposed to bring together integration of systems of infrastructure and technology to secure the border. This program was terminated in 2011 only after $1 billion had been spent. Let me repeat that. This program was terminated in 2011, but only after $1 billion had been spent. The acquisition went wrong because CBP bypassed required processes and awarded a multimilliondollar contract without having laid the foundation to oversee contractor performance, cost controls, and scheduling. Just last week, the Department was forced to cancel its $1.5 billion Agile Services contract, or the FLASH contract, due to significant errors and missteps in the procurement process. Many of us are concerned that, in the Department’s haste to deliver the President’s campaign promise to build a wall, critical steps in the acquisition process will be shortcircuited, leaving Americans with a bill for a bad investment. b1500 At this time, a centralized oversight body for DHS major acquisitions is more important than ever. This bill provides for the board to convene when a major acquisition program requires authorization to proceed from one decision event to another, or is in breach of its approved requirements, or requires additional review. Efficiency and effectiveness in the acquisition process is imperative for the DHS mission of procuring goods, services, and supplies in support of its national security efforts. The Committee on Homeland Security unanimously approved this measure earlier this Congress, and similar language was approved by the House in October 2015. By establishing this board into law and laying out its responsibilities, Congress can ensure that this vital oversight will continue and that DHS will continue to show progress in its management of acquisitions. I urge passage of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt thanks to my distinguished colleague from California. While we might not agree on all that is appropriate within the purview of the Department, we do agree on being effective stewards of tax dollars, and I am grateful for his comments. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank my colleague from Virginia for bringing forth this most important accountability measure. This bill enhances the Department’s accountability and provides greater acquisition oversight to intercede before programs fail to meet important cost and schedule milestones. Given DHS’s limited budgetary resources and the importance of its mission, it is critical that DHS improves its management of major acquisition programs. Although the Department has made some progress in its major acquisition programs, DHS cannot afford to neglect the daytoday management of the agency and how it procures essential goods and services. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, wish to extend my thanks to my colleague from California. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to support this commonsense, bipartisan measure, H.R. 1282, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GARRETT ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1282, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish the Acquisition Review Board in the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 392 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1873. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1504 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1873) to amend the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to enhance the reliability of the electricity grid and 
reduce the threat of wildfires to and from electric transmission and distribution facilities on Federal lands by facilitating vegetation management on such lands, with Mr. WOMACK in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER ) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today marks the Committee on Natural Resources’ Subcommittee on Water, Power and Oceans’ first step in advancing an infrastructure agenda that aims to improve our Nation’s infrastructure and expedite the development of new infrastructure. As vice chairman of the subcommittee, chaired by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ), I have already seen a number of bills advance through the committee that, like the bill in front of us today, employ simple, pragmatic solutions to improve our Nation’s infrastructure and advance an alloftheabove energy and water strategy. The Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act, a bipartisan bill offered by my colleagues, Mr. LAMALFA  and Mr. SCHRADER , is about avoiding electricity blackouts, preventing forest fires, and promoting healthy habitat for wildlife on Federal lands. This bill represents a simple, pragmatic solution to an issue that is born out of a lack of communication and consistency within a Federal agency. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman CONAWAY for agreeing to help expedite consideration of this bill today. I commend my colleagues, Mr. LAMALFA from California and Mr. SCHRADER from Oregon, for bringing up this bipartisan, commonsense piece of legislation. I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES , Washington, DC, May 22, 2017. Hon. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY , Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN : On April 27, 2017, the Committee on Natural Resources ordered reported as amended H.R. 1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act, by a bipartisan roll call vote of 24 to 14. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Natural Resources, with an additional referral to the Committee on Agriculture. I ask that you allow the Committee on Agriculture to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Agriculture represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Natural Resources to memorialize our understanding. Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further opportunities to work with you this Congress. Sincerely, ROBBISHOP , Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Wildfires are a huge problem in our country. They are becoming more frequent and more intense, and they pose a growing threat to public safety and local economies. But, instead of taking steps to reduce wildfire threats, this bill tries to scare us into weakening environmental safeguards and giving away public land management to States and localities. I agree with the bill’s sponsor that overgrown vegetation and falling trees can spark forest fires. However, government data shows that this accounts for less than onethird of 1 percent of fires in the past 5 years. Why are we focusing on this minor problem when it is clear that real wildfire solutions require treating these fires like the disasters that they are under the law, and allowing the Forest Service to use its base budget for preventing wildfires, not just fighting them? Given what we have seen from Republicans in the Natural Resources Committee, the answer is simple: to chip away at the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA; shut expert Federal agencies and concerned citizens out of the land management process; and allow Big Business to profit at the expense of taxpayers and our public lands. The bill lets State and local electricity reliability standards trump public land management rules. There is not even any requirement that the standards are based on sound science or principles of risk assessment. If a county says it needs to clearcut a half mile into a national forest to protect power lines, this bill would allow it, and the Forest Service could only watch. Further, there is no prohibition on selling timber harvested during these operations. The bill also mandates the Forest Service and BLM use its NEPA categorical exclusion authority, even when vegetation management projects could cause environmental damage. This means that people who value public lands would be completely shut out from the management process. So much for transparency and public input. Adding insult to injury, the bill waives liability for companies that start forest fires or cause other damage. This is nonsense and shifts an incredible burden and risk onto American taxpayers. The bill also fails to deal with the root causes of our fire crisis, including the fact that the Forest Service cannot afford mitigation work to prevent wildfires because it spends half of its budget fighting them. I support legislation making wildfire disasters eligible for disaster assistance under the Stafford Act, and I know many of my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, do as well. I am disappointed that we are not passing a bill to do that today, and, instead, are here just pretending to do something about a very serious problem. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM ). Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in support of H.R. 1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act. In California, we know all too well the disastrous effects of wildfires. Reducing the threat of wildfires requires numerous proactive efforts, including the timely removal of fire hazards. My colleague, Mr. LAMALFA , has identified a solution to help improve fire hazard removal on Federal lands and prevent electrical blackouts. There are more than 18,000 miles of power lines on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land, and these transmission lines, running along electricity rightsofway, are critical to the power distribution in the West. The costs of operating and maintaining these transmission rightsofway are borne by utility companies, but approval for companies to remove the fire 
hazards comes from the Forest Service. Currently, it takes the Forest Service months to grant approval to remove a dead tree. H.R. 1873 addresses this issue by allowing utility companies to remove fire risks in a timely manner and ensuring we are being responsible stewards of our Federal lands. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. DENHAM. Additionally, the bill allows utility companies to engage in responsible vegetation management along these rightsofway, including language that I have added, which encourages the management practices for our pollinators, enhancing the habitat and forage for these pollinators, such as commercial and native bees that are so important to our trees and our community. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan bill. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, let me repeat: We are talking about caution and what is causing fires; and 0.03 percent of fires caused by transmission lines is the data that is available to us. I know facts sometimes don’t matter, but they should matter in something as important as this; and 0.03 percent is the cause by transmission lines of fires in the forest on public lands. We are generalizing the huge wildfires that we have seen to make a case for this bill when the case is about transmission lines, rightsofaway; and it is 0.03 percent as the root cause of those fires over 5 years. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ). Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding me time. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to commend my colleagues for this commonsense legislation. As a result of drought and the bark beetle, there are an estimated over 107 million dead trees in over 33 million acres of forests in California, and it is also throughout the West. Part of this is due to climate change, which is one of the most vexing challenges of our time. This unprecedented tree mortality has created serious fire risk of wildfires throughout the West. Today, in California, in the Central Valley, we have record temperatures of 109 degrees and 112 degrees. Obviously, that adds to the concern. One thing that can be done, though, to prevent wildfires is to manage and control the amount of vegetation, particularly in areas where we have increased fire risk. We just, bottom line, have to manage our forests a lot better than we are. We are putting way too much of our budget for managing our forests to putting out fires, and that must change. But an example of a location with higher fire risk is a utility corridor with exposed electrical lines that we have throughout the West in forested areas. In 2015, the Butte fire in northern California, which was the seventh most destructive in California’s history, was sparked by a tree that came into contact with a power line. This is easily prevented by removing those trees that could damage lines, reducing fire risk and the cost of repairs to the utility ratepayers, plus the people in the surrounding area, which these fires are devastating, and sometimes lives are lost as well as property. b1515 H.R. 1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act, if enacted, would create a process to expedite routine maintenance of vegetation along electric utilities in and near utility corridors and would help prevent future tragedies like the 2015 Butte fire in northern California that was devastating, once again. The bottom line is that we must do more, and we can. I concur that we should utilize the Stafford Act for forest fires, and that would free up more money to manage the forests. But that is a separate piece of legislation that, hopefully, we will get a chance to act on. This is a separate piece, and I urge support of this commonsense legislation, for my colleagues to do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ). Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1873, legislation sponsored by my colleagues from the Western Caucus, which improves the reliability of our electrical grid while, at the same time, protecting our Federal lands and forests from the ravages of wildfires. This bipartisan legislation is common sense, plain and simple. This bill allows electric coops to prune or remove a tree that would fall on a power line in an electricity corridor if left unmanaged. Maintaining healthy and wellmanaged rightsofway is important for many reasons, not the least of which are the safety of our communities and reliable electricity delivery. Now, if you knew that a tree was going to fall on a power line and potentially cause a massive blackout or spark a fire, you would probably want to cut it back or get rid of it, right? Of course you would. It is common sense. Unfortunately, inconsistent and unpredictable viewpoints between Federal land managers at the Departments of Interior and Agriculture have prevented coops from ensuring safety along the corridors, putting many at risk. Timely decisionmaking is crucial for these coops to protect the land, but for far too long, bureaucratic red tape has delayed the removal of hazardous trees for weeks and, in some cases, months. Too many times, coops have notified the proper Department of a dangerous situation only to have the request to remove a hazardous tree either denied or bogged down by unnecessary and duplicative reviews. Not only that, but when the very tree they reported inevitably falls on a power line and sparks a fire, the coop is left holding the bill for the damages. Mr. Chairman, this is absurd, and I am pleased that this legislation shifts liability for a fire started under those circumstances back to the party responsible for inaction. Rolling the dice on forest health is not just unwise, it is flat out irresponsible. I thank the gentlemen from California and Oregon for sponsoring this muchneeded legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. SCHRADER ). Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1873, the bipartisan Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act. I want to thank my colleague from California (Mr. LAMALFA ) for working with me on this important legislation that will bring muchneeded consistency and accountability throughout the Federal land management agencies. This bill is just common sense. Putting it quite simply, we are just helping our utilities better enhance safety and reliability of the grid and protecting against wildfires and blackouts. Contrary to what some folks have asserted, this is actually a bipartisan bill supported by quite a few Democrats. This bill is especially vital for most of those in the West, where much of our land is federally owned. Many of your utilities’ and coops’ service territory can be more than 50 percent federally managed. We have witnessed extreme variations and approaches not only between the Forest Service and the BLM, but within the management agency districts themselves. Jim Pena, out in Oregon: ‘‘There is little consistency from agency to agency, district to district, or even within the same offices.’’ This is the Forest Service talking. We read and listened to the specter of big companies coming in and clearcutting our Federal lands. I respectfully suggest that that is why we need these vegetative management plans. They are short, concise, deal with only the utility’s rightofway and the land adjacent to it that could cause problems. I wonder sometimes what the heck folks are talking about. We have heard complaints about absolving companies from liability. That is not true. What we are saying is, if the Secretary fails to allow the utility to manage the vegetation on Federal lands or adjacent rightofway in a way that is consistent with their approved vegetative 
management plan that they have worked out with them or if the hazard tree or tree is in imminent danger of contacting an electricity line, the utility will not be held liable for wildfire damage or loss. It does not absolve a utility from liability if they are negligent or act in a way that is inconsistent with their vegetative management plan. I give you a great example our colleague from Arizona talked about. In Oregon, a rural coop requested trimming some dangerous trees along the rightsofway by the Forest Service. The Forest Service denied the request. A tree fell on the power line, sparked a fire. The utility was held responsible for paying for that fire when they had actually brought the issue to them in the first place. That is ridiculous. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1873. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ). Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Chair, I also thank Mr. WEBSTER for managing this legislation for us here on the floor today. I appreciate it. I rise today as a sponsor in strong support, of course, of H.R. 1873. It is indeed a commonsense vegetation management bill that reduces forest fire danger possibilities and electricity blackouts, while cutting through the bureaucratic red tape in the process. I also want to thank my colleague Mr. SCHRADER from Oregon for his strong support in making this a true bipartisan effort for something that really should have no partisan roots at all. As we have heard several of my colleagues speak earlier in testimony on the floor here today, there are gross inconsistencies and impediments in the way the Forest Service and BLM manage transmission lines, particularly in the West, where many of these lines run through difficult terrain and dense forest. One electric utility in my district, the City of Redding Electric Utility, uses helicopters to engage in vegetation management along the rightsof way on Federal lands. Such remote and forested areas make it especially difficult to effectively manage an area so large and dense. Rapid agency response is needed to help electric utility requests to conduct routine and emergency vegetation maintenance along Federal rightsof way. It is absolutely essential to avoid wildfires and blackouts. Another benefit this bill brings to utility companies is muchneeded safeguards in instances where the Secretary fails to allow them to trim or remove a hazardous tree. There was an unfortunate incident in La Pine, Oregon, in which a rural electric utility company was unjustly billed for a $300,000 fire suppression bill when its request to remove a tree in imminent danger of falling on a transmission line was denied by the Forest Service. This bill would provide the electric utility companies the confidence and means to manage and maintain their own transmission lines from overgrown and unmanaged trees along rightsof way, something the Federal Government should already be doing in the first place. You see from the example here that electricity frequently is generated in rural parts of our country, and long, long transmission lines are needed to get to the urban parts of the country. So we are all in this: blackouts for the urban areas and, indeed, black skies in our rural areas where the forests are from unneeded wildfires. The Forest Service’s own document shows that, between 2012 and 2013, approximately 350 forest fires were caused by this interface of damaged trees, dying trees, falling trees falling into the different types of lines you would find in rural areas in order to move the power. These changes to status quo are long overdue. This bill is an answer to many of the problems electricity companies are having with the management of electricity rightsofway on Federal lands. Too many dying and dead trees have fallen unnecessarily on power lines, sparking devastating forest fires that could have been prevented had they had that ability to remove the tree in question. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. LAMALFA. By providing the utilities with the tools they need to ensure the reliability and the longevity of our national forests, we can bolster investment in energy infrastructure and enhance the lives of all Americans and do much better to preserve the habitat of these areas that we treasure. I urge swift passage of the bill today and favor in the Senate when it gets over there. Indeed, I thank my colleagues for helping this process along today. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. An example that supporters of this legislation use is from Oregon. It is from 1984. In the 33 years since then, I am aware of no example of a Federal agency refusing to allow a company to do vegetation management work and then holding the company liable for the damages. In fact, as the committee report for this bill states, the issue of land managers allowing access to rightsofway was largely resolved by language in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, stating: 
Federal agencies responsible for approving access to electric transmission and distribution facilities located on lands within the United States shall, in accordance with applicable law, expedite any Federal agency approvals that are necessary to allow owners and operators of such facilities to comply with any reliability standard approved by the Commission under section 215 of the Federal Power Act that pertains to vegetation management, service restorations, or any situation that imminently endangers the reliability or safety of the facilities. If the utility companies feel that BLM and the Forest Service are not complying with the law, they should seek resolution in the court. Instead, they are coming after a backdoor opportunity to affect our public lands. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ). Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, it really is amazing that the bureaucratic tangle that has been caused by our so called environmental laws has now reached the point that even dead trees on public lands that threaten to fall on power lines and cause major forest fires cannot be removed without permission from Federal bureaucrats. And then to add insult to insanity, when the bureaucracy denies or delays permission and a fire results, the cost of the fire is paid by the utility’s customers through higher household electricity bills. Mr. LAMALFA mentioned a situation in La Pine, Oregon, where the Midstate Electric Cooperative begged the Forest Service for permission to trim trees that were threatening their power lines, and they were refused. Well, sure enough, when one of those trees fell on a power line and started a fire, the utility’s customers were forced to pay the firefighting costs that resulted, a third of a million dollars. Carbon Power & Light warned the Forest Service of trees threatening their lines. The Forest Service required them first to conduct $1.6 million of environmental studies paid by the utility’s customers. If there had been a fire in the meantime, they would have had to pay those costs as well. Mr. LAMALFA ’s bill basically does two things: First, it exempts such projects from timeconsuming and costly environmental reviews. After all, there is nothing more devastating to the forest environment than a forest fire. Our environmental laws are now causing these fires. Second, when a Federal agency delays or denies permission for a utility to remove or trim hazard trees and they end up causing a fire, the liability is placed where it belongs: on the agency and its bureaucrats, not on the utility and its customers; and it gives utilities permission to remove imminent threats to power lines before they can cause a fire. Mr. Chair, you may have noticed, common sense is not exactly common to government. Let’s change that today by adopting this bill. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. At a hearing on similar legislation in the Natural Resources Committee last Congress, both the Forest Service and BLM testified in opposition and explained how they work with utility companies to address vegetation management issues. 
In addition to entering into voluntary vegetation management plans, the Forest Service testified that the agency’s 2013 vegetation management guide specifies for field staffs the procedures and practices that should be included in operation and maintenance plans for power lines. This guide states that, where vegetation conditions inside or outside the authorized rightof way pose an imminent threat to power line facilities, utility companies may remove those threats immediately, without prior approval from the Forest Service. For its part, BLM testified that, under the terms and conditions typically included in a rightofway grant, a utility company may conduct minor trimming, pruning, and weed management to maintain the rightofway of a facility after simply notifying BLM. The utility company can often obtain BLM approval for removal of hazardous trees through a streamlined process. For an emergency situation causing an imminent hazard, no BLM preapproval would be necessary. b1530 I understand that some of the companies believe they should be able to do whatever they want whenever they want, but the land does not belong to them. It belongs to the American people, and Federal agencies have a responsibility to all Americans to ensure that those lands are not abused. Again, facts do matter, and 0.03 percent of fires in public lands were caused by trees falling on transmission lines in the last 5 years—0.03 percent. So we continue to exaggerate the common sense behind the facts that I just laid out. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN ). Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in favor of H.R. 1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act, and I thank Mr. LAMALFA  for his leadership on this issue. I would also like to commend the nonpartisan support for this bill, and associate my remarks with the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. SCHRADER ). This bill is a commonsense piece of legislation that will reduce the risk of wildfires and improve the safety and reliability of our electrical grid. How will this bill accomplish these objectives? It is really quite simple. When we remove overgrown vegetation near our electric grid on Federal lands, we remove the fuel component of wildfires. By reducing the risk of wildfire, we reduce the risk of an interruption of our electrical grid. Mr. Chairman, this is so much just plain common sense that it baffles me that we are having to debate it on the floor of the House of Representatives, but I think it is an example of how misguided some of our land management agencies have become, and the need for broader reforms. This bill would streamline the Federal review process for removal of trees and vegetation that pose a risk to our power grid and promotes consistency among Federal agencies tasked with the decisions on removal. If we want to move toward better protection of our forests on Federal lands and the electrical grid that moves through these locations, it is obvious that we should pass H.R. 1873. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My colleague from California (Mr. COSTA ) brought up one of the real causes of wildfire, and that was climate change, the lack of mitigation, and the situation within the Forest Service budget in which half of the revenue dedicated to that department is used to suppress wildfires. This administration has denied the existence of climate change, scrubbed it from its vocabulary, from its science, from its study. If we are going to look at the causes of wildfires, if we are going to look at strategies and how we protect the urban and forest interface, if we are going to look at really addressing the subject, then the very salient point that Mr. COSTA brought up regarding climate change has to be part and parcel of the discussion. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP ), the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, management of the forests and forest fires is an important and significant topic, but it is not the issue that we are having here today. Climate change is an important significant topic, but it is not the issue that we are talking about today. We are talking about how you transfer power from point A, where it is produced, to point B, where people live, and make sure that you can continue to have that power flowing there because it impacts the quality of life. This is about how we improve our lives. That is the key issue. The examples have been given out here before of examples of where that has been interrupted simply because we failed to maintain transmission lines. A good example is down in New Mexico, where, once again, an ash tree—pun intended—actually fell on a forest, on the line, creating a 150,000acre fire; and then the company that actually owned the line and wanted to maintain it but was not allowed to by the Forest Service was given a $35 million bill. Unfortunately, the liability of that company was only $20 million, so you can understand the difficulty that company is in right now. That is the reality in which we are dealing, and we have to realize that this is a solution to that issue. It is about how we provide power to people. The only chance I had of meeting President Obama was when he came to Utah and visited Hill Air Force Base, and he was there to talk about solar power that is being used on Hill Air Force Base. Hill Air Force Base also has a great power source that comes from a neighboring trash dump, which provides steam and methane power that goes to the base itself. And I told the President, when he asked us questions about this, that it is very easy for Hill Air Force Base to have this power source because it is next door. But for most people, they live miles and miles away, and you have to have transmission lines that get the power from where it is produced to where they live, and often across Federal lands. To his credit, President Obama lit up and said: Yes, not only is that an important issue, but it is also an issue dealing with our entire grid structure that needs to be worked on; another issue that is not today’s discussion matter. And to his credit, his office did contact our office, our committee, and started helping us work on some issues. Even though they did not stay with us to the final conclusion of the bill, the bill we have before us today is the result of those discussions, the result of that effort. I try to emphasize how bipartisan this bill is; an effort to try and solve a real problem that helps real people with real circumstances that have caused problems in the past that need to be changed. That is what we are attempting to do here. So I applaud the committee that came up with this bill. I applaud the chief sponsor of that bill. I urge my colleagues to please support this. This is the right thing to do if you really care about helping people. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. You know, this legislation, with a few modifications, could help prevent the 0.03 percent of wildfires that are caused by electricity infrastructure, but the majority refused to work with us on those modifications. Most importantly, the failure to make vegetation management plans for utility rightsofway mandatory negates any positive impact this bill might have had. As we have heard from Forest Service and industry at a hearing on similar legislation last Congress, voluntary vegetation management is already allowed and is quite common. This includes the ability for rightsofway holders to access these areas and conduct vegetation management without notifying Federal land managers until after the fact. This is current law. The majority claims we need this bill to address delays caused by the approval of unplanned work and delays 
associated with removing dead trees on public lands outside of rightsofway. Without an upfront planning requirement, I can see authorizing limited activity for utility companies to do targeted vegetation management adjacent to rightsofway. But instead of offering the commonsense trade off, the bill before us today simply cuts Federal agencies out of the process of managing the American people’s land by requiring the Forest Service and BLM to approve plans with no option to modify or reject them if the plans are inadequate. So whatever the company turns in— the utility company turns in, that is the plan that will become the management plan for that vegetation, regardless of any opinion by Forest Service or BLM. Further, the bill does not define ‘‘adjacent,’’ meaning that companies could cut trees that are well outside the rightsofway on public lands. This makes public lands vulnerable to a level of abuse that no one who values them would be willing to support. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have no more speakers and I am prepared to close, so I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me just say that this legislation is a solution without a problem. And as I mentioned earlier several times, facts do matter. When we are doing a wholescale change of how we manage rightsof way on public lands because of 0.03 percent of the causation by utility lines of fires on public lands, that is a heavyhanded way to approach doing legislation. There have been opportunities and modifications, opportunities of expediting the process, but those were not allowed as part of this legislation. If we, indeed, are going to look at both the wildfire situation, the budget stress on Forest Service to suppress those fires, and this rightsofway issue, which is miniscule compared to the bigger issues, then I think this legislation has to be rejected, and work on a piece of legislation that has consensus, that is bipartisan, and that addresses the real problems with wildfires in this country, not this utility giveaway that we are doing here today. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chair, again, I commend the bill’s sponsors for bringing up this bipartisan, commonsense piece of legislation. I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 1873—the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act. North Carolina is home to four national forests that offer visitors and residents access to incredible scenery, wildlife, and a wide variety of recreational activities. In my district in Western North Carolina, American Forestry management has its roots in the Pisgah National Forest: The Cradle of Forestry, the very first forestry school in the country, is located there. Proper forestry management is a part of North Carolina’s history that we hope to pass on to for our future generations to come. I commend my colleagues, Reps. DOUG LAMALFA and K URT SCHRADER , for identifying a problem and for providing a commonsense solution to make vegetation management in national forests easier. Managing vegetation around power lines is important for ensuring electric grid reliability, and for keeping overgrown and falling trees from interfering with nearby power lines which can cause blackouts, wildfires, and other safety hazards. This bill would ensure utility companies, who are responsible for vegetation management near power lines on federal lands, are no longer delayed by bureaucratic red tape and inconsistent federal standards between agencies. With the passage of this bill, we will be a step closer to providing expedited forestry management plan approval, while also giving utility companies the authority to remove hazardous debris in emergency situations. Mr. Chair, I am pleased we are advancing a bipartisan proposal today—I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chair, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R.1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act. This important legislation is meant to proactively prevent major utility reliability problems before they happen. Currently, electric cooperatives in my district own transmission lines which cross lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to provide essential services to rural areas. I’ve heard from my electric coops that before addressing problems with these transmission lines, such as clearing downed trees or excess debris near utility poles, they must first be granted approval to do the work from these federal agencies. Any delay in receiving approval costs time, money, and amplifies the impacts of major power outages to my constituents. Currently, electric coops can be held responsible for damages if a tree falls on a power line and causes a fire, even if the coop is still awaiting approval to work on clearing the hazardous debris. H.R. 1873 will save utilities unnecessary costs and improve electricity reliability for consumers by streamlining outdated federal land management policies. The language minimizes the need for casebycase approvals and instead provides expedited review and approvals for routine vegetation management and maintenance activities. Cutting red tape will make it easier for electric utility companies to initiate preventative measures to manage vegetation and woody debris on rightofway transmission lines. This proactive work will mitigate the effects of fires and storms by clearing hazardous material before the natural disaster hits. Just two weeks ago, a major storm with winds up to seventy milesperhour blew through my district and left thousands of my constituents without power. The strong winds downed trees and took out power lines, severely damaged homes and businesses, and ripped the roofs off of barns. Lengthy power outages delay the repairs needed to get storm victims’ lives back on track. So I am eager to support legislation which helps my communities recover from these painful storms as fast as possible. Storms like these are commonplace in Minnesota. Our electric coops are ready to complete the work necessary to mitigate the effects of these disasters as much as possible so consumers can have better access to electricity, especially during natural disasters. Again, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to be here today in strong support of H.R. 1873, the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act. As we enter wildfire season, it is of the upmost importance that the federal government act to prevent these devastating disasters. The Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act strengthens electric grid reliability while reducing the risk of fires and fire hazards caused by poor vegetation management in power line rightsofway on federally managed public lands. Currently, bureaucratic permitting delays impede electric utility companies from effectively managing overgrowth near electric infrastructure, which puts these areas at greater risk for a fire event. This commonsense, widelysupported, legislation would require an expedited federal review process for trees that are dangerously close to power lines. The effective management of this unruly vegetation is especially important in my home state of California, where in 2016, an overwhelming 6,986 fires destroyed over 565,000 acres of land throughout the state. I thank my Colleague from California, Mr. LAMALFA, for his leadership on this legislation and I look forward to supporting the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act later today. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule.

AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . CARBAJAL  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part A of House Report 115–186. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 5, beginning on line 10, strike ‘‘the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture shall provide’’. Page 5, beginning on line 13, strike ‘‘with the option to’’ and insert ‘‘shall’’. Page 5, beginning on line 16, strike ‘‘plan, that at each transmission or distribution owner or operator’s discretion may cover some or all’’ and insert ‘‘plan covering all’’. Page 6, beginning on line 1, strike ‘‘The Secretaries shall not have the authority to modify those requirements.’’. Page 6, beginning on line 10, strike ‘‘and approval’’ and insert ‘‘, approval, denial, or modification’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 392, the gentleman from California (Mr. CARBAJAL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chairman, my amendment to H.R. 1873 ensures that we make upfront vegetation management planning a requirement for utilities that hold transmission rightsof way on public lands. I agree with Mr. LAMALFA ’s intent to address the threats of wildfires. Coming from local government, as the former county supervisor for Santa Barbara, I have experienced firsthand the obstacles and challenges of balancing red tape and coordination among stakeholders. Now, as the Representative for the Central Coast in California, I can tell you, we are no strangers to wildfires. Just last year, my district witnessed the devastating impacts of the Rey and Sherpa fires. Unfortunately, the impacts of these wildfires are widespread. The Sherpa fire burned 7,474 acres in Santa Barbara County and the Los Padres National Forest for nearly a month last June. Then in January of this year, the heavy rains in the area triggered mudslides and flooding. If we can take action to prevent wildfires, we should. We know it pays to be prepared. Congress needs to act to improve better coordination and clarity between Federal and land managers and utility companies that hold rightsofway on public lands. In improving coordination, we can help utilities prevent fires due to overgrown vegetation or trees contacting power lines. In turn, it would help the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management respond more quickly and consistently for requests to access and maintain rightsofway on public lands. At the same time, the agencies can function as good stewards of our natural resources while enhancing their effectiveness in addressing fire hazard vegetation. While wellintentioned, H.R. 1873 does not solve the problem of poor coordination. Mr. Chairman, the underlying bill does not address the threats of wildfires because the rightsofway maintenance plans described in the legislation are voluntary. Currently, owners of transmission lines can work with the Federal land managers to develop these plans. This is no different than the status quo. That is why I introduced my amendment to ensure that we make upfront planning a requirement for utilities. b1545 I urge passage of my amendment to make sure that we are prepared and minimize the threats of wildfires. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chair, the goal of H.R. 1873 is to provide certainty to utilities, their line workers, and their consumers, not forcing unnecessary, onesizefitsall regulations. Each plan can be tailored by an individual utility based on the service territory, region, and other characteristics. Some utilities may not choose to submit plans because they are satisfied with their local Forest Service office. Others, especially those who have rightsofways that predate the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, may not want to trigger Federal paperwork costs that are ultimately passed on to their consumers. This amendment, if adopted, would significantly burden Federal Land Management agencies by inundating them with all kinds of submittals. Additionally, if you want to increase the cost of this bill, then this amendment will do just that. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I would inject additional bureaucracy into the bill that is unintended to do exactly the opposite of what this bill intended to do. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chair, unfortunately, this bill is in search of a problem. Voluntary is the status quo. That is the case today, and we see the wildfires happen day in and day out. So, again, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. CARBAJAL ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MS . SINEMA  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part A of House Report 115–186. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 392, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. SINEMA ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman BISHOP and Ranking Member GRIJALVA for their leadership. I also thank Congressman LAMALFA , Congressman SCHRADER , and all of the other Members for their hard work on this issue. In particular, I thank Congressman GOSAR , who is here today, Congressman TIPTON , and Congressman O’HALLERAN for cosponsoring our bipartisan amendment. Mr. Chairman, the Sinema amendment ensures the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior are educated on how unmanned technologies are transforming the energy industry to improve maintenance, lower costs, and reduce the risk of wildfires. Unmanned technology is changing the way Arizonans do business. Currently, energy companies use manned helicopters to check transmission lines and direct repair and maintenance crews. This work ensures Arizona’s electric grid remains resilient, reliable, efficient, and that it 
works when Arizona families and businesses need it. But utilities and cooperatives believe that unmanned technology can improve the way we manage our energy infrastructure. Unmanned technologies can monitor transmission lines quickly and safely in multiple locations, enabling more efficient operations and maintenance. They provide better situational awareness to crews and managers, reducing accidents and workplace injuries. It also improves vegetation management, disaster prevention, and disaster response. These are critical issues in my home State of Arizona. In rural areas, our transmission and distribution lines run through Federal land that are prone to wildfires. I am a cosponsor of the underlying bill because I recognize the importance of keeping these rightsofway clear of dry brush and fallen trees. Streamlining the process that allows us to perform routine maintenance and prevent wildfires that too often endanger our communities is just commonsense. Our bipartisan amendment improves the underlying bill by ensuring that unmanned technologies integrate appropriately, quickly, and effectively into broader vegetation management, disaster prevention, and disaster response strategies. Unmanned technologies have the potential to improve efficiency, lower energy costs for Arizona families and businesses, and reduce the risk of dangerous wildfires by ensuring that rightsofway are reliable and properly maintained. Federal agencies should be prepared to embrace these smart technologies. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Sinema amendment and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman? There was no objection. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this amendment to H.R. 1873. This bipartisan amendment would ensure that personnel involved in vegetation management decisions understand the benefit that unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, or drones, can add to the maintenance and management of transmission lines. In 2017, not only does this policy make sense, it is essential. Our electric grid and forests should be protected with this effective and costefficient technology, which has proven its worth in so many other areas, including national defense and private industry. In my home State of Arizona, UAVs have proven to be highly valuable tools in forest management. Utilizing UAV expertise from EmbryRiddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona, as well as Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, land managers have greatly improved their ability to monitor forest conditions both at scale and down to the detail of individual trees and branches. Proper vegetation management around transmission lines is essential to preventing power outages and dangerous forest fires. UAV technology makes transmission line monitoring safer, cheaper, and more effective. As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to our constituents to pursue smarter, safer, and cheaper approaches to public policy and resource management. This amendment and this bill allow us to do so in a bipartisan way. I am proud to partner with the gentlewoman from Arizona on this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to extend my thanks to my friend and colleague, Mr. GOSAR from Arizona. I encourage my fellow Members to support the amendment and the underlying bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. SINEMA ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . BEYER  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part A of House Report 115–186. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to the bill. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of the bill, insert the following: 
Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act shall detract from the availability of funds or other resources for wildfire suppression. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 392, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I believe the bill before us today is a wellintentioned attempt to create a process which would minimize the risk of fire along electrical utilities’ rightsof way. Yes, there are some problems with the bill, but my most significant objection is that this bill, our Natural Resources Committee, and this Congress refuse to act on the urgent need to address how our U.S. Forest Service deals with wildfires. The Forest Service burned through more than half of its budget last year fighting wildfires. Yet our leadership won’t bring to the floor for a vote a bipartisan legislation that deals with the problem of ‘‘fire borrowing.’’ In the 114th Congress, just such a bill, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act had 151 cosponsors—67 Republicans, 84 Democrats—but it never even got a committee hearing. So that is disappointing, and even irresponsible. So, once again, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are going to go into this fire season knowing that they don’t have the resources to do the work necessary to mitigate wildfire damage on U.S. public lands. In a recent report on fire suppression costs, the Forest Service reported that funding available for recreation, heritage, and wilderness had fallen 15 percent; funding for roads is down 46 percent; facility spending, off 68 percent; deferred maintenance outlays have been slashed by a disastrous 95 percent. Mr. Chairman, in my two terms on the Natural Resources Committee, we often debate and fret about how little money is available for maintenance of our public lands, the deferred maintenance. The diversion of these funds for wildfire suppression is among the many causes. Nonfirerelated staff has been cut by 39 percent since 1998, and over the last two decades, the cost of fire preparedness and suppression activities has grown from 62 percent of the Forest Service’s total budget, to more than half—52 percent. That shift has come at the expense of programs and staff that every American wants: staff on recreation, permits, timber sales, hunting, and fishing. Everything else is suffering because of our inability to deal in a constructive way with wildfire mitigation. So now is the time that we address wildfires to be treated as the major disasters they are and for the efforts to put them out, to be eligible for disaster assistance, and not subtract it from funds that land managers need to do their daily jobs. So my very simple onesentence amendment simply says that no money in this bill—this bill will not divert legitimate wildfire mitigation money more to wildfires than is already there. I urge you to vote ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment so, at the very least, we can prevent this bill from detracting from further Federal wildfire suppression efforts. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment, but I am not opposed to it. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, the amendment prohibits any loss of funds for wildfire suppression activities. The bill also provides electric utilities with the certainty that they need to ensure that downed trees do not fall on power lines, which would prevent many of these wildfires from starting in the first place. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I want to thank my friend from Florida for his support for this sensible amendment, and I hope that we can proceed. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ). The amendment was agreed to.

BOYLE of Pennsylvania, O’HALLERAN, KIND, and SCHNEIDER changed their vote from ‘‘aye’’ to no.’’ Messrs. CARSON of Indiana, LIPINSKI, Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas, Mr. DOGGETT, Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ, and Mr. GARAMENDI changed their vote from ‘‘no’’ to ‘‘aye.’’ So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The CHAIR. The question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. DONOVAN ) having assumed the chair, Mr. WOMACK , Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1873) to amend the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to enhance the reliability of the electricity grid and reduce the threat of wildfires to and from electric transmission and distribution facilities on Federal lands by facilitating vegetation management on such lands, and, pursuant to House Resolution 392, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. (By unanimous consent, Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ was allowed to speak out of order.) 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you with your congressional women’s softball team, who are tanned, rested, and ready to beat the press tonight. Our bipartisan team has been practicing for the last 3 months at 7 in the morning, two to three mornings a week, with batting practice at night at the cages at the Nationals training academy. We have been singularly focused on two things—I know it doesn’t make sense, because that would mean it wasn’t singularly—making sure that we can continue to raise awareness about the risk that young women face of breast cancer and to make sure that we can shine a spotlight on the fact that young women can and do get breast cancer. This is our ninth annual game. It is the eighth time that we are playing the common ‘‘enemy’’—we say that affectionately—the female Capitol press corps. They have been incredible partners in helping this year cross the incredible milestone of raising more than $1 million for the Young Survival Coalition. We are so proud of that. We want to thank our coaches who have been remarkable through all these years. Of course, we have our head coach, Torie Barnes, Jo Ann Emerson’s daughter, who was the cofounder of this game 9 years ago; our own House favorite, Natalie Buchanan, who is an amazing new mom who has 
been out there with us, in spite of just having a baby a few short months ago; Coach Jim, who has been amazing as well; and, of course, our very own colleague, Coach EDPERLMUTTER from the great State of Colorado. Come on out tonight at 7 p.m. at Watkins Recreation Center, 420 12th Street, SE. Turn right at the CVS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY), my cocaptain, friend, and fellow appropriator. Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I think everyone would agree with me when I say that, in the midst of the tragedy and horror last week, there are also special moments that brought us together and reminded us of what is really important. One was right here in this Chamber, where we heard touching speeches from PAUL RYAN and Leader P ELOSI ; another was at the baseball game when the entire Capitol Hill community gathered in an amazing show of support for our friend, STEVE SCALISE , our Capitol Police officers and their heroic acts; as well as Matt, Zack, David, and Crystal; and all of those who were involved. That spirit of unity and togetherness is a big part of why we play this softball game. Our relationships as Members of Congress are stronger because of this game. I don’t think we can have too many reminders about the importance of unity and friendship. I encourage all Members and staff to come join us tonight and go to bat for this great cause. Unlike the baseball game, Republicans and Democrats don’t compete against each other. We team up against one opponent we can all agree on: the press. So, beat cancer, beat the press. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5minute vote. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—ayes 300, noes 118, not voting 13, as follows: [Roll No. 315] AYES—300

b1639 Messrs. KEATING and PALLONE changed their vote from ‘‘aye’’ to ‘‘no.’’ So the bill was passed. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I was absent during rollcall votes No. 314 and 315 due to my spouse’s health situation in California. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on the Carbajal Amendment. I would also have voted ‘‘nay’’ on H.R. 1873—Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act. 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I was not present today, June 21, for rollcall votes. I was attending a memorial service in my district. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 311, ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 312, ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 313, ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 314, and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 315. 
MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT Messages in writing from the President of the United States were communicated to the House by Ms. Mariel Ridgway, one of his secretaries. 
REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2842, ACCELERATING INDIVIDUALS INTO THE WORKFORCE ACT, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES Mr. COLE, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–187) on the resolution (H. Res. 396) providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 2842) to provide for the conduct of demonstration projects to test the effectiveness of subsidized employment for TANF recipients, and providing for consideration of motions to suspend the rules, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. 
CELEBRATING THE REMARKABLE CAREER OF TINA HERRING (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the remarkable career of Ms. Tina Herring, who retired as branch manager with the Georgia Department of Veterans Services on Thursday, June 1, 2017. During her childhood, Ms. Herring often moved with her father, a Pearl Harbor survivor who frequently traveled on Air Force assignments. This instilled an appreciation for our Nation’s Armed Forces. She began her career with the Department of Veterans Services in 1985 as a benefits caseworker. In this position, she worked to ensure that Georgia’s servicemen and women received the crucial resources and benefits which they and their families deserve. Ms. Herring was promoted to oversee multiple southeast branches of the Georgia Veterans Services Department in 2009 because of her exceptional dedication to Georgia’s veterans and her 25 years of hard work. Ms. Herring, thank you for your extraordinary effort in honoring our servicemen and women. You have managed southeast Georgia’s Veterans Department with exceptional precision. I wish you the best of luck in all your future endeavors. 
THE NRA AND PHILANDO CASTILE (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask a simple question: Who is the National Rifle Association here to protect? I ask this question because Philando Castile, exercising his constitutionally protected right to bear arms, was shot dead in front of his girlfriend and his young daughter. At that time the NRA claimed that they were awaiting ‘‘more facts.’’ A year later, the investigation is over and the trial is complete. The facts are clear. Philando’s killer remains free, but, Mr. Speaker, I and many Americans across this Nation remain confused and dissatisfied. Mr. Speaker, dashcam video released yesterday confirmed that Second Amendment protections simply do not apply to Black, lawabiding, concealed carry permitholding, compliant Philando Castile. And still the NRA has had nothing to say. Mr. Speaker, I ask again: If the NRA isn’t here to protect lawabiding gun owners like Philando Castile, then just who are they here to protect? f 
b1645 STOPPING THE SCOURGE OF SEX TRAFFICKING (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 15 yearold Bianca struggled with insecurities and depression, so she turned to social media for comfort and companionship. She met a person named Ariel, to her later displeasure, but after he brought her to a seedy motel room and forced her to watch as he raped two other girls, she knew she had walked right into the bonds of sex slavery. Held captive, he put up advertisements about her on the notorious backpage.com, selling her to dozens of men a day. After 2 years of this hell, Bianca finally escaped, bolting from the motel room, and found safety, finding a police officer. Four days later, her trafficker was arrested and thrown behind bars. Unlike Bianca, many victims don’t escape this trafficking. That is why Senator JOHNCORNYN and I have introduced the Abolish Human Trafficking Act that increases funding for law enforcement to find and arrest traffickers like Ariel and helps restore and rescue victims. We must use every tool in our resources we can find to help stop the scourge of human trafficking. And that is just the way it is. 
HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE FAILING TO DO THEIR JOBS (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, perhaps it is not surprising that the House Republicans haven’t put forward a budget, despite passing their deadline more than 2 months ago. It has been nearly 800 days since the House Republicans agreed to a budget. Hattip to the Huffington Post’s Matt Fuller for that fun fact. What we are seeing is an ongoing inability of House Republicans to do their job. Republicans have introduced no jobs bill, given no indication whether they will lift the debt ceiling to avoid default, and offered no responsible spending legislation. Mr. Speaker, this is dysfunction at its worst. The American people sent us here to deliver results on jobs, on healthcare, on security. I urge my Republican colleagues to take that responsibility seriously and to work with Democrats to achieve progress. I know we can. f 
CONGRATULATING AYESHA AHSAN (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ayesha Ahsan, a resident of Arizona’s Fifth Congressional District, who has earned a significant achievement: the Congressional Award Gold Medal. Ayesha has completed 400 hours of voluntary public service, 200 hours each of personal development and physical fitness, and a 5day, 4night expedition. She is one of five Arizonans and only 373 Americans to win this prestigious award in 2017. Ayesha volunteered at her local hospital in outpatient services, where she was responsible for registering patients who needed vital tests. For her personal development requirement, Ms. Ahsan participated in weekly study groups with her friends to prepare for the SAT exam; and for physical fitness, she worked out at the local gym. For her expedition, she traveled to Sedona, Arizona, where she enjoyed hiking and exploration of that town. Congratulations to Ayesha on these achievements. By completing the benchmarks for this award, Ayesha has learned perseverance and diligence, traits that will last her a lifetime. I thank her for her example and service to our community, and I wish her well with her future endeavors. 
COMMEMORATING 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF SPENCERTOWN FIRE COMPANY (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the Spencertown Fire Company, which is celebrating 100 years of service to our communities in Columbia County, New York. Twentyfour hours a day, 365 days a year for the past century, this fire company has served with pride and courage. I express my gratitude for the past and present volunteers of this organization, who have made great sacrifices and performed heroic acts to protect their neighbors. Today, 35 individuals make up the team at Spencertown Fire Company. Twothirds of this group are active, highly skilled volunteer firemen. Their commitment to Spencertown and its neighboring communities does 
not stop at fire safety. Each year, since 1985, they have awarded a $1,000 scholarship to a collegebound senior, chosen from within their service area. I thank Spencertown Fire Company’s President Alan Silvernale, Austerlitz Fire Chief Eric Pilkington, and the entire Spencertown Fire Company, which, in the great tradition of New York fire companies, continues to raise the standard in ensuring and furthering the wellbeing of our local communities. 
SURVIVORS OF BUS ACCIDENT IN TANZANIA AIDED BY SIOUXLAND TANZANIA EDUCATIONAL MEDICAL MINISTRIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to be recognized to address you here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives, this great deliberative body that we have and are, and this deliberative body that brings this Nation together to discuss our troubles, to discuss our triumphs, and sometimes intensively debate our disagreements here on the floor and in committee. We have seen a fair amount of that disagreement around the country. There are a few things we see that brings this country together, and we join together in these efforts when we can be Americans, and reach out with the hand of the American heart and spirit and help others when they are in sometimes dire need and dire difficulty. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this afternoon to discuss one of these circumstances where Americans joined together and reached out their hands— not only of friendship but physically reached out their hands—to deliver the kind of medical care that saved three lives from a terrible accident that took place in Tanzania. This terrible accident in Tanzania was worldwide news. There were 39 people on a bus in Tanzania, and all but three were students, children, 12 to 13 years old. There were two teachers and a bus driver on the bus. From the reports that I got, the bus was going too fast. It went around a curve and reached the peak of a bump in the road, a rise in the road. The bus went airborne off the road into a ravine, and it crashed nose down in the same fashion that a plane might crash into the Earth. Of the 39 people on the bus, 36 of them children, there were only three survivors. These three survivors were in the back of the bus, and all others in the front were thrown to the front, where the engine and the front part of the bus, all the way back to behind the driver, was jammed into the fuselage, I might call it, of the bus itself. And as that was jammed backwards, they were all thrown into that. The three survivors were in the back, and the violence to them was cushioned, to a degree, by those who had perished in front of them. Everyone else was essentially instantly killed, and these three children by the name of Wilson and Sadia and Doreen were survivors. The bus was crushed together like a tin can. Three vehicles behind the bus were some missionary workers who are associated with STEMM, the Siouxland Tanzania Educational Medical Ministries, which was formed in Sioux City, Iowa, and it was formed by the inspiration of a long chain of, I will say, the Hand of Providence that arranges people together. They were there in Tanzania, following the bus three vehicles behind. Mr. Speaker, the situation there was that, as they saw the bus go off the road and crash, the bus crashed down off into the ravine; they stopped. The three of them were trained medical personnel named Kevin Nygard and Jennifer Milby and Amanda Volkers. I believe there are also a couple that I don’t happen to have their names in 
front of me this evening, and I don’t want to leave them out, Mr. Speaker, but they raced down the bank to the ravine where the bus had crashed nose down. They knew it was a terrible accident. I don’t think they could have imagined how bad and how terrible it was, but the only way to get in that bus was through the windows in the sides, schoolbustype windows, as we know. Most all of us are familiar with those, Mr. Speaker. So they climbed into that bus and began to look for survivors and to try to pull the survivors out and then the bodies of those who didn’t survive, and they worked frantically there with other volunteers, also, who happened to come along to the scene. They were able to remove the three survivors that I had mentioned, Wilson and Sadia and Doreen, and lay them out on the bank. They were all medically trained, and so they were applying first aid. These three kids, these three students, 12 to 13 years old, two girls and a boy, were then transported by ambulance into the city in Tanzania. Now, I didn’t know that this had happened, even though it was international news, but I was on an international trip as well into the Balkans. I happened to be in Bosnia at the moment in Sarajevo. I received a phone call from Dr. Steve Meyer. Steve Meyer is the founder of STEMM, the Siouxland Tanzania Educational Medical Ministries. b1700 His heart has gone out to Tanzania nearly 20 years ago. He spends about half of each year there doing missionary work and providing and conducting orthopaedic surgery because he is an orthopaedic surgeon. He has taught them how to farm. He is drilling wells for irrigation. He also is running an educational system there that, at least the last report I had, it was the largest nonpublic school in Tanzania. This is all done by the drive and the inspiration and the heart of Dr. Steve Meyer and his wife, Dana. And so the people that work with him had contributed to the survival of the three students that they had helped pulled out of that bus. Yet I received a call from Steve Meyer. I was with the charge d’affaires in Sarajevo, Bosnia, and I stepped out of that reception to take a cell phone call. When I pick up my phone and it says, ‘‘Steve Meyer,’’ I know I better answer the call. He is a friend. He is a pheasant hunting buddy. I guess he is a neighbor in the neighborhood, not technically a constituent, but we are brothers by faith, by head, by heart, and I know the level of conviction that Steve Meyer has. So I took his call when I stepped out of the reception, and he said: ‘‘You have already seen this on the news. I need your help. There are three students that will . . .’’ He said: ‘‘One, probably two, of them will not survive if we cannot get them out of Tanzania. The third one likely will be handicapped for life, but is more likely to survive.’’ I know that he does orthopaedic surgery in Tanzania, and I said: ‘‘Can’t you help them there? Can’t you fix them there?’’ And he said: ‘‘No, I can’t. We don’t have the equipment in Tanzania. We are not going to be able to save them unless we can get them out of Tanzania, get them back to Sioux City, where we can provide all the best medical care and perform the surgery necessary to put their bodies back together.’’ And that was his medical prognosis. Now, I know from previous times that I have been around Steve Meyer, the level of conviction that he has and, of course, the depth of his heart. So I said: ‘‘I think I know what you need from me.’’ And he said: ‘‘Yes, their parents need to go along, too; and we want to send along a doctor and a nurse. I have only got just a little bit of time, and I am going to have to leave Tanzania, but we need to get them out of here while they are still alive.’’ So my job was to accelerate the visas, acquisition of visas for the three patients, the kid patients, for each one of their mothers, and for the doctor and for the nurse that needed to accompany them back to the United States, and to promote and accelerate the issuance of passports, which nobody had that needed to travel here either, and that would be a function of the Tanzanian Government and a function of something that we might be able to encourage. So that was the easy part. It doesn’t sound easy, Mr. Speaker, but it was the easy part compared to the second part of the assignment Dr. Meyer gave me. And he said: ‘‘I need a medevac plane, and we are going to have to fly them out of Tanzania in a medevac plane. I have got everything set up in Sioux City. It is at Mercy Hospital. All of us are going to donate our time, our medical care, the devices that will be used to do the reconstructive surgery. All of that is going to be provided. It is going to be at no cost, but we need to get them there and get them there fast.’’ So this is a high emergency. I hung up the phone and I began to make phone calls. And the fortunate thing was I was leaving Bosnia shortly to go to Macedonia. Well, I would employ the staff at the Bosnian Embassy—the U.S. Embassy in Bosnia to pull some phone numbers together for me and start the outreach on this and to accelerate the effort to get the visas, promote the passports, and get the medevac plane. I want to thank the people there at the U.S. Embassy in Bosnia for their work and their cooperation. I shortly arrived in Macedonia, where now I had a whole new embassy team to put to work; and they did. They pulled together phone numbers and made connections for me, too. I spoke—I believe it was from Macedonia—to the Tanzanian Embassy— the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania. I want to thank Anthony Pagliai. Anthony Pagliai is the officer who issued the visas, and he was Johnnyonthe spot. He couldn’t have moved any more quickly or with any more conviction once I convinced him that this was for real. And it was interesting how that happened, Mr. Speaker, that the—you know, when a congressman calls a staff person in an embassy in Tanzania, he doesn’t have any way of knowing that it actually is a Member of Congress, for one thing, and what is the level of urgency and credibility of that call. But I told him I can vouch for Dr. Steve Meyer and I have known him for a long time, I know the level of his credibility and his conviction, his heart. I have spoken to that, Mr. Speaker. I relayed that to Anthony Pagliai, and it seemed that the message wasn’t clearly resonating because he didn’t know of Dr. Steve Meyer. So I said to him that Steve Meyer is also working with Lazaro Nyalandu. Lazaro Nyalandu is an individual who ran for Prime Minister in Tanzania in the last election cycle—didn’t win, but a fairly high name recognition within Tanzania. And when I gave Lazaro’s name—you heard me hesitate already, Mr. Speaker. I have always had trouble remembering his name, but it is Nyalandu. And I hesitated on his name, but I said: ‘‘Lazaro, the Prime Minister candidate in Tanzania, is working with Dr. Meyer, and I can vouch for Dr. Meyer. I know Lazaro, and I know, if the two of them are working together, this is a credible endeavor, and you should help them in any way that you can.’’ And he finished up and he gave me Lazaro’s last name. He volunteered it: Nyalandu. He said: ‘‘We know him. He was the only candidate for Prime Minister that actually answered our phone calls.’’ So I knew that he had a good relationship with the U.S. Embassy and that they had all of the incentive to move forward to expedite the visas. And I asked Anthony: ‘‘Find me also a medevac plane.’’ Well, that was a very big request for somebody that is in the business of issuing visas for travel. And he said he would go to work on that, but I knew it was very difficult. So with the confidence that the visas would be moved expeditiously and that the encouragement to deliver the passports would be supported out of the U.S. Embassy, I moved on to begin looking for a medevac plane while the course of his lifesaving techniques were going on in the hospital in Tanzania, trying to save the lives of these three badly broken bodies. Mr. Speaker, as I move then from Macedonia to Albania, I have been continually making phone calls trying to find a medevac plane. I talked to the 
1⁄2weeks ago, but the accident took place May 6. So within a couple of weeks of the accident, they had finished the surgery of our three victims here. Mr. Speaker, I will say, among these three, there were five broken arms and at least, I believe, three broken legs. There were two fractured spines. There were 17 broken bones altogether. There was a broken jaw over here in Doreen. And this is a fractured spine in her neck. And this is Sadia. And Wilson had a fractured femur. And when you add this all up, it would have been—I guess I better not necessarily point out which one, but both of these girls were at great risk of death in Tanzania and likely would not have made it. Wilson here in the middle likely would have survived, but he had a fractured femur where, in Tanzania, would have required that they amputate his leg at the hip. And now, as of a week ago Saturday, I went up to the Sioux City Bandits’ football game—indoor football—and they were cocaptains for the team, for the playoff game that took place that Saturday night. They wheeled all three of them out to the middle of the field for the coin toss. And after that, they came back, and we had a little stage on the end where we watched the game from the stage. And they look a little fresher and more alert that night than they do in these pictures, Mr. Speaker, but they are now happy. Their parents are delighted and very grateful. This is Dr. Steve Meyer here in the picture, and I just can’t say enough about a man who inspires everyone around him and makes things happen by force of will and faith that would not and, we would think, could not happen otherwise. And then of the patients here, Wilson is the one that cracks me up the most. On that Saturday night, this young fellow who would have, by now, lost his leg up at the hip, I leaned down and I said to him: ‘‘Wilson, is what I heard about you yesterday true?’’ And he looked at me and smiled a little bit, and said: ‘‘Well, what?’’ And I said: ‘‘Did you really kick a ball yesterday? Did you stand up and kick a ball?’’ And he got this grin on his face and said: ‘‘Yes.’’ So that is how far this has come. This is a happy result, Mr. Speaker, and I wanted to also show the picture. Here is Wilson and his mother. I will give you an example. He has got this ready smile. He is not the only one of the crew with a ready smile, but he has got a great ready smile. And part of it is he had got a big wound in his head that you don’t see in the picture, too, but it doesn’t suppress the grin on his face. And we did a little press conference there. It was the first time he had been out of a hospital room. The only thing he had seen in America was the inside of a hospital room, and then wheeled down the hallway to the reception area of the hospital. And he is there with the two girls in their wheelchairs. That was also taken the same day. b1715 And the press asked him: ‘‘What is it you like best about America?’’ Well, the only thing he had seen of America was the inside of the hospital, and he smiled and he said: ‘‘Everything.’’ And they asked him: ‘‘What is your favorite food here?’’ And he said: ‘‘Everything.’’ And they asked him only one more question: ‘‘Is there anything else you would like to say, Wilson?’’ And he said: ‘‘Thank you.’’ And that is something that the parents have been saying ever since, the three mothers that are here and the doctor and the nurse that are here also to take care of them. They are now out of the hospital. They are at Ronald McDonald House there in Sioux City. They have been taking them out on occasion to get some fresh air and see what normal life is in our part of the country. And you can just see the heart, and Steve Meyer here in this poster. I would be remiss if I didn’t have this poster up also tonight, Mr. Speaker. This is Samaritan’s Purse. This is the DC–8 that Reverend Franklin Graham dispatched to fly our three patients out of Tanzania and into Sioux City, Iowa. These are the people that have gathered at the departure wondering if they are ever going to see these three Tanzanian kids again. Many of these people would be people that were at the state funeral for the 36 who were killed in that bus accident. Tens of thousands came to the stadium as those 36 caskets were all lined up side by side, and 
the nation went into mourning in Tanzania because of that terrible loss that they had and the tragedy that was there, that was commemorated by the attendance of tens of thousands. Probably over 100,000 Tanzanians came to their soccer stadium for that huge funeral that they had. And now some of them come to the airstrip to see these three survivors, these miracle kids from Tanzania be flown off to the United States. I can only imagine what it is like in their mind’s eye, what they imagine is happening with their three children that have been flown over here to the United States. And the father of one of these patients said to Dr. Meyer: ‘‘Why? Why? Why?’’ And Dr. Meyer said: ‘‘Well, what do you mean ‘why?’’’ ‘‘Why do you do this? Why are you willing to do this for our children?’’ And his answer is: ‘‘We are Christians and we are Americans. That’s why.’’ And so it is the head and the heart of our country, our people. It does come to us to reach out and lift others up and help them. We can’t help them all. We can’t save them all. But every once in a while, there is a cry out and a need for a chain of individual miracles linked together. Without a connection, by the way, between Steve Meyer and Lazaro, who met years ago when Lazaro was going to college in Iowa, Lazaro Nyalandu— as he went to college in Iowa, he was brought together by Steve Meyer’s pastor and then Steve Meyer, and they got to know each other and they became friends. And because of that relationship, Steve Meyer went to Tanzania and became one of the lead people on mission to Tanzania. If it hadn’t been for that, he never would have formed STEMM. The Siouxland Tanzania Educational Medical Ministry would have never been formed had it not been for that connection more than 20 years ago. And if it had never been formed, the workers wouldn’t have been behind the bus when it went off the road, and, likely, everybody would have perished in that bus rather than all but three. If they hadn’t been behind the bus, we would have not heard about the injuries that they had and wouldn’t have had the connection to fly them back to the United States. I don’t know Lazaro myself. I don’t have that to use to convince Anthony Pagiliai that this is a credible act. Now, he might have done it anyway. His head and his heart sounds good to me, too, but it helped to have that series of networks already built. I bring this up, Mr. Speaker, because I want people to know, the people that are listening here, and especially young people as they form and shape their lives, that networking is worth a lot. You can be the smartest person in the world with the best intentions in the world, but if you don’t have relationships with people so that you can communicate, that you can share ideas, that you can connect and team up on projects, then you can’t get a lot done. The smartest person in the world in a phone book hasn’t had much effect on our society. But people with good convictions and good relationships and positive attitudes and a good heart can get a lot done that is good if they are connected with the right people. So I just encourage, especially, young people: Go out there and build those networks. Build them while you are young. Build them while you are in school, when you are in K–12, when you are in college, when you are after college, when you are building those networks of young people that are going into the profession together. And understand that 40 years later you are still going to have friends that you can call on to produce a good and positive result if you build those relationships and those networks, not be reclusive. Push yourself out there and build friendships with people. And that multiplied itself over and over again. By the way, I am grateful that Franklin Graham took my call and I carried enough credibility that that actually worked that way, too. That is another piece of networking. But I can’t thank Revered Franklin Graham enough. I remember sitting in my living room watching a blackandwhite TV while Billy Graham was preaching and calling for an altar call, and that is a little bit of how we grew up in our family, clear back then when TVs were black andwhite. And now, his son, Reverend Franklin Graham, took a phone call from me from Albania that resulted in a DC–8 being dispatched to fly these three patients out of Tanzania to Sioux City, Iowa, where they received surgery that repaired 17 broken bones and, by the way, with all of the medical devices donated by the company that produced them as well. When I look at this, Doreen was paralyzed, particularly in her right leg, and there was no confidence as to whether she would ever be able to have any feeling in that leg or ever be able to walk again. Today she has feeling in that leg. She has some movement in that leg, and my level of confidence that she will walk again is pretty high right now. All the other prayers have been answered; why not this one? I think the day comes when these three arrive back in Tanzania, and I will predict the date. I think it will be the 18th or 19th of August that they will be flown back to Tanzania, and I believe that these three patients, with their mothers with them, will walk down the steps off that plane onto the soil of Tanzania; and I believe that there will be tens of thousands of Tanzanians there to welcome them back home again. The completion of this series of miracles that came about because one person, Steve Meyer, had the right head and heart at all times, and he had the right networks, with people like Lazaro Nyalandu and people working in our U.S. Embassies like Anthony Pagiliai and Elizabeth Soderholm, who set up that call, and our Ambassadors within each of those places that promoted and allowed this to happen, including Ambassador Lu and also Ambassador Baily, whom I worked with. I got the good news when I was in Kosovo that it was going to be, it was likely to be completed then, that they had reached that transaction. I called it a transaction. They had put together the logistics so that the plane was going to go and pick them up. I found myself then at the Vatican shortly after that, and kind of as maybe a little extra frosting on the cake, I was offered the opportunity to do the Bible reading at St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican that Sunday. I don’t know how that came to me unless it was just a little reward from God that said, ‘‘Well done, well done,’’ by a lot of people. These young people are now reconstructed. Their reconstructive surgery is completed, and they are on the mend. Two of the three are standing and walking and getting stronger, and each of them are taking physical therapy, and their attitudes are good. Their pain levels are down, and the projection is that, by mid to late August, they will be ready to go back to Tanzania. That is an American success story, Mr. Speaker, and it is one that I am happy to relay here on the floor of the House of Representatives and deliver the credit to so many people who did so much to make this work, particularly Dr. Steve Meyer, but all of that for three kids in Tanzania for whom it is a miracle that they survived the bus accident. Now, for their futures, the three miracle kids of Tanzania have a legacy to live up to. I expect that in years going forward, 10 and 20 and 30 and 40 years from now, wherever they go in the world, especially in Tanzania, they will be known as the Tanzanian miracle kids, the ones who survived against such improbable odds. Out of them should come the kind of ambassadorship that links together Tanzania and the United States, and who knows what gets built that helps them help themselves; who knows how much of their own agriculture will be expanded so they can raise their own food; who knows how much of their educational system will be built out because of the inspiration that can come from young people whose lives have been saved by the technology and education that we have here; who knows how much of their spirit of faith is going to be bolstered by the good hearts of people that only wanted to do something good, only wanted to reach out their hand and help. So, Mr. Speaker, I am very happy and grateful that this story is on its way to a very happy conclusion, and I can’t say enough about the children, about 
the mothers who expressed their gratitude at the game. One of the mothers continued to always offer some little chicken strips for my granddaughter, my 10yearold granddaughter, Rachel, to eat. Rachel couldn’t quite understand why she was supposed to be eating all the time. And whenever Rachel would take a bite of it, then she would hear: ‘‘You like? You like?’’ And I said: ‘‘Well, Rachel, it is because there are only a few words in English that this girl’s mother knows, and she wants to open up a conversation with you, and so she’s offering you food. That is a way of her expressing gratitude, not only to us, but to our country, and a way of having a conversation and communicating.’’ And so it was a good experience for Rachel, too. But I can’t say enough about Reverend Franklin Graham, Samaritan’s Purse, this effort that is global, that didn’t hesitate. Again, it was not a 5 minute conversation between me and Reverend Franklin Graham that was able to set up this transportation; and the conversation with Franklin Graham and Dr. Steve Meyer, not very technical. It is: ‘‘Where are they?’’ ‘‘What do we need to do?’’ ‘‘How are we going to figure out how to get there?’’ ‘‘Can we set the plane up to be a medevac plane?’’ He had expressed that also in the phone call with me. So, Mr. Speaker, this is a story that is on the way to a very, very happy conclusion, and I hope sometime, maybe in September, I can come back to the floor and report on the return of the Tanzanian miracle kids to Tanzania and, hopefully, I will have some pictures then of the crowd that is bound to be gathered together in a great celebratory event to counteract, or to be juxtaposed against the terrible, terrible tragedy of that bus accident that killed 36. It was 33 students and 2 of the teachers and the bus driver. Only these three children survived, and they survived because they were at the back of the bus when the bus landed on its nose. So 17 broken bones, 2 broken spines, 5 or 6 fractured arms, and 3 or 4 of the legs were fractured in one bone or another. Also, I should say that Dr. Quentin Durward was the neurosurgeon who did a lot of that technical work on the spines along with Dr. Steve Meyer, and he is one, also, who I know that his head and heart are in the right place. I know that I have left off many, many of the medical providers at Mercy Hospital in Sioux City who donated their time and are so dedicated to this. I regret that I didn’t have a list to read into the RECORD , Mr. Speaker. But I also want to express my gratitude to those whom I left off the list. With that, I believe that I should conclude my presentation here on the Tanzanian miracle kids and, again, thank all of those who are involved and transition my discussion over to a few other things that are part of the current concerns here in America. ISSUES OF THE DAY  
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I want to transition over to the shooting last Wednesday at the practice ballfield in Alexandria. I want to thank everyone across this country who offered their prayers for the recovery of all of those who were injured in this shooting and especially our whip, our majority whip, STEVE  SCALISE . His nickname for me and mine for him for years has been ‘‘Scrapper.’’ We just call each other ‘‘Scrapper.’’ Well, we know, STEVE SCALISE is a scrapper. He is a fighter. He took an awfully hard hit last Wednesday, and it did significant damage to him. All of the medical reports that we have been getting after the first 36 hours or so have been of improvement in his condition. b1730 I don’t suppose—and I say this for STEVE ’s benefit—I don’t suppose LSU’s loss in the College World Series the other night by a score of 13to1 improved his condition that much, but he is a baseball player and a baseball fan, and he is a very dedicated LSU fan. They are still in the College World Series, as I understand it, and it is a doubleelimination tournament. So they are the leaders in the loser’s bracket, so to speak. So they have got a chance to battle back and still win. But he is battling back, and he is a winner, and his strength is coming back. The day will come when he comes to this floor to cast a vote. I don’t know how long that is going to be, Mr. Speaker, but I can only anticipate the cheers of joy that this House of Representatives will utter when the day comes that STEVE SCALISE comes back to this floor to vote, to count votes. He is the vote counter for the majority in this House of Representatives. That is one of the most important jobs in this place. If you bring a bill to the floor and you can’t produce the votes to get it to pass, it is a pretty heavy embarrassment, and STEVE SCALISE has gotten that art down pretty well. I always want to make that job as easy for him as I can, provided I agree with him on the policy, of course. But STEVE SCALISE , whether you agree with him on the policy or whether you don’t, he has the personal support and the prayers of a vast majority of the Members here on this floor, and across this country. He is an individual who you have got to like him, you have got to like him personally. He is engaging. He is sociable. He makes sure that there is a meal back there for us on first votes of the week, and he is the host in the Lincoln room in front of the Lincoln fireplace where Lincoln used to sit back in the day as well. His two kids and his wife are also certainly near him whenever they can be and by his bedside whenever they can be. It is a time when the family is going through a fair amount of grief and stress, too. But STEVE SCALISE isn’t the only story in this, and that would be that Matt Mika, the lobbyist for Tyson Foods, was the secondmost seriously injured in the shootings last Wednesday. And without describing his wounds here in the RECORD , I just want to make sure the RECORD knows, Mr. Speaker, that it was a very serious wound that Matt Mika took, and his recovery looks positive at this point. It is also one of those things that, day by day, gets a little better. But each one of these individuals, STEVE SCALISE and Matt Mika, had it been a different scenario, if it had been a more remote location, without an almost immediate medevac by helicopter out of there and to the hospital, I am going to say that if they had been in a remote location, we likely would have lost them both. It is attempted murder by a fellow that we don’t need to bring charges against now because he has gone to the morgue. And his death is as a result of the two officers who were there providing the security for STEVE SCALISE : Crystal Griner, I believe her name was, and also David Bailey. One of the most uplifting things that I have seen was at the Congressional Baseball Game last Thursday night at the Nationals Park, when I saw Joe Torre come out to the mound, and I thought he was going to throw out the first pitch, and then they introduced— it was either Roberto Clemente’s son or grandson, he was also at the mound— but then this fellow came out on crutches that had one leg up off the ground. And as he went out there, I realized who it was: David Bailey; the man who had actually taken the shooter out just the day before and took a wound himself in the leg came to the ball game on crutches and went out to the mound. He handed over one of those crutches, leaned on the other one, and threw out the first pitch. It was a tremendous moment. It was the best moment of the evening, Mr. Speaker. It was the equivalent of Neil Diamond going back to the Red Sox stadium after the Boston bombing and singing ‘‘Sweet Caroline’’ at the seventhinning stretch. Those things, when we see that, have got a lot more meaning than just throwing a ball into home plate or singing a song at the seventhinning stretch. It is something that uplifts and motivates all of us and should unify all of us together. This ghastly attempted killing that took place by Hodgkinson was something that—we don’t doubt that some of it was ginned up by the hatred and the vitriol that is part of the vernacular and part of the public arena today in politics. More examination of his Facebook page and his other communications and people who were 
around him will go on as we try to understand what motivated this man, but there is no question it was political. I believe that he was radicalized by the political dialogue that has been taking place in this country. And that radicalization took place in a way, in his mind, that we won’t understand. I remember Speaker PELOSI saying that everybody is not as stable as we are, and that words weigh a ton on people who aren’t stable, and sometimes they are motivated into violence. That doesn’t mean we can prevent the violence by preventing the dialogue, but it does mean that when we clash, we should clash on policy. We should disagree on policy and the best method to bring this policy forward, but it should not be personal. We should not be demonizing the other side. There is going to be a disagreement in ideology. Our Founding Fathers understood that. They set up this competition here in this Congress to drain the stress off of the streets of America. And one of the results here is that we come to this place, on the floor of this House, and when we disagree, we don’t challenge the motive of the person we disagree with. We challenge the ideas, and we try to present better ideas. And the best ideas are to prevail in the mind of the public. That is how it was designed to be. That is why every 2 years we have an election here, and why there are no appointments to the House of Representatives. Everybody that has a vote card in this place, all 435 of us, that is a vote card earned in an election; not one that has been handed by a Governor’s appointment, for example, which is the case in the Senate, from time to time, when there is a vacancy. But we are elected every 2 years, and our Founding Fathers looked at this and said: We are going to be the hot cup of coffee—or hot cup of tea, perhaps, is what they were referencing at the time—so we could react quickly to the will of the people. But the saucer that it cools in is the Senate—6year elections instead of 2— so that the hot ideas that come here to the House of Representatives can be tempered in the cooling saucer of the 6 year terms in the Senate. But it was about bringing ideas here, bringing them here quickly with the elections every 2 years for every one of us, every 2 years, and then those fresh ideas then wash across over to the Senate, and the Senate is designed to step back and take a look, and a deep breath, and then, with the judgment of both bodies, come together and conference committee, and conference report, and send those results to the President of the United States—elected every 4 years—who is, of course, the Commander in Chief, commands our military, has a full authority to do all kinds of things, Mr. Speaker. But the point I want to make is this: During the ObamaCare debate in 2010, in that March period of time, when this Capitol was surrounded by the American people, and encircled, and they were six to eight people deep in a human doughnut around the Capitol— not just a human chain where you touched people and reached out as far as you could—six or eight deep, packed together all the way around the Capitol. By the way, there are no pictures of that human doughnut around the Capitol, because there was no airspace allowed for anything to fly up there and take pictures of us standing around in that fashion. But during that period of time, I had walked from the Judiciary Committee over here to the House of Representatives. And on the way, I came by a lady who I had seen in the gallery of the Judiciary Committee quite a number of times, and I had never talked to her. But as I walked by her, I felt compelled to speak to her, Mr. Speaker. And as I did, she said: You have got to stop arguing. You have got to stop debating. You have got to get to a compromise. You have got to get to a compromise and move on. We can’t have these arguments in our country. We can’t have this kind of stress, this kind of pressure. And I hadn’t answered a question of anybody the same as I did that day. I answered her differently, Mr. Speaker. And it just kind of clicked in my mind, and I said to her: Did you ever think that because we come to this city together, and we debate our disagreements here in open debate, and we air out our beliefs and our convictions, and we weigh our options, and we bring new ideas in, and we churn those ideas, did you ever think that because we do that this way in America, that it keeps us from being at each other’s throats and fighting each other in the streets of America? And I know that was how it was designed to be, to drain off that hot bloodedness that comes through debate, and by public—not only by debate but by legitimate elections that reflect the voices and the will of the people. It is the biggest thing that keeps us from having revolutions in America. We have them. We have them every 2 years when we have an election. They are, in a way, a revolution. New ideas come here. We weigh those ideas. We cast our votes. We change the policy. We adjust to the will of the American people, and that keeps us from having revolutions in the street of America. But how long will that last, Mr. Speaker? How long can that last in a country where we had a legitimate election last November 8, and there is that evergrowing group of people who seem to be denying the very results of our legitimate election? The constitutionally elected President of the United States is Donald J. Trump, and it is not an arguable or refutable point. You can say that Hillary Clinton won more popular vote than Donald Trump. Well, that is like saying, the Packers beat the Bears, but the Bears ran up more yards than the Packers, so they don’t have a legitimate win. They are not playing by the rules on the football field of who runs up the most total yards. It is who has the most points on the scoreboard. You can run the ball up and down the field, but if you can’t get across the goal line, or kick it through the uprights, or if you can’t score a safety, you don’t score. And if you don’t score and the other team does, you lose. If they score more than you do, you still lose. And that is how this constitutional election takes place, Mr. Speaker, is by the rules; the rules that are written into our Constitution and have been barely altered over more than 200 years because they were so wisely put in place. The electoral college decides the President of the United States, and the ballots are cast here on the floor of the House of Representatives, and that is the official tally that rings up who is the President of the United States. There is no part of this process that is legitimately refuted by the other side. Yet, they say, we are the resistance. And the loser in the last Presidential election wants to be the leader of the resistance—the leader of the resistance, and one who has looked for a lot of reasons why she is not the President of the United States. And I would quote CHUCK GRASSLEY  on how you define that. In one of his elections years ago—this is a back channel story about him, but he is a person I admire and have a great affection for, a senior Senator from Iowa, now the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee—they continually asked him when he was first elected to the Federal office here: ‘‘Why did you win? Why did you win?’’ And he didn’t want to say anything anymore. He was just happy enough with the victory. And finally, as he walked away from the press, they said: ‘‘But, Mr. Grassley, why did you win?’’ And he turned, and he said: ‘‘I got more votes than the other guy.’’ And he walked away. Well, that is a pretty good point, CHUCK GRASSLEY . And in this case, Donald Trump got more electoral votes than his opponent. That is why he won. But he earned those legitimately by elections within the States that converted those electoral votes to his side. That is how it is supposed to be. And to deny that then subverts the constitutional results of an elected President. It subverts the mandate that comes with the election of a President. It diminishes the credibility of our constitutionally structured government that is there, and it bogs down our process. So when I see demonstrations in the streets, Mr. Speaker, that say ‘‘the resistance’’ in the front, and then there is another big banner up there that says, ‘‘be ungovernable,’’ we don’t want to be an ungovernable people, Mr. Speaker. We want to be a governable 
himself. Mosaic law is the foundation for law in America, and it is traceable. The Greek philosophers and the leaders in Greece would talk about the rule of law. They would be sometimes teased and ridiculed by some of their competitors. They would say: ‘‘That is not your thoughts. You borrowed that from Moses. That is Mosaic law. I can hear it in your voice. I know that is where it came from.’’ Mosaic law was traced to Greece and Rome, and from Rome then on to Western Europe where the Romans occupied much of that all the way to England and beyond. That is where the rule of law came from. One of the pillars of American exceptionalism is the rule of law. If you would pull that out of the equation of the history of the United States of America, you would end up with an entirely different country, an entirely different culture, and an entirely different structure here. We respect the law. We don’t have police officers that pull us over because they need money for their children and accept a bribe because they said that you were speeding. If any of that happens, we look at their badge number, and that officer is soon out of a job. We clean our society up of those kinds of things. But that is not the case in Third World countries. They know what mordida means south of the border. That happens in country after country. But here, we respect the law. We have open meetings laws where the function of government is out in the open so the public can be in and participate. That is rooted clear back in the Greek citystates. I recall going into the National Archives to take a look and stand and gaze at the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, where you can get your hand within 8 inches of that parchment where they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. As I waited to step before the Declaration, there was a display of the artifacts from the Greek city states where they would gather together all of the eligibleage men—at that time it was only men, but, of course, now, today, we fixed that—but as they would gather them together, they would all have a voice. They had a situation where there would be what they would call demagogues. The Greek demagogues would be those who were so skillful in their oratorical skills that they could wind up the emotions of the other Greeks and sometimes get them to stampede in the wrong direction. If they consistently stampeded their fellow citizens in an illlogical direction, eventually they would say—I don’t know what the name would be of the Greek individual, but maybe it would be like: Demetrius is causing too much trouble for us, we are going to have to blackball him. So if the demagogue was too effective and caused too much damage to the public policy, then they would go through, there would be one door there that you would vote in, and the next door would be the discard door. Each voter, each citizen, would get a white and a black marble. They would cast their ballot, blackball that Greek demagogue and banish him from the citystate. There is much that is rooted as part of this country that is rooted back in this era. We need to teach it and we need to have respect for each other. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
THE TERROR The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. CHENEY). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTENBERRY ) for 30 minutes. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, last week, as we are all too aware, a gunman opened fire on Members of Congress and staff assistants as they were practicing for the annual bipartisan baseball game to raise money for a Washingtonbased charity. Among those who were injured is my dear friend and colleague, Congressman STEVE SCALISE , the House majority whip. As news of this event came in right before our weekly Nebraska breakfast, a 74year tradition—by the way, a bipartisan tradition in which the entire Nebraska delegation gets together on a weekly basis and invites anyone from our home State to gather with us. As that was about to occur, I heard the news of the shootings. I felt bewildered, shocked, and numb. As further reports came in from my colleagues throughout the morning, I heard that STEVE was playing second base at the time of his shooting. He crawled from the infield, leaving a trail of blood. Mr. Speaker, this isn’t a movie. These are not distant figures. These are our friends and our colleagues, people who work right here in this institution. Representative SCALISE and I frequently interact on the nuances of policy, and sometimes differences of policy. No matter what our disagreements—and believe me, there are hard differences even on one side of the political aisle. No matter what the differences might be, STEVE always has worked with me in a cordial, professional, constructive, and, perhaps most importantly, gentlemanly manner. That is just who he is. So regardless of what anyone may think of his policies, of his political point of view, Congress, or the GOP, he did not deserve to be shot. As noted by Senator RANDPAUL, who was also at the practice, were it not for the courageous Capitol Hill Police officers who accompanied Representative SCALISE to events, this would have been a massacre. Were it not for the first responders from the Alexandria Police Department and Fire and Rescue, many of those injured, for them it could have been much, much worse. My heart goes out to STEVE SCALISE  and the others who were injured in this tragic event. However, my words cannot stop here. For years now, across multiple administrations and across party lines, we have seen accelerating political rancor in our country that goes way beyond normal partisan politics. It is hard to get your mind around some of the stuff that people write. It is awful. It goes beyond just pointed language. It is now so frequent, so violent, and so directly threatening that security personnel are working overtime to keep up with it. Madam Speaker, you know this. Many good men and women of differing political perspectives work in the United States Congress. These are people who have accomplished important things in their own home communities and decided that their heart was calling them to serve in a broader capacity. b1800 I fully recognize that Washington, D.C., can seem elitist and aloof, but as you know, Madam Speaker, Members of Congress are real people, with real families, from real places across our land. Sure, there may be a disproportionate share of lawyers in the institution, but there are also nurses, social workers, doctors, teachers, and small business owners. In fact, one of the doctors, Representative BRADWENSTRUP , a friend of mine, happened to be at the baseball practice. He is an Iraq veteran and surgeon. He attended to STEVE SCALISE ’s gunshot wound, thankfully. Above all, all of these persons are Americans. Nevertheless, there is a limit to what the human person, even a paid public servant, can absorb. We can take the violent words, but when it spills into violent action, it is too much. This country cannot continue to rip itself apart like this. Madam Speaker, there is one additional difficulty here that needs to be unpacked. There is a real risk and vulnerability in what I call regularizing this response, in making it like a ‘‘new normal.’’ In fact, within only a few hours of the shootings, certain national media had begun to routinize the tragedy, as they returned to obsessing on the latest crisis du jour in Washington, as if nothing fundamentally destructive to all that we hold dear as Americans had just occurred. And why not? As the media tells us, the assassin was a ‘‘troubled man,’’ a ‘‘lone wolf,’’ with a ‘‘history of violence’’ and ‘‘easy access to guns,’’ who was likely ‘‘mentally ill.’’ Nothing unique to see here. Madam Speaker, these were not our thoughts after the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan or the shooting of Democratic Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords of Arizona. When President Kennedy was shot, I am told, it was as if the entire world came to a halt. If we are now going to move beyond words and normalize the violent targeting of people just because they 
choose public service, hold views that are different from our own, or speak in a style that is not to our liking, there is no country. I find it particularly jarring that the widely praised theatrical assassination of President Trump at a rendition of Julius Caesar in New York City’s Central Park—underwritten, by the way, by The New York Times—continues to go on. Madam Speaker, violence is violence. When it is here and it is political, of course, it is particularly jarring. Tragically, we also may be growing used to the idea of terror abroad. Although its root causes are different than those of domestic political attacks here on our own shores, the same thing is at stake: the very principles of civilization itself. Madam Speaker, let me digress for a moment, because this is particularly notable. After 9/11, crime all but vanished from the streets of New York City. In other words, the shock and the horror caused a community to rally together above any social discord in a spirit of true unity. We glimpsed that same spirit of solidarity as a nation when Obama bin Laden was finally confronted. Just recently, a day after the terror attacks that rocked London a few weeks ago, Richard Angell, a patron in a restaurant that had been evacuated during the jihadist rampage, calmly returned to pay his bill. In explaining his generosity, Angell told a reporter, ‘‘These people shouldn’t win.’’ The night before, several bartenders had risked their lives to defend patrons in that particular establishment with bottles, chairs, tables, anything they could find, as the terrorists tried to hack away their customers with large knives. More lives would have been lost were it not for their bravery. Only a few weeks before that, at a concert attended mostly by young girls, a homeless man, Stephen Jones, who slept most nights near the stadium, helped several victims of that bombing to safety, even pulling nails from the faces of young children. The resolve and courage in the face of barbaric violence harkens back to the passengers of United Flight 93 who sacrificed their own lives on 9/11 in order to take down a plane headed straight for Washington, D.C., probably for the White House. While we appropriately recognize those who act with courage, the constant repetition of these scenes appear to be resulting, sadly, in what I call ‘‘terror fatigue.’’ We go about the same tired ritual: the requisite shock and horror; the 24hour media coverage of victims, heroes, and families; and the inevitable autopsy of what went wrong. By this exercise, I am afraid we further enable what Hannah Arendt once famously wrote, ‘‘the banality of evil.’’ Against this backdrop, I think it is important and useful to pull back and contemplate the fundamental error in our analysis and approach. In the West, we have a blind spot. We want to believe that if we can only understand how a disordered person was raised, how his parents treated him, if he was an orphan or poor or misunderstood or abandoned or a victim of some real or imagined prejudice, then we can understand what makes him kill. Armed with this soft understanding, perhaps we can prevent further tragedy by ameliorating the conditions that we think gave rise to barbaric deeds. In many discussions of unpredictable and random attacks on bystanders in Europe and America, we find a perverse unwillingness to accurately identify the true motivations of the perpetrators, lest we close the space to ‘‘cure them’’ of their zealotry. In the current, highly polarized, oversensitized, and extremely volatile climate, it is risky to call a thing for what it is. Instead, again and again, we hear that these were just a few misguided individuals—another mental health problem, another aberration, another police problem; nothing to do with dark theology to notice here. Carry on. We must just accept this as a new normal. What makes these particular vicious actors different? In a study, the Gallup organization basically finds that most people in the world want similar things. Most people in the world want a good job: to be able to take care of themselves; to be able to take care of their family; to be able to use the creative talents of their personhood, whether it be their intellect or their hands to make things for the benefit of others and, in turn, receive an income that they can support themselves with. However, as one of my Muslim friends has noted, PetroIslam has enabled and unleashed a narrow sect of men and women who often want for nothing. Several of the terrorists on 9/11 were young men of both wealth and privilege, with worldclass educations. They weren’t motivated by the allures of Western secular materialism. They used those values to hide in plain sight. Rather, they were in the grip of a dark, violent theology. They were willing to die for its inherent irrationality. This cannot continue. Even the Saudis, who have lived for too long with the hyper hypocrisy of buying off Wahhabists while shopping in Paris, recognize this is an unsustainable trend. Madam Speaker, when I was in college, I remember the day when Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was assassinated. It was a hard day for me. Shortly before, I had lived in that country on an exchange program. I received the bountiful gift of hospitality and an invaluable source of deep and reach cultural understanding. Sadat died. Sadat gave his life because he made a reasoned choice to reach across the divide to find peace. In another courageous move, just a few years ago, in a littleknown speech, the current Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah elSisi, said: ‘‘Is it possible that 1.6 billion Muslims should want to kill the rest of the world’s inhabitants— that is, 7 billion—so that they themselves may live? Impossible.’’ Quite a courageous statement. At this moment, Madam Speaker, we are on the verge of wiping out ISIS militarily. But it is only the latest brand. We will only fully resolve the thinking that leads to the embrace of dark theology through a rebirth in reason, modeled through courageous leadership. As we see in our battle against ISIS, when you call for evil to happen on social media, in Main Street media and in art, eventually someone in the real world takes it to heart. We must stop creating the rhetorical conditions and the media cover for this politically motivated violence or the grotesque twisting of mediums to encourage terror. There is no rationalization that can justify it. This is not about freedom of speech. It is about freedom from violence. Ask yourself a question: Where would you like to live? Where people lie, steal, and kill? Or where people are good, trustworthy, and free? Madam Speaker, I will close with this because it is a hint of good news. Last week, the House of Representatives, in a private session, Democrats and Republicans, had a family meeting and, with due candor, spoke about the effect of escalating rhetoric and the responsibility each of us must take in owning our share of it. Importantly, the bipartisan Congressional Baseball Game went on as planned last Thursday night. I took my younger staff. The game was energetic and patriotically bipartisan. Madam Speaker, as you are aware, my side lost, but I believe America won. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ) for 30 minutes. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Madam Speaker, today a lot of people are looking at Washington more perplexed than ever, thinking that nothing is getting done here. It is easy for them to think that because, when they turn on their televisions or listen to their radios and listen to news commentators, all they seem to be talking about is some very obscure idea. But something that dominates all the communication, or a great deal of communication, is that Russia in some way altered the outcome of the last election, perhaps— what they have been telling us—the Russians hacked into the system. This is the image we are being given. b1815 All those emails that came out during the election from the Democratic 
National Committee and the Hillary campaign, those emails were, in some way, a product of a Russian conspiracy with the Trump campaign. Over and over and over again, even though all of the experts who we have seen from the intelligence communities on down the line have said that that is bogus; that did not happen; there is no proof that that happened. And many people who are looking into this don’t think that the Russians were involved with that hacking at all, much less their involvement in our campaigns in a way that differentiated from every other government in the world, including our own, being involved in trying to impact other people’s elections in a light handed way. In this situation, the Russian Government has not—again, has not—been proven or even the evidence seems to indicate that they were not involved in a way that actually affected the outcome of our last election. Yet that is all we hear about. That is the massive news coverage, and the American people’s attention is being focused on that, or they are being told: Oh, but over in Washington, the Congress is so tied up because of this crisis. We have not been tied up. We have been doing great things here in the Nation’s capital, and the Trump administration has been doing great things. We have not been frozen by this unrelenting attack trying to give the American people the idea that the last election was invalid. This effort to distract us is a disgrace. And I do believe the American people see, when they hear this over and over repeated but there is no substance being told us that indicates the specific crime, the specific hacking incident that happened. No, we have no incidences where any type of Russian interference, in some way, determined the outcome of the last election. But, of course, the distraction that is taking place is basically covering the fact that we have a group of people who lost the last election who have been disrupting, who have a plan, a program of resistance and disruption of those who did win the election. If there is anything more antiAmerican than that, I don’t know what is. Talk about destroying democracy. So with that said, what are we doing if we aren’t tied up in this Russian problem? And let me note, there has been, even to the point after all the hearings that we had and there is no evidence of it, now some Republicans have gone along with this effort, and we have appointed what was called an independent or a special prosecutor. And now what we can expect is another 3 or 4 months of the headlines on all of the news media except one or two trying to divert our attention. Well, I would ask that the independent counsel and the special prosecutor, they are going to look into Russia, let them not just look into, did our Attorney General have two conversations or three conversations with the Ambassador from Russia to the United States in passing meetings, I might add, other people engaged, instead of asking questions like that and trying to find some way to charge our Attorney General with some sort of crime that he would have committed and maybe perjury even because he forgot about one conversation with someone over a year’s time period where there were thousands of conversations with thousands of people, nobody hope—if they can go into detail like that, let us hope that the Clinton Foundation becomes a target of that investigation. They want to find out what effect the Russians had on our elections. Let’s find out what the millions of dollars that went into the Clinton Foundation did that might have helped Hillary’s chances of being elected. Let’s find out that. And let’s find out how much money was actually put into the Clinton family’s pockets when former President Clinton, speaking again before Russian oligarchs, was able to receive certain payments, exorbitant payments, from what I understand, we need to know exactly what they were, into his own pocket at the same time Russian oligarchs were putting millions, maybe tens of millions, into the Clinton Foundation. So, okay, that needs to be looked at. But I would suggest that the American people need to go beyond this madeup crisis. The American people need to take a look at what we have been accomplishing here, and we have been accomplishing. A healthcare bill passed. And, yes, it is not a perfect healthcare bill, but now we have actually got a bill that is in the system. The Senate is going to have their bill. The system is now working, and there is a healthcare bill going through the system to improve our situation now instead of being stuck with ObamaCare that was so poorly written that people were being priced out of the market of having insurance. And we end up with millions of people who can’t afford the health insurance because ObamaCare did what? ObamaCare basically said anybody with a preexisting condition, that risk will be paid for by other health insurance policyholders. And, thus, everybody else’s health insurance went way up, and the amount of coverage they got went way down. Surprise. Surprise. No, that was not a good way to go, and the Republicans are trying to find a better method. Let me just note that I have personally been involved with promoting another concept of how we should be dealing with preexisting conditions, and there is a bill circulating now, and hopefully it will be seriously considered. And as the healthcare bill goes through the House and the Senate, maybe we can get this in there, and that is you look at preexisting conditions and you say: okay, that person has a preexisting condition, and right now that preexisting condition puts them into the mix with all the other policyholders. And then everybody else, including that person, picks up the cost of insuring for that preexisting condition, which then prices everybody out. More people end up without insurance, or insurance that they can’t cover, or what they are getting for their money is decreased. My daughter, for example, had leukemia a few years ago. She is 9 years old. And thank God that we got through that and she is now free of leukemia. But I am sure that somewhere along the line what we are going to have is an insurance company saying: Well, you had leukemia, you had a preexisting condition, thus we are going to charge you more money for health insurance. Maybe 10 years down the road this will happen to her, maybe 20. But the fact is that we don’t need to have people around our country that are in that situation. My daughter is now cancer free. And if she has a preexisting condition, or anybody else in the country has a preexisting condition, what I am proposing—and there is a bill making its way around, people are considering this as an alternative, and I hope they take it seriously, but we will see, at least we are trying, and the idea is the Federal Government will document all preexisting conditions. My daughter’s leukemia would be on that list. And at any time from then on that someone with a preexisting condition has that preexisting condition, if leukemia comes back to her or anyone else who has a preexisting condition that is documented, it will be paid for by Medicare. Just as simple as that. That condition only. All the rest of her health insurance, however, need not be covered by the Federal Government or anybody else. Now that the preexisting conditions have not put their amount way up in the cost to buy an insurance, now they will be charged just the same as anybody else who is healthy. But if they break their arm, they are in a car accident, if they have another disease that comes on, they now are insured from that, but they are not having to pay extra insurance because of that preexisting condition, and you just leave that to Medicare. It is a simple answer. It is not going to cost the taxpayers any more money by doing it any other way. Just let the government take care of those preexisting conditions. All the rest of their healthcare, however, will have to be paid for by that individual. Just the preexisting condition is covered. So that is a type of reform that we can put into place, and people are talking about these ideas now here. That is why, when the Republican bill passed, it was launching a discussion, an honest discussion, of what we should do. The Senate is going to send us back something, and we will, this year, have a healthcare bill because we will have gone through all of these types of alternatives like the one I just suggested. We also passed a financial reform bill. It was called the CHOICE Act. It was a financial reform bill that one of 
the main parts of it actually repealed the DoddFrank bill which was so dramatically hard for our economy and was basically making it very difficult for businesses to function in our country, was a terrible burden, and was actually bringing our economy down. So we passed the elimination of the Dodd Frank Act, and we have reformed our financial community, and that has passed the House. It is now over to the Senate. We have passed dozens of notable bills, yet the impression we are given, of course, is the only thing happening here is the Russians were, in some way, engaged in the last election, and we must focus totally on that, even though all the committees that investigated this, all the people who came from the various intelligence agencies, no one said, here is the proof that they were colluding with the Trump campaign to defeat the Democratic candidate in the last election. So people are only getting that story, but there are all kinds of bills that are being passed, legislation being passed here. Like, for example, there was a weather bill that passed. I mean, this is one example. SUZANNE BONAMICI was someone who had a bill that was attached to the weather bill. It was aimed specifically at trying to have a warning system for tsunami waves that might be created and come not only towards the United States but towards Japan and any other coastal area. That bill passed, and, as I say, it is part of the weather bill now. And SUZANNE BONAMICI , of course, is a Democrat, and I am a Republican. The other lie is that Republicans and Democrats can’t work together. Well, that is just wrong. People are creating a false image, and I am glad to see, by the elections last night, that the American people aren’t falling for the baloney they are being fed. So was that a good bill, the tsunami bill? I think it was, and it has made it through. We have other environmentally aimed bills that are making up for the excesses of the last administration that was basically pushing a radical, environmental, globalist approach to environment issues. I think it is a great thing that the President of the United States has withdrawn us from the Paris Agreement, which would have cost us billions of dollars that we would send to other countries and would put us under the jurisdiction of decisions made by international bodies, not by Americanelected officials but by international bodies. That was a terrific move on the part of the President. In fact, Trump has done a number of wonderful things that he is not getting credit for. Because all the media wants to talk about is how many conversations anybody associated with Trump had with any Russians in the last 2 years. Sorry. A lot of other things that are happening are important. Those people who are trying to distract us are not succeeding. The fact is that President Donald Trump had a triumphant trip overseas. His first visit was to the Middle East. I am a former speech writer for President Reagan. I didn’t write the speech, but I was there when he gave that speech in Berlin telling Gorbachev to ‘‘tear down this wall,’’ a speech that made history, not just reflected it but is now seen as a pivotal moment in changing the direction of what was going on with the Cold War. b1830 I might say, I didn’t write it, but I did make sure that I was one of the people who smuggled that speech into the President’s hands. After the President was given that speech and said he was going to say that, all of his senior advisers tried to convince him not to say, ‘‘tear down this wall.’’ And ‘‘Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,’’ was a phrase in history that made history. And Ronald Reagan stood up against all of the people on the left who were attacking him and even all of his own advisers. That made a huge difference in the world that we live in. Now, let me just note this. We have a President now, President Donald Trump, who went to Saudi Arabia and went to a meeting with the leaders of that part of the world. He talked to them—and these were Muslims, of course. And he said to the Muslim world that, if there is going to be peace with the United States, drive the terrorists out of your mosque; drive the terrorists out of your country. I haven’t been as proud of any President since I was with Ronald Reagan when he said ‘‘tear down this wall’’ than I was proud of our President, President Donald Trump, for telling the Islamic world that they have got to disassociate themselves, they have got to drive the terrorists out of their families and out of their relationships with good and decent Muslims, who are the vast majority of the Muslims in the world. So, with that said, I think there is a lot going on that is good. There are good things. This is a good report. I hope the American people pay attention. There are a lot of creative ideas that are going on. These I just told you about, healthcare and finance reform, these are really important things. And the fact that we are not putting everything in the hands of the United Nations or some unelected government to tell us what we have to do in the name of the environment, that is good, too. Well, I have got a few creative ideas that I have actually presented. I thought I would just let my colleagues know, let my constituents know, and let the rest of the country know, these are some issues on the table that I have personally put on. I think I have a good chance, for example, of getting into the tax bill a provision that is now written out in H.R. 1792, the Expanding Employee Ownership Act. What my bill suggests is that we should have more involvement by working people in their own companies. Let them own part of their companies so that the bosses and the laborers work together as a team rather than looking at each other as adversaries. My bill, H.R. 1792, is being considered for the tax bill that we are putting together. What it says, very simply, is that, if an employer gives to his employees—it has to be a general distribution—stock in that company, the employees don’t have to pay income tax on it. And if they keep that stock for 10 years, they don’t have to pay capital gains tax. So what we have now is a major boost of people keeping their good employees, a better working relationship, more productivity, and management more concerned about their laborers because now their laborers own stock in the company—maybe even 10 or 20 percent of the stock at some point. What we have is a bill that has a chance, and it is being considered. That is the type of thing that is going on here. People are talking about new ideas. For example, I talked about the idea of a new healthcare reform bill and my approach and what I am doing to promote that price for people with preexisting conditions. That is another example, ideas that are being discussed, legislation that is going through, and people are trying to mold it. That is part of the legislative process. Also, when you talk about Republicans and Democrats working together, we are being told we don’t work together. Well, we do. Republicans and Democrats work together, just like I did on the tsunami bill. We actually have a good relationship—many of us do. Nowhere is that more evident than in my leadership of H.R. 975, which is a bill that is entitled, Respect State Marijuana Laws. What this bill does is—over the years, in the last 6 years, I have been joined with a Democrat. It is Mr. BLUMENAUER now, and it used to be Congressman Farr when he was with us. We were able to put into the appropriations bill for the Department of Justice a provision, an amendment to the bill that said: No money in this bill can be used by the Department of Justice to supersede the State laws on medical marijuana in those States that have legalized the use of medical marijuana. So, for the last 5 and 6 years, that has been a totally bipartisan effort. I am a Republican, obviously, and I have been joined by Mr. Farr and, now, Mr. BLUMENAUER . We have actually created a situation where we now have people who are getting involved in researching medical marijuana. By the way, did you know that Israel now, finally, has stepped forward and has done research in the last 10 years? We haven’t. The United States hasn’t. In fact, for 100 years, when we should 
have been trying to find the medical uses of marijuana, it has been virtually outlawed. And now Israel has found wonderful applications for medical marijuana. They also, by the way, when they were studying the effects of marijuana, have legalized it for personal use, for adult use of marijuana, as well as medical marijuana. Well, what does that tell you? That tells you that some of the people who have been telling us, ‘‘oh, we can’t do this because it is going to have a serious impact,’’ Israel studies this closely, especially when it might have a military implication. This would not destroy their military; otherwise, they would not have passed this major reform in their country. Now, why is it that marijuana is an important issue and it brings Republicans and Democrats together? We have limited resources here. The idea that we are going to spend billions of dollars not on protecting Americans from terrorists, not from trying to get bad guys—rapists and murderers—in our local area; no, we are going to spend billions of dollars on police, on jailers, on lawyers, on judges, and on prisons. And then we are going to take people out of the workforce. We are spending billions of dollars so somebody will not smoke a weed in their backyard. And what is even worse, we are telling them we are going to spend billions of dollars to prevent you. If you find that there is a medical use for marijuana, like for senior citizens who have lost their appetites after a major operation—which happened to my mother, by the way. I did not give her marijuana, but I knew when I was feeding her that she had lost her appetite after a major operation. I said to myself: Why can’t she have cannabis here? Well, now people know about that. There is no reason for us to prevent our seniors from having some euphoria when they are 85 years old in a senior citizens home, especially if it brings back their appetite and they feel better because of it rather than drinking. Do they want to have them all drinking? Well, this is not just for seniors. This is for people who have medical problems. It has been documented to have important uses. And again, no one has ever overdosed with marijuana, ever. In terms of what we need to do and what we need to focus on are drugs that are harmful. We have an opioid addiction problem now. Doctors have been giving prescriptions for this. We need to confront that and confront other challenges in crime rather than billions of dollars to try to prevent someone from hurting themselves. If an adult wants to consume cannabis—an adult—it is their business. For the government to intrude, especially the Federal Government, after a State has legalized it, this is tyranny. Our Founding Fathers did not believe that we should have police forces and criminal justice operating at the State—they believed it should happen at the State and local level, not the Federal level. These current restrictions that we have, we have people, unfortunately, again, that are living in the past. All they can remember is the sixties when hippies were smoking dope, and it was just literally a counterculture— counter our culture. And I say ‘‘our culture’’ because I have more of a conservative family background. Although I lived a life in my past and I had too much to drink at times, and maybe even when I was younger, maybe I tried cannabis a couple of times, but I have had an adulthood since I was 23 that I think meets the approval of my parents and, in particular, my dad, who was a lieutenant colonel in the Marines. So with that said, had I been arrested, let’s say, where some of my friends or something were consuming marijuana when I was around, what would have happened to my life? And what is happening to the lives of all of these people, especially in our less affluent areas, who can’t afford the legal protections of hiring a lawyer right away? It is destroying their ability to function in our society. We should not be taking people who are involved in an activity like consuming a weed. Adults should be able to make that decision for themselves. Sending police for someone like that or expending billions of dollars or ruining the life of that young person who can’t afford, whether Black, Chicano, or Caucasian, who can’t afford a lawyer to get them off and expunge their record, it is going to affect them the rest of their life. We can’t be doing that. It is a waste of money. We have a chance now, with bipartisan support, to pass this amendment again, perhaps. We are trying to get that onto the appropriations bill for the Department of Justice, which would then keep in place those restrictions on the Federal Government. But I have a bill, again, with bipartisan support, that would make that across the board. It just says that every State that has legalized the use of marijuana, that none of the departments and agencies of the Federal Government should supersede. They should be treated just like someone selling alcohol or whatever. And, in fact, if they do, they will be asking for ID cards from people to make sure that they are not selling to juniors, to people who are minors, rather than to adults, just like beer. Unfortunately, when it is illegal, it is easier to get marijuana than it is—for someone who is not 18 or 21, it is easier for them to get marijuana than beer because they don’t have to show their ID card at the liquor store. So with that said, there is bipartisan support for my bill. I am hoping that we can get it passed this year or next year, at least in this session of Congress. And then, finally, we have lots of things going on here. I just discussed several creative things that are being discussed around town. And we have got a President of the United States who is opening the door which was guarded by basically a very farleftwing philosophy for the last 8 years. The door of government in this country now is open to working people, where this President has committed himself to trade policies and others that are aimed at creating jobs for the American people, ordinary jobs. One of the things that he has promised us to protect the American people and our American workers is to stop the massive flow of illegals into our country. The massive flow of illegals into our country is bringing down the standard of living of working people. There is one idea that I have presented. When he wants to build a wall, we have the means to provide the resources to build that wall in a very creative way. It wouldn’t cost the American people anything. So I would hope that those who are listening who like some of these ideas don’t get depressed about what they are hearing in the news. Good things are happening in Washington, and a lot of new creative ideas are being discussed. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
