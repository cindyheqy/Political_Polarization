Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the grand opening of Delirium Cafe ´ in Leesburg, Virginia, a world renowned inter-national franchise known for its great food and extensive beer selection. Delirium Cafe ´’s flag- ship franchise is located in Brussels, Belgium, and this grand opening marks its first location in the United States. While offering some clas-sic dishes and beers, and yet at the same time being situated at the corner of South King Street and Loudoun Street, Delirium Cafe ´will provide its patrons with a traditional Belgian experience right here in Virginia’s 10th District. Curtis Allred, former manager of the Shoes Cup & Cork and a Leesburg native, traveled to Brussels six years ago and has since dreamed of opening a Delirium Cafe ´here in the United States. This dream started to come to fruition earlier this year, as he, his business partner, Rick Leith, and Aislin Kavaldjian, who will serve as the Assistant General Manager of Delirium Cafe´, began working tirelessly to open the doors of this restaurant after signing their first lease on January 1, 2017. Since then, Mr. Allred has leased two additional con-nected spaces, and the restaurant now has the capacity to sit over 150 guests with both indoor and outdoor seating. Delirium Cafe´is known internationally for its beer selections, but it was important to Mr. Allred and his management team to strike a balance between offering world renowned beers and beers from local breweries. In addi-tion to providing customers with a wide array of beverage selections, Delirium Cafe´will also offer catering services, lease space for private events, and sell a variety of merchandise. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that my colleagues rise and join me in applauding the Grand Opening of Delirium Cafe´. Not only am I ex-cited for the experiences and memories it will afford my constituents, but as the only location in the United States, I look forward to the visi-tors that will be drawn to downtown Leesburg, a truly vibrant area. I wish Mr. Allred, Ms. Kavaldjian, Mr. Leith, and the entire 50 person staff of Delirium Cafe´all the best moving for-ward and in their future endeavors.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Pastor Victoria James of Ekklesia Fellowship Ministries for her work on behalf of Washtenaw County. Pastor James has been key to the growth and development of Ypsi-lanti and the surrounding areas. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE HONORABLE JOE MAY 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 15, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize the Honorable Joe May, my friend and former colleague from the House of Delegates of the Virginia General Assembly. Delegate May has had both an il-lustrious business career, in which he has served as the Founder, Chief Technology Offi-cer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Electronic Instrumentation and Technology (EIT), and a distinguished career as a public servant as he honorably and capably rep-resented the people of Virginia’s 33rd House District for two decades. Delegate May has dedicated most of his life serving the people of Virginia, starting with his service in the United States military. After-wards, Delegate May became a professional engineer and has since excelled in the field of electrical engineering, as he obtained 24 pat-ents for a variety of inventions, including, among others, a signature reproduction ma-chine, an instrument to measure the curvature of railroad tracks, and the instrument used for measuring octane on gasoline. Then in 1977, soon after he relocated to Loudoun County, Delegate May and his wife, Bobby, founded Electronic Instrumentation and Technology (EIT), which provides electronic manufacturing and engineering services for the medical, communications, industrial process control and analytical instrument markets. EIT would later evolve into a multi-million-dollar company and has been instrumental to the development and success of Loudoun County’s economy during a period when the county’s economy has flourished. In 1993, the year that would mark the ad-vent of his political career, Delegate May was first elected to the House of Delegates from Virginia’s 33rd District, which at the time in-cluded parts of Clarke, Fairfax, Fauquier, and Loudoun counties. In the House of Delegates, Delegate May’s sharp business acumen and unique experience as only one a few profes-sional engineers in the entire General Assem-bly, enabled him to play an integral role in passing numerous legislative initiates, includ-ing a bill to establish the House’s Science and Technology Committee, of which he would later serve as chair. Through his time as Chair of both the Joint Commission on Technology and Science and the Science and Technology Committee, Delegate May helped promote leg-islation that allowed Loudoun County to be-come a leading innovator in the technology sector while also ensuring that western Loudoun retained its bucolic character. For Delegate May’s innumerable contribu-tions in both his career as an entrepreneur and public servant, a remarkable number of well-deserved accolades and honors have been bestowed upon him, including being in-ducted into Virginia Tech’s College of Engi-neering Academy of Engineering Excellence, being named the Loudoun Times-Mirror’s Per-son of the Year for 2012, and being recog-nized as the Legislator of the Year by multiple associations, such as the Virginia Soil, Water and Conversation Districts, the Virginia Cable and Telecommunications Association, and the Virginia Biotechnology Association and Vir-ginia Transit. Delegate May is the true embod-iment of a public servant, and the residents of Virginia will benefit for years to come from his lifetime of service to the Commonwealth. It is honor to call him a friend and I wish him all the best as he continues his focus on the de-velopment and expansion of EIT and on what-ever future endeavors he may pursue.

RECOGNIZING MR. ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ MAXWELL 
HON. GREG WALDEN 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 15, 2017 Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize Mr. Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Maxwell of Bend, Or-egon for his outstanding military and civilian service to Oregon and our nation. Mr. Maxwell is well known in veterans cir-cles mostly as a WWII Medal of Honor recipi-ent. He served with the famed 3rd Infantry Di-vision in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and France. During the invasion of Anzio, Italy, he was wounded and acted bravely to earn his first Silver Star and Purple Heart. Shortly after being released from the Army hospital in Naples, he participated in ‘‘Operation Dra-goon’’—the invasion of Southern France dur-ing late August, 1944. While protecting his Battalion Headquarters with 3 other soldiers in Besancon, France on September 7, 1944, a German Infantry unit outnumbering his unit 10 to 1 attacked the outpost. Mr. Maxwell hurled his unprotected body on a German hand gre-nade thrown into their midst. The grenade ex-ploded under Mr. Maxwell, saving the lives of 3 comrades and severely wounding Mr. Max-well. For his unhesitating valor above and be-yond the call of duty, he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, a second Sil-ver Star, a second Purple Heart, a Bronze Star and French Croix de Guerre. Mr. Maxwell was discharged from the U.S. Army and used the ‘‘GI Bill’’ to earn his cre-dentials in Automotive Technology. He worked in that profession for 32 years, teaching at Bend High School, Central Oregon College and Lane Community College. In 1970, he was named one of 5,000 outstanding edu-cators in our nation. Since his retirement from teaching, ‘‘Bob’’ has served as a Director of the Bend Heroes Foundation, and has co-chaired several vet-erans projects including the Bend Parade of Flags, Bend Heroes Memorial, the first-of-its- kind WWII Veterans Historic Highway, and the Oregon Medal of Honor Exhibit. Mr. Maxwell is a passionate promoter of the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation’s ‘‘Character Development Program’’ now being adopted in Central Oregon schools. As de-voted Christians and proponents of higher education, Mr. Maxwell and his late wife Bea initiated the Bob and Bea Maxwell Medal of Honor Scholarship program at Boise Bible College many years ago. Mr. Maxwell celebrated his 96th birthday on October 26, 2016. He is the oldest surviving recipient of the Medal of Honor, our nation’s highest military award. It has been my privi-lege and honor to know and have worked with Bob Maxwell for many years. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful state and country, I wish to honor Mr. Robert D. ‘‘Bob’’ Maxwell for his grand accomplishments over many years. IN RECOGNITION OF MARGARET CRAWFORD FOR HER PIO-NEERING CAREER WITH LINCOLN CONSOLIDATED SCHOOLS HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 15, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Margaret Crawford for her out-standing career with Lincoln Consolidated Schools. As school board member and presi-dent for Lincoln Schools, Ms. Crawford worked tirelessly on behalf of the school district’s stu-dents and staff. After graduating from Wayne State Univer-sity with a degree in Social Work, Ms. Crawford began her career doing case man-agement work for the State of Michigan, even-tually transitioning to work in fiscal manage-ment for Head Start. She then utilized her management and community service experi-ence to successfully run for a seat on the school board of Lincoln Consolidated Schools. During her time on the school board, Ms. Crawford established a reputation as an effec-tive advocate for the district’s students. As a result of her successes, Ms. Crawford was elected school board president of Lincoln Con-solidated Schools, making her the first female and black president in the schools’ history. Ad-ditionally, Ms. Crawford later started the non-profit Council for Black Student Achievement, which provided academic assistance and fi-nancial support to individuals in need. These initiatives played a critical role in providing impactful aid to the district’s students. Ms. Crawford’s work with Lincoln Consoli-dated Schools and in the community has helped empower countless students and im-prove educational outcomes. In addition to her work with the local school system, Ms. Crawford also partnered with local social and community agencies to support efforts to bet-ter serve children in the school district. Her ex-emplary public service and activism have left a lasting legacy in the community, and it is my hope that Lincoln Consolidated Schools can continue to build on these successes. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Margaret Crawford for her work on behalf of Lincoln Consolidated Schools. Ms. Crawford’s trailblazing career has improved the lives of countless students.

HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 15, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an extraordinary leader, Karen Cleveland, for the incredible impact she has had on individuals, families, and communities in Northern Virginia and to congratulate her on being named Northern Virginia Family Serv-ice’s 2017 Community Champion, Ms. Cleveland’s father, Jim Kelly, was a coach and Athletic Director at the University of Cincinnati, and she and her family not only had a strong grasp for health and wellness, but also for working with others. Accordingly, after graduating from the University of Cin-cinnati in 1978, Ms. Cleveland began her ca-reer in Fairfax County teaching aerobics. She knew she wanted to engage with her commu-nity, which is why she took an executive posi-tion in the Fairfax County Chamber of Com-merce in 1986. She then had the opportunity, in 1988, to serve as the first Executive Direc-tor for Greater Reston Chamber of Commerce, which at the time was a start-up chamber that needed tremendous leadership to grow. At the chamber, she worked to establish business and community relationships, and her efforts included starting initiatives to host awards ceremonies, fundraisers, and more. Addition-ally, she then went on to serve as the execu-tive vice president of the Association of Sales and Marketing Companies and as the presi-dent and CEO of Habitat for Humanity of Northern Virginia. In 2008, Ms. Cleveland received a certificate in leadership coaching from Georgetown Uni-versity and then started the Cleveland Coach-ing Group. As a Leadership Coach, she works with executives and emerging leaders to assist them with their personal growth and develop-ment. Now as the president and CEO of Lead-ership Fairfax, Inc., a community leadership development organization, Ms. Cleveland’s ex-pertise has allowed her to empower other indi-viduals and organizations to expand their busi-nesses and explore new opportunities. She has received numerous impressive awards, in-cluding being named the YMCA of Metropoli-tan DC Volunteer of the Year, receiving the EXCEL Award for Nonprofit Leadership Excel-lence by the Center for Nonprofit Advance-ment, and more.
