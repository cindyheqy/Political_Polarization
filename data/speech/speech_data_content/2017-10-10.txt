Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, going back to the days of Teddy Roosevelt, it has been a bipartisan principle that protecting the public health in America’s environment is the sacred obligation of all of us who have the honor to serve this Nation in elective or appointed office. Unfortunately, the Administrator of the EPA, Mr. Scott Pruitt, didn’t get that memo. Yesterday, Mr. Pruitt announced that he is precipitously going to strike down the Clean Power Plan rule sometime later today, which will turn the clock back in this country in terms of trying to get our arms around the issue of rising carbon emissions that scientists from across all sectors have universally recognized are causing rising sea temperature, rising sea levels, affecting climate, and clearly are linked to manmade carbon emissions that have been tracked for decades going back in time. Mr. Pruitt’s argument is based on the discredited view that carbon pollution does not fall under the Clean Air Act, which is what the last administration was proceeding on when they actually designed the Clean Power Plan rule. The facts are these: In 1963, this Congress passed the Clean Air Act. It was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson and has been amended a number of times on a bipartisan basis to strengthen and enhance the protections that were built into that law when it was, again, enacted many years ago. In fact, in 1990, George Herbert Walker Bush signed the last update and upgrade to the Clean Air Act, which is exactly what the prior administration was proceeding under when they designed the rule. The Supreme Court has weighed in on this question about whether or not greenhouse gases are covered under the Clean Air Act. In 2007, in Massachusetts v. EPA, a Republicanmajority Court ruled in favor of the fact that greenhouse gases are in fact covered under the statutory umbrella of the Clean Air Act. This is what the Court said: 
Because greenhouse gases fit well within the Clean Air Act’s capacious definition of ‘‘air pollutant,’’ we hold that EPA has the statutory authority to regulate the emission of such gases. 
In 2014, the Court reenforced that ruling in a decision written by Antonin Scalia, the godfather of conservative lawyers all across this country, which reiterated the fact that greenhouse gases emitted from power plants are, in fact, subject to the scope and authority of the Clean Air Act. Unfortunately, today, the EPA Administrator is completely striking down that important advance in terms of protecting the public health of this country and putting nothing in place. There is no alternative that Mr. Pruitt is putting out there in terms of trying to get this country to move forward on clean power. It is unfortunate because, as the International Energy Agency announced this morning, for the first time ever, solar energy production now surpasses any other form of power production in the world. The same thing is happening here in the U.S. because of the renewable energy tax credits. In my State of Connecticut, renewable energy solar panel jobs far exceed any other power production job in the State. We are seeing an incredible proliferation of people installing panels on their homes and businesses. The U.S. Navy in Groton, Connecticut, now has solar panels on all Navy housing as well as a solar field to power the Nation’s oldest submarine base, which is there. The decision by Mr. Pruitt is not a progrowth, proeconomic decision. It is simply responding, unfortunately, to political forces that drove this administration to power from the fossil fuel industry. The only saving grace of Mr. Pruitt’s order is that he allows a large and long public comment period for the people of this country who do care about clean air and who do care about our environment to weigh in on this reckless decision that turns the clock back for public health and safety and for our economy. That is where the growth is going to be, in renewables, and not power production of the past. 
It is not a war on coal. Coal production is not singled out in the Clean Power Plan regulations. But what it does say is that any plant, whether it is coal, natural gas, or solar panels, you have got to address the question of carbon emissions. You don’t get to produce that power and then leave a mess behind you. That is a very simple principle that I think every American can understand. Unfortunately, it is about to be torpedoed by the EPA Administrator, who, by the way, was in the courtroom trying to argue against this in the courts back in 2014 and came out on the losing decision. I guess he got his revenge not just on the Court but, unfortunately, all of us who have to live with this terrible rule. Mr. Speaker, again, let’s reverse that decision. Let’s move toward the future with a type of power that will protect the environment and grow jobs. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF TROOPER TIMOTHY O’NEILL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a fallen hero. Tragically, Michigan State Trooper Timothy O’Neill made the ultimate sacrifice in an onduty motorcycle accident. I rise to offer my support and love to Trooper O’Neill’s friends, family, and all who were fortunate enough to know him. As the proud parent of a police officer, I can only imagine the pain you must feel. Words are inadequate at such a time of sorrow, but please know you are in my prayers. Trooper O’Neill was known by his friends, fiancee, and family for his sense of humor, compassion for animals, and deep love for his family. He is also remembered for his commitment to bettering our community and our safety. I ask my colleagues and all those watching to join me in a prayer for Trooper O’Neill; his fiancee, Carli Hicks; parents, Kristine and Michael O’Neill; siblings, Sara O’Neill and Brian O’Neill; and his entire family. May God bless them all. 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF THELONIOUS MONK The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of the most innovative jazz musicians of all time, the legendary Thelonious Monk. This legend, Mr. Speaker, was born in my congressional district in the State of North Carolina, and would have turned 100 years old today. Thelonious Sphere Monk was the second of three children born to Thelonious, Sr., and Barbara Monk on October 10, 1917, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Though Monk and his family left Rocky Mount for New York City when Thelonious was a child, scholars and fellow musicians say Monk’s North Carolina roots had an important influence on the man and his music. Writer Sam Stephenson credited Thelonious Monk’s Carolina roots in the ‘‘Oxford American,’’ writing that Rocky Mount’s flourishing tobacco culture and rail yard was one of the largest in all of the South the year Monk was born. Stephenson speculated those railways may have inspired Monk’s composition ‘‘Little Rootie Tootie,’’ which features train whistle sounds. Mr. Speaker, incidentally, the city of Rocky Mount, North Carolina, is divided between two counties, Nash County and Edgecombe County. The railroad in that community is the dividing line. Every day, the CSX and Amtrak trains come through that community. They have been doing that for a very long time. Those train tracks were first established in 1855, even before the Civil War. It was established as the Wilmington to Weldon Railroad. It was the longest railroad in the entire world, consisting of more than 160 miles of track. It came through Mr. Monk’s hometown. Thelonious Monk began studying classical piano at the age of 11 and showed an early aptitude for the instrument. By the time he was 13 years old, he had won the weekly amateur competition at the Apollo Theater so many times that management banned him from reentering the contest there in Harlem. In 1941, Monk began working at Minton’s Playhouse in Harlem, where he joined the house band and helped develop the school of jazz known as bebop. Alongside fellow jazz greats Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Eubie Blake, and Ruble Blakey, Monk honed his fast and often improvised style that would later become synonymous with modern jazz. Thelonious Monk’s first known recording was made in 1944, when he worked as a member of the Coleman Hawkins Quartet. Monk did not record under his own name, however, until 1947, when he played as the leader of a sextet session for Blue Note. In 1947, he married Nellie Smith, his longtime sweetheart. Two children were born to the marriage, whom they named after Monk’s parents, Thelonious and Barbara. In 1952, Monk signed a contract with Prestige Records, which produced pieces like ‘‘Smoke Gets in Your Eyes’’ and ‘‘Bags’ Groove,’’ which he recorded with Miles Davis in 1954. In 1956, Mr. Speaker, Monk released his third album, ‘‘Brilliant Corners,’’ which is considered by many to be his first true masterpiece. In 1957, the Thelonious Monk Quartet, which included John Coltrane, began performing regularly, with tours across the United States and Europe. By 1964, Monk was popular with the mainstream audience and became one of the four jazz musicians ever to grace the cover of Time magazine. The years that followed included several overseas tours, but by the early 1970s, Monk was ready to give it up. He was ready to retire from the limelight. After battling illnesses for several years, Monk passed away from a stroke in 1982. Finally, Thelonious Monk, Mr. Speaker, has since been inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame and the Grammy Hall of Fame, added to the Library of Congress’ National Recording Registry, awarded a Pulitzer Prize, and featured on a United States postage stamp. Thelonious Monk left a legacy as one of the originators of modern jazz music. That is why the city of Rocky Mount is so proud of their native son. They celebrated this past weekend in various places throughout the city honoring and celebrating the life of this great musician. I ask my colleagues to join me today in paying tribute to an outstanding artist, Thelonious Monk, as his family; the residents of Rocky Mount, North Carolina; and the country prepare to celebrate his 100th birthday. f 
BEAU BIDEN FOUNDATION The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MITCHELL ). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the formation of a partnership between the Beau Biden Foundation and Doylestown Health, which will clear the way for efforts to prevent, recognize, and react appropriately to child sexual abuse in our community. This critical program will be funded through the generous support of the Cowhey Family ShopRite in Warminster and will train local medical staff in the Darkness to Light’s Stewards of Children course utilizing online education tools. There is no doubt that because of the compassionate efforts of these organizations, the Beau Biden Foundation, Doylestown Health, and the Cowhey Family ShopRite in Warminster, Bucks County, children will be safer and our community stronger. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of this vital new partnership and all efforts to protect our society’s most vulnerable. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a lifelong Levittown resident, Christopher Ward, Sr., who passed away suddenly last month. Born in Bristol, Pennsylvania, Chris became an accomplished businessman and a true pillar of our community. With all his success, he strongly supported local small businesses and always rooted for the underdog. People in Levittown will remember Chris as the coowner of Bailey’s Bar & 
Grille and Bailey’s Plaza. But to his friends, employees, family, and all those who had the pleasure of truly knowing him, Chris was a humble, kind, selfless man with a loving, caring heart. He loved to make everyone laugh with his unique sense of humor, but what made him the happiest was being ‘‘Chocolate PopPop’’ and spending time with his family. Mr. Speaker, Chris strove to be the very best father, son, grandfather, uncle, and brother. He will be sorely missed by our entire community. b1215 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize October as Dysautonomia Awareness Month. ‘‘Dysautonomia’’ is a general term used to address any disease that aggravates the autonomic nervous system, adversely affecting the body’s involuntary functions. There are many types of dysautonomia, which can lead to other devastating illnesses, including Parkinson’s disease and lupus. Dysautonomia afflicts nearly 70 million people of all ages worldwide, including constituents in my district like Liz Kennerley. While there is no cure, there are many treatments to improve quality of life, including medications and lifestyle changes. This month, we work to spread awareness of dysautonomia through education, community events, and lobbying, and we inspire family, friends, and neighbors to get involved and to take action. It is necessary that communities hold events for spreading the word about dysautonomia and for funding research to find a cure. It is on us to educate the public about this illness and to race towards a cure. 
UNFAIRLY WITHHOLDING TEACHERS’ SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS EARNED THROUGH SECONDARY EMPLOYMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent thousands of teachers across west Texas who have dedicated their careers to educating and preparing our children for the future. As a former member of the Midland Independent School Board, I understand the impact these selfless individuals have on our communities. Unfortunately, we honor their service to our communities by unfairly withholding Social Security benefits that they have earned through secondary employment. While this policy, known as the windfall elimination provision, was wellintended, it has proven to be illconceived. Many educators have been harmed by the unintended consequences that have created uncertainty and put a damper on the otherwise joyous occasion of retirement. It is imperative that we solve this issue and give our Texas teachers the ability to collect the Social Security benefits that they deserve. I remain committed to working with my colleagues in the House to find a fair and equitable resolution to this issue to ensure that our educators have access to the Social Security benefits and pensions they most certainly have earned. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until 2 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 18 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. GOHMERT ) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. While Members come to the end of a long weekend of constituent visits, bless them and those with whom they consult among those they represent with wisdom, patience, and generosity as they seek law and policy that benefits not only local interests but, where possible, the greater common good of our country. We again ask You to impel those who possess power here in the Capitol to be mindful of those Americans who possess little or no power, most especially in these days those recovering in Puerto Rico. Finally, we are mindful of yet another natural disaster unfolding in California, with massive wildfires. We ask You to protect those who combat these fires and comfort those who have or will lose their homes and possessions. May all that is done today be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. BLUMENAUER led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following resignation from the House of Representatives: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, October 5, 2017. DEAR MR. SPEAKER : Upon further discussion with my family, I have made the decision to resign my position as Member of the House of Representatives for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District, effective October 21, 2017. I am grateful for the opportunity to have served the people of southwestern Pennsylvania and to have worked with the talented and dedicated men and women of the United States Congress. Sincerely, TIMMURPHY . 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, October 5, 2017. DEAR GOVERNOR WOLF: This letter serves to inform you I am resigning my position as Member of the House of Representatives for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District effective October 21, 2017. Sincerely, TIMMURPHY . f 
BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the many women who have lost their lives to breast cancer and those who have survived. As you know, October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. In order to prevent additional loss of life, it is essential that women educate themselves on prevention and receive regular screenings. In 2008, I cosponsored legislation supporting the observance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, in part, to help get the message out that this disease can and does kill men and women of all ages. According to the American Cancer Society, since 2007, death rates in older women with breast cancer are decreasing, yet death rates in women under the age of 50 are steady. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all women watching to get screened regularly for this devastating disease. 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, domestic violence is a scourge. Its physical and psychological effects have lifelong consequences for survivors, their families, and their children. 
I appreciate South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster and Attorney General Alan Wilson, both of whom who are working hard to stop domestic violence in our State, encouraged by Laura Hudson of the Crime Victims’ Council. The Governor issued a statewide proclamation that designates October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Attorney General Wilson’s 20th annual Silent Witness ceremony, which he held last week, honored the past year’s victims of domestic violence at the statehouse. Specifically, the South Carolina Office of the Attorney General works to combat domestic violence through the STOP Violence Against Women program, dedicated to providing representation to victims of domestic violence and raising awareness of the issue; also, with the Pro Bono program, dedicated to providing pro bono legal representation in prosecution of domestic violence cases. Eliminating domestic violence should be something we fight for during the month of October and every day of the year. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
TAX REFORM (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, the last time Congress passed fundamental tax reform, I was 7 years old. It is long past time that our broken Tax Code is fixed and our country gets back on a path to robust and sustained economic growth. As we consider tax reform legislation, we should look to my home State of Indiana for inspiration. During my time as a State senator, Indiana lowered business taxes by nearly 50 percent, and rates are scheduled to fall even further in the coming years. By 2022, the Hoosier State will have the third lowest corporate tax rate in the Nation. At the same time, Indiana has removed many special interest loopholes and carveouts to make the system simple and fair for all Hoosier taxpayers. According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, Indiana has the eighth best business tax climate in the country, a number that will only get better as tax rates continue to go down. The results speak for themselves: Indiana has an unemployment rate below 4 percent, strong economic growth, a AAA credit rating, and a $1.8 billion surplus in the bank. Lower taxes combined with simplicity and fairness—this is the model that we need to embrace if our country is going to return to sustained 3 percent and greater growth. 
NATIONAL FOREST PRODUCTS WEEK (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the tremendous impact forests have on our rural economies and natural environment nationwide. Next week is National Forest Products Week. In Arkansas, we know that growing and sustaining jobs in forest communities begins with ensuring that working forests continue to thrive. Most working forests—over 70 percent—are privately owned by families, small and large businesses, and an increasingly broad array of Americans who invest in forest ownership. When forest owners have confidence in their ability to manage and sell their timber productively, they will continue to grow and invest in forests and provide the foundation for the rest of the forest products supply chain. Federal policies have a significant impact on the longterm economic and environmental benefits we derive from these working forests and the livelihoods of those who own and manage them. The forest products industry represents a key economic driver for rural economies nationwide, totaling nearly $92.8 billion in GDP. In my home State of Arkansas, environmentally friendly forestryrelated businesses support more than 62,000 jobs, with more than $2.4 billion in annual payroll. A strong marketplace for forest products helps keep rural America employed and U.S. forests robust. These healthy forests, in turn, provide crucial habitat for species, filter America’s drinking water, sequester carbon, and provide outdoor recreation opportunities for the public. f 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1858) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4514 Williamson Trail in Liberty, Pennsylvania, as the ‘‘Staff Sergeant Ryan Scott Ostrom Post Office’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1858 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. STAFF SERGEANT RYAN SCOTT OSTROM POST OFFICE. 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4514 Williamson Trail in Liberty, Pennsylvania, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Staff Sergeant Ryan Scott Ostrom Post Office’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Staff Sergeant Ryan Scott Ostrom Post Office’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Montana? There was no objection. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1858 introduced by Congressman MARINO from Pennsylvania. The bill names the Liberty, Pennsylvania, Post Office at 4514 Williamson Trail the Staff Sergeant Ryan Scott Ostrom Post Office in honor of Staff Sergeant Ostrom, who, in 2005, was killed in the line of duty in Iraq. 
Mr. Speaker, I now yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MARINO ), the sponsor of the bill. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation to rename the Liberty, Pennsylvania, post office after Staff Sergeant Ryan Scott Ostrom. Ryan was born on September 23, 1979, in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, where he attended Liberty High School. While in high school, Ryan excelled in soccer, basketball, and baseball—serving as the captain for the soccer and basketball teams. After graduating from high school, he attended Mansfield University and pursued a degree in education science. Ryan planned to become a teacher and a coach to help young people become successful students, athletes, and leaders within the community. However, just months before Ryan was set to graduate from college, his National Guard unit was deployed to Iraq. While serving his country in Iraq, Ryan made the ultimate sacrifice, as he was killed in action on August 9, 2005. Ryan enlisted in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard in 1997, serving with Company B, First Battalion 109th in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Ryan was an accomplished soldier with a bevy of previous accomplishments and commendations. During his time enlisted, Ryan earned a Purple Heart, Combat Information Badge, Gold Star, Armed Service Ribbon, and numerous other awards that gave Ryan the recognition he deserved for his heroic years of service. Beyond these awards, Ryan also took advantage of what the military had to offer, graduating from the U.S. Army Europe Primary Leadership Development Course, which furthered his ability to lead both on deployment and in the communities about which he cared so deeply. While Ryan will always be remembered for his valor and his years of military service, he will also be remembered for what he brought to the communities of which he was a part. In his free time, Ryan could be found playing Monday night basketball with his friends at home and was an active member of the Eagle Base basketball team during his deployment. Staff Sergeant Ryan Ostrom prioritized the world around him—his country, his community, his family— all over himself. His years of service and his record speak for themselves, but beyond that, Ryan made a positive impact as a friend and a role model wherever he was. He was a soldier and leader on his deployments and an active member of the community back home in Wellsboro. Mr. Speaker, I ask that all Members support this legislation to honor Ryan by renaming the Liberty Post Office as the Staff Sergeant Ryan Scott Ostrom Post Office. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 1858, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post Office located at 4514 Williamson Trail in Liberty, Pennsylvania, as the Staff Sergeant Ryan Scott Ostrom Post Office. Born in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, in 1979, Mr. Ostrom graduated from high school and then joined the Pennsylvania Army National Guard while beginning his studies at Mansfield University. A sports lover, Ryan could frequently be found playing and coaching basketball in his free time. In 2002, Ryan joined his father, Scott Ostrom, on a peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, and he later deployed to Iraq with the 109th Infantry Regiment. Staff Sergeant Ryan Ostrom tragically made the ultimate sacrifice in August of 2005, when he sustained fatal wounds from enemy smallarms fire in Iraq. He was, as mentioned, awarded the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Good Conduct Medal, and Combat Infantryman Badge from the Department of the Army, as well as the Pennsylvania Meritorious Service Medal from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to recognize the bravery and selflessness of the honorable service of Staff Sergeant Ryan Scott Ostrom. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 1858, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill in recognition of Staff Sergeant Ostrom’s sacrifice to our Nation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1858. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
SPECIALIST JEFFREY L. WHITE, JR. POST OFFICE Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 452) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 324 West Saint Louis Street in Pacific, Missouri, as the ‘‘Specialist Jeffrey L. White, Jr. Post Office’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 452 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SPECIALIST JEFFREY L. WHITE, JR. POST OFFICE. 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 324 West Saint Louis Street in Pacific, Missouri, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Specialist Jeffrey L. White, Jr. Post Office’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Specialist Jeffrey L. White, Jr. Post Office’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Montana? There was no objection. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 452 introduced by Congressman LUETKEMEYER from Missouri. The bill names the Pacific, Missouri, Post Office at 324 West Saint Louis Street the Specialist Jeffrey L. White, Jr. Post Office in honor of U.S. Army Specialist White, who, in 2012, was killed in action in an IED attack in Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, I now yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER ), the sponsor of the bill. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 452, legislation to designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 324 West Saint Louis Street in Pacific, Missouri, as the Specialist Jeffrey L. White, Jr. Post Office. U.S. Army Specialist White grew up in Catawissa, Missouri, with his parents, Jeff and Paula White, and his brothers, Michael and Kyle. He graduated from Pacific High School in 2008, and enlisted in the Army in October of 2009. Specialist White served our country honorably as a member of the First Battalion, 501st Airborne, Fourth Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, Joint Base ElmendorfRichardson, Alaska, unit. Specialist White deployed for Afghanistan in December 2011, and after serving our country bravely, he gave his life for our country when an IED detonated near his unit on April 3, 2012, roughly one week before he was scheduled to return to the United States. Specialist White was a highly decorated servicemember. His awards and medals include the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army 
Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, and the NATO Medal, among many others. As an avid sports fan, White shared my love of the St. Louis Cardinals. He witnessed their 2011 World Series Championship win shortly before his deployment and was planning to attend opening day in 2012. Specialist White was honored by the Cardinals, who invited his family to raise the 2011 World Championship flag on opening day in his memory. Specialist White was an upstanding citizen and beloved by his family, friends, and community. Hundreds of individuals lined the streets in the pouring rain to honor his final journey home and memorial service. We can never fully express our thanks to our military and their families. Their service and sacrifice for this country goes beyond a level of bravery most people have never seen. While the naming of this post office is not nearly enough to honor Jeffery White, nor will it heal the pain felt each day and every day by the family he left he behind, it is my sincere hope each time the Whites and folks in the Pacific community pass by this building they are reminded of how grateful and how proud we are to call Specialist White one of our own. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Missouri delegation and Pacific community for their support of this designation, and I ask every Member of the House to join us in honoring our hometown hero, Jeffery L. White, Jr. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 452, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post Office located at 324 West Saint Louis Street in Pacific, Missouri, as the Specialist Jeffrey L. White, Jr. Post Office. A native of Missouri, Jeffrey White, Jr. graduated from Pacific High School in 2008, and joined the United States Army. After graduating from basic and advanced training at Fort Benning, Georgia, Specialist White was assigned to the 25th Infantry Division at Joint Base ElmendorfRichardson. He deployed to Afghanistan in 2011, and tragically lost his life in April of 2012, after insurgents attacked his unit with an improvised explosive device. Specialist White was just 21 years old. Specialist White is remembered for his love of the St. Louis Cardinals, as well as his distinguished service, for which he received many awards, including a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. b1715 As an avid Dodgers fan, I think Specialist White would get a kick out of the fact that I am here and that the St. Louis Cardinals are still beating the Dodgers. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the life of Specialist Jeffrey White, Jr., who selflessly sacrificed his life in defense of his country. I urge the passage of H.R. 452, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill in recognition of Specialist White’s sacrifice to our Nation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 452. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
JANET CAPELLO POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2254) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2635 Napa Street in Vallejo, California, as the ‘‘Janet Capello Post Office Building’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2254 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2635 Napa Street in Vallejo, California, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Janet Capello Post Office Building’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Janet Capello Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Montana? There was no objection. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2254, introduced by Congressman MIKETHOMPSON from California. The bill designates the post office located at 2635 Napa Street in Vallejo, California, as the Janet Capello Post Office Building. Janet Capello was a prominent citizen in her Vallejo, California, community. Born in 1935, she served on the city’s Planning Commission, the Civil Service Commission, and the Charter Review Committee, among others. She loved her community, and she gave back in whatever way she could before passing away in 2012. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 2254, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post Service located at 2635 Napa Street in Vallejo, California, as the Janet Capello Post Office Building. H.R. 2254 was introduced this year by my colleague and friend from California, Mr. THOMPSON . Unfortunately, Mr. THOMPSON is unable to be here today, as he has remained in his district in California this evening to assist in wildfire relief and recovery efforts. I am, along with the entire House of Representatives, praying for Mr. THOMPSON and our fellow Americans in this time of need. A lifelong resident of Vallejo, California, and granddaughter of Italian immigrants, Janet Capello took great pride in her heritage. Her deepest passion was the Sons of Italy, an organization where she served as a dedicated member of Lodge Number 1626 for over 63 years. She held two of the organization’s most prestigious posts—vice president of the Grand Lodge of California, and Secretary of the United Lodges—and led efforts to bring the group’s scholarship program to Vallejo. In doing so, she helped hundreds of young men and women attend college. Ms. Capello oversaw a number of charity efforts, and helped raise thousands of dollars each year for Alzheimer’s research in conjunction with the University of CaliforniaDavis. Ms. Capello’s dedication to these causes earned her the Dr. Vincenzo Sellaro Award, the highest honor granted by the Sons of Italy. In addition to these accomplishments, Janet Capello was an active participant in local Vallejo politics, serving on the city’s Planning Commission, the Civil Service Commission, and the Charter Review Committee, and others, and was an active member of the St. Vincent Ferrer Catholic Church until her passing in 2012, at the age of 77. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the life of Janet Capello, and recognize the lasting contributions she has made to the Vallejo community. I urge the passage of H.R. 2254, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2254. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY POST OFFICE Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2464) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 25 New Chardon Street Lobby in Boston, Massachusetts, as the ‘‘John Fitzgerald Kennedy Post Office’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2464 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 25 New Chardon Street Lobby in Boston, Massachusetts, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘John Fitzgerald Kennedy Post Office’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘John Fitzgerald Kennedy Post Office’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Montana? There was no objection. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2464, introduced by Congressman STEPHEN LYNCH from Massachusetts. The bill designates the post office located at 25 New Chardon Street Lobby in Boston, Massachusetts, as the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Post Office. John F. Kennedy was the 35th President of the United States. During his tenure, he is possibly most famous for his handling of the Cuban missile crisis, preventing a thermonuclear conflict with the former Soviet Union. This year marks the 100th anniversary of President Kennedy’s birth, and we thank him for his service to our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. LYNCH ). Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2464, legislation that I introduced back in May of this year to officially designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 25 New Chardon Street Lobby in Boston, Massachusetts, as the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Post Office. This bill reflects the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform’s commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of President John F. Kennedy this year, otherwise known as the JFK Centennial. I would like to thank our former chairman, Jason Chaffetz of Utah; our current chairman, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. GOWDY ); the ranking member, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ); the chairman of our Subcommittee on Government Operations, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS ); our ranking member, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY ); and all of the Subcommittee on Government Operations for their efforts to move this legislation forward. I would also like to thank the entire Massachusetts House delegation for their effort in sponsoring this measure. H.R. 2464 honors the life and enduring legacy of our Nation’s 35th President, John F. Kennedy, and his impassioned commitment to public service, equality, peace and diplomacy, and ensuring a better quality of life for every American. Our special remembrance of President Kennedy this year also affords us a distinct opportunity to reflect on and appreciate his vision and wisdom in the context of the many challenges we are facing as a nation today both at home and abroad. As we grapple with difficult issues ranging from healthcare to economic reform, let us recall President Kennedy’s understanding that: ‘‘For one true measure of a nation is its success in fulfilling the promise of a better life for each of its members.’’ And in contemplating issues pertaining to equality and civil rights, we would be wise to remember President Kennedy’s advancement of the principle that the rights of every person are diminished when the rights of one person are threatened. As we continue to address matters of contention with adversarial nations, we must bear in mind President Kennedy’s admonition and foresight that ‘‘civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.’’ In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to also thank my colleague and friend, Congressman JOSEPH KENNEDY from the Fourth District of Massachusetts, for his work on this legislation as well. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 2464. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the gentleman from California aware that I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill in recognition of President Kennedy’s sacrifice for our Nation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2464. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
ENDY NDDIOBONG EKPANYA POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 294) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2700 Cullen Boulevard in Pearland, Texas, as the ‘‘Endy Nddiobong Ekpanya Post Office Building’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 294 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2700 Cullen Boulevard in Pearland, Texas, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Endy Nddiobong Ekpanya Post Office Building’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Endy Nddiobong Ekpanya Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. GOMEZ ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Montana? There was no objection. 
b1730 Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 294, introduced by Congressman PETEOLSON  of Texas. The bill names the Pearland, Texas, Post Office, located at 2700 Cullen Boulevard, as the Endy Nddiobong Ekpanya Post Office Building in honor of the Pearland police officer who fell in the line of duty in 2015. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ), the sponsor of the bill, so that he can explain the bill. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank my friend from Montana for bringing this bill forward this afternoon. Mr. Speaker, this is a great day back home in Pearland, Texas, because right now this House is about to honor a fallen hero from Pearland, Endy Ekpanya. Endy was born in Nigeria in 1985, the same year I graduated from college. When he was 11, his family left Nigeria to come to America to provide a better life for them. They moved to Long Island in 1996. He obtained a degree in psychology and sociology from Hofstra University in New York and later earned his MBA and master’s degree in criminal justice from the University of Maryland. The call to serve his country and his community never left Endy, which is why, after moving to Pearland, Texas, he enrolled in the Alvin Community College Police Academy. He graduated with the 105th class in December of 2015, and he was sworn in as a Pearland police officer 6 months later. In less than 6 months after December of 2015, his time with us was cut short just 2 days before his 31st birthday. At approximately 4 a.m. on the morning of June 12, 2016, Endy was hit headon by a drunk driver while responding to an emergency call. He was the first officer to die in Pearland while on duty in over 40 years. Endy’s life embodies the selfless dedication of our law enforcement officials back in Pearland. His sacrifice will never ever be forgotten. That is why I am proud that today this House will pass a bill to name the post office at 2700 Cullen Boulevard after Endy. It will be a source of great pride for our local community and will ensure that his sacrifice is remembered for generations to come. This small gesture can’t make up for the loss of Endy’s life. The grief his wife, his young son, and his parents have will never go away. The Pearland community has suffered, but this small gesture is a testament to Endy’s commitment to protect and serve. It will be an inspiration for future generations to strive to improve their community just like Endy did in his short time with us. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill. Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 294, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post Office located at 2700 Cullen Boulevard in Pearland, Texas, as the Endy Nddiobong Ekpanya Post Office. Endy Ekpanya reflected the best of America. Born in Nigeria in 1985, Endy immigrated to the United States in 1996. Here, he obtained U.S. citizenship, a college education, and two master’s degrees. Endy’s deep love of family and community inspired him to join the police force so he could help those in need. He hoped that his hard work in the classroom and the field would help him be a role model for his young son, Julian. As a rookie member of the Pearland Police Department, Officer Ekpanya took his duty to protect his community seriously but always found a way to brighten his fellow officers’ days. Tragically, on June 1, 2016, Officer Ekpanya was killed when a drunk driver struck his police cruiser as he was responding to a call. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor Officer Endy Ekpanya’s dedication to his education, family, and community, and to remember the sacrifices he made while working to protect those he loved. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 294, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill in recognition of Officer Ekpanya’s sacrifice to our Nation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 294. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
JAVIER VEGA, JR. MEMORIAL ACT OF 2017 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 1617) to designate the checkpoint of the United States Border Patrol located on United States Highway 77 North in Sarita, Texas, as the ‘‘Javier Vega, Jr. Border Patrol Checkpoint’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1617 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Javier Vega, Jr. Memorial Act of 2017’’. 
Congress finds the following: (1) A native of La Feria, Texas, Border Patrol Agent Javier Vega, Jr., served his country first a member of the United States Marines Corps and then proudly as a border patrol agent in the canine division with his dog, Goldie. (2) Agent Vega was assigned to the Kingsville, Texas, Border Patrol Station as a canine handler and worked primarily at the Sarita Border Patrol Checkpoint. (3) On August 3, 2014, Agent Vega was on a fishing trip with his family near Raymondville, Texas, when 2 criminal aliens attempted to rob and attack them. (4) Agent Vega was shot and killed while attempting to subdue the assailants and protecting his family. (5) Agent Vega is survived by his wife, parents, 3 sons, brother, sisterinlaw, niece, and dog, Goldie. SEC. 3. DESIGNATION. 
The checkpoint of the United States Border Patrol located on United States Highway 77 North in Sarita, Texas, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Javier Vega, Jr. Border Patrol Checkpoint’’. 
Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the checkpoint described in section 3 shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Javier Vega, Jr. Border Patrol Checkpoint’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 1617. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The Javier Vega, Jr. Memorial Act of 2017 would designate the Border Patrol checkpoint on United States Highway 77 North in Sarita, Texas, as the Javier Vega, Jr. Border Patrol Checkpoint. After serving his country honorably as a United States Marine, Agent Vega joined the United States Border Patrol in 2008. During his time in the United States Border Patrol, he served as a canine handler and was involved in 42 seizures of narcotics and 38 separate cases involving the apprehension of 238 illegal immigrants. He was a man of honor and duty, a man who loved his family, and a man who would give his life in service to his country. On August 3, 2014, in Raymondville, Texas, Agent Vega took his wife, three children, and parents out for a day of fishing. While fishing with his family, two illegal immigrants attempted to rob them. These illegal immigrants had been deported multiple times for various crimes. Law enforcement believed they had conducted a string of similar robberies at the behest of a Mexican cartel. Agent Vega sprung into action to defend his family. While drawing his firearm, Agent Vega was shot in the chest. 
His father was also shot and wounded. Though his family did everything possible to help, Agent Vega, tragically, passed away. On September 20, 2016, Border Patrol determined that Agent Vega’s actions were instinctive as a result of his law enforcement training. He did what law enforcement in America does: he put himself in harm’s way. As a result, his death was determined to have been in the line of duty. This bill honors the service of Agent Vega. He made the ultimate sacrifice for his family and his country. Today, the House will name the Border Patrol checkpoint after him where he and his service dog, Goldie, served. Every day, the men and women of the United States Border Patrol put on their uniforms and put their lives on the line to protect America’s borders. Tragically, as we see in the case of Agent Vega, even when spending time with family, they may be called to serve. On Sunday, President Trump unveiled immigration enforcement policies that will ensure other families will not have to face the devastating loss of a loved one at the hands of an illegal immigrant. I hope Congress can work together to make those proposals a reality. I believe it is more than fitting to name this checkpoint after Agent Javier Vega, Jr. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of my good friend from Pennsylvania, and I, too, rise in support of S. 1617, a bill to designate the checkpoint of the United States Border Patrol located on United States Highway 77 North in Sarita, Texas, as the Javier Vega, Jr. Border Patrol Checkpoint. Javier Vega, Jr., was killed in the line of duty on August 3, 2014, while trying to stop a criminal act and trying to protect his family in Raymondville, Texas. While fishing with his wife, with his children, and with his parents, two men approached him and tried to rob his family. Agent Vega attempted to stop the robbery by drawing his gun, and we know that Border Patrol agents may carry their guns when they are off duty because they are law enforcement officials. He was shot in the chest. Agent Vega was rushed to the hospital after he was shot but died soon thereafter. It was determined that Agent Vega was aware of a pattern of robberies in the area due to his role as a Border Patrol agent and that he identified himself as an agent before he was fatally shot. The U.S. Border Patrol considered those facts and later determined that Javier Vega, Jr., was murdered in the line of duty, ensuring that Agent Vega’s name was enshrined at the Customs and Border Protection Valor Memorial. Agent Vega was a U.S. Marine veteran and had served with the United States Border Patrol for 6 years before his untimely death. He served his country with honor and distinction. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation honoring the life and death of Javier Vega, Jr., by naming this checkpoint after him. I urge my colleagues to pass S. 1617, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1617. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 6:30 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 5 o’clock and 44 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1830 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) at 6 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m. 
REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF S. 585, DR. CHRIS KIRKPATRICK WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT OF 2017; PROVIDING FOR PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PERIOD FROM OCTOBER 16, 2017, THROUGH OCTOBER 20, 2017; AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES MR. WOODALL, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–345) on the resolution (H. Res. 562) providing for consideration of the bill (S. 585) to provide greater whistleblower protections for Federal employees, increased awareness of Federal whistleblower protections, and increased accountability and required discipline for Federal supervisors who retaliate against whistleblowers, and for other purposes; providing for proceedings during the period from October 16, 2017, through October 20, 2017; and providing for consideration of motions to suspend the rules, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘Yea’’ on rollcall No. 559. 
Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, October 10, I missed two votes to attend to constituent business in my district. Had I been present for the day’s vote series, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 558, the passage of H.R. 1858, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4514 Williamson Trail in Liberty, Pennsylvania, as the ‘‘Staff Sergeant Ryan Scott Ostrom Post Office’’; and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 559, the passage of H.R. 2464, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 25 New Chardon Street Lobby in Boston, Massachusetts, as the ‘‘John Fitzgerald Kennedy Post Office’’. 
CELEBRATING THE MIAMI LIGHTHOUSE FOR THE BLIND LEARNING CENTER AND PREK PROGRAM (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Miami Lighthouse for the Blind on its new Lighthouse Learning Center and PreK program. The Miami Lighthouse has served south Florida since 1931, offering life changing programs and resources for those who have visual impairments. President Virginia Jacko and her staff are making history once again with the Lighthouse Learning Center. The Miami Lighthouse is partnering with MiamiDade County Public Schools to provide a comprehensive learning program for preK students using an evidencebased curriculum to support and empower visually impaired students to achieve their potential. Children in this program will receive the training they need to perform at the same level as their sighted peers by the time they enroll in school. Mr. Speaker, it fills me with great pride to recognize Virginia Jacko and the entire staff at the Miami Lighthouse for the Blind for their tireless work in launching this wonderful learning center in the heart of Little Havana, located in my congressional district. 
CONGRESS NEEDS TO REAUTHORIZE CHIP FUNDING (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, since 1997, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, has provided lowcost health insurance for millions of children across the United States of America. Unfortunately, in another apparent sabotage to our Nation’s healthcare system, Congress failed to reauthorize CHIP funding before it expired on September 30. Without immediate action, States will soon have to curtail care for our neediest children. In my home State of Illinois, alone, over 295,000 children rely on CHIP for everything from routine checkups to immunizations. Congress’ continued failure to reauthorize this critical program is jeopardizing the wellbeing of millions of America’s children. Congress will be going into recess again next week without taking any action to reauthorize this bipartisan and essential program for children. Meanwhile, millions of kids could go without care because of our failure to act. We must do better. f 
MICHIGAN’S UPPER PENINSULA CELEBRATES 40 YEARS OF COMMUNITY REVITALIZATION (Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 40 years of community revitalization in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. When Kincheloe Air Force Base closed in 1977, a renewal of the Saulte Ste. Marie community began as it transitioned from military to civilian use. These 40 years stand as a testament to the hard work and resilience of the folks of Chippewa County, who have overcome the job loss and revenue loss associated with Kincheloe’s closing. The transition from military to civilian is not always an easy one, but I am proud to represent a region that has remained focused on investing in the future of our communities. On this anniversary, we not only celebrate our current successes, but we also remember the contributions of our past. Kincheloe Air Force Base played a significant role in shaping our national defense and making our community into what it is today. We are forever grateful to the Chippewa County community for preserving that history throughout these 40 years. 
TRUMP RAMPS UP DEMANDS FOR NEW DACA DEAL (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleague from Illinois and demand that the Children’s Health Insurance Program that will help millions of children have healthcare be reauthorized now, and certainly it should be done before we leave for the work recess. I also want to hold up the headline of the Houston Chronicle that says: ‘‘Trump Ramps Up Demands for New DACA Deal.’’ Sometimes we think that these are just statements that don’t impact people’s lives. The name of the young lady on this front page is Karen, who watches her parents work 17 hours a day, trying to ensure that the children who came here through no fault of their own can be contributing Americans. We stood together yesterday with 122,000 in the State of Texas. We thought we had a reasonable deal to be able to work together to help these young people. But with the ridiculous demands that have been made by this administration—$15 billion border wall, cutting legal immigration, sending out the door unaccompanied children—it is absolutely ludicrous. Does anyone care about human life. Then we stood together with the chief of police, the sheriff, the constables, and Moms Demand Action and fought against ridiculous nonregulation of guns that can kill people, military guns. We need gun safety legislation, and we need to do it now. f 
THE VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL TRAVELING WALL VISITS CENTRE COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, I had the opportunity to participate in both the opening and the closing ceremonies for the traveling version of the Vietnam War Memorial Wall. The traveling wall was in State College last Thursday through Sunday, and it was a truly moving experience for all those who visited. The theme for Centre County was ‘‘Welcome Home.’’ We all know that in many instances, our Vietnam veterans did not receive a warm welcome home when they returned from war. This is a scar on our history and one that we are working to heal. The traveling wall serves as a reminder of the efforts to promote liberty and freedom that our Vietnam veterans put forth. It finally recognizes their struggles and thanks them for their service after years of underappreciation. Mr. Speaker, the wall tells the story of so many Americans. They were sons and daughters. They were our friends and our neighbors. They are American heroes. It is never too late to honor our veterans to ensure that they receive the recognition that they deserve. 
RELIEF EFFORT IN PUERTO RICO AFTER HURRICANE MARIA (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, what a privilege it has been for me to know and do my best to help community leaders in Lorain, Ohio, who have been engaged in the Puerto Rican relief effort following Hurricane Maria. Lorain Councilman Angel Arroyo, along with many of our constituents, have been organizing local shipments to Puerto Rico. Last week, working with celebrities like Bravo TV star Bethenny Frankel, Councilman Arroyo helped arrange seven truckloads of aid that were flown in on a private charter airplane. Human stories from relatives across that vast region focused on the tragic lack of aid, especially within the vast interior parts of that island. Our district has the largest concentration of Puerto Ricans in Ohio, and families are very worried. FEMA is not doing its job, and the Trump administration should get an F for all of the citizens of this country that are being left behind. Victor Leandry of the Lorainbased nonprofit El Centro noted that his sister and brotherinlaw live in a smaller city, Ponce, and, as of this weekend, they still had no power. I include in the RECORD a letter from a constituent’s family member detailing the dire situation: no water, no electricity, no radio contact, with families’ life savings destroyed, their crops and their land as well. We need to address the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico. What is happening there is unAmerican. The Trump administration better wake up and help the citizens of this country. 
Hi My parents live in Lares Puerto Rico in the Barrio called Palmallanos. November will make two years since they moved back ‘‘home’’. They worked since day one to get their land aka finca to what it was when my grandparents owned the home. They did a great job. They had Banana and Avocado trees. Had just planted roughly 200 coffee trees and couldn’t wait to watch them grow. They had planted different herbs as well as squash and beans. All of that was lost on September 20th when Hurricane Maria ripped straight down the island. I could not get in touch with my parents for two long weeks. Finally I received the call I had been waiting for. While my parents are safe and their house is intact, they lost everything on their land. They had some flooding in the home and a shed they had their washer and dryer in had its roof ripped off and flooding. The river that runs through their land rose so much that my dad could not sleep concerned that it would rise to their home. Fortunately it did not, however due to the rains and winds the house did get flooded, but they were able to work for hours nonstop to get the water out. After two weeks they are still without running water, electricity and phone service. They drive 30–40 minutes to get cell Service as well as go get water. They have to take whatever containers they have to fill up. They have received no additional assistance. They went to the market and were lucky enough to get a bag of rice and some canned goods. They have enough propane to have one warm meal a day and the rest of the time they eat whatever they have in cans or other non perishable items. They boil water to drink and shower with rain water. As for eating any dairy or meat, well they haven’t in two weeks. They are concerned to eat any meat they could get from the store for fear of getting sick due to no electricity anywhere and the inability to keep anything cold. When getting gas, they waited in line for 2.5 hours and a letter they had mailed me on 9/24 finally arrived on 10/6. They have not received mail and are not able to get packages. I asked if they wanted to come and stay with me and my family and they said no. Why? Well, they are afraid of leaving their home due to looting. They want to keep what they have left. I know my parents are strong people, but honestly, I don’t know how much longer anyone in their situation can make it. Prayers for Puerto Rico. SENYKERFONTA . f 
NEIL ‘‘SUDS’’ SUTHERLAND, A DEDICATED FIREFIGHTER FOR 53 YEARS (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding constituent and volunteer firefighter from the 22nd District, Neil Sutherland, otherwise known as ‘‘Suds.’’ Neil has been a member of the Stittville Fire Department since 1965 and fire chief since 1998. Throughout his 53 years of dedicated fire service, Chief Sutherland has led the Stittville Fire Department to become one of the most wellrespected departments in the State. Stittville Fire Department is also one of the busiest fire departments in our region, handling over 220 calls a month. Incredibly, Chief Suds Sutherland has responded to 90 percent of those calls. Chief Sutherland is also an active player on the Stittville Volunteer softball team, the undefeated league champions for the past 3 years. Recently, Chief Sutherland was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. On Saturday, I had the honor of joining our community and the Sutherland family at a beautiful ceremony benefiting Chief Sutherland and his dedication and service to our community. Tragically, medical research shows that firefighters have a much greater risk of contracting cancer due to increased exposure to smoke and toxins. Chief Sutherland’s enduring spirit and unwavering commitment to community is an inspiration to us all. I ask everyone to join me in sending our thoughts and our prayers to Chief Sutherland, otherwise lovingly known as ‘‘Suds,’’ and his family during his courageous battle to beat cancer. 
b1915 PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PLAYING A DANGEROUS GAME (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, $15 billion for a wall. I thought Mexico was going to pay for it. Mr. Speaker, President Trump is playing a dangerous game with North Korea. He is playing a dangerous game with American lives. The President probably thinks he is being clever when he taunts Kim Jong un and calls him ‘‘little rocket man.’’ The President probably thinks he is a tough guy when he threatens to rain down fire and fury on North Korea. But the President is not clever, and he is not tough. A clever President would know that peace is preferable to war. A tough President would understand that threatening war with a highly armed, petty dictator makes the United States look weak and risks American lives. President Trump’s saberrattling could draw the country into nuclear war that no one wants. If the United States is drawn into a war for the President’s ego, people will die, Americans will die, and thousands, if not millions, of North Koreans will die. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MITCHELL ). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ALTO ‘‘BUD’’ ADAMS, JR. (Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Bud Adams, who passed away at his home on Adams Ranch in Fort Pierce, Florida, on September 22. He was 91 years old. Mr. Adams was a largerthanlife cowboy. He was a fixture in Florida’s agriculture community, and the patriarch of Adams Ranch, a 4generation family operation that spans 80 years and spreads across 50,000 acres in Florida in four counties. After serving in the Navy in World War II, Bud began managing Adams Ranch with his father and quickly became a legend among Florida cattlemen for innovations like the development of the Braford breed of beef cattle, a breed capable of withstanding Florida’s hot and rainy summers. He has also served as the president of the Florida Cattlemen’s Association and is a member of Florida’s Agricultural Hall of Fame. He was an avid outdoor photographer and awardwinning conservationist. He has shown a generation of farmers and ranchers and admirers like me that it is possible to work the land while still preserving God’s beauty. Bud is survived by his loving wife, Dot, of 67 years, his three sons, his 14 grandchildren, and his nine great grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, Florida has lost one of its greatest sons, and it was an honor for me to serve him here in the House. 
FAA REAUTHORIZATION IS CRITICAL (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 21st Century AIRR Act. This critical FAA reauthorization offers the best possible plan to finally modernize our antiquated air traffic control system. I recently traveled to Ottawa, Canada, with congressional colleagues to learn firsthand how Canada’s private air navigation service provider has been efficiently and safely moving 12 million aircraft each year since 1996. This model consistently upgrades and improves air traffic control technology and isn’t subject, as it is in the United States, to onerous government procurement rules. It is clear that this system works far better than its U.S. counterpart. These reforms would also benefit the environment, as the updated technology allows for more direct routes. For instance, in Canada, over the last 20 years, this has resulted in 1.4 billion fewer gallons of fuel that have been used just in the last 10 years, and twice that amount in the last 20 years. This needed change has widespread bipartisan support, and it would guarantee consistent funding for modernizing our air traffic safety system. 
WE CANNOT REST UNTIL CAITLAN COLEMAN AND HER FAMILY ARE FREE (Mr. PERRY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago today, Caitlan Coleman, an American citizen from York County, Pennsylvania, which I am privileged to represent, was taken hostage by the Haqqani Network, an offshoot of the Taliban, while hiking near the Pakistan and Afghanistan border. Caitlan has given birth to two boys while in captivity, boys whose only life experience has been that of a hostage and surrounded by violence and fear. I speak with Caitlan’s mom and dad regularly. While my heart breaks for them, as fellow Americans, as a father with children of my own, I am crestfallen and horrified for them. Caitlan and her family are Americans. We cannot rest until they are released and returned safely to the arms of the United States. I urge my colleagues to join me in praying for the safe return of Caitlan, her husband, and her two children, but also for her family and loved ones for whom time stopped 5 years ago. I implore the U.S. State Department to use every resource at our disposal to bring our American citizens home. RECENT DISASTERS THAT HAVE BEFALLEN OUR AMERICAN PEOPLE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, there are so many things that we need to talk about. Important events are spilling upon Americans, just cascading upon us. We could spend hours and, indeed, should spend hours talking about North Korea. We should and will spend hours talking about tax reform, or tax reductions, or serious benefits for the superwealthy in America, and we will talk about that. We will debate that. But what is on my mind right now are the disasters that have befallen our American people. We think about what has happened over the last 11 months— floods on the East Coast, people forced out of their homes as the rivers rose in the Carolinas. We think about California, and the massive floods, and the 200,000 people who were evacuated from their homes in my district. We think about the recent hurricanes as they slammed into Houston, Florida, the Keys; and Hurricane Maria, as that hurricane devastated Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. These traumatic disasters are now in our memory, but they are also our reality. In California today, in my district, and in my colleague MIKETHOMPSON ’s district, thousands of homes have been burned to the ground and people have died. These disasters are not new to America, and, over the years, we have set up a mechanism to deal with them. That mechanism is the firefighters across this Nation who respond, the emergency plans that have been put in place. I know during my period as insurance commissioner in California, I would often arrive at these disasters, some of which go back more than 30 or 40 years, and console people who will have lost their home and attempt to deal with their insurance issues. And I would always remind those who were in the path of these flames, or hurricanes, or tornadoes, to be prepared; that Boy Scout motto: Be Prepared. And now, in California, the same message goes out by the first responders and, indeed, by myself here on the floor of the House of Representatives: Be prepared. Be prepared to evacuate. Think about what it is you need to take ahead of time, those important papers, those scrapbooks, those photo albums, the dog, the cat; and when the time to go arrives, when that message arrives on your cell phone, or on the loud speaker from the police car out in front, obey it. Get out. Get out because you have already prepared. Yes, you should have had that insurance policy that you forgot, that flood insurance program. Yes, you should have had it. And all too often, we have to rely upon the generosity of charities, and, thankfully, they are there. And we also rely upon the Federal, State and county governments. Today, here in the House of Representatives, and in the Senate, as well as in the administration, we are beginning to gear up for yet another emergency appropriation to pay for the relief efforts that are underway. It is not going to be enough. It may take care of part of what occurred in Houston, or in Florida, or in the Keys. It is certainly not going to be enough to take care of the devastation in Puerto Rico. And I know, as the fires continue to rage in California, the appropriations that are being discussed, the emergency money for FEMA, will not be enough. While we are looking at these disasters and the billions upon billions of dollars that will be needed to rebuild the infrastructure, to rebuild the schools and hospitals, to pay the bills for the emergency work that is going on, this House of Representatives, this week, is in the process of trying to figure out how to pass a massive tax cut that will take trillions of dollars of revenue away from the Federal Government. It is estimated anywhere from $2 trillion to $5 trillion, depending upon the details, over the next decade, will not be available for the next disaster. Will it be added to the deficit? Possibly. Will those revenue reductions be balanced by cuts to Medicare? Yes. It is already being discussed. It is in the Republican budget. Will those $2 trillion to $5 trillion reductions in revenue be added to the deficit, or will we cut Medicare? They tried to do it in the Affordable Care Act, now they are coming back with a budget bill that would cause it to happen again—more than $1.5 trillion pulled out of the Medicaid program. And so there will be another disaster, a slowbuilding disaster of millions of Americans who will not be able to get healthcare. So, added on top of the burden of rebuilding America, the emergency appropriations to pay for the ongoing and past disasters, we need to be aware of the inconsistency of thought that is going on here. We are looking at an appropriation bill to pass something in the range of $15 billion, in addition to the previous $12 billion, which we know will not be sufficient to deal with the existing disasters; to say nothing of the billions of dollars that are owed to the counties and States for disasters going back, at least in California, 10 years, where the Federal Government has yet to reimburse the counties and State for the obligations that the Federal Government accepted, in some cases, a decade ago. 
b1930 In the face of all of that, we are going to reduce revenues to the Federal Government. Who gets the tax breaks? Well, here is a fact that the Vice President—excuse me, Mr. Speaker, if I might—has suggested in California: that it is the poor that will get the tax break. Not so. They will get a little, to be sure. The middle class is likely to get a tax increase. But the real tax break, the top 1 percent get 80 percent of those revenue reductions. Eighty percent will flow to the top 1 percent of America’s wealthy. So if you are concerned about income inequality, you better be paying attention. One must wonder: What is the logic of what is happening here? What is the logic? In the face of disasters that have occurred, historically, but more recently within the last year—floods in California, floods in the Carolinas, hurricanes, fires, tornados in the Midwest— in the face of all of that, we are going to massively reduce the ability of the Federal Government to respond. It doesn’t make much sense to me, particularly when the beneficiaries of those tax reductions are the superwealthy. I think it is 2,500 families in America that would benefit from the elimination of the estate tax—2,000plus families. It is some $6 billion to $9 billion of revenue lost every year so that 2,000 superwealthy families don’t have to pay an estate tax. What is going on here? 600,000 lowincome housing vouchers gone so that they can pass on their wealth to the next generation. Income inequality. In the face of the disasters, we need to stop for a moment as we begin the appropriations process for the FEMA emergency appropriations. We need to stop for a moment and consider the way these two things work together. I was in my district, Davis, California, for an event on Sunday, and I had several students—some of whom are my interns—come to me and say: What are you going to do about the student loans? There is a lot of happy talk around here that we are going to make higher education free. It is a great idea. It used to be that way when we were building the economy, when we knew, if we educated people, we would have a strong, growing economy. But tell me, in the face of a $2 trillion to $5 trillion reduction in the revenues to the Federal Government so that the wealthy can get wealthier, how are we going to ever reduce the cost of education to Americans? I don’t know. Maybe somebody has the answer here. It doesn’t seem clear to me that that could be happening. I am going to introduce a bill again this week—one that I introduced in the last session—that is kind of based upon the fact that Americans across this Nation are able to refinance their homes at a lower interest rate. It is a great idea. I have done it. I suspect many of the people who are listening, and certainly many of the Members of Congress, have refinanced their home to get a lower interest rate. But if you have a student loan that may have been from 5 or 8 years ago, or you are about to sign a document this fall for a Federally financed student loan, you cannot refinance that. Why? The Federal Government—there is $1.3 trillion of student loans out there. Nearly $900 billion of that $1.3 trillion is owed to the Federal Government. Why don’t we refinance those loans? What if we were to do that? What would it mean to the students out there who are paying 5, 6, 7, 8 percent interest to the Federal Government that is able to go out and borrow money for 10 years at 2 percent? That is a pretty good margin. Even the fat cats on Wall Street can’t have a margin that big, but the Federal Government does. So these students are paying these high interest rates so that the Federal Government can literally profit on their backs. That is a fact. Let’s allow those students to refinance those student loans. Let’s just see what happens. The Federal Government can borrow money at less than right around 2 percent—maybe a little less right now; add a percent for management fees, 3 percent; reduce all of the student loans, $800 billion, $900 billion of student loans. The government would go out and borrow it at 2 percent for 10 years and tell the students and those who are no longer in school: We are going to allow you to refinance. Take an interest rate that may be half of what you are getting now. By the way, why are we charging a fee to these students so that they could borrow money? Don’t we want them to get an education? Don’t we want them to be able to improve themselves? Yet we require a fee. So let’s eliminate the origination fees. It is as though the Federal Government were some sharks out there dealing with home mortgages. No. We are dealing with students and their lives. If we can do this, maybe it is a couple of thousand dollars over the life of that loan that that student can then invest in their life and in their family. These are things that are possible. These are things that we ought to be doing. There is just a lot of happy talk around here: Oh, we are going to make education free. It would be good if we could. We could if we don’t cut the Federal revenues by $2 trillion to $5 trillion over the next decade. Eliminate origination fees. Save lowincome borrowing. It is all possible. The art of the possible ought to be what we are doing, not the art of enhancing those who are so wealthy already. I am going to paraphrase a fellow that is pretty important in American history. FDR said something like this: The measure of our success is not that we do more for those who have much, but, rather, that we do for those who have little. So what of this tax cut that we are going to spend this week and next week, this next month, and, according to our Treasury Secretary, we will be done by the end of the year? So what does it mean? It means maybe a small tax break for the working men and women of America. It means a huge tax benefit for those who are already wealthy; the elimination of the estate tax. It has been estimated by The New York Times that based upon our President’s tax returns of a decade ago—by the way, he won’t show us his present tax returns—that he could benefit to the tune of $1 billion with his proposed tax program. Not bad if you can have it. But is that good public policy? I don’t think so. I don’t think so; not in the face of the needs of America. We have enormous defense needs. We have been fighting wars in the Middle East for almost three decades now. There are other needs that we have for our military. You only need to listen to the Secretary of Defense and others as they talk about the need to rebuild much of the American military. The admiral responsible for the Pacific Theater says that he needs something rather important: munitions. Munitions. Wow. Yes, we have needs. We have students who are paying interest rates far higher than is necessary, unable to refinance their Federal student loans because the law doesn’t allow it. But it is possible. In fact, it would make a lot of economic sense. These young men and women might actually start a family; might actually be able to buy a home or a car, start a new business, start a small business. There are a lot of possibilities. But the superwealthy need another tax break? I don’t think so. I don’t think so at all. And I don’t quite understand the happy talk by our leaders of this administration who like to say: Not to worry. You are going to get to deduct the first $25,000. Well, yes. And then what? Oh, by the way, there is this 20 percent increase in the bottom tax rate, from 10 percent to 12 percent. That is a 20 percent increase. At the top tax rate, it goes from 35, unless you are able to maneuver into their little scheme where you can actually reduce your tax rate to 15 percent by being an LLC—a limited liability corporation— or a subchapter S corporation. Well, if you have the money to hire a good accountant and a lawyer, there are a lot of ways you can scheme and scam. And if you are a corporation, some of our largest corporations are able to hire the lawyers and the accountants and duck their taxes entirely. 
The list is long. The list is actually rather maddening. Apple, GE, AT&T, and others, the big ones, their tax rates are down in the zero or in the less than 10 percent range, and they want more. So Puerto Rico is devastated. My counties in California are facing rampaging fires, and perhaps as many as 2,000 homes have already burned. There will be another tornado and another hurricane. The question for us is: Will there be the money for the Federal Government to provide the support that we should do to help Americans rebuild? That is a fundamental question. I know that there is a better way. I know that in the proposal that our Republicans have put forth there will be less money for infrastructure. I know that if you want goodpaying jobs, the construction industry has goodpaying jobs. I know that for every dollar we spend on infrastructure, the economy will grow by $2 or more and have a foundation for future economic growth. I know that when we rebuild the infrastructure of our communities that have been devastated by hurricanes, tornados, floods, and fires, that the communities can come back strong and the economies for those communities can flourish. I know that it takes a strong American Government to make that happen. Mr. Speaker, as we enter this week, my heart and thoughts go out to those millions of Americans who have been devastated by the hurricanes, floods, and fires; those people in my district who have lost their homes, and those who have lost their lives. I come here to the floor to say: Let us think seriously about what our obligation is to Americans, to those who have little, to those who have lost everything. What is our obligation to them? FDR was correct: The measure of our success is not that we do more for those who have much, but, rather, that we do for those who have little. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
b1945 THE RULE OF LAW The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to be recognized to address you here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives and to discuss the topics that are on my mind. Hopefully, you will consider these arguments as well, Mr. Speaker. I know that people across this floor and across the country have a lot of these same considerations in mind. I want to come to the floor and address the DACA situation and take you through a little bit of the history of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals which was implemented by Barack Obama in an unconstitutional fashion. He knew it, and all of America knew it. We know that Barack Obama, 22 times, said that he didn’t have the constitutional authority to implement a program that granted the equivalent of amnesty—at least temporary amnesty—let alone a work permit which he added to the program by executive edict, fiat, or order. Instead, it requires legislation in order to enable such a policy. A President can’t grant amnesty. A President can have prosecutorial discretion. Prosecutorial discretion is a legal term for what the Justice Department does when they are determining whether the resources they have to prosecute crimes are adequate to enforce against the most serious offenders. Barack Obama, President Obama, did implement some of those relatively prudent policies with prosecutorial discretion. He prioritized the most violent and evil criminals that he could identify, at least by policy. He turned a lot of them loose too, by the way, onto the streets of America in the course of all that. So it was a very confusing policy that emerged without consistency under President Obama. However, he exercised a legal prosecutorial discretion when they looked at each case on an individual basis. But I recall when his Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, came before the Judiciary Committee to testify about this program on DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—or some might say the deferred action for children of aliens. Her testimony and the memos that came down, the Morton memos, set up four different categories of people who would be granted a quasiamnesty underneath the President’s policy. There, Secretary Napolitano testified over and over again, and it reflected the document itself which, seven times, referenced on an individual basis only—on an individual basis only— seven times. I can repeat it for the RECORD , Mr. Speaker, but that is what was going on, which told me, as I listened to her testimony and had read the documents prior to the testimony, that they knew what the law said. They knew it required—that it required—an individual basis only and a prioritization of applying the law to bring about the best effect of the utilization of the resources of the Justice Department. Yet Barack Obama, President Obama, around the country multiple times, in the 1
1⁄2or 2 years building up to his implementation of the DACA policy, multiple times he said that he didn’t have the constitutional authority to implement the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Multiple times. It turned out to be at least 22 that we have a videotape on. The most recent that I recall was in a high school just outside of the Capitol here in Washington, D.C., where he was speaking to a high school group. He said: You are smart students. You know that there is a separation of powers. I don’t have the authority to grant this legal status to people who are here illegally even if their parents did bring them in or even if they came in on their own under the age of 18. I don’t have the authority to do that. That is Congress that has the authority. I should remind everyone, Mr. Speaker, that President Obama taught constitutional law. He was an adjunct professor teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago. The University of Chicago has a good reputation for understanding the Constitution, and Barack Obama demonstrated that when he said: You are smart students, and you know that we have three branches of government, a separation of powers. Congress is Article I. They make the laws. He said: I am Article II, the executive branch. My job is to enforce the laws. And Article III is the judicial branch of government. They interpret the laws. So when the courts interpret the laws that Congress writes, the executive’s job is to carry them out. He knew he was violating the separation of powers because he defined that to America multiple times. But he did anyway. I believe that President Obama made a calculation, a political calculation. The political calculation, in my estimation, was that he could get away with it. He wanted the policy, but Congress wouldn’t pass the policy because we have great respect for the rule of law, and we don’t want to reward lawbreakers. That happened in 1986, and we are paying the price for that amnesty act of 1986. He couldn’t get the DREAMers legislation through Congress, so he calculated that he could get away with implementing that as a policy even though he knew it was unconstitutional. So some of us went to work to initiate lawsuits to have the courts strike down the executive edicts of Barack Obama that was the foundation for DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. As it wandered through the courts. The lead in the primary case was Chris Crane, the president of the ICE, Immigration Custom Enforcement, union. His name was on the case first. It was Crane, et al. v. Napolitano, et al. in the beginning. It went through the courts, and by the time you follow it through a circuitous route, you find out that Crane, et al. v. Napolitano, et al. got shifted off to the side. It was declared to be a decision that had to do with the administrative rules that if he had a grievance, he had to take that grievance through the administrative rules process rather than through the courts to address the policy itself. So it got parked off on a side rail, so to speak. Then we saw a parallel case come forward, the DAPA case, the Deferred Action on Parents of Americans was how the President described it. I would have said parents of aliens myself. But that 
case was found by Judge Andrew Hanen down in Texas to be unconstitutional. It was a very similar and parallel case. The President couldn’t grant amnesty to parents of children who were here, and the President couldn’t grant amnesty to children who came here. That same constitutional principle applies to both. We know that Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, and others with about 9, 10, or 11 other State attorneys general, had prepared to file a suit to litigate the DACA case in parallel fashion that DAPA was litigated successfully. They set a date of September 5 and said to the President: If you don’t end DACA by September 5, we are filing this case. So that is about the day and probably exactly the day that President Trump came out with his decision on DACA. I moved too fast forward, Mr. Speaker, and I need to back up to what happened. Barack Obama, President Obama, finished out his term while growing the DACA recipients by hundreds of thousands. By the time he finished his term, that number was estimated to be over 700,000 recipients who get a little card that says: You get to stay in America for 2 years, and there won’t be any immigration law enforced against you as long as you don’t commit any of these serious crimes, felonies, or a nasty combination of three different misdemeanors. Then also he created out of thin air a work permit. Now, Congress isn’t going to grant work permits to illegal aliens, but Barack Obama did. Congress isn’t going to grant a ‘‘come out of the shadows and stay on the streets of America’’ permit for DACA recipients, but President Obama did. He went outside. This Congress should have had its back up. I am frustrated. I am frustrated with the lack of conviction on the part of the Members of this Congress. Mr. Speaker, you stand in here once every 2 years, and you take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. That includes acknowledging that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land. It includes the requirement that you understand the difference between Article I, Article II, and Article III. Article I writes the laws—that is all of us here and over in the Senate. We write all of the laws for the United States of America. That is how the Constitution starts out: The legislative powers shall be reserved for we here that are the Representatives in this Republic of the American people. We are as close to the people as anybody who is elected in the Federal Government right here in this House of Representatives—435 of us. That is what you take an oath to is that you are going to protect the Constitution of the United States. You should at least be able to defend Article I, the very authority that is the reason that you are here serving in the first place, Mr. Speaker. Then we have an obligation also to look over the shoulder of the executive branch and have oversight over the function of the executive branch and conduct hearings and bring witnesses and dig into the methods and the effectiveness of the President of the United States, our Chief Executive Officer, in carrying out the execution of our laws. The President of the United States takes an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. But also it requires that he takes care that the laws be faithfully executed. Now, that means carry them out, not kill them off. It looks like he was trying to kill off the Constitution rather than carry out the laws that are described by this Article I, Congress. By the way, some of the laws that President Obama defied and gave orders to defy and to ignore were signed into law by Bill Clinton. So the legitimacy of the United States Congress and our effectiveness has been diminished by President Obama who went outside the bounds, the lines that are drawn between legislative authority, executive authority, and judicial authority. Now, our Founding Fathers set that up to be a static relationship. They expected and believed that the courts would be the weakest of the three branches of government. They expected also that since you always have ambitious people reaching for more power, they wanted to divide that power, and they wanted to restrain the power. That is why we have the system that we have today. That is why we redistrict every decade. That is why they called for a census so we can count all the people of America and set up congressional district so that there is a proportional representation in each of the 435 seats here offset by two Senators from every State so that we have a geographical representation—a small population State with a big voice or maybe a big population State with the same kind of voice—over in the United States Senate. But here in this Congress, in this House, everyone has roughly the proportional same number of constituents, and your vote means the same amount here that it does for each one of us, whatever your particular role is. So this was set up to have this balance of power. What our Founding Fathers envisioned was each branch of government would jealously protect the power vested in it through the Constitution. They didn’t imagine that there would be a Congress that would be in opposite—they actually didn’t imagine the twoparty system, as I understand some of the history that I read, but they didn’t envision that there would be a Republican majority in the House, a Republican majority in the Senate, and a Democrat President who clearly, openly, and blatantly defined it in advance and then violated the Constitution. Our Founding Fathers never expected that this House of Representatives would sit on its hands and simply let that Constitution be violated for 2 years or longer just on DACA alone. But that happened. I brought amendments to the floor time after time after time that cut off the Federal funding that supported the unconstitutional acts of the President of the United States. Those amendments passed off the floor of the House of Representatives, and they were killed off over in the Senate. b2000 Our Founding Fathers did not imagine that the Constitution could be openly, defiantly, and blatantly violated and not have this Congress hold together and shut off the funding. The power of the purse is the power of bringing that President back in line and making him keep his constitutional oath. The will wasn’t there. As I went before a committee to present an amendment to get Rules Committee consent to an amendment, I reminded everybody on that panel: You all took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. If you meant it, if you take your word seriously, if your oath to the Constitution means anything, then not only do you have to open the door so that my amendment comes to the floor and we have an opportunity to debate it and force a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives, not only is that the case, if you don’t support this, then your own oath to the Constitution is called into question. By the way, Mr. Speaker, I just remind people that I chair the Constitution and Civil Justice Subcommittee. There are a couple of reasons for that— more than a couple—and I have defended this Constitution every day that I have been here in this United States Congress, and I take it seriously. My father used to lecture the Constitution to me at the supper table. He would bring out the Constitution, set it down at the table. He would bring the Code of Iowa and set it down at the table. The Bible would be on the end table. The Constitution and the Code of Iowa would be on the kitchen table, and he would open it up and say: Now, we are going to trace back for you how ‘‘pick your law out of this book’’ gets back to the Constitution. Where is the authority for ‘‘pick your law out of this book?’’ He would debate that and discuss it with me. That is where I learned that I shouldn’t ever utter an opinion that hasn’t been thoroughly thought out. He was the most effective critical thinker I ever met in my life. But he steeped me in the great respect for the rule of law and a great respect for the supreme law of the land, our Constitution, and the structure that is guaranteed in the Constitution: a republican form of government. That, Mr. Speaker, means a representative form of government, where the people select their Representatives and send them off to be their voice here in this Congress. 
It was a fantastic piece of wisdom and historical knowledge that put this together in the fashion that it did. Now we have not just the oldest constitution on record, but we have the most successful constitution on record. You can put this altogether. I believe that our Founding Fathers, as they put this together, were inspired by God to write the Declaration, to fight the war, to shape the Constitution. I think that our Founding Fathers were moved around like men on a chessboard to bring about this fantastic country that we have. A big part of this fantastic country is the rule of law. When I write ‘‘rule of law,’’ for years, I capitalized the word ‘‘rule.’’ I capitalized ‘‘rule’’ with an ‘‘R’’ and ‘‘law’’ with an ‘‘L’’ so that it stands out on the page, so that it looks as important as it is when you read the phrase: rule of law. Rule of law is an essential component of American exceptionalism. It is a pillar of American exceptionalism. If you think about what went together to make this great country that we have, I would add up a whole series of things. I would trace our American exceptionalism back all the way to Mosaic Law. The Mosaic Law was borrowed by the Greeks. The Greeks kind of teased each other: Well, that isn’t your original law. You borrowed that from Moses. Well, they had great philosophers and they added to the culture, but the law came out of Moses from the Greeks to the Romans. The Romans set up republican forms of government. They also had a very good and healthy rule of law so that, at least in theory, they applied that to everybody. That rule of law spread across Western Europe by the Romans all the way to Ireland. When the Dark Ages came— the Visigoths sacked Rome in 410 A.D. When that happened, historians, more or less, called that the signal of the world falling into the Dark Ages. For several hundred years, not much happened that was reported to us. People lost the ability to think and reason in the fashion that they had from among the Greeks and among the Romans. Christianity had to get itself spread into all of that and then emerge. It did emerge. It emerged sometime shortly before the end of the first millennium. It became the Age of Enlightenment and the industrial revolution. We know, Mr. Speaker, these courses of history that have followed, but I would just point out what happened in America. In America, we are about ready to celebrate—we did it on Monday, because it was a Federal holiday—Columbus Day on October 12, the day after tomorrow. It happens to also be my wife’s birthday, Mr. Speaker. There are a couple of reasons we should celebrate Columbus Day. He discovered the Western Hemisphere. He did so because he had a vision that the Earth was round and not flat. He was able to convince Ferdinand and Isabella that they should invest their capital in three ships to send him across the seas in the hopes that they would circle all the way around to India and maybe find a passage to come back. They could trade and be an even richer nation than Spain was. By the way, that was the same year that the Spanish threw the Moors out. That is when the kingdom of Ferdinand and Queen Isabella was established in a more stable fashion than it had been prior to that. They found the money for Christopher Columbus. He discovered the hemisphere. After that, we saw a lot of Spaniards emerge. They focused down in the south, in the Central American region, in the Caribbean, and settled in that area going south and north from the isthmus. They brought with them Christianity. They were driven by the idea of spreading Christianity around the world. That went on through the 1500s, where they were settling and developing in that part of the world, and conducting some atrocities as well, Mr. Speaker—just to address what otherwise somebody would ask me to yield and listen to. Yes, they had some atrocities. They began to develop and bring Western civilization, though, to the New World. The other end of this thing, in 1607, the first people who settled and built a permanent settlement in the North American continent were there at Jamestown, just down the road from us a little ways. It was 1607. The Christians who landed there came for religious freedom. They sat across there on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean and they knelt at that cross and prayed. The prayer was: Lord, thank You for sending us to this new land. We hear Your call and we call out to You to guide us and bless us. We will listen to the mission that You delivered to us, which is to evangelize all people here and around the world and to settle this continent to please You. That is the summary of the prayer. If you read that prayer, you can see and hear manifest destiny in that prayer. You can see religious emancipation in that prayer as well. They knew why they were here. A country that is formed by people who have powerful faith, as they did, and then you have the pilgrims of Plymouth Rock in 1620, and the rest of America was built out. As the colonists began to throw off the yoke of King George, they still retained essential principles. The essential principles would include those of the Magna Carta: the idea that a man’s home is his castle and that the law has to be applied equally to everyone. King John wasn’t happy to sign that, by the way, but I think it came down to: It is your head or your signature. Why don’t you decide, King John? He decided his signature. It has been a long time ago since the Magna Carta was signed, but it laid a foundation for the pilgrims and the settlers who came to America. They came here for religious freedom and to get away from the yoke of the old country, Great Britain. We should remember that the pilgrims who came in on the Mayflower didn’t sail out of jolly, old England. They sailed out of Leiden in the Netherlands. Several years before, they sailed the Atlantic Ocean. They pulled out and went to Leiden in the Netherlands. There, several hundred of them lived around in the area, in a community, in various different houses and apartment complexes that were there. A lot of them went to church in Pieterskerk, which is the church in the center. They staged themselves until they were ready to go across the Atlantic Ocean to settle and land at Plymouth Rock in 1620. These early settlers were driven by religious freedom. As they began to build their farms, their shops, and trade and build ships along the coast and our harbors, we reach the year of 1776. Then, of course, we know the Declaration was on July 4 of that year. But there is another seminal event, Mr. Speaker, and that is Adam Smith published his treatise on free enterprise capitalism. The name of it is ‘‘The Wealth of Nations.’’ No one has surpassed that document at this point. If you allow people to keep their own goods, earn their own profits, invest that, he explained with utter clarity how it will improve the productivity—they will invest it in efficiency—and how the invisible hand, that is the person who is buying the loaf of bread off the shelf, if that shelf is empty, you put more bread on there and sell more. If you are selling more than you can make, you raise the price a little. If somebody thinks you are making too much money, they start up their bakery. They get their bread on the shelf, and then it competes with each other. The shelf is always full of bread and the consumers get a product that they demand. That is the concept of free enterprise capitalism. I don’t hear anybody talking about that today. We also developed here a meritocracy. If you have freedom, you can be rewarded for merit. We don’t talk about meritocracies anymore. We give out participation trophies for kids. They don’t really want them to be winners or losers, just participants. That is not the American way. The American way is: we get in, we compete. There is bound to be a lot of losers because there is only one winner at the end, but the losers all learn something and so does the winner. If the winner gets complacent, if the winner gets lazy, then the others who are competing are going to pass up that former winner, and he is going to have to get a little sharper in his game. That makes us all better. When I look at my neighborhood, Mr. Speaker, I see that we have got some counties in particular that have excellent competition between the public 
schools and parochial schools. They have a number of different churches to choose from. They have a lot of banks that will loan money and compete with each other to invest back in the communities so entrepreneurs with ideas or families that need a bridge to the next month or two can have something to bridge them through that. This is the kind of competition that I see. It is not just sports competition, but it is academic competition, it is competing for students, it is competing for tuition dollars, it is competing for the business investment dollars among the banks, it is churches competing for the faith and competition to save the maximum number of souls, and it is a very healthy environment. If you take competition out, this goes flat and the vitality that exists today and just the vibrant humming of the lives that I am thinking of would be gone. It becomes complacent. I fear that is where America is going: if we are afraid to compete, we are afraid to defend our values. Free enterprise capitalism. I think every college campus in the country has some professor who will speak against it. Some of them have many professors who speak against it. They are teaching against free enterprise capitalism. They are teaching socialism. They are teaching Marxism. They are rejecting conservatism. By the way, I can’t find a school in the country today that has an effective course on Western civilization itself. That doesn’t mean they aren’t out there. This is just me asking questions of people who should know the answer to that. They are saying: I can’t name one, unless it would be Hillsdale College or maybe Liberty University. I grew up in an era where every school had multiple courses on Western civilization. Because we understand our culture, we respect it. We know that, without Western civilization, the world would be so void of the contributions that came from Western civilization. Sometime a year ago last summer, I found myself on a panel at MSNBC, Mr. Speaker. One of the panelists said: One could be an optimist and hope that this is the last Republican convention where old White people have anything to say about it. There is no way to let a comment like that pass. So I pointed out: Charlie, that is getting a little tired, this criticism of old White people. I would challenge you to name another subgroup of people who have contributed more. Then the lady on the panel started fanning herself. She was getting the vapors because I defended Western civilization. The host leaned over, almost with a leer, hoping that I would take the bait, and she said: More than White people. And I said: More than Western civilization itself. Western civilization is everywhere that Christianity has laid the foundation for civilization itself; where Christianity has been the footprint that has laid down the foundation of Western civilization itself. b2015 And you don’t have western civilization without Christianity; you don’t have a successful history without Christianity; and you don’t have people that abide by the moral laws so we don’t have to have a lot of legal laws. You can’t not manage a people of 300 million people and think you are going to get that done effectively if they fail to be a moral people, a people that reach over and pay forward and take care of their families and their friends and their neighbors. I see it all over this country, Mr. Speaker. I have been to all 50 States in this country, met people in all 50 States. I have gotten behind the steering wheel in 48 of the 50, and I see good people, great people day after day after day that get out of bed, and all they want to do is help somebody. And they don’t care about credit; they don’t care if anybody ever notices it or sees it; they just want to help somebody. That is what makes this country turn and work the way it does. If we wonder, we should take a look at the hurricanes that we have suffered in the South and all across, from Texas, Louisiana, and now Mississippi the other day, and Florida—Irma. American people, some people fled out of the hurricane and some people come to help, and I imagine there is a traffic jam there from time to time. But I am so grateful that we have the American character that it is. American character is a cando spirit, people that—I know that I had a banker visit me one day, and he showed me a picture. Actually, I met him at the airport. He showed me a picture of their bank, and the water was ready to run in the door of their bank. They had a flood that flooded the whole downtown. He said: Don’t send us anything. We can handle this. It is only a flood. I have been back to that community, and he was right. I am glad we have people like that, these spirited Americans who are part of a culture that is a cando culture. And I don’t want to lose it, Mr. Speaker. I don’t want to lose it by devaluing any of the pillars of American exceptionalism. Now, I will just list a few others. Aside from the rule of law, there is freedom of speech, religion, assembly, the press. There are all of those together in the First Amendment, and they are put up there in the First Amendment because, without them, without an open dialogue, without ideas having to compete in the public square, then we don’t test those ideas, and our Founding Fathers understood that. They wanted debate to take place here on the floor of the House of Representatives. They wanted debate to take place in the Senate. They wanted these ideas to be tested. For me, I have long believed that I should engage in debate; and if I can’t sustain my position in debate, I only have two choices: I can either adopt the other guy’s position, or I can go back and do my homework and get that research done, up my game, so to speak, and be prepared to defend myself for the next round. That is usually what happens if I am not able to defend myself. But over the years, I pay a little more attention to preparation than I used to when I was younger, and so that is how it is, and the best ideas can be sorted forward. Sitting in a meeting here, we can be discussing these ideas; somebody brings up an idea, might get knocked down like that. I don’t think the public gets to see how many ideas are not successful in competing with other ideas, but sometimes there is a power structure, too, that is involved. What troubles me is when good ideas can’t have a fair hearing because others want their idea to come through to have their name on it. That is a bit of a side issue, but I point that out. So freedom of speech, religion, press, the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances, First Amendment, all pillars of American exceptionalism. Second, the right to keep and bear arms. We have had a lot of discussion about the right to keep and bear arms, but our Founding Fathers put that provision in the Bill of Rights, not so that we could hunt or collect or target shoot or even defend ourselves. The Second Amendment is in our Constitution so that we can defend ourselves from tyranny, from a future tyrant who would come in; and if they confiscated our weapons, then they can force anything upon the people of this country. History has proven that over and over again. The first thing a tyrant does is go after your guns. The second thing they do is they go after all the other rights, and pretty soon you are a subservient people. Imagine North Korea or Cuba to get a model or an example of that. And you can go on up the line: the protection against unreasonable search and seizure, constitutional right. I am naming pillars of American exceptionalism. Without them, we would not be an exceptional nation. There is no pillar that we can pull out that the edifice wouldn’t tumble if we lost our First Amendment or Second Amendment or Fourth Amendment. Our Fifth Amendment, we have lost a part of it already with the Kelo decision, Mr. Speaker. The Fifth Amendment says, ‘‘nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.’’ In the Kelo decision, the Supreme Court ruled—I believe it was a 5–4 decision. And I know that Justice Scalia dissented, as did Justice O’Connor in one of her last major dissents that she had written, but the Supreme Court essentially struck out—I will say, de facto struck out—the terms ‘‘for public use’’ from the Fifth Amendment. 
They ruled that a locality could condemn private property and hand it over to another private interest, provided they had a government interest and the private interest being successful. And so they could take, let’s say, a senior lady’s home, a whole tract of land, and force that into the—and confiscate that and put it into the hands of a private investor. That decision is a horrible decision that weakens American exceptionalism, weakens our property rights in America. I had a private conversation with Justice Scalia, and he told me that he expected the Kelo decision to be reversed one day. But to amend the Fifth Amendment, effectively, by a decision in the Supreme Court, ‘‘nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation,’’ this private property was taken not even for public use, but for private use. Now, they didn’t write in there ‘‘nor shall private property be taken for private use’’ because that was a given that that would not be the case. It is absolutely implied in the Fifth Amendment itself, but the Supreme Court ruled the way they wanted to rule, and they have weakened a pillar of American exceptionalism. Trial by jury, no double jeopardy, you can go up the line. The powers that are not enumerated in the Constitution are reserved, respectively, for the States or the people. All of these are pillars of American exceptionalism. Free enterprise capitalism, another pillar of American exceptionalism. And, by the way, if you take the naturalization test, there is a series of flashcards, laminated flashcards, and these flashcards, you can hold them up and you can ask these aspiring citizens some questions. And part of some of the questions are this: ‘‘Who is the father of our country?’’ And then you flip that card over and it says: ‘‘George Washington.’’ ‘‘Who emancipated the slaves?’’ ‘‘Abraham Lincoln.’’ ‘‘What is the economic system of the United States of America?’’ It is on a flashcard: ‘‘Free enterprise capitalism.’’ That is under assault. Our religious values are under assault. Our family values are under assault. The very definition of the Constitution itself is under assault, and Barack Obama landed some heavy blows to it while he was President of the United States. So as we began bringing forward a nominee who could compete effectively and hopefully be elected to the Oval Office as President of the United States, 17 Presidential candidates came through my State. Many of them I knew before they announced, and I think I can say that all of them I knew by the time they got through with their campaigns. Out of that all, hard fought, there was a platform that was hammered out, and Donald Trump earned the nomination. His platform is awfully close to the platform of T EDCRUZ, who was the second to the last man standing, and that platform is a platform that I appreciate, I respect, and I worked for, Mr. Speaker. I have watched as Presidential candidates can see themselves as President of the United States. They may not have all of their positions hammered out when they present themselves as candidates—in fact, I don’t know if any of them ever actually did have all their positions hammered out when they presented themselves as candidates—but they give their speeches. There is a crowd reaction. There is some polling information that is there. They have a team, a team of advisers. We all talk to them and we try to convince them of the priorities that they should be bringing forward. In the end, throughout all of this, by the time you get through the national convention and confer the nomination on your Presidential candidate, there is a platform to run on from June or July on through, all the way to November 8 it turned out to be last year. Donald Trump’s platform was clear. He said to me, one day, about the events that he has done for me—and I am very much appreciative of President Trump and the times that he has come in to help me politically, Mr. Speaker. He made that reference in a discussion among several of my colleagues, and I said: Yes, you helped me, and I appreciate it, Mr. President, but I markettested your immigration policy for 14 years, and you knew how Iowans were going to respond and how most people across the country were going to respond because I market tested it. And he did a great job with it, and he gave it more clarity than I have given. But throughout all of that, it was: build the wall and secure our borders and enforce domestic immigration law and reinforce ICE and reinforce Border Patrol and CBP, put that all together, and the birthright citizenship. Support English as the official language. These are just some of the pieces along the way, and we have refined some of this since then. And also, it was the New IDEA Act, the act that denies deductibility for wages and benefits paid to illegals, and let’s see IRS come in and do the enforcement through the normal audit process. So if the IRS came in under the New IDEA Act and did a normal audit, they would run the Social Security numbers and other pertinent information of employees through EVerify. If EVerify confirmed that these employees could legally work in the United States, the employer will get safe harbor for having hired them; if they couldn’t verify it, the employer gets 72 hours to cure, we see, 72 hours to correct the record. But, if he is hiring illegals, then the IRS would say: All right. But you can’t deduct this $10,000, $20,000, $100,000 that you paid this illegal, and so we are going to have to charge taxes on that because that deduction is not a business expense; it is actually income instead. So the tax that would be applied to that $100,000, so to speak, plus interest, plus penalty, and it would turn your $10anhour illegal into about a $16an hour illegal. That is the essence of it. And we require, also, that the IRS and the Social Security Administration that is collecting Social Security deposits from workers all across this country, sometimes multiple sources on the same Social Security number— I mean, scores and scores of people on the same Social Security number. Social Security stopped sending out nomatch letters some years ago under the Obama administration. We put that all back together, and we require the IRS communicate with and trade information with the Social Security Administration to target and flag those false Social Security numbers. And then also bring the Department of Homeland Security to the table so that the IRS, Social Security Administration, and the Department of Homeland Security are all working together to cooperate to enforce immigration law and denying, then, the deductibility of the employer. The employer will have all kinds of incentives to clean up his workforce. In fact, we have a 6year statute of limitations that compiles or accrues over the years. And so if you are sitting there with a 6year potential liability, you are going to want to be with a clean workforce. That is another piece that is a policy that the President has been for, at least in the past. Now, things move on, but we are—we have an immigration policy that became part of the platform for the President of the United States, and in that policy and throughout, there are multiple times in speeches he announced that he is going to end DACA. He is going to end DACA, and we all expected that that would happen at noon January 20 of this year when the President was inaugurated out here on the west portico of the Capitol not very far from where I stand right now. That would have been consistent with his campaign promise: build the wall, and the unconstitutional DACA. And so while he was signing executive orders—and I give him credit. He went to the Oval Office, and at least he had a formal signing of multiple executive orders that day, launched his Presidency with work right on the spot instead of—he shortened up the parade for himself and went to work for America. Hats off to President Trump for that, and I support his entire agenda, and I am going to do my best to help him keep his word on that entire agenda. But we found out weeks later that DACA permits were still being issued, and they were still being extended, and those permits also included work permits. 
b2030 So President Obama’s unconstitutional DACA—deferred action for children of aliens—program was continued, and it continues actually to this day under the Trump administration, completely in contradiction with the campaign promises he made. I would say many more times than Barack Obama made the statement that he didn’t have the constitutional authority. Barack Obama violated the Constitution. President Trump has continued that violation. And I am calling upon him to keep his campaign promise, restore the respect for the rule of law; and DACA, by the executive action, just sign it off and end it. If we fail to do that—and I have worked for 31 years to restore the respect for the rule of law with regard to immigration. In 1986, Ronald Reagan signed the Amnesty Act. At least he was honest about it. He called it the Amnesty Act. I listened to what I could on the debate from the House and the Senate. And I didn’t believe it would pass either Chamber, but it passed both Chambers, and it was messaged to President Reagan’s desk. I read the material and I thought that through. I thought: I don’t have to worry about this. Ronald Reagan will know that, if he signs the Amnesty Act, it does great damage to the rule of law and it will take years to restore it. Now, the deal was to be that if you sign the Amnesty Act, we will give you the reinforcement and will enforce the law from this point forward, and illegal immigration will no longer be a problem in America. That is what the deal was. They promised us that this Amnesty Act in 1986 would be the last one ever, that they were going to then set about establishing respect for the law. Well, it seems to me that most everybody in this Congress has lost any memory they may have had about what was going on in 1986. Things haven’t changed. There is nothing really new under the Sun. Human nature is human nature. It is what it has been for 2,000 or more years. But when there is a promise made that is ‘‘first you give us this, and then we will see to it that you get that,’’ let me see, we had Ronald Reagan’s successor, Bush 41—George Herbert Walker Bush, a great American as well—who took the promise and said: ‘‘Read my lips: No new taxes.’’ He said that more than 22 times, too. But when it got to the point where he was wanting to get some spending cuts, the Democrats went to him and said: Do you know what? We have to raise taxes if you are going to get spending cuts. We will follow through on our part of the deal if you just sign the tax increases that they pass. So Bush 41, dealing honestly and straight up in believing that the people he was dealing with had the level of integrity that he had, signed the tax increase in exchange for the promise of the spending cuts. And we all know the answer to that, Mr. Speaker. We know the story. When you make a deal like that and you don’t have the things on the table that you are supposed to get for that deal, never comes first. You don’t see them. So George H. W. Bush 41 signed the tax increase. He violated his pledge of: ‘‘Read my lips: No new taxes.’’ Not only did he sign that and not get the spending cuts, but they beat him over the head with that at his reelection. He lost his reelection because of it, and we ended up with Bill Clinton. I think that lesson should be enough to make us all smart enough to know not to make a deal like that. Ronald Reagan recanted and regretted that he signed the Amnesty Act because of the damage he did to the rule of law when he signed that. There were to be 1 million who would be recipients of the Amnesty Act of 1986. It turned out to be 3 million because, let’s say, the estimates were wrong, but there was a lot of fraud and corruption, and people slipped through because we didn’t have tight enough security on it. So 3 million people got amnesty in 1986, and that was a path to citizenship—a fairly short path to citizenship—as well. I have talked to some of them, and they say: It was great for me. And some of them think that amnesty for another group of people is all right. But if the law means nothing to someone and they violate the law, or it is an obstruction and they slip around that law, or, as we have today, some number that is 750,000 to 800,000 DACA recipients, they are demanding that we grant them amnesty. Illegal aliens came here to the Capitol, right out here on the grass, 2 weeks ago, on a Monday, gathering around, demanding that Congress grant them amnesty. Now, how do you go to a foreign country and be unlawfully present in that country and you go protest to the government that they should ignore their own laws because you have something that you want that you slipped across the border to have access to? And I do not buy the idea that most of these DACA recipients are kids. The average age is 23. Some of them go all the way up to 37. Some of them are bald. Many of them have gray in their beard. Some have a build like mine. I don’t think of them as kids when I look at them. Yet there are some who came across the Rio Grande River on their mother’s arm. And, no, they didn’t know and they didn’t form intent. But there are a whole lot of them who would qualify under this, who did have intent and did know. And we know there are a whole lot of them also—and I have witnessed this with my eyes and helped to collar some of them as this goes on, and I have walked through the desert and seen the burlap backpacks that they haul marijuana in into the United States. And it is not only marijuana. But some of these will qualify under DACA. Drug smugglers will qualify. And they say: We will do background checks. Well, how do you do a background check on somebody who doesn’t have a legal existence in their home country? If there is no record of them existing there, then they will say: Well, we didn’t find anything negative. Of course not. The person didn’t exist. I know I had an individual I wanted on my Hispanic Advisory Committee. A smart, personable, young businessman. I said: I would like to have you sit down and I would like to hear your advice. I would like to have your finger on the pulse because I want to know what is going on in the minority communities, and I want to make sure that I am doing a good job of representing them, too. And he said: That is fine. I am interested. And I said: But before I put you on this committee, I have to make sure. So I want to see—and he said he was born in America—no. Excuse me. He said he was born in Mexico, but he is a naturalized citizen. And I said: Well, I would like to see your birth certificate. And he said: Okay. I can get it for you. And I said: How long will that take you? And he said: Well, it will only take me a few days. What do you want the birth certificate to say? Now, that is a legal document, and you don’t get to ask that question if you have respect for the rule of law. I just dropped him as a potential candidate on my advisory committee. And a year or two later, I found out that ICE had come in, picked him up, and deported him. I didn’t know that he was illegal, even at that time. I just didn’t trust him any longer when he asked me that question. So that is another individual that could have been, and may still be, qualified to be a recipient. Those that come across the border, I have gone down and looked into the jail cells of the Border Patrol, and there were hundreds there at the times that I have been there—hundreds of them. They are sorted between children, women, men. And the men far outweigh the numbers of women or children. Some of the numbers we looked at were 80 percent men. Some of these men will present themselves as under 18—many of them will. And I have seen the cell with those minor males that are in there. And some of those, supposedly, minor males have gray in their beard. They would also qualify, or at least apply for. And if we didn’t have a way to do a background check on them—and many cases we don’t—and they give you a false name, what do you do after that if they had never been printed? They would qualify. And MS–13. We know that there have been a significant number of MS–13 
gang members, who also are DACA recipients. That has been published multiple times throughout the last couple of years. So many people that we would want to get out of this country would be granted a path of citizenship to stay in this country. That is why it is so wrong. And it disrespects naturalborn American citizens. It even more disrespects naturalized American citizens, who came here the right way, applied the right way, and spent maybe 7 years to get in a position where they could take the naturalization test and then the oath; which is a grand day, by the way, Mr. Speaker. I look forward to every opportunity I have to speak to the naturalization services that take place in the Federal building in Sioux City, Iowa. And I always tell them: Remember this date that you became an American citizen, and I want you to memorize it. I hand them a Constitution with the date on it and my signature on it. Hopefully, they will have the reverence for the Constitution that I and many have developed as well. But we have a vigor that comes into America. These are selfselected people. If you have ten kids growing up in a family in Bangladesh or Ireland or Italy, or wherever it might be, and one of them has the inspiration to come to America, you are going to get the one who had the greatest aspirations, the one with the strongest ambition, the one with the deepest convictions in themselves. The most cando sibling out of 1, 5, 6, or 10 is the one that has the dream to come to America. So they line up and come here legally. And they built this country for over 200 years. We need to respect the rule of law that they came here to embrace. We have people who are leaving countries that don’t have the rule of law, that are corrupt. And when I go to Mexico, I see the problems down there. Any country that I go to, I can put together a formula to put that country into the First World from the Third World, except for corruption. How do you address the corruption? Law doesn’t mean law in Mexico and points south the way it does in this country. If you get pulled over by the police, they might pull you over because they might need an extra tip that week. You may not be speeding, you might not have run a stop sign, they might just pull you over, and you have to pay the ‘‘bribe,’’ ‘‘mordida.’’ That is corruption itself. That doesn’t happen in this country hardly ever because we get their badge number and they are out of a job. No country is free of corruption, but we have a healthy country with a rule of law. It is a pillar of American exceptionalism. We cannot, Mr. Speaker—and my message is to the President—we cannot reward lawbreakers. It destroys the rule of law. Our hearts cannot be leading ahead of our heads. There is a DACA recipient that I would like to adopt, if that is what it takes to keep that individual in America. I think that much of that individual. I like this individual a lot and respect this individual a lot, but I love the rule of law. I love the rule of law because, without it, we descend into the Third World. So this debate about, ‘‘don’t you have a heart, don’t you know that these are just 800,000 kids, and can’t we just give them the confidence of having a legal status in America,’’ I say, no, not if you love the country, you can’t do that. And it is not our doing. They either came here of their own volition, formed the intent, or their parents did. The law is the law. We don’t tell the judge: Don’t be putting this criminal in prison because he has kids at home. We don’t worry about the separation of families when it comes to enforcing the law against American citizens, but we worry about enforcing the law against people who have intentional and willfully divided themselves. Now, what happens if we should grant amnesty to DACA recipients and then deport their parents? That splits up the family. I say: Get right with the law, go to your home country and apply to come in the legal way. By the way, when you arrive in your home country, if you truly are characterized for DACA, you will have a free American education that the American taxpayers pay for. You will be bilingual. You will have familial connections in your community. You will have a skill set that is there, a good educational set. You will know what it looks like to live in a country where things work generally right. And if you think of the 7,000 Peace Corps workers that are working in about 130 countries in the world and how much good they do, they go to countries without speaking the language, they don’t know where they are going to land, they find a way to help out and contribute. People going home is not being condemned to hell. People going home is like sending out 750,000 or 800,000 fresh Peace Corps workers back to their home countries. What could be a greater economic development plan for Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua than for their best and brightest to go home and build their countries while they apply to come back to the United States? That is the best solution we can have, Mr. Speaker. And we don’t even have a serious debate on that in here unless I bring it up. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address you here on the floor of the House of Representatives this evening. I am hopeful that we made a little bit of progress. I will continue to defend the rule of law and the Constitution. I challenge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. WORLDWIDE REFUGEE CRISIS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. RUTHERFORD ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO ) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as with any moment in the history of our Nation, in the world, there are tragedies and disasters which sear the conscience and call us to action not only because we are American, but because we are human. Some of these tragedies are man made, others are the work of nature. Some hit close to home, such as the hurricanes that devastated Texas—my home State—Florida, and Puerto Rico, taking many lives and inflicting billions of dollars in damage. Some are the work of one man, like the shooter in Las Vegas, who took 58 lives. b2045 Like many in this Chamber, I have spoken up on these tragedies close to home. Tonight, I would like to speak to a humanitarian crisis far away from us; that is, the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma. Since late August, 500,000 Rohingya have been forced out of their nation. The Rohingya, after being driven out of Burma, have sought refuge in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and India. Some have even come as far as the United States of America. These victims had been driven out of the country their ancestors have called home for hundreds of years through a systematic campaign of murder and rape and the destruction of entire villages and communities. It can be challenging for host governments to care for these displaced populations, which can lead to additional instability, especially in countries with low incomes or with governments already under stress to provide services to their citizens. We see this pattern worldwide. The refugees from the war in Syria have fled to Lebanon and Turkey, to Iraq, and across the Mediterranean to Europe. Over a million Syrian refugees are in Lebanon, which is over onesixth of that nation’s population. Over 3.2 million refugees have found their way to Turkey, and 600,000 in Jordan. Almost 1 million have sought refuge in Europe. There are similar crises in the Central African Republic, Iraq, South Sudan, and Yemen. Millions of people have fled conflicts and instabilities in these regions, usually finding refuge in 
neighboring countries vulnerable to instability. The United States, our own country, has already been affected by instability. In recent years, gangrelated violence in Central America has driven hundreds of thousands of people both to the north and to the south. We remember the tens of thousands of primarily women and children who made their way to the United States and were able to find refuge here. Tens of thousands more, though, remained in Mexico, where the resources to care for these children are scarce. These crises have global consequences, and failure to address them early will eventually affect the United States. The United States cannot afford to treat these crises as events ‘‘over there’’ or just far away. This affects us in a very real way. These events highlight how important the concept of democracy and inclusive governance are. Democratic countries with inclusive governments respect the rights of citizens and address the concerns of even the most vulnerable and least empowered. This is why U.S. foreign assistance matters so much. We invest in the rest of the world and build the capacity of states and societies to govern in a more democratic and inclusive manner. We also empower regional diplomacy through our engagement, allowing regions to address any such instability in a single country collectively. Like many others in the global community, I welcomed Aung San Suu Kyi’s rise to power in Burma a few years ago in 2015. Her election ended decades of military rule when the Burmese military government held elections and promised civilian rule. This kind of democratization, enabled by the persistent diplomacy of President Obama and Secretary Clinton, is a precious and rare event in the world and occurs only now and then. Last year, after the Burmese military drove tens of thousands of Rohingya out of the country, Aung San Suu Kyi moved to establish the Rakhine Advisory Commission under former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. This was an important step towards addressing the concerns of the Rohingya, which includes disenfranchisement, statelessness, and widespread discrimination. The situation today looks far different and far less flattering to Counselor Suu Kyi. This year, the crisis is much more devastating, with hundreds of thousands displaced. I wanted to be able to show you some of these images of the catastrophe the Rohingya face. These are, of course, just a few, but as I said, they sear the conscience and call us to action. This year, the crisis, as I mentioned, is much more devastating, with hundreds of thousands displaced. Like many others in Congress, I have been disappointed in the lack of moral leadership Aung San Suu Kyi has demonstrated. When hundreds of thousands of people are driven out of the country, their villages burned, people slaughtered, women and children raped, I would expect a Nobel Peace Prizewinning leader of a country to take action. Counselor Suu Kyi rose to power because her moral leadership and her persistence in the face of adversity inspired millions. It is deeply saddening and disappointing to witness her lack of action today. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ), my colleague. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding and for bringing up this very important issue. I just want to make a few comments, and I just want to say, what makes the United States exceptional among all nations is the moral courage and leadership we have displayed throughout our history. So many times, in the face of great terror and significant moral crisis, the United States has acted as a force for good. We have supported our allies to restore order where there was once chaos. Where people have been suffering famine and drought, we have stepped up to provide food and water. Time and again, the world has faced crises, and the United States has stepped up to defend the moral good. The crisis in Myanmar presents yet another challenge for the global community, but in this moral crisis is yet another opportunity for our Nation to once again lead. As we speak, the Rohingya people are suffering undue hardship and violence under a government that has failed to uphold the values inherent to a vibrant democracy. It has been reported that an average of 2,000 Rohingya are fleeing the country each day. Denied basic rights for decades, the Rohingya people have been subject to systematic discrimination as a religious minority in a predominantly Buddhist country. The state has gone so far as to completely deny citizenship to the Rohingya people since 1982. Serious accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide have been leveled against the government, which has failed to respond appropriately to the calls for calm and peace. While the government has the right to defend itself against any form of insurgency, common, agreedupon rules of warfare dictate that all civilians be protected. This rule is sacred and must not be broken. Despite this, reports of abuse against civilians are running rampant in Myanmar. More than 200 villages have been destroyed, many burned to the ground by government forces. Communities are being wiped away as hundreds, possibly even thousands, of civilians are slaughtered. The crisis demands our immediate attention. Just recently, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing, and Chairman ROYCE stated plainly: ‘‘This is ethnic cleansing.’’ Mr. Speaker, I must agree. Every conflict is complex, and this one is no different, but it must be made clear that under no conditions should the rights of innocent civilians be abridged. To the Government of Myanmar, we must make it equally as clear that their behavior will not be tolerated. I recently met with constituents from Myanmar in my district office. Utica, the largest city in New York’s 22nd Congressional District, is home to a vibrant refugee community. We are home to the largest Bosnian refugee population in the Nation, a population that was also fleeing ethnic cleansing in their own home country of the former Yugoslavia. My constituents shared with me their personal stories and deep despair over the violence in their home country. They asked that I do all I can to make their voices heard, and tonight I am proud to speak on their behalf. They shared with me horrific pictures of violence and death, of torture of children, of young people, of women, of men, of families. It was simply just appalling. Mr. Speaker, when our Nation faces moral challenges, it is in our nature not to back down. I must insist that this time be no different. I call on my colleagues to stand up and speak out and to act on this important issue. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas and my colleague for highlighting this very important issue. I urge all of my colleagues to understand this is a tragedy of major proportions that is happening in our world today. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas again for bringing this issue to the floor. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative TENNEY for joining me at this late hour to speak on this issue. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, this is so important. I really am grateful to my friend from Texas for doing this. Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for her comments. This humanitarian crisis in Burma, or Myanmar, requires international attention and action, as Representative TENNEY said. The actions of the Burmese State in ethnically cleansing hundreds of thousands of Rohingya demonstrate this need for international action. The most immediate need is to facilitate access by NGOs and international organizations in the Rakhine State. There are tens of thousands of Rohingya internally displaced within the Rakhine State. Violence against Rohingya, including the burning of villages, continues despite international condemnation. Just yesterday, a full month and a half after the beginning of this crisis, 11,000 Rohingya reportedly crossed over into Bangladesh. 
Access by international groups would allow the rest of the world to deliver assistance to the Rohingya still within Rakhine and to help prevent further violence. The United States, in partnership with our allies around the world, must also assist Bangladesh in providing for the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya they lost. This includes food, water, shelter, and medicine. We cannot allow this humanitarian catastrophe to escalate further. We know a political settlement to repatriation is possible. Bangladesh and Burma have arrived at such agreements in the past. The United States and our allies must support the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the Bangladeshi Government’s effort to identify all Rohingya who have arrived. Given the Burmese Government’s reluctance to acknowledge Rohingya as Burmese citizens, leaving them stateless, identification by the United States would assist in repatriation by defining who originates from Rakhine State. The Rohingya have suffered violence and forced displacement for decades. Hundreds of Rohingya villages have been burned to the ground, and they can no longer return to their homes, because in many cases, those homes no longer exist. The full extent of the catastrophe is not yet known, as thousands of Rohingya remain unaccounted for. More Rohingya have fled Myanmar in the past 2 months than remain in Rakhine State. Would the Rohingya want to return if given a chance? What would need to be done to create the conditions required for such a return? Tackling the underlying issues that led to the violent displacement of the Rohingya will take decades to resolve, the most important of which will be a military that lacks transparency or oversight; that is, the Burmese military. Burma’s Government and military currently face a dozen separate insurgencies against forces claiming to represent minority communities. While the Burmese Government has taken steps to reach a ceasefire and political agreements with a number of these groups, continued fighting in various parts of the country undoubtedly contributes to the military’s independence and free rein. Allowing the Rohingya to be comfortable in Burma will require assurances by the Burmese Government to respect the rights of Rohingya to live on the land they have lived on for hundreds of years. This can only come with citizenship for the Rohingya, and greater democracy, where the government is responsive to the needs of the population and respects the human rights and civil liberties of ethnic and religious minorities. Developing a political settlement towards greater accountability in the Burmese Government and citizenship for the Rohingya will be difficult and may take years. Important actions the United States can take include limiting our support for the Burmese military, given their complicity in these crimes. For example, Congress considered expanding support for the Burmese military this year. That will not occur, given the actions of the Burmese military. I also believe sanctions on individuals found to be complicit in ethnic cleansing, including local military commanders, are warranted. Designating military commanders in Rakhine State as Specially Designated Nationals, SDNs, would send a powerful message that these crimes will not be tolerated anywhere in the world, including in Burma. On the other hand, I would like to recognize the immense generosity the people and Government of Bangladesh have shown during this crisis. Over 500,000 people, most of whom are women, children, and the elderly, have fled to Bangladesh since August 25. The Government of Bangladesh has accepted these people and worked to provide for them within the limits of their abilities, while supporting international efforts to address the root causes of the crisis. b2100 Bangladesh, a country not much larger than Iowa, with a population of more than 150 million, faces significant challenges in taking care of this refugee population. The 500,000 Rohingya join hundreds of thousands who have arrived in Bangladesh during previous such forced migrations. Bangladesh has done an admirable job, but the limits on the Bangladeshi Government to provide for these refugee populations are real, and the nation requires international assistance. This includes assistance from the United States, the United Nations, Europe, and Japan. Countries in the region must also step up and provide support for the refugee populations in Bangladesh, especially China and India, which maintain close relationships with both Bangladesh and Burma. As I mentioned previously, we are in an age of accelerated news, and with social media, we are in an age of knowing. Things that were once far away that were hardly seen or known directly or firsthand can now be seen over the internet, on Facebook, on Twitter, on other social media. The pace at which news comes at us now can give us a case of whiplash, and governing in this body and trying to deal with even the things that just affect the United States of America, such as the hurricanes that have hit Texas and Florida and Puerto Rico, can sometimes feel overwhelming. There can be a temptation to hunker down, to look no further than our own borders, to try to solve the problems that confront us not only as Americans but as fellow human beings. These days, with everything going on in our own Nation, sometimes it doesn’t seem like there is a time to take our focus off of our challenges and speak about other things, some of them far away. But it is important that we think about, that we remember, that we reflect, and that we try to solve the problems and challenges of other peoples. It is often said that the United States can’t be the policeman of the world, and I believe that is true. But there are things that call our conscience that do move us to action where I believe that we do have a responsibility to act as the leader among nations in the world. The crisis in Burma, the ethnic cleansing that has victimized the Rohingya people, is one of those instances, and I wanted to speak about it today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues tonight in calling the attention of Congress to the horrific ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya people that is underway in Burma. On August 25th of this year, an illegal armed militant group known as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army attacked police outposts in Rakhine state, Burma, killing twelve people. I condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms. Fortyfive years ago, Pope Paul VI said ‘‘If you want peace, work for justice.’’ Especially in today’s world, I do not believe that armed insurgency is the best path to justice, nor to peace. But let me be clear: the Burmese government’s response to the August 25th attack over the last several weeks has been so disproportionate that one is at a loss to describe it. The military has carried out a massive scorched earth campaign in which hundreds of Rohingya villages and tens of thousands of homes have been burned and destroyed. There are many highly credible reports of people, including children, being shot in the back as they ran, and of rapes, torture and illtreatment. As many as half a million Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh and at least another 27,000 are displaced within Burma. That is on top of the tens of thousands of Rohingya who fled after a previous armed militant attack a year ago. Most of the Rohingya population of Rakhine has now been forced out of the state. 120,000 of those who remain live in IDP camps. Stunningly disproportionate? Unimaginably, brutally, barbarically disproportionate? Flagrantly, inyourface, trytostopme disproportionate? I am left without words. Do I regret the killing of 12 policemen on August 25th? Absolutely. Do more than half a million people deserve to be punished for it? Absolutely not. And please do not talk to me about a ‘‘growing terrorist threat’’ in Burma. The Rohingya in Burma are stateless and subject to the most profound discrimination. They are povertystricken, denied access to education and work, and their movements within the country are restricted—and all of this was true before the militant attacks. The Burmese government has allowed the conditions for radicalization and extremism to 
fester within their country. The current military campaign is only making things worse. What should we be doing? First, all available leverage should be brought to bear on the Burmese military to end its violent campaign against the Rohingya people. Its actions to date are entirely removed from any concept of rule of law and make a mockery of the government’s obligation to protect its people. Second, the government must ensure full and unfettered humanitarian access to Rakhine state. Given the dimensions of the crisis, this means letting in experienced aid organizations in addition to the Red Cross. It also means ending the threats, allegations and misinformation against humanitarian staff that have sparked fear among humanitarian workers, especially national staff, and contributed to an environment in which targeted attacks against humanitarian staff have taken place. Enough already. Third, the Burmese government must grant access to the factfinding mission authorized by the UN Human Rights Council last March, after last ‘‘clearance operation’’ the military conducted from October 2016 to February of this year. Now more than ever, we need an objective international presence on the ground. Fourth, a roadmap to ending this crisis already exists. It’s found in the Final Report of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. International actors, including this Congress, must do all we can to make sure that the Burmese government implements the recommendations included in that report—especially the ones that have to do with ending statelessness and poverty. Otherwise, we should not be surprised if the situation in Burma just gets worse and worse. Finally, we need to be cleareyed about the nature of the Burmese government. I have been among those in Congress who have welcomed the political transition in Burma that began with the 2015 elections. But the events of the last few weeks raise very serious questions about the extent to which that transition is real. As events have unfolded in Burma in recent weeks, a lot of criticism has been focused on Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Laureate and de facto leader of the civilian government. Her defenders have responded that the military still has a lot of power, and that she has to walk a very fine line. But if that is true, what kind of ‘‘democratic’’ government are we talking about? If the military is still in charge—if the civilian government is powerless to stop ethnic cleansing—then we need to recognize that. If not, then let’s be clear about the requirements of moral leadership. Standing by in silence—even worse, downplaying the seriousness of what is happening to the Rohingya people because of political convenience—is not the leadership we expect from Aung San Suu Kyi. Those who want to claim the mantle of human rights leader must defend the human rights of all people.
