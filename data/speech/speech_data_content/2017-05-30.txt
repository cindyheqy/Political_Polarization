Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, today I have the privilege of recognizing the Delaware & Lehigh National Heritage Corridor as it becomes an Affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution. Earlier this year, the heritage corridor completed a five year merger process with the National Canal Museum. As a result of this merger, the Canal Museum’s Smithsonian Affiliate status will transfer to the Delaware & Lehigh National Heritage Corridor. The Delaware & Lehigh National Heritage Corridor, also known as the D&L Corridor, is part of our nation’s National Heritage Area system. The corridor spans 165 miles from the mountains of northeast Pennsylvania through the Lehigh Valley, and it preserves and showcases the cultural resources that are an integral part of this region’s history. As part of its efforts, the D&L Corridor has developed a curriculum offered to 4th and 5th grade students in the area, titled ‘‘Tales of the Towpath,’’ which provides them with the opportunity to explore mid19th Century life along the Lehigh and Delaware canals. By merging with the National Canal Museum, the D&L Corridor is able to utilize the museum’s artifacts and exhibits— including Pennsylvania’s only muledrawn canal boat—to bring its curriculum to life. In addition to the National Canal Museum, the D&L Corridor also includes other important sites such as the National Museum of Industrial History, Historic Bethlehem Museums and Sites, Mercer Museum and Fonthill Castle, and numerous other National Historic Landmarks. For these reasons, the D&L Corridor has achieved a SmithsonianNational Heritage Area Partnership, which is the first of its kind in the United States. The D&L Corridor has worked tirelessly to preserve and promote the rich history and culture of our beloved region in Pennsylvania, and I am proud that it now has even greater resources to share with those who visit. I wish them the utmost success as they pursue this endeavor. 
IN RECOGNITION OF MICHAEL SIMPSON FOR HIS WORK ON BEHALF OF THE DETROIT COMMUNITY 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Michael Simpson, owner and proprietor of Nu Jazz Swingers. Mr. Simpson has contributed to the vibrant jazz culture in Detroit through his work with NJS and in the community. Originally founded in 1976 as the Flying Diamond, the club was renamed the Nu Jazz Swingers the following year and has established itself as one of the premier jazz clubs in southeast Michigan. NJS became a popular destination for AfricanAmerican members of the United Auto Workers, who frequented the club after their shifts at nearby auto manufacturers. Michael Simpson, the club’s owner and DJ, also played an important role in popularizing jazz music by featuring music played by Louis Armstrong, Michael Franks, Bob James and other prominent jazz performers. This helped the club cultivate a loyal following and a reputation as one of the leading juke joints in southeast Michigan. Additionally, Mr. Simpson and NJS are active in the surrounding community, hosting annual Halloween and Christmas parties for children and families in nearby neighborhoods. Mr. Simpson has also supported Detroit youth athletics through donations and sponsorships of local teams. Mr. Simpson’s work has been critical to creating a longlasting establishment in NJS that has contributed to the cultural expression of the AfricanAmerican community in Detroit. Through its popularization of jazz musicians, as well as its Jazzy ballroom nights and other events, NJS has become a wellknown destination and has influenced the culture of Detroit and the surrounding areas. Mr. Simpson’s charitable acts have also provided important aid to local families in need, and his holiday party raises thousands of dollars each year for individuals in the community. Collectively, Mr. Simpson’s actions have had a significant impact on the City of Detroit and its residents and are worthy of commendation. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Michael Simpson. Mr. Simpson’s work as an owner and DJ with NJS has been a key influence on Detroit’s cultural life. f 
IN HONOR OF THE NIAGARA FALLS AIR RESERVE STATION ATTAINING 187,000 ACCIDENT FREE FLYING HOURS 
Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station for their accomplishment of attaining a total of 187,000 accident free flying hours. Since I have been in Congress, Congressman BRIAN HIGGINS and I have worked together to ensure this base is protected for future generations. The Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station sits near the North East international border, near one of the largest populated areas in Canada. In 1970, the base made the transition from the C–119 to C–130 aircraft; a large tactical aircraft primarily used for troop transportation and supply drops, the C–130 can withstand rough terrain and has been a major tactical component for the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station. Not only does the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station provide national security and give those in Western New York a chance to serve their county, it also provides a significant economic boost to Western New York. The base employs over 2,600 people and has an economic footprint of more than $200 million in the Western New York Community. It has been an honor, alongside Congressman HIGGINS, to fight to protect this base, and keep its location in Niagara Falls. These brave men and women were called to active duty to participate in Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. Their professional ism, teamwork and pride for their country enabled them to achieve 187,000 accident free flying hours since 1961. These men and women are not just exemplary servicemen and women. They are your neighbors, your scoutmasters, your children’s coaches, your friends. You notice when they are gone, because they bring their leadership and teamwork skills to everything they do. The 914th Airlift Wing Vision statement is, ‘‘Attain the highest state of readiness in support of the nation and our community through the development of our Airmen to deliver exceptional performance.’’ From the flight crew, to the maintenance crew, everyone must be fully prepared for whatever comes their way. In order for this to happen, they train efficiently, and regard safety as their top priority. I, along with Congressman HIGGINS , applaud their accomplishment, and thank them for their relentless commitment and service to our country. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition of H.R. 1862, the Global Child Protection Act of 2017. Studies completed by the Centers for Disease Control show that 1 in 4 women and 1 in 6 men are sexually abused before the age of 18. Furthermore, these numbers may not be completely accurate—acts of child sexual abuse are often not reported, and experts agree that incidence is higher than what is discovered by authorities. These acts can be detrimental to youth, multiple studies have shown that child sexual abuse victims are twice as likely to develop mental health conditions. In my home state of Georgia, 800 children suffered from sexual abuse in 2015. As a member of the Congressional Missing and Exploited Children’s Caucus, I am in 
strong support of giving law enforcement any and every legal tool they need to protect children and punish abusers. However, as someone who is passionate about criminal justice reform, I cannot support the current version of this bill. Crimes against children are pathetic and disgusting, and those who hurt children must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. While we want to protect these vulnerable individuals, it is also important to consider the legal ramifications of this bill. We are considering a bill that would impose a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment in many cases. Repeat offenders should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. However, I do not believe that mandatory minimum sentences are an effective solution. Congress does not know the facts of every case—but the judges will. That is why I do not support legally binding judges to give mandatory sentences—but instead giving the judges the freedom to consider each option available. Again, I fully support the goal of this bill— punishing those who commit horrible crimes against children. However, if we are going to make such substantial changes to U.S. federal code, I believe that this bill requires more discussion. In its current form, I cannot support H.R. 1862. I would encourage my colleagues to vote NAY on this resolution. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the ‘‘Balancing Trade Act,’’ an important bill that requires U.S. policy to take the trade deficit seriously. This legislation provides actionable steps to rebalance our trade deficits with countries with which we have a deficit of $10 billion or more for three consecutive years. Following the Trump administration’s recent Executive orders on U.S. trade policy, and recent letter to Congress to renegotiate NAFTA, this legislation offers actionable steps to the Administration. Bad trade deals have contributed to a loss of nearly 4 million American jobs and a deficit of $43.6 billion. President Trump promised a trade deal that would get Americans back to work and reduce our deficit. By prioritizing our worst trade deals, we are ensuring that some of these promises are met. An old adage reminds us: there are two kinds of failures: ‘‘by those who think and don’t do, and the other by those who don’t think and do.’’ Our ‘‘free trade’’ deals have been a major failure of the second order. Persistent, massive trade deficits are a drag on the U.S. economy and impair job creation. Now more than ever we need a trade policy that grows the economy and creates jobs in the United States. RECOGNIZING DAVID FLAUM HON. TOM REED 
Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate David Flaum on receiving the prestigious Rochester Rotary Award. Mr. Flaum currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and President of Flaum Management Company, which he founded in 1985. He has dedicated his career to managing and developing real estate, from retail centers to office buildings and industrial facilities. Mr. Flaum has been directly involved in the restoration of many commercial buildings in our region, which has created new jobs and contributed to the revitalization of our local economy. In addition to his professional work, David and his wife, Ilene, have generously supported various charitable causes and organizations. Mr. and Mrs. Flaum established the Bob Witmer Campership Fund, which provides free summer camp experiences to underprivileged children, and the David and Ilene Flaum Eye Institute. Mr. Flaum is the 80th recipient of the Rochester Rotary Award, which is the oldest civic award in our area. The award is given to outstanding individuals who exemplify the motto, ‘‘Service Above Self’’ and make significant business, professional, cultural, or civic contributions to our community. There is no question that David embodies these ideals. His vision, dedication, and generosity have made our region a better place to live and will continue to benefit local families and businesses for years to come. It is a privilege to call David my friend. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating David Flaum on this welldeserved recognition and wishing him all the best in his future endeavors. 
IN RECOGNITION OF MAE JEMISON FOR HER OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS AS AN ASTRONAUT AND SCIENTIST 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mae Jemison, a physician, scientist and astronaut whose pioneering career has furthered our understanding of the world around us. Dr. Jemison has achieved excellence across a number of disciplines as a result of her hard work and perseverance. After receiving a medical degree from Cornell Medical College and completing her medical training, Dr. Jemison served as a Peace Corps Medical Officer, treating Peace Corps volunteers in Liberia and Sierra Leone. She was then accepted into NASA’s astronaut program in 1987, providing launch support and assistance until her space mission aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavor in September 1992. During her mission, Dr. Jemison conducted scientific experiments on bone cell research and the effects of weightlessness on the human body, which contributed to advancements in our understanding of life sciences. She then resigned in 1993 from NASA, and has since founded several companies, including BioSentient Corp. which develops treatments for chronic pain and stress disorders. Dr. Jemison has had an extraordinary career and has affected countless lives through her work. In addition to breaking down barriers as the first black woman in space, Dr. Jemison has utilized her medical background and business acumen to develop novel medical treatments for a variety of illnesses. She has also excelled in academia, working as a professor at Dartmouth and Cornell, and is the founder of the Dorothy Jemison Foundation for Excellence, a nonprofit that promotes science education initiatives. Collectively, Dr. Jemison has had an indelible impact on a variety of disciplines through her work, and she continues to inspire new generations of scientists. Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in honoring Dr. Mae Jemison for her outstanding career. Dr. Jemison’s work with NASA, in medicine and in business has impacted and inspired countless individuals. f 
Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to be present at recorded votes due to medical reasons. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on rollcall No. 283, YEA on rollcall No. 284, and YEA on rollcall No. 285. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 1842, the Strengthening Children’s Safety Act of 2017. Crimes against children are abhorrent, and those who commit them should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. In 2015, in my home state of Georgia, 22,163 children were victims of abuse. Eight hundred of those children were subjected to sexual abuse. I recognize the merits of H.R. 1842. However, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I cannot support a bill which brings sweeping changes to Federal code without a thorough review process. This bill creates mandatory minimum sentences, which will effectively remove discretion from the judges who should be making sentencing decisions—not Congress. This bill has good intentions, and as a member of the Congressional Missing and Exploited Children’s Caucus, I am in favor of strengthening the laws that protect our nation’s children. However, this bill also enacts major changes in the criminal law, and I do not believe it is right for our committee to pass this bill without holding the appropriate hearings. I believe that the testimony of experts in the fields relevant to this bill would be of great 
use and would help ensure that this committee does not pass a bill that will impose unfair, mandatory sentences on individuals. This committee does not know the facts of every child abuse case—but the judge that hears those cases will. That is why I believe we should not bind judges to give mandatory minimum sentences. For this reason, I urge my colleagues to vote NAY on this resolution. 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, due to an unavoidable conflict, I missed the following vote on May 25. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 285. 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Taiwan’s true, meaningful participation in the World Health Organization (WHO). It is unfortunate that, almost 13 years after Congress made it an annual requirement to have an unclassified report from the Secretary of State on the U.S. plan for Taiwan to gain observer status at the WHO, and eight years since Taiwan was first invited to the World Health Assembly (WHA)—the governing forum of the WHO—as an observer, it remains necessary for Members to again raise their voices on this issue. Since 2009, Taiwan has been allowed to attend the annual meeting of the WHA as an observer, but last year, its invitation was held up due to pressure the People’s Republic of China wished to place upon the incoming administration of Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing wen. The current WHO DirectorGeneral has shown hostility to Taipei before. When last year’s invitation arrived, it contained insulting, unnecessary language referring to the October 1971 UN General Assembly resolution replacing the United Nations delegation from Taipei with the delegation from Beijing, as the basis for Taiwan’s attendance. Additionally, the invitation stated that Taiwan’s participation should be conditioned on the ‘‘oneChina’’ principle. This, too, was unnecessary, as President Tsai has stated Taiwan’s commitment to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. This year’s WHA is currently taking place in Geneva. It began on May 22 and will conclude May 31. As of yet, no invitation has been issued to Taiwan. As my colleagues are aware, it is the stated policy of the United States, over successive administrations, that Taiwan should be allowed meaningful participation in international organizations where it cannot become a full member. I submit that Taiwan’s current level of participation is neither satisfactory, nor meaningful. Mr. Speaker, this situation is unacceptable. As an advanced democracy, economy, and society, with one of the mostdeveloped health care systems in the world, a proven track record controlling infectious diseases, and a history of providing humanitarian relief, Taiwan has much to offer. Neither Taiwan, nor the international community, is served by restricting Taiwan’s access to timely information and important resources. The situation necessitates that we reiterate our full support for Taiwan’s inclusion at the WHA and in the other work of the WHO. The WHO Secretariat should continue to uphold its independence and impartiality, and should not be at the service of any particular member state. I ask my colleagues to join me in encouraging the administration to work with Taiwan and our member friends at the WHO to secure Taiwan’s invitation and meaningful participation at the WHA now and in the future. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF INFORUM FOR ITS SUCCESS IN PROVIDING MENTORSHIP AND PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO WOMEN 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Inforum for its work on behalf of women. Since its founding 55 years ago, Inforum has provided effective mentorship and education opportunities for women throughout Michigan. Originally founded in 1962 as the Women’s Economic Club, the organization has grown and evolved over the years to meet its mission of empowering women to lead and succeed. Inforum hosts a variety of highperforming women leaders for lunches and roundtables to exchange ideas and foster leadership skills. Additionally, Inforum sponsors the Inforum Center for Leadership, an educational initiative that provides professional development through its training programs for midcareer women leaders. These include its Executive Leadership professional development program, a fourmonth program that combines individual instruction, group exercises, and personalized feedback to provide women with the skills to assume more senior and influential roles in their careers. Collectively, over 1,100 women have graduated from this program since its launch in 2003. Inforum has provided countless women with critical skills and training to succeed in the 21st century workforce. Its talent initiatives and programs provide targeted professional development to women of all backgrounds, including veterans and earlycareer women. As a result of its success, Inforum has expanded throughout Michigan to better serve its members. Today, the organization hosts additional branches in Lansing, Grand Rapids, the Saginaw/Bay City area and southwest Michigan. The growth of the Inforum Center for Leadership, along with its long track record of educating and empowering women, is a testament to the organization’s success, and it is my hope that Inforum continues to effectively serve a broad range of women throughout their careers. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Inforum for its record of providing career skills and training that allows women to achieve success. Inforum provides resources and hosts a variety of programs that provide professional development for women. f 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize several important people in the Richardson Independent School District music community: First, the students and band directors of the Lloyd V. Berkner High School Full Orchestra under the leadership of Craig Needham and Jason Schayot for receiving an invitation to the 2016 Midwest International Band and Orchestra Clinic in Chicago, Illinois; second, the Liberty Junior High School Symphonic Band under the direction of Christopher Pineda for receiving an invitation to be a guest performing band at the Midwest Clinic, hosted by Berkner High School alumnus and outstanding music educator, Frank Ticheli; and, third, Frank Troyka, a Former Head Band Director at Berkner High School, nationally renowned clinician, music educator, and teacher, for his induction into the 2016 Bands of America Hall of Fame, which recognizes individuals who have greatly impacted the nation’s bands and music education. Again, congratulations for your outstanding achievement and national recognition. 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind my colleagues that May is National Inventors Month. It’s a special privilege to do so as CoChair of the Congressional Inventions Caucus. Our Founders were aware of the importance of invention and inventors, enshrining invention and protecting the rights of inventors across the country in Article 1, Section 8 of our Constitution. This not only has served the purpose of protecting one’s exclusive property rights, it also has achieved the Founders’ goal of stimulating ‘‘progress in science and useful arts.’’ From the beginning, invention has driven forward progress for our country and helped elevate American innovators to the forefront of the world stage. This has benefited not only our country but the world—curing disease, extending life and bringing joy and opportunity to billions. Without patents and other protections, protected in our Constitution and laws at every letter, this innovation could not be possible. As President Abraham Lincoln, himself a patent holder, put it, our patent system adds the fuel of interest to the fire of genius. Our country has a rich legacy of inventors who have combatted some of history’s greatest challenges and used their unique gifts to 
upend the workings of the world. American innovators like Edison, Bell, George Washington Carver and the Wright Brothers have become household names across the country. On top of that, wellknown inventions from the Internet to the garage owe themselves to the American spirit. American innovation and ingenuity is a foundation for our nation’s prosperity. This National Inventors Month, I hope we will all consider the contribution inventors have made to our nation. IN CELEBRATION OF ROBERT IAN MALONEY ON HIS GRADUATION 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to pay tribute to Robert ‘‘Ian’’ Maloney. Ian is a May 2017 graduate of Georgetown Preparatory School. Georgetown Preparatory School is the world’s oldest Catholic and Jesuit school for boys. Ian’s time at Georgetown Preparatory School closes the chapter on a stellar high school career. At Prep, Ian maintained a four year ‘‘A’’ average and was recognized as a National Hispanic Scholar, a member of the National Honor Society, and President of the Black Student Association. Volunteer work, tutoring inner city students, renovating homes for Habitat for Humanity, feeding homeless families at Thanksgiving were but a few of his selfless community activities. Aside from academics, Ian has also been a scholar athlete, lettering in tennis and leading as Captain of the Varsity team. In fact recently, Ian was certified by the internationally recognized Professional Tennis Registry as an Instructor. As the chapter closes on Georgetown Prep, it opens for Ian at Brown University. Of the 32,720 students who applied to Brown University’s class of 2021, Ian was accepted early decision. According to the Dean of Admission, ‘‘this admitted student group is extraordinary in every way. . . .’’ Mr. Speaker, Robert ‘‘Ian’’ Maloney is extraordinary in ‘‘every way.’’ He is a young man of integrity, intellectual excellence, and caring for others. Please join me in saluting Ian and wishing him every success as he brings great pride to his family and our country as a member of the Brown University class of 2021.
