Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, Friday, the Trump administration declared war on State legalization of marijuana as they come out on the wrong side of history and the American public. The Obama administration recognized that the vast voterdriven movement to legalize marijuana at the State level was something that couldn’t be stopped and, in fact, that the Federal Government shouldn’t interfere. Their Justice Department issued guidance, known as the Cole amendment, that, as long as these voterapproved State legalization efforts were enforced rigorously and thoughtfully, the Federal Government wouldn’t interfere with what the voters wanted. Friday, Sessions and the Trump administration overruled that guidance and declared open war on the part of 93 U.S. attorneys to feel free to interfere with what local voters have decided. This is strongly opposed by the American public. Over 60 percent in poll after poll show that Americans favor legalization of marijuana. When it deals with medical marijuana, that percentage is over 90 percent. We have seen State after State, approve medical marijuana including Florida, with a 71 percent ‘‘yes’’ vote in November of 2016. If the question is, regardless of how you feel about marijuana, should the Federal Government interfere with what the voters have decided, three out of four voters say the Federal Government should keep their hands off it. Luckily, at least as far as medical marijuana is concerned, they are protected from interference by the Justice Department because of the amendment that I have authored with my friend DANA ROHRABACHER . It is in the continuing resolution. It needs to be in any longterm funding bill. In fact, we should embrace an amendment by our colleague TOMMCCLINTOCK from California, that would expand those protections to any State legal marijuana activity. The Justice Department is not just on the wrong side of history and the American public, they are missing a chance to cure the damage caused by selective and cruel enforcement of marijuana laws. We are still arresting tens of thousands—mostly young men of color, especially AfricanAmerican men—for something the majority of Americans now think should be legal. We miss a chance to win the war against opioid death and addiction. In States that have medical marijuana— surprise—there are fewer pills prescribed. The longer the States have had medical marijuana, the lower the overdose deaths. In California, which has had medical marijuana the longest, there are a third fewer opioid deaths. We are missing an opportunity to build on that. We are missing the opportunity to increase the hundreds of millions of dollars that are now going to the State tax coffers to deal with education and addiction and law enforcement through State legal efforts and away from the drug cartels and the black market. Indeed, if we clean up this mess, we will have billions of dollars to devote to public purposes and further undermine the strength of drug cartels that use the black market to fund their efforts. It is past time that Congress steps up and fixes this mess. The good news is this reckless action by the Trump administration and Jeff Sessions will accelerate the time that we support what State and local governments should do: rationalize our cannabis policy and stop this ineffective, failed prohibition. f 
LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, we salute and thank the brave men and women who make up our law enforcement community. Officers on the local, State, and Federal level dedicate their efforts to keep 
us safe. They serve to protect the vulnerable and to defend us from harm. They patrol the neighborhood beats, walk our streets, and willingly put their lives on the line to do the work that makes our society safe. These men and women preserve our way of life by steadfastly safeguarding us from crime. To ensure the safety and protection of others, many have lost their lives in the line of duty. Their sacrifice must not be forgotten, and their families should always remain in our prayers. Though today is National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, I believe members of our law enforcement community deserve our gratitude every day. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, it is a new year, and I am thankful that my Republican colleagues and I made good on our promise to bring about a new Tax Code. Due to the historic passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, most citizens, couples, and companies will finally receive the tax relief they have so desperately needed. The list of companies nationwide that have announced pay raises, bonuses, and 401(k) contributions is growing. Companies that weren’t able to invest more in their employees in the past have found renewed confidence in this Nation’s economic future. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle proclaimed that this bill was a tax scam that would only profit the rich. These baseless claims are the very epitome of fake news, and nothing could be further from the truth. Already, more than a million Americans have received bonuses because of our efforts to reform the Tax Code. $900 billion is being distributed to hardworking American taxpayers by job creators as of today. Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we have witnessed companies begin to reinvest in the future of employees. In fact, Aflac announced it will increase 401(k) matching from 50 percent to 100 percent for the first 4 percent of employee contribution, on top of issuing onetime bonuses to employees. Our job creators are so inspired by the reforms we worked hard for, and those who are working toward retirement will enjoy these benefits for years to come. While some in this Chamber stated that tax reform would lead to Armageddon, I would like to point out that, for many, tax reform has brought about what Reagan called morning in America again. Proponents of the status quo and naysayers claimed that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would cost taxpayers. That is simply not the truth. Even modest increases in GDP growth caused by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will substantially contribute to a leveling off of the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office stated, for every onetenth of 1 percent increase in GDP, nearly $270 billion in revenue is added over 10 years. Most importantly, hardworking American taxpayers will now keep more of their hardearned cash. Estimates show that married couples taking advantage of the new standard deduction in the Fifth District of North Carolina may receive a tax cut to the tune of $1,834. That is no small sum. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that House Republicans kept our promise to bring about more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks in 2017, and I look forward to this continued success in 2018. f 
IT IS TIME TO STOP THE ATTACK ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, last October, President Trump loudly proclaimed that the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, was ‘‘virtually dead.’’ He said it was finished, it was gone. This was after the pummeling that this law had been taking over 2017 in the unsuccessful effort by the Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Again, last October was a critical moment, because enrollment was about to commence for 2018’s policy year, and the Trump administration announced that they were going to cut in half the time that people would have an opportunity to go out and learn about rates, to talk to get enrollment help, and also to sign up for different plans. They also cut the marketing budget by 80 percent and eliminated funding for folks at the State level to actually provide faceto face assistance. So it all looked pretty grim back in October in terms of what that would result in in terms of enrollment for 2018. Well, as a famous resident from the State of Connecticut, Mark Twain, once infamously said: Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated. Yesterday, the Connecticut exchange, the Connecticut Access Health Exchange, announced their enrollment numbers for 2018. Rather than going down, even though they were only able to enroll people in half the time there was in 2016, and even though they had no budget in terms of trying to actually promote and advertise, their enrollment went up. It went up by 3 percent in terms of the number of people who signed up for Anthem Blue Cross plans, for ConnectiCare plans, and for Medicaid plans. Again, it was done because of this amazing grassroots, organic effort by libraries, by community health centers, by human service agencies, by hospitals that went out and took on the task of getting the word out that, in fact, the Affordable Care Act was still alive and that people would have access to affordable health plans. Sure enough, it resulted in an increase in health plans. Interestingly, the young invincibles, the young enrollees that everybody predicted were going to abandon the program because the enforcement of the mandate was going to be relaxed by the IRS actually had a very strong, healthy number. Coming from a State that is known for its insurance history—it was the insurance capital of the world—the fact of the matter is that getting those young enrollees, those young members to sign up for these plans, in fact, portends well for 2019 and beyond. This morning, The Hill newspaper reported that for ObamaCare insurers, actually, their financial prospects are looking much better for 2019 because the system has stabilized. Now, again, there is still work that could be done. There is a bill, H.R. 3748, a Medicare buyin, which would allow people 50 and up to voluntarily sign up for Medicare, again, using subsidies if they qualify or paying the full cost, which would still be 40 percent less than the plans that are on exchanges throughout the country for people 50 and up. It would not affect the deficit, and, in fact, arguably, it would strengthen the Medicare trust fund because you would get a younger population into the Medicare Program. So there is work that we can do that is optional, voluntary, in terms of trying to provide more choices for individuals out there; but, clearly, what happened yesterday in Connecticut and throughout the country in terms of enrollment figures, that despite the active efforts by the Trump administration to undercut and sabotage this law, in fact, shows that the law has a life of its own, that, in fact, people are voting with their feet in terms of still trying to get access to the critical needs of every human being and every American, which is access to healthcare. I want to particularly congratulate Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman, who spearheaded this effort in Connecticut and yesterday stated: This just shows how valuable the Affordable Care Act is to thousands of residents in Connecticut; also, Jim Wadleigh, the director of the exchange, who, again, was not distracted or demoralized by the comments coming out of the White House but still plunged forward and still persistently and determinedly went out and made sure that people got the real information, the real facts, the real news so that they could, in fact, take an opportunity to protect themselves and their families from the inevitable problems of sickness and accident, that every American and every Member of Congress enjoys through their health benefits, for every resident in the State of Connecticut. It is time for us to stop the attack in terms of a program that has provided millions of Americans coverage and opportunity to healthcare. We should work together on bills like H.R. 3748, a voluntary, deficitneutral attempt to try and strengthen and provide cheaper alternatives for people 50 and up and small businesses. That is the way forward, not this persistent, nonstop hyperpolitical, hyperpartisan attack 
on a bill that has made a huge difference to millions of Americans. 
b1015 PENNSYLVANIA FARM SHOW The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania kicked off one of my favorite events, the Pennsylvania Farm Show. For more than a century, farmers have gathered each January at the Pennsylvania Farm Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. This week, we are having the 102nd Pennsylvania Farm Show. This weeklong event is the largest indoor agriculture exposition in the Nation, showcasing over 6,000 animals, featuring nearly 12,000 exhibits, and more than half a million visitors. Each year, I host a listening session at the Farm Show and we cover a range of topics during the public forum, from raising awareness about agriculture education to hearing very real concerns from our dairy farmers and more. As we embark on crafting the next farm bill, the 2018 listening session was extremely important. I want to thank the following Members who were able to join this year’s Farm Show: Agriculture Committee Ranking Member COLLIN PETERSON , Congressman DWIGHT EVANS , Congressman TOMMARINO , Congressman R OGER  MARSHALL , and Congressman L LOYD  SMUCKER . I also want to thank USDA Under Secretary Greg Ibach for coming up to join us. I was honored to be joined by Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding. The Pennsylvania Farm Show truly does bring together so many different people in the ag community and it is an event like none other. As vice chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I am very proud of this fine event that takes place in the Commonwealth. The Farm Show complex houses 24 acres under one roof, spreading throughout 11 buildings, including three arenas. There is no admission fee and it is a great event for the entire family. There are numerous educational shows that are all free of charge. The Pennsylvania Farm Show provides an atmosphere for everyone to walk through, observe, and educate themselves about different areas of agriculture, the Commonwealth’s largest industry, which brings in nearly $6.9 billion annually in agricultural cash receipts. Almost half a million jobs are tied to the industry, which positively impacts all Pennsylvanians. Undoubtedly, one of the most popular attractions at the Pennsylvania Farm Show is the Food Court. Located in the Expo Hall and Main Hall of the complex, the Food Court offers visitors a variety of Pennsylvania products—PA Preferred products—and it generates income to support the nonprofit Pennsylvania Agricultural Commodity Organizations. Mr. Speaker, over a century ago, the first Pennsylvania Farm Show was a 3 day exhibit. Today, the event is a weeklong, 8day celebration of how the agricultural industry touches our everyday lives. Proudly, this event draws visitors from across the country to highlight everything our State has to offer when it comes to ag. Numerous students participate in the event as well from 4–H clubs and FAA organizations. The Pennsylvania Farm Show truly showcases our Nation’s farmers and landowners, and I was thrilled to again take part in the best agricultural expo in the country. f 
THE NATIONAL DEBT AND OUR SHARED FUTURE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the national debt and our shared future. Our country has been on an unsustainable fiscal path, regardless of which party has been in power, and we all know this. As a result, our national debt is the largest it has ever been. As of this week, the national debt is in excess of $20 trillion. This works out to be an average of $62,670 debt for every man, woman, and child in the United States. It is outrageous. It is a completely unacceptable amount of debt, and we have it because of irresponsible governing and a lack of political courage here in our Nation’s Capital. Sadly, this Congress has chosen to continue this irresponsible and unsustainable fiscal course. The tax cut legislation that Republicans rammed through the Congress last month will add $1.45 billion to our deficit over 10 years, estimated, and over $2.2 trillion to our national debt. We are going in the wrong direction. But there is something I think that I have learned about this tax legislation last month, and that is that it seems that deficits matter under Democratic administrations, but under Republican administrations, deficits don’t matter at all. So when it comes to lifting our debt ceiling later this year, I would expect or hope to see every Republican who voted for the tax bill that adds $2.2 trillion to our deficit—our debt to vote to increase the debt ceiling, seeing as deficits no longer matter. Let’s think about this $2.2 trillion tax bill that will add to our debt. That is $2.2 trillion in additional moneys that our children will have to pay for unless we do something. We can be fiscally responsible, and we must be fiscally responsible. But to act to change this course, we must stop digging this hole bigger. I had a farmer friend who once told me: JIM, I’ve got a theory about holes, and that is, once you find yourself in one, just stop digging. Sometimes you think if you dig harder and faster, you’re going to get out of it. Just stop. Mr. Speaker, this will be difficult, especially considering the opportunity we missed to put the Nation back on a fiscally responsible path with the tax reform effort last year. Yet there are important steps that we can take—and Congress should—to balance our budget and to keep it from getting worse, like the amendment proposed by Representative STEPHANIE MURPHY from Florida, a balanced budget amendment. We should also move to implement targeted reforms on government spending, both mandatory and discretionary spending, in ways that contribute to economic growth and invest in our future. It is tough work. It requires political courage and the willingness to reach across the aisle, for Democrats and Republicans to join hands and jump, in essence, on these tough decisions. The last time we had such an opportunity to address the challenge was in March of 2012, when Congressman JIM COOPER from Tennessee presented a budget resolution similar to the recommendations under SimpsonBowles. That plan would have reduced the deficit over $4 trillion over a 10year period. Sadly, the political courage was in short supply then on that day, as it is now. There were 38 of us who were willing to support the plan. I was attacked by political groups on the left and on the right for taking such a vote, but that vote was the right thing to do and I was proud to take it. Congress has a chance to do the right thing now. Congress has to come together. We need Democrats and Republicans to put our Nation’s fiscal house back in order for the sake of all Americans. The Blue Dog Coalition, of which I am a cochair, has a long history of standing for fiscal responsibility, even when it was hard. Bridging the divide between Republicans and Democrats, both in Congress and this administration, is what we must do. So as we are debating today how to put together the votes for the concurrent resolution to fund our Nation’s budget for the rest of this year, let’s think about this. Let’s work together. What a novel concept. As I stand here today, as a Blue Dog, as a proud Representative of California’s 16th Congressional District, and as a concerned American, ready to reach across the aisle to create the bipartisan, longterm policy solutions that will help us tackle our national debt and our deficit, and that will help put us back on a fiscally sustainable path, I invite my colleagues and my fellow Americans to join me. This is what good governance is really all about. This is where responsible leadership is necessary. It is what 
Americans want and need, and it is what we should be doing. 
TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR VETERANS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address a very troubling issue, but also to tell the story of one of my high school classmates who is trying to make a difference. Mr. Speaker, every day, 22 veterans in the United States take their own lives. At this pace, veterans are committing suicide at a rate of 19 percent higher than the general adult population. We, in Congress, will not turn a blind eye to these servicemembers in need of our support. This issue is a top clinical priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as for this Congress. In a unanimous vote, the House passed legislation that works for the VA to examine the effectiveness of the Veterans Crisis Line. I am also a proud cosponsor of the Oath of Exit Act written by my close friend and colleague, Congressman BRIAN MAST from Florida. This legislation will require all individuals retiring or separating from the Armed Forces to take a pledge not to harm themselves. But these actions alone are not enough, and more must be done to protect our servicemembers. To help our veterans with this mental health battle, we are now turning to our fourlegged friends. Therapy dogs have a proven success record for helping our veterans tackle the physical and mental challenges that they face in their transitions back to civilian life. As I stand before the House today, I want to bring awareness to one organization that I am especially proud of, K94Heroes. This nonprofit group provides therapy dogs to our servicemen and women who are in desperate need of compassion and support. I am overjoyed to see members of the community empowering our veterans and I am honored to say that this organization was founded in my home State, in my hometown, by one of my high school classmates, John ‘‘Big Daddy’’ Lipscomb. John founded the K94Heroes program after connecting with one of our other classmates, an elementary classmate, who specializes in service dog training for veterans. In 2015, John and his daughter established K94Heroes and raised private funds to mitigate training costs. Together, they work tirelessly to ensure every veteran who deserves a service dog receives one. We owe it to those who protected us abroad the assurance of protection here at home. With upstanding citizens like John ‘‘Big Daddy’’ Lipscomb and with continued action on the Federal level, we will be able to better protect our veterans who sacrifice so much for this country. Still, this Congress must make continued efforts toward veteran suicide prevention, and I commend the efforts of organizations such as K94Heroes. f 
HONORING JOHN YOUNG, CENTRAL FLORIDA’S LOCAL HERO The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) for 5 minutes. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the life of an Orlando favorite son, a hero that we lost this past weekend, Astronaut John Young, who was inspirational and legendary to our community and who grew up in College Park in Orlando, Florida. Streets named after him span our district, as well as Congresswomen MURPHY ’s and DEMINGS ’ districts in central Florida. He was described by our local paper as a ‘‘country boy who grew up in Orlando, Florida, back when it was mostly farmland.’’ He even got in trouble for smuggling a corned beef sandwich into space on Gemini 3. He was mostly known for his coolheadedness and calm demeanor as he took numerous trips into space with NASA. Some of the flags and mission patches he flew into space are on display in our Orlando Science Center. In central Florida, we are proud to have the John Young Parkway bear his name. He died on January 5, this past Friday, at his home in Houston. Mr. YOUNG was NASA’s longestserving astronaut. He was the first person to orbit the Moon by himself and the ninth person to walk on the Moon as well. He was the first person to travel to space six times during NASA’s Gemini and Apollo lunar missions, and into the space shuttle programs as well. John Young commanded the first space shuttle flight mission, an iconic view that so many central Floridians and so many Americans have seen over the years during that program. He was awarded the prestigious Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1981. He represents the very best of the Orlando area. Rest in peace, Astronaut John Young. 
b1030 HONORING ISABEL CASTANOLUGO The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MARSHALL ). The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Isabel CastanoLugo, who will turn 112 years young on January 11. Isabel, a supercentenarian, is one of only a handful in the Nation who has lived through some of the brightest times and darkest chapters in our history. Born in 1906, in Manizales, Colombia, Isabel was one of 13 brothers and sisters. At age 41, Isabel married and had 2 sons, Omar and Danilo Lugo. Because of the increasing violence in her home country and the kidnapping of her husband, Isabel began a new life with her children in the United States in 1970, and, for 26 years, she resided in my district in beautiful Miami Beach. Throughout her long and distinguished life, Isabel has never ceased placing the needs of others before her own. Isabel has served as a strong advocate for many important issues and organizations, such as the Jewish Community Center of Miami Beach, and has continued to serve as a voice for the voiceless to this day. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this historic birthday with Isabel, who is the oldest living person in the State of Florida. CONGRATULATING COACH MARK RICHT  
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Mark Richt, head coach of the Miami Hurricanes football team on being named the Walter Camp 2017 Coach of the Year and the ACC Coach of the Year. In only two seasons at the helm, Coach Richt has created a winning environment at my alma mater, the University of Miami. This season, the Hurricanes won their first ACC Coastal Division title and ended a 7year losing streak against rival Florida State University. Coach Richt’s success on the field this past year also earned him two notable accolades. He is the first Miami Hurricane’s coach to be named ACC Coach of the Year and only the second UM coach to receive the Walter Camp award. Coach Richt is truly a phenomenal leader, and I am confident that he will continue to guide UM’s football program to greater victories in the years to come. Once again, ‘‘congratulations,’’ ‘‘felicidades,’’ to Coach Richt on your success this last season, and ‘‘Go Canes.’’ 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Jim Morris on celebrating his 25th and final season as head coach of the Miami Hurricanes baseball team. Coach Morris has dedicated his life to college baseball. He has won over 1,500 Division 1 games, the fifth most in the history of the sport. During his tenure, the University of Miami, my alma mater, qualified for the College World Series more times than any other baseball program throughout the country, and he led the team to two national championships. Coach Morris has also been named National Coach of the Year three times. Coach Morris’ outstanding leadership for the past 25 years has left a positive and lasting impact on the University of Miami. I am confident that this historic legacy will continue to inspire and will continue to shape Hurricane baseball in the years to come. Once again, ‘‘congratulations,’’ ‘‘felicidades,’’ to Coach Morris on a long and distinguished career. ‘‘Go Canes.’’ 
RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA FOOTBALL TEAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the football team at the University of Central Florida located in my congressional district. The Knights finished the season ranked sixth in the Nation by the Associated Press. They had a perfect 13–0 record—the only team in college football to go undefeated. UCF won the American Athletic Conference championship with an exhilarating—and excruciating—doubleovertime victory against a talented team from the University of Memphis. The Knights shook up the world of college football in the Peach Bowl on New Year’s Day when they beat Auburn University, one of the most storied football programs in the country. I had a personal stake in the outcome of the Peach Bowl, having made a friendly bet on the game with Congressman MIKE ROGERS , whose Alabama district is home to Auburn. I am excited to collect my winnings from Congressman ROGERS later today, a bucket of delicious Florida oranges that he will deliver to me while carrying a UCF helmet. I thank the football gods that UCF did not lose. Under the terms of the wager, I would have been compelled to blanket a tree on the Capitol grounds with toilet paper, pursuant to a time honored and, frankly, bewildering Auburn tradition. I am grateful that the Knights saved Capitol Police from the trouble of having to arrest a Member of Congress for vandalism. Even though UCF was not given the opportunity to play for the national championship, the players and coaches of this team are national champions in my book. The Knights didn’t just win games, they also won our hearts. They didn’t just beat opponents, they also beat the odds. Sports—in particular, team sports—have a unique power to captivate, to unify, and to inspire. Under the strong and steady leadership of Head Coach Scott Frost, the Knights captivated the school’s students and alumni, filling them with pride. They united our Central Florida University community from Orlando to Oviedo, from Apopka to Altamonte Springs, and they inspired countless people, young and old alike, both football experts and novices. Importantly, UCF the football team brought national attention to UCF the university, which has quietly become one of Florida’s and our Nation’s academic gems. To be sure, the Knights’ squad was filled with talented players, seven of whom won first team allconference honors, including riflearmed quarterback McKenzie Milton, fleetfooted running back Adrian Killins, and one handed defensive warrior Shaquem Griffin, who personifies courage and character. Many members of the team justifiably played with a chip on their shoulder, having been overlooked by more established college football programs coming out of high school. They had to earn respect through their actions. Ultimately, what made the Knights so special and so successful was not what they accomplished as individuals, but, rather, what they achieved together as a team. It was clear from watching the coaches and players that they loved and respected each other. The bond they shared made them teammates in the truest sense of the word. The team’s motto, which is the name of the UCF fight song, is ‘‘Charge on.’’ It is a message whose power extends beyond the football field and applies to life itself. When you confront challenges, charge on. When others doubt your abilities, charge on. And when you think you can’t work any harder, charge on. As a proud fan, I thank the UCF football team for showing us all what it means to charge on. f 
CONGRATULATIONS TO NATIONAL MERIT SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize seven students from my district who have received the 2017 National Merit Scholarships. The criteria required to receive a National Merit Scholarship is quite difficult. In fact, of the 15,000 finalists selected, only half will actually receive scholarships. The recipients of this prestigious scholarship are Connor Schmidt of Ham Lake, Benjamin Caswell of Shoreview, Raffi Toghramadijan of Blaine, Rachel Cho of Blaine, Piper Christenson of Spring Lake Park, Catherine Lewis of Blaine, and Kenneth Truong of Coon Rapids. Each one of these students has big plans for the future which include careers in medicine, science, and engineering—all fields that are critically important to the success of our Nation. I congratulate each of these students on receiving this scholarship, and we look forward to watching you achieve great success in your respective careers. Good work, and good luck. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of one of Minnesota’s heroes. On Tuesday, December 19, 2017, Captain Jeffrey Vollmer of the Mayer Fire Department died in the line of duty. A loving father and husband, Jeff is survived by his wife, Emily, and their two daughters, Anika and Kennedi. He was a 12year veteran of the allvolunteer fire department in Mayer, Minnesota. Friends and colleagues knew him as a selfless and kind leader who was always willing to help others. Fire Chief Rod Maetzold described Jeff as the kind of guy you could count on when it mattered most. Jeff was an avid muskie fisherman who enjoyed hunting and photography. Jeff loved to work with wood. He built signs, tables, and even a bed set for his daughter. We pray for peace and comfort for his colleagues, friends, and family. He will be missed by so many. RECOGNIZING JAKE HENRIKSEN  
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding servicemember from my district, Jake Henriksen. As a Centennial graduate and resident of Lino Lakes, Minnesota, Jake always knew he wanted to serve in the military. As a thirdgeneration member of the U.S. Army, his service as a specialist representing the 173rd Airborne Infantry Brigade Combat Team continues a family legacy of service to our Nation. In just under 2 years in the service, Jake won the U.S. Army Europe Soldier of the Year award. Each company of the Army made up of about 100 people selects a soldier to compete in the Best Warrior Competition. Jake was chosen as his company’s representative. The competition tests soldiers’ abilities in a variety of areas, including a physical test, a written test, marksmanship, land navigation, chemical defense, and medical tasks. Jake excelled in all, which is why he went on to earn the title of U.S. Army Europe Soldier of the Year affirming his commitment to excellence. Our community is very proud of Jake and his accomplishments. We admire his dedication and his commitment to serve. Congratulations, Jake. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day to remember the men and women in blue who protect and serve our great Nation. The great State of Minnesota is home to many phenomenal law enforcement officers, men and women, who put their lives on the line each and every day to ensure the safety and security of our communities. These are the true heroes, and some, tragically, have lost their lives in the line of duty. In 2016, Deputy Steven Sandberg was shot and killed in the line of duty in St. Cloud, Minnesota. While his death was both senseless and tragic, we remember the courageous way he chose to live and serve our local community. In honor of brave officers like Deputy Sandberg today and every day, let us remember and honor the selfless service of our men and women in blue. 
DEFENDING THE AMERICA WORD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, this morning, a high school senior sat attentively in a Chicago classroom while 
this country held her college dreams hostage. This morning, a fourthyear medical student started her rotation as an aspiring thoracic surgeon in Cambridge while this country took her talent for granted. This morning, an enlisted soldier living in Queens eagerly awaited his basic training assignment while his country shrugged their shoulders at his service. This morning, 800,000 young men and women woke up, offered a brave smile to their loved ones, and sought to better the only home they have ever known. You can call them DREAMers. You can call them immigrants. You can call them Americans. You can call them husbands, wives, sons, daughters, neighbors, doctors, students, servicemen and women. You can call them human beings who deserve to live in a place that they call home; whose lives shouldn’t be horse traded for big walls, petty tweets, and bad campaign ads; who have offered us their talent, their tirelessness, their ingenuity, their empathy, their loyalty, and their patriotism; who have earned their government’s protection in return. We gave those 800,000 human beings our word, and if those of us here in this room who have the incredible privilege of serving in these halls bestowed with the title ‘‘Representative,’’ if we aren’t willing to defend the American word and make sure that it still means something, then who will? 
NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, today is National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, and so I rise to honor our men and women in blue. My oldest son is a local police officer, so I am acutely aware of the risks and sacrifices made by the men and women in law enforcement. They assume risks every day—risks we sometimes take for granted in order to keep our communities safe. Being a law enforcement officer isn’t a job. It is a calling. It is a service to the community. b1045 Despite the very real risks, they respond to the call always knowing they may not go home. Just last week, a deputy in the community my son serves in was struck by a car during a traffic accident. Yes, he was responding to a traffic accident, and he was hit by a car. It broke his back, broke his neck, and crushed his face. The last update I received, he was in critical condition. All he was doing was trying to protect people at a traffic accident. We can’t take that for granted. Today we need to pause and simply offer a thankyou to law enforcement officers across the country and to their families. We offer a prayer for those who have reached the end of watch. Join me today in thanking police officers across this Nation. Take a moment to simply say thank you. RECOGNIZING THE BICENTENNIAL YEAR OF  
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the bicentennial year of Macomb County, Michigan. On January 15, 1818, Macomb County was formally organized as the third county in the territory of Michigan. Macomb County was designated nearly 20 years before Michigan even gained statehood. It was named in honor of General Alexander Macomb, a decorated veteran of the War of 1812. Macomb’s rich history of service to our Nation doesn’t stop there. In July 1917, almost 100 years after Macomb’s founding, Selfridge Field was established. Everyone in Macomb County and the National Guard knows the importance of Selfridge Air National Guard to our national security. Its founding just 13 years after the Wright brothers’ first flight is a true testament to the commitment to national security and to innovation that has defined Macomb County for 200 years. In addition to being the auto capital of the world, Macomb led the manufacturing that resulted in the arsenal of democracy in America’s victory in World War II. Our defense industry helped the Allies win World War II and continues to provide necessary resources to maintain our strength and security in the world. I am proud to represent Macomb County in Washington, D.C., and eager to celebrate the 200th anniversary of this great county. 
HONORING AND PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay honor and pay tribute to the Honorable Dr. Martin Luther King, and, Mr. Speaker, I am so proud and honored to have the preeminent privilege of doing so here in the well of the Congress. Mr. Speaker, Dr. King was born at a time, to quote Dr. Benjamin Hooks, when he could buy a hat but he couldn’t try it on. He was born at a time when he could only sit in the balcony of a movie, and that was in some movies. There were others that he wasn’t allowed in at all. He was born at a time when he had to sit in the back of the bus or he might be barred from riding the bus totally. He was born at a time when he would have to wait in line and others of a different hue could always stand in front of him. He was born at a time when invidious discrimination and when segregation was apparent and lawful. Dr. King was born at a time when there were few who were willing to challenge the hate and the bigotry that was emanating from this country in all of its arenas for the most part. But Dr. King was a person who understood that that which you will tolerate you will not change. Dr. King refused to tolerate bigotry and hatred. He refused to tolerate it, and, in fact, that is what separated him from a good many other people, for the most part. Dr. King, if I may recall, went to Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. He went there to do something about the conditions, about the discrimination, about the hate and the bigotry. When he went there to do something about it, there were people who were tolerating hatred and bigotry. There were people there who were very prominent members of the clergy—eight of them—who decided that they would write Dr. King a letter and explain to him that what he was doing was unwise and untimely. They explained to him that law and order should prevail. They commended the constabulary for protecting the city. These were persons who were considered honorable people, but they were people who were willing to tolerate hatred and bigotry. They, in fact, insisted that we should let the courts handle this: Let’s work it through peaceful means by which we might sit and negotiate with those who would perpetrate hatred and bigotry. Dr. King, on the other hand, sought to use nonviolent protest as a methodology by which change might take place. The things that he could not tolerate he was willing to protest to bring about change. There were other great orators of the time. Dr. King was indeed a great orator, one of the greatest ever, but there were other great orators. There were other persons who were knowledgeable, had Ph.D.’s, and who were very well versed in what was happening with discrimination and could have spoken up on it. Many did speak up, but many of them were willing to tolerate it. Dr. King was not, and that separated him from a good many people who were orators, who were learned, and who understood invidious discrimination. In fact, they were opposed to it, but they tolerated it in quiet ways. So when Dr. King went to Birmingham, these eight clergypersons having written him a letter, he found himself incarcerated in the Birmingham jail, and he decided to respond to them. The ‘‘Letter from Birmingham Jail’’ is a response to eight notable clergy members in Birmingham. So he decided to respond to their letter. In responding to their letter, he gives us this masterpiece that really addresses what invidious discrimination is all about, why you can’t consider yourself an outside agitator if you are an American, and why you have to do this not only for yourself, but for the generations to come. 
But reading Dr. King’s letter, as masterful as it is, is not enough. So today, in honor of his birthday, January 15, I am asking people to read the letter that Dr. King was responding to. If you read that letter, then you will understand why you cannot tolerate hate. 
ADMINISTRATION’S OIL DRILLING PLAN INCLUDES FLORIDA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CURBELO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Department of the Interior announced a newly proposed plan to expand offshore drilling off our country’s coasts, including Florida’s. Shortly after making the announcement, Secretary Zinke guaranteed that States will have a voice in this process. So I have come to the floor today as the elected Representative of the Florida Keys and southern MiamiDade, a district that includes ecological treasures and economic drivers like the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, Everglades National Park, and Biscayne National Park, to be that voice. I can say this with confidence: the people of Florida and its leaders, including myself, have made it clear over and over again how we feel about offshore drilling near Florida. We don’t want it. We don’t want to put our beautiful beaches and environmental treasures at risk. We don’t want to risk the livelihoods of millions of hardworking American men, women, and families when there is no need. Florida simply has too much to lose. Mr. Speaker, I, along with many of my colleagues in this Chamber, both Florida Senators MARCO RUBIO and BILLNELSON , and our Governor Rick Scott, are going to make sure Florida’s voice is heard loud and clear on this issue: we don’t want drilling near Florida’s shores, we don’t need drilling near Florida’s shores, and we will not allow this or any administration to put our economy or our environment at risk. 
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dale Adamson, a dedicated teacher of mathematics at Howard D. McMillan Middle School in my district and a recent recipient of the prestigious Milken Educator Award. Central to Mr. Adamson’s selection was his classroom rapport with students, ability to explain complicated concepts through realworld applications, and a daily commitment to his craft. Not satisfied with simply lecturing on abstract theories at the chalkboard, Mr. Adamson gained well deserved renown for exciting his students with realworld problems like how algebra was used by NASA recently to land a probe on an asteroid or the multitude of mathematical principles one might observe launching objects off the school’s roof. The Milken Family Foundation’s motto states that ‘‘the future belongs to the educated.’’ As a past member of the MiamiDade School Board and the proud father of two daughters in the public school system, I am glad to have teachers like Mr. Adamson in our community. I sincerely believe that educators with the heart and imagination displayed by Mr. Adamson are the key to unlocking the next generation’s potential. IMMIGRATION POLICY  
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind my colleagues how critical it is that Republicans and Democrats work in good faith to find a compromise on immigration policy in the coming days. Congress first began trying to pass legislation for the benefit of young immigrants who were brought to our country as children through no fault of their own some 17 years ago. All attempts have failed, but this time failure is not an option. 800,000 DREAMers who came forward and registered with the government in recent years would be at risk. These are young people who are working, paying taxes, getting educated, and contributing to our country. They speak English. Some of them want to serve in our military to defend our freedoms. They sat in the same classrooms and grew up with our own children. Many have no memories of their countries of origin. Mr. Speaker, these are America’s children. That is why we all need to work together in the coming days and find a compromise that can secure the future for these young immigrants and, at the same time, make our country safer and more prosperous by securing our borders and reforming our immigration laws. Americans have been expecting results from Congress on immigration policy for years. Enough is enough. The time for action is now. 
A YEAR OF RESULTS FOR THE NORTH COUNTRY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK ) for 5 minutes. Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment today to highlight the real results we have achieved on behalf of north country families in this Congress. In 2017, we worked on many important initiatives to grow the north country economy, support our veterans and military families, strengthen our local healthcare system, and improve education. In fact, last year alone, the House of Representatives passed more than 470 bills and resolutions, 90 percent of which are bipartisan. In Congress, I focused on important legislation to grow our local economy. I recently introduced two bills that will increase access to rural broadband and help our north country farmers bring their production into the 21st century. I also helped the House pass legislation to strengthen career and technical education programs. This bipartisan bill updates Federal career and technical education policies to help more students gain the skills they need to compete for indemand jobs. I have also introduced bipartisan legislation to boost north country tourism by extending the time Canadian visitors can spend each year in the United States. We have also made significant strides when it comes to education. For the past 3 years, I have worked to ensure that our students have the educational opportunities to achieve their limitless potential. In my first year in Congress, I introduced a bill to expand Pell grant access so that students can access this critical financial aid resource during summer months. I was pleased to see my initiative for yearround Pell signed into law this past May, meaning students and families in our district now have another important tool to achieve their higher education dreams. As the proud Representative of Fort Drum and the Navy nuclear site at Kesselring, my district is home to thousands of military families that make incredible sacrifices serving our Nation. In 2017, I was pleased to have a bill I authored pass the House of Representatives to help military spouses. This legislation eliminates a loophole that requires military spouses to establish residency every time their servicemember receives a new assignment. I also introduced two bills that will help military spouses that were signed into law in December. The Lift the Relocation Burden from Military Spouses Act increases professional license portability. This provides reimbursement for licensing fees of up to $500 for each permanent change of station. The second is the Military Residency Choice Act, which allows spouses the choice to establish the same State of residency as their servicemember spouse for voting and tax purposes. New York’s 21st District is the proud home of more veterans than any other district in New York State. My district offices have been hard at work on their behalf helping to recover over $2.25 million in hardearned VA benefits for our veterans. Congress also passed an extension of the GI Bill education benefits that lifts the expiration on when they can be used, giving veterans more flexibility to attend higher education institutions. Last summer, Congress passed the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which President Trump signed into law. This important law makes it easier to terminate failing VA employees and provides stronger protections for whistleblowers who raise the alarm over wait lists or medical malpractice. 
b1100 No veteran deserves to be denied care, and this law brings needed accountability to the VA. Healthcare is another issue I hear frequently about when I speak with families and businesses across my district, especially ensuring our rural communities have the access they need. In September, I introduced the CHIME Act, a bipartisan bill to extend the Community Health Center Fund for 5 years. Federally Qualified Health Centers like Hudson Headwaters, North Country Family Health, and the Community Health Center of the North Country provide over 95,000 people in my district with critical healthcare and preventative services. I am pleased that this bill has over 200 cosponsors. The overwhelming bipartisan support for the CHIME Act was instrumental in the House passing legislation to extend the Community Health Center Fund for 2 years. I have also been a strong supporter of CHIP and I voted to pass a 5year reauthorization in the House in November. While we work to have longterm solutions for these two programs signed into law, I was pleased to pass a critical extension for them in December. Mr. Speaker, last year was busy working hard to grow our North Country economy, increase access to education, serve our brave veterans, and much more. I am honored every day to serve New York’s 21st District in Congress and I look forward to continuing to work my hardest in 2018. 
SUPPORTING THOSE LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Philip Gutis. Mr. Gutis is from New Hope, Pennsylvania. At the age of 56, he has been diagnosed with earlyonset Alzheimer’s disease. Earlyonset Alzheimer’s currently affects hundreds of thousands of Americans who are under the age of 65. Diagnoses for this debilitating neurological disease in its early stages can be arduous and frustrating, as many of the symptoms resemble less serious issues like stress. Mr. Gutis recently visited my district office to discuss living with this disease. He detailed the pain, stress, and confusion that he felt when first diagnosed. He described how simple tasks can become challenging when dealing with memory loss. But his message was not to complain about his ailment, it was to be a voice for other individuals who live with Alzheimer’s, those who are unable to have their voices be heard. Alzheimer’s is a serious neurological disease. Though there is no cure, treatment for symptoms can help slow the progressive effects of dementia. I stand in support of Mr. Gutis and all those living with Alzheimer’s. DOYLESTOWN HEALTH FOUNDATION  
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, the Doylestown Health Foundation is a healthcare network that has provided critical care to the Bucks County community for over 90 years. In recognition of its continued work, Doylestown Health recently received $10 million in gifts, the largest amount in their history. The pair of $5 million donations were given by two families with close ties to the Doylestown Health Foundation. Richard and Angela Clark have had four generations of family cared for at Doylestown Hospital, while Alex Gorsky, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson, and his wife, Patricia, have served on the hospital board and board of directors, respectively. Supporting institutions in our community through charitable donations are crucial to community prosperity. The generous gifts of the Clark and Gorsky families are earmarked for vital projects like a new heart and vascular center. With contributions like these, the Doylestown Health Foundation will be able to continue providing optimal care to those in our Bucks County community. 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE A message from the Senate by Ms. Lasky, one of its clerks, announced that the Senate has passed without amendment a bill of the House of the following title: 
H.R. 3759. An act to provide for the establishment and maintenance of a Family Caregiving Strategy, and for other purposes. 
The message also announced that the Senate has passed a bill of the following title in which the concurrence of the House is requested:

HONORING THE LIFE OF SHERIFF’S DEPUTY ZACKARI PARRISH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) for 5 minutes. Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the heroism and bravery of Douglas County Sheriff’s Deputy Zackari Parrish. I attended Deputy Parrish’s funeral this past Friday and heard what a great husband, father, son, and law enforcement officer he was. He was a father of two young daughters; a husband to his wife, Gracie; a son to his loving parents; and a colleague to many of the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office. Zackari lost his life 10 days ago, responding to a domestic disturbance call in Highlands Ranch, Colorado. Sergeant David Buyers spoke of Zackari’s bravery that day, saying that he didn’t flinch, he didn’t back down, he didn’t hesitate. But he also did everything in his power, according to the sheriff, to talk down the gunman. Sadly, we can’t always win the battles against evil, and on that day, Zackari lost. But a lost battle is not a lost war. Zackari knew he fought in a war to defend the innocent and to stand up for good. It is an honor to speak about a hero. We have the chance to honor one of those people who devoted their life to others. People like Zackari remind us that our world is not lost, evil will not win the day, and we can give more to this world than we take from it. Zackari is a hero for the people of Douglas County, Colorado, his fellow sheriff’s deputies, and the State of Colorado. I pray for his family, friends, and fellow deputies as they charge ahead in life without their loved one. I pray that God will give them peace in this time and that God will be glorified even in the midst of this horrible trial. I pray for the other law enforcement members, the other heroes wounded that day, as well: Michael Doyle, Taylor Davis, Jeff Pelle, and Thomas O’Donnell. We can never repay their sacrifices for our community. We can only commit ourselves to never forget the cost they willingly paid for us. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 11 o’clock and 6 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Lord our God, we give You thanks for giving us another year. At the beginning of this new session, surround us with Your Holy Spirit. Encompass with Your power all the walls and the dome of this building, truly a symbol to the world of inalienable rights and the freedom of people. Guide and protect Your elected servants in government and all who work in this place. May all who visit here be treated with respect and kindness. May the comings and goings of Your people be under the seal of Your loving care, and may all our work be done for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. BABIN led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The SPEAKER laid before the House the following resignation from the House of Representatives: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , January 3, 2018. Speaker PAULRYAN, The Capitol, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN: I write to inform you that I will resign from the office of U.S. Representative, effective 5:00 PM EST, Monday, January 15, 2018. For the past seventeen years, it has been a tremendous honor and privilege to serve the people of Ohio as a Member of Congress. I thank you for your leadership as Speaker and wish you all the best in future success. Sincerely, PATRICK J. T IBERI , Representative to Congress. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , January 3, 2018. Hon. JOHNR. K ASICH , Riffe Center, Columbus, OH. DEAR GOVERNOR KASICH : I am writing to inform you that I will resign from my seat effective 5:00 PM EST, Monday, January 15, 2018. It has been an unimaginable privilege to serve the people of the 12th district of Ohio for the past seventeen years. Throughout this time, I have been honored to have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to strengthen our nation and improve people’s lives. However, I am equally proud of the outstanding constituent services my office has provided to help countless central Ohioans solve myriad problems with the federal government. Public service is a sacred trust with those we represent, and I hope I have been able to make a difference in people’s lives. It was a distinct honor to succeed you in Congress, and thank you for your leadership as governor to make Ohio an incredible place to live, work, and raise a family. I wish you all the best in continued success. Sincerely, PATRICK J. T IBERI , Representative to Congress. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, some folks in Washington are upset because we just passed the largest tax cut in American history. They think this money is Washington’s money and that politicians and bureaucrats should decide how to spend it. I could not disagree more. You and I know that this money belongs to the American people, came right out of their wallets. Under our new law, we put hardworking families first by helping them cope with the cost of raising children by doubling the child tax credit. We also help small businesses by cutting their taxes so that they can compete with foreign companies and create jobs right here in America. Well, for those folks who don’t think they need an extra $1,500 or so, or who think politicians and bureaucrats can spend their money better, I have a solution: go ahead and drop your new refund check in the mail. Send it to the IRS. They will be glad to take your money. 
CHILDREN’S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Children’s Health Insurance Program that so many of our vulnerable young people depend on for their healthcare coverage. Across the country, 8 million young people use CHIP, more than 300,000 people in Illinois alone. But their coverage and, consequently, their health and future are now in jeopardy because this House has failed to reauthorize the program for the first time in 20 years. Yesterday marked 100 days since the authorization lapsed. Before the new year, Congress temporarily extended limited funding, but the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is already warning that some States won’t have funding to make it through the month of January. It is beyond shameful that this House can pass trillions of dollars in tax breaks for those with the most security but not see its way to provide health insurance for the children most in need. This is a vital program. This is a popular program. This is a program that traditionally enjoys bipartisan support. There is no reason to continue to extend the uncertainty. I urge my colleagues to act and reauthorize the CHIP program as soon as possible to offer muchneeded stability to families and their children depending on this coverage. CELEBRATING LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today, on Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, to commend law enforcement officers throughout our Nation who answer the call to serve their communities. Law enforcement officers face increasingly difficult circumstances while working to serve and protect the public. It is a dangerous job, and often it is a thankless job. Our officers put on their uniform each day knowing that they can be in harm’s way at any moment. They answer the call in times of distress. They follow the rules, and they wear the badges proudly. This day is designated annually, on January 9, to show support to our law enforcement leaders in every community, including the Capitol Police, who are with us here today. Madam Speaker, we must remember that our officers are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, husbands and wives. They are human, and they, arguably, have one of the most difficult jobs in America. So today, and each day, let’s honor our brothers and sisters in blue. Let’s thank them for the important work that they do to keep us all safe. 
LET’S KEEP THE GOVERNMENT OPEN (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, the Republican majority spent the entire year of 2017 in this House essentially stacking the deck for the most powerful interests in this country. That tax bill, you look at it closely, it grants massive benefits to people at the very top of the economy, at the cost of over $1 trillion in debt that our children and grandchildren will have to pay back. Now, with just 10 days to go before another potential government shutdown, and a shutdown which would cost our economy billions of dollars, we still have not gotten a budget. Despite the fact that Republicans control the House, they control the Senate, they control the White House, and they have consolidated power, they can’t keep the government open for more than a few weeks at a time. The way we have to do this is to work together across the aisle. We are willing, but we can’t be brought into the conversation 15 minutes before the government is going to be shut down; and we ought to deal with the big priorities that we were sent here to deal with, where we agree. We agree on CHIP, at least the majority of the House does. Bring it to the floor for a vote. We agree on DACA. A majority would vote for a Dreams bill. Let’s just work on the things we can agree on and leave the partisan fights to those areas where we really disagree. This is long overdue. f 
CHILDREN’S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (Mr. YOUNG of Iowa asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I rise today again to call on my colleagues to quickly pass a 5year extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Around 85,000 Iowa children rely on CHIP for their health. If we don’t act, families and children will suffer. This is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue, and we must pass a solution together. Families should not be worried about losing coverage for their children. And the fact that this Congress cannot muster the ability to pass a long term extension of CHIP is confounding, to say the least. We must quickly set aside any political games, come to the table, and work together to pass a longterm CHIP funding bill. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to set aside any political games or partisan brinksmanship and come together and fully fund CHIP. The health of our children is at stake. 
b1215 REMEMBERING SISTER CATHERINE PINKERTON (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Sister Catherine Pinkerton, who journeyed from us during this past Christmas season in Cleveland. She had attained the age of 96. Sister Catherine was a Roman Catholic Sisters of St. Joseph order for 78 years. She rose to serve as president of her congregation, and she was also selected to lead the national Leadership Conference of Women Religious and was awarded its Outstanding Leadership Award in 2006. She worked as the founder of NETWORK, the social justice lobby, urging Congress to care for the needy and the sick, and she became a tireless advocate in these Halls of Congress for justice, especially for the poor and oppressed. One of her greatest victories was pushing for the passage of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which insures 9 million of America’s children. In 2008, Sister Catherine was invited to deliver the benediction at the Democratic National Convention, and she urged Americans to ‘‘call forth and affirm as leaders of this Nation, persons 
of vision, courage, and solid values, clearly focused not only on what is but, rather, open to the challenge of discerning and welcoming what is yet to be.’’ Sister Catherine, your sacrificial life was extraordinary, and you were countercultural. You will be missed. May your passionate words and deeds guide us to care for our fellow human beings. The American people are grateful for your lifetime of service. I will later include in the RECORD a eulogy and tribute to Sister Catherine by Sister Christine Schenk, who spoke at her memorial service and whose first sentence about her reads: ‘‘Catherine’s life was all about bringing glad tidings to the poor and letting the oppressed go free. She was so powerfully passionate and so dedicated to her mission of justice, who can doubt that the spirit had indeed anointed her for this work?’’ 
CONGRATULATING PANAMA CITY BEACH FIRE CHIEF JOHN DALY ON RETIREMENT (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Panama City Beach Fire Chief John Daly on his retirement. Chief Daly served the people of Panama City Beach for 33 years and willingly took up the responsibility to run into the fire, putting his life on the line to save others countless times. When he began his career with Panama City Beach Fire and Rescue in 1985, there were only seven career firefighters. Today that number has grown to 35 as our city has grown and thrived. John was promoted to chief in 2002 and has remained an outstanding leader ever since. He considers the firefighters under his watch to be family, and he knows that they will continue to do great things under the leadership of the new fire chief, Larry Couch. Madam Speaker, please join me in saying thank you to Chief Daly, his wife, Joan, and their daughters for their years of service and sacrifice, and wish them luck as they enjoy a new chapter in life. 
NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY AND HONORING THE LIFE OF DEPUTY DANIEL MCCARTNEY (Mr. REICHERT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, before I came to Congress, I spent 33 years as a cop. Today is National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, a day to honor our dedicated law enforcement officers who selflessly put their lives on the line each and every day to protect our families. We not only honor those who protect and serve us today, but we also remember those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Sadly, yesterday, in my community, we experienced the death, the murder, of another police officer. His name was Deputy Daniel McCartney of the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department, shot and killed while responding to a burglary call. This brave man was also a Navy veteran and leaves behind a wife and three sons—4 years old, 6 years old, and 9 years old—without a father. I ask you to join me today in praying for his family and for his colleagues in the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department. Every day, law enforcement officers are asked to stand tall in the face of danger. I know. To paraphrase a quote from Sheriff Pastor yesterday after the death of his fallen officer, he said: Deputy McCartney ran toward trouble, ran to protect. He is a man who served with the heart of a servant, with spirit, with strength and compassion. Please join me today in thanking our law enforcement officers across this Nation for their dedicated service. f 
MEDIA POSITIVE NEWS (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, the media’s daily barrage of negative stories have undermined the public’s confidence in their reporting. The media continues to ignore positive stories about the President’s effective policies. If the media were not so biased against the President, more of the American people would know the following: The 4.1 percent unemployment rate for the entire country is the lowest it has been in 17 years; Latino and AfricanAmerican unemployment numbers are the lowest in decades; The stock market has broken numerous records, adding significant value to Americans’ investment and retirement accounts; The economy is growing at 3.3 percent, the fastest in years; Consumer confidence is at a 17year high. The liberal media should report the facts, even if they make the President look good. 
RECOGNIZING LITTLE ROCK POLICE DEPARTMENT (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today on this National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day to recognize this year’s Little Rock Police Department recruit class and their efforts to fill dozens of sworn officer vacancies within the department. Little Rock’s police force has suffered a loss in numbers over the past few years, currently with 84 sworn officer vacancies. According to department data, this fall’s recruit class is tied for the largest number of starting recruits since 1993. Earlier this year, City Manager Bruce Moore announced that officers would work mandatory overtime due to the vacancies. So I thank City Manager Moore, Chief Buckner, and Mayor Mark Stodola for their leadership and efforts to address these vacancies and return this department to full strength. I respect and appreciate the important work of our police throughout the Nation who are charged with the critical work of protecting us in our States and communities. I wish this recruit class the very best of luck as they pursue their goal of joining the Little Rock Police Department and ensuring the safety of our citizens, our neighborhoods, and our property. f 
CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL (Mr. BEYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to claim that climate change is real, that it is manmade, and that we have a responsibility to act bravely and constructively to minimize the damage it does to humanity and to the fauna and flora of our planet. The reality of our warming atmosphere, oceans, and continents has been established in thousands of peerreviewed articles. This is scientific fact accepted by the governments of peoples of almost every nation in the world. But science is always evolving, and scientists continue to work diligently to discover the facts, the processes, and the implications for all of us. Mostly, what we learn is sad and destructive. Last Thursday, the peerreviewed academic journal Science published a new study that concludes the frequency of coral bleaching has increased so much that reefs cannot recover between severe episodes. We need to focus on just the facts of climate change and then be wise enough and bold enough to act. Every Member of Congress must bear the burden of this responsibility. 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF FIREFIGHTER LIEUTENANT MATT LETOURNEAU (Mr. MEEHAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MEEHAN. Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor the memory of Philadelphia firefighter Lieutenant Matt LeTourneau, who is also a longtime member of the Springfield Fire Company in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. 
Lieutenant LeTourneau tragically died Saturday evening, giving his life protecting his community while battling a row house fire in subfreezing temperatures in the city of Philadelphia. Matt graduated from Cardinal O’Hara High School in 1993 in Delaware County, and he served 11 years as a member of the Philadelphia Fire Department. He joined the Springfield Fire Company in 1991 at the age of 16, and he served and continued to serve as an instructor at the Delaware County Emergency Services Training Center, where he was praised by his colleagues for his skill and the knowledge that he passed on to them about how to keep themselves safe. He served his community with dedication, commitment, and courage, his colleagues said. ‘‘We took a big loss in the fire service,’’ J.J. Bonsall, one of his closest friends said. ‘‘He was one of the greatest firefighters we know.’’ He was also a participant in something called Redpaw Emergency Relief Team, making sure that animals that are harmed in fires have a safe place. Madam Speaker, I thank Lieutenant Matt LeTourneau for his service and sacrifice for the community that he loved. The condolences and gratitude of an entire region are with his mother, with his extended family, his friends, and the firefighters from Springfield and Philadelphia fire companies. 
RECOGNIZING STOP THE BLEED TRAINING COURSES (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Stop the Bleed training courses offered by the American College of Surgeons. Every year, more than 180,000 Americans die from injuries sustained in a myriad of ways. What many people may not know is that a large number of these fatalities result not from instantaneous trauma but, rather, from blood loss. From the moment a major injury occurs, the clock is ticking. Uncontrolled bleeding can kill us in as little as 5 to 10 minutes. Bleeding is a preventable cause of death, and that is why the Stop the Bleed effort is such a valuable program. The American College of Surgeons, working in partnership with many other organizations, has now made this training easily available to Americans across this country. I had the opportunity to participate in Stop the Bleed training myself, and as part of my course, I learned how to properly apply bandages and tourniquets. And do you know, what? It actually was kind of fun. We should do everything possible to ensure that more accidents don’t become tragedies. This effort must include integrating blood loss prevention into our preparedness toolkit. Let’s all be ready to come to the aid of our fellow citizens if the need ever arises. Madam Speaker, let’s stop the bleed. f 
HONORING THE LEGACY OF DR. RICHARD ALBERTA (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of a constituent of mine in my district, Dr. Richard Alberta, senior pastor at Cornerstone Evangelical Presbyterian Church in Brighton, Michigan. On December 31, 2017, Dr. Alberta stepped down from the pulpit after 40 years of service. Originally from New York, Dr. Alberta was raised in a nonreligious home. After marrying his high school sweetheart, Donna, he embarked on a successful career until, one day, something changed. He attended a church service and realized the missing puzzle piece in his life was to do whatever he can to pursue and prayerfully consider the path felt by the love of his Lord and devotion to his ministry. Over the past four decades, Dr. Alberta dedicated his time, wisdom, and leadership to the Lord and the church. His friendship and faithful guidance has made a lasting impression on the lives of so many. As he begins his next chapter, I wish him all the best, and I commend him on his unwavering commitment to his congregation and to our community as a whole. 
b1230 ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4577, the Domestic Explosives Detection Canine Capacity Building Act of 2017. In recent years, the volume of air travel has steadily risen, with 42 million people traveling domestically in the last days of 2017 alone. Last year, the worldwide number of people flying rose to a historic high of 4 billion passengers. The high visibility of the aviation sector makes it a persistent target for terrorists who wish to carry out attacks and inflict harm upon U.S. citizens. As such, the TSA must continue to collaborate with stakeholders and better incorporate proven security tools into security operations. One of the tools that we know to be effective is canine detection teams, particularly in detecting and protecting against explosive threats. In a May 2017 hearing before the Committee on Homeland Security last year, the Director of the Threat Assessment Division within the Transportation Security Administration attested to the value of aviation screening canine teams, saying: ‘‘Canines are incredibly effective. They can do things we can’t even measure with machines.’’ The legislation before us today, H.R. 4577, would require the TSA to establish a working group of stakeholders to determine ways to develop a domestic canine breeding network to produce explosives detection canines and modernize canine training standards. Today, the demand for trained and certified dogs is huge, with more and more security stakeholders coming to appreciate the explosive detection capabilities of our fourlegged friends. This heightened demand has led to a shortage, presenting challenges for the U.S. Government in the procurement of suitable canines. In testimony before the committee, the TSA and various stakeholders have cited these challenges and expressed concern regarding how to best address this shortage. That is why this legislation is so important. The working group mandated in this legislation draws from authorities on explosives detection canines and homeland security missions, including the Transportation Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Directorate, national domestic canine associations, academic experts, and domestic canine breeders and vendors. The knowledge and expertise offered by this diverse group of representatives will ensure that the DHS can implement an effective and impactful strategy to further the development of explosives detection canine teams. For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ), who is the chairman of the Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee of the Committee on Homeland Security. Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my colleague’s bill, H.R. 4477, the Domestic Explosives Detection Canine Capacity Building Act of 2017. This bill will help develop a domestic program through which the DHS and the TSA can acquire highquality explosives detection canines from the United States. Currently, too much money is spent on too few canines because we are forced to compete for dogs from other countries in this highdemand threat environment. Mr. ROGERS ’ bill will help mitigate threats to aviation security by working to build our capacity here at home while proliferating the use of highly capable explosives detection canines. In a time when threats to homeland security are rapidly evolving, these dogs represent one of our greatest security tools in detecting explosives in surface and aviation transportation systems. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. ROGERS  for his leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance of my time. H.R. 4577 will jumpstart conversations on how to increase the supply of canines and better integrate them in the TSA’s layered security at airports 
and surface transportation hubs. Canines have become an invaluable asset to the DHS in fulfilling its many important missions and goals. Even prior to the inception of the Department, canines were utilized by law enforcement and first responder agencies for decades, proving to be one of the most effective and versatile tools in detecting threats and protecting the homeland. Terrorists are working hard to exploit vulnerabilities in our transportation system, and the U.S. must utilize all of our available resources to combat these threats. Canines are undoubtedly one such resource, providing a robust and reliable layer of security and giving Americans peace of mind. If enacted, H.R. 4577 would better position the TSA to achieve and maintain a reliable supply of canines to deploy to not only airport terminals, but also to cargo operations and mass transit systems. As such, Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4577, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, this is an area that we have spent a lot of time on in the Committee on Homeland Security over several years, and I can state without equivocation that there is no technology that is more effective at detecting explosives in our transportation systems than these canines. It is a shame that we have allowed ourselves to become so heavily dependent on European providers for this very essential asset. This bill will go a long way in helping our country establish its own production of these essential assets for our use in keeping our country safe and secure. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4577, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DHS OVERSEAS PERSONNEL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2017 Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4567) to require a Department of Homeland Security overseas personnel enhancement plan, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4567 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘DHS Overseas Personnel Enhancement Act of 2017’’. SEC. 2. OVERSEAS PERSONNEL BRIEFING.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VELA) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4567, the DHS Overseas Personnel Enhancement Act of 2017. As chairman of the Homeland Security Committee’s Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective Security, I recently led a bipartisan congressional delegation to Europe and the Middle East to examine international aviation security and counterterrorism operations. The efforts of DHS personnel stationed overseas to build relationships with foreign partners, to coordinate with other Federal agencies, and to secure our homeland from threats before they arrive on our shores are truly a testament to the vital counterterror mission of Homeland Security. Additionally, the trip underscored the need to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of our overseas programs in a manner that is risk based. Unfortunately, however, I also observed that even today, more than 15 years after 9/11, the United States Government still struggles to avoid stovepiping and effectively participate in information sharing and collaboration on homeland security matters. It is imperative that DHS personnel serve as a force multiplier with their Federal counterparts to act in genuine partnership when mitigating threats to the homeland both here and abroad. My legislation takes observations from our delegation and codifies requirements to make overseas DHS personnel more effective and better equipped. This bill provides critical transparency to the training provided to overseas DHS employees, as well as how their positions and roles measurably contribute to the counterterrorism mission of the Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, my bill will allow Congress to understand what organizational culture or bureaucratic hindrances exist to effective information sharing among DHS personnel and how we can break down barriers to better address evolving threats to the United States. The first role of government is to protect its citizens, and it is incumbent upon those of us in Congress to ensure that the United States Government is doing all it can to respond to changing threats, share information effectively, 
and build counterterrorism capacity among our foreign partners. I appreciate the bipartisan support of Ranking Member WATSON COLEMAN , Congressman VELA, and Congresswoman MENGof this bill and I look forward to continuing our work together on these and other issues. I also wish to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. MCCAUL, for his unwavering support of our efforts. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4567, the DHS Overseas Personnel Enhancement Act of 2017. Madam Speaker, the DHS Overseas Personnel Enhancement Act of 2017 would require the Department of Homeland Security to submit to Congress an overseas personnel assessment and enhancement plan. Today, roughly 2,000 DHS personnel have been deployed to more than 70 countries around the world. These DHS employees are involved in a diverse range of overseas operations targeted at terrorism prevention, counternarcotics, and preventing human smuggling. I am particularly interested in the efforts of the National Targeting Center, which is housed within U.S. Customs and Border Protection, to embed intelligence analysts in overseas information sharing operations with international partners to prevent terrorist and other criminal networks from carrying out attacks and criminal operations with impunity. In fact, in a short while, the House will be debating H.R. 4578, the Counter Terrorist Network Act, which, among other things, authorizes overseas deployments from the CBP. About half of overseas DHS personnel are from the CBP and are involved, among other things, in screening U.S. bound passengers at airports, inspecting cargo being loaded on ships bound for the U.S., and training other nations’ customs and border force. Additionally, the DHS also assigns Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents, Secret Service special agents, and Transportation Security Administration officials to overseas posts to engage with international partners on counterterrorism, counternarcotics, information sharing, and criminal investigations, as well as security screening and vetting programs. Just last month, CBP personnel were credited with helping Ecuadoran authorities interdict and arrest seven people and 800 pounds of cocaine. Specifically, a CBP team participating in an aerial surveillance mission in drug transit zones near South America tracked a lowflying aircraft that intelligence reports indicated had not filed a flight plan and, with a longlens camera, snapped images of the plane’s tail number and other identifying details and radioed Ecuador who were waiting when the plane landed to arrest the smugglers. b1245 According to CBP, its P–3 plane program patrols more than 42 million square miles in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the Pacific Ocean and last year contributed to 145 drug seizures, helping American and foreign authorities capture a combined 34,108 pounds of marijuana and 193,197 pounds of cocaine, according to Customs and Border Protection records. More broadly, DHS personnel stationed overseas make important contributions to the Department’s efforts in securing the homeland and keeping the American people safe. As such, it is imperative that these individuals are utilized efficiently and effectively. This bill seeks to ensure just that. In 2016, Congress enacted legislation that the Committee on Homeland Security, on a bipartisan basis, approved to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue a strategy for the Department’s international programs. Among other things, the law required DHS to provide the committee with an inventory of personnel and resources deployed abroad and a 3year, risk based strategy to ensure strategic overseas employment of personnel. The statutory deadline for this strategy was June 2017, 7 months ago. This critical strategy has not been submitted to Congress, as mandated. H.R. 4567 incorporates an amendment from Ranking Member THOMPSON that expands the bill’s briefing requirement to include information on efforts to implement the strategy. Enactment of this bipartisan legislation should help enhance the effectiveness of DHS personnel at foreign locations. Madam Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ). Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I represent Newark, New Jersey, home of Port Newark and Newark Liberty International Airport. Port Newark is the busiest container port on the East Coast, handling over 700,000 cargo containers annually. In 2015, over 37 million passengers traveled through Newark Liberty International Airport, including many traveling into the United States from abroad. As a Member of Congress representing the largest port on the Eastern seaboard and one of the busiest international airports in the country, it is important to me that the Federal Government do everything in its power to push out our borders—to prevent dangerous cargo and dangerous people from coming into our country. The DHS Overseas Personnel Enhancement Act of 2017 would do just that by directing the Department to develop and execute an overseas personnel assessment and enhancement plan. As we speak, nearly 2,000 DHS employees are stationed around the globe, engaging in terrorism prevention, counternarcotics, and antihuman smuggling activities in more than 70 countries. About half of DHS personnel deployed overseas are from Customs and Border Protection, who are responsible for screening U.S.bound passengers at airports, inspecting cargo being loaded onto ships bound for the U.S., and training other nations’ customs and border forces. The Department also sends Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents, Secret Service special agents, and Transportation Security Administration officials abroad to help prevent international criminal and terrorist activity from spreading into the United States. These activities have a direct impact on the security of my district. Over the course of the past year, multiple people have been caught attempting to smuggle drugs into the country through Newark Liberty International Airport, including a man who tried to bring over 1 kilogram of heroin into the country by disguising it as a sixlayer cake. While I applaud CBP for apprehending bad actors as they attempt to enter the United States, I would prefer to keep bad people and bad cargo outside of our borders, particularly in light of the drug epidemic affecting many of our communities. Accordingly, I am committed to ensuring that the Department has optimized the deployment of its international personnel. Madam Speaker, therefore, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4567. Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, in closing, H.R. 4567 seeks to enhance DHS’ efforts to push out our borders. The men and women of DHS face an immense challenge in responding to the everchanging terrorist threat landscape. It is imperative that DHS personnel stationed overseas serve as an effective force in this mission, and enactment of this legislation would be a positive step towards this goal. In fiscal year 2016, CBP officers inspected over 390 million travelers at 328 ports of entry, of which over 119 million flew into air ports of entry. Deployed overseas CBP officers, through programs such as Preclearance and the Immigration Advisory Program, utilize a riskbased, intelligencedriven strategy to extend our border security efforts outward to detect, assess, and mitigate, at the earliest possible point in the travel continuum, any risk imposed by travelers before they reach the United States. Today, ICE agents are assigned to 66 offices in 49 countries and work with their overseas law enforcement counterparts to detect, disrupt, and dismantle transnational criminal groups 
and individuals who seek to harm our country and people. ICE special agents investigate transnational crime by conducting a wide range of criminal investigations, in coordination with our foreign and domestic partner agencies, targeting the illegal movement of people, merchandise, and monetary instruments into, within, and out of the United States. Maintaining an overseas footprint is costly. In fact, the annual cost of deploying an ICE agent overseas can be four times the cost of deploying the agent domestically. As such, it is critical that DHS have a strategy for its overseas programs and execute it. Congress has an important oversight role to play to ensure that DHS carries out these programs in a riskbased, strategic manner. Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4567, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, the starkness of the challenges facing the men and women of DHS to accomplish our mission was made clear to me and my committee colleagues on a recent trip to the Middle East and Western Europe. I hope they know just how much we appreciate all of their tireless efforts to protect the homeland. Madam Speaker, I digress just for a moment before I close and note that, for the last 3 years on my committee, one of my colleagues, the main committee staff person, Krista Harvey, has worked on all these bills and worked on all these trips I have taken and has played a key role in the things we do to keep our country safe. In fact, I was just checking. Twentyone bills that she helped author passed the House, and many were signed into law. Ms. Harvey, regrettably, is leaving our service, but she is going to continue serving the government in working at the Department of Homeland Security in a senior capacity at the Transportation Security Administration. I thank her for her work and doing all she does as a public servant helping us keep our country safe. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4567, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. SECURITY ASSESSMENT FEASIBILITY FOR EQUIPMENT TESTING AND EVALUATION OF CAPABILITIES FOR OUR HOMELAND ACT Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4561) to provide for third party testing of transportation security screening technology, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4561 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VELA) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4561, the SAFE TECH Act, sponsored by my good friend and colleague and a knowledgeable alumnus of the Homeland Security Committee, Congressman BILIRAKIS , who recently participated in my subcommittee’s overseas congressional delegation to examine airport security and the passenger screening technology in place at last point of departure airports with direct flights to the United States. As part of our delegation, we visited Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, where we saw the effective deployment of new and advanced computed tomography screening technology, as well as a number of other screening technologies aimed at making the passenger and employee screening checkpoints both more effective and more efficient. Upon returning to the United States, the committee conducted rigorous oversight and found that the existing testing and evaluation processes in place at the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration are riddled with bureaucratic bottlenecks that serve to delay new technologies for years. I will note that the technology in place at the airport in Schiphol was made in the United States, yet we are not taking advantage of that technology because of these bottlenecks. Additionally, due to logjams at Homeland Security and TSA facilities, small businesses, as well as technology startups, are often prevented from participating in the acquisitions and procurement processes. As a result, our aviation system is left with antiquated security technology that is incapable of adequately responding to new and everevolving threats. Madam Speaker, this is simply unacceptable, and we must act to reform the Homeland Security and TSA acquisition processes. H.R. 4561 takes significant steps toward making these reforms by allowing new technologies to receive thirdparty testing and evaluation, while maintaining existing lines of authority for the TSA administrator to ensure such testing remains held to the highest standards of security and integrity. This bill will not only drive innovation but will also save taxpayer dollars at Homeland Security and TSA, while reducing costs to companies developing new screening technologies. That is why we have received broad support, not only in a bipartisan manner here in Congress, but also from the private sector. Madam Speaker, I commend the dedication of Congressman BILIRAKIS to reforming the broken acquisitions process currently in place and for working with me and the committee on developing this bill. I also wish to thank Chairman MCCAUL for supporting this legislation and moving it quickly through the committee to address the serious concerns we found through our oversight efforts. I also thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who routinely support bills of ours, and we routinely support bills of theirs, because we both understand that homeland security is a very bipartisan issue. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4561, the Security Assessment Feasibility for Equipment Testing and Evaluation of Capabilities for Our Homeland Act, and I encourage my colleagues to support its passage, which would require the Department of Homeland Security to develop a new, thirdparty testing program for Transportation Security Administration screening technology. We have heard, time and time again, from vendors that it takes far too long to get their technologies through TSA testing processes. TSA’s testing and evaluation must be improved not simply to improve management efficiency, but to address the constantly evolving threat landscape. In November, TSA Administrator David Pekoske testified before the Committee on Homeland Security about the need to accelerate deployment of innovative security enhancements, as terrorist groups are becoming more sophisticated. These bad actors are learning about our aviation security countermeasures and have even gone so far as to post instructions to build devices to evade screening technologies on the internet. b1300 As terrorist and criminal organizations become more sophisticated, we must remain one step ahead. H.R. 4561 seeks to do just that and move TSA forward in overcoming technology stovepipes that have hindered stateof theart security technology from being integrated into our Nation’s transportation systems in a timely manner. H.R. 4561 is predicated on the view that, by establishing alternative avenues to test transportation screening technologies, TSA will be positioned to introduce innovative security enhancements into checkpoints sooner, and businesses, regardless of their size, will be better positioned to compete. The committee has repeatedly heard from small security manufacturers about how financially draining it is to wait out TSA testing in the hopes of a contract. H.R. 4561, if implemented effectively, has the potential to get innovative technology produced by small businesses in airport security checkpoints and enhance the effectiveness of TSA’s screening operations. During consideration of this measure in committee, the majority accepted amendments offered by committee Democrats to the bill to ensure that the thirdparty testing receives scrutiny from the Government Accountability Office and to build integrity into this new program. Given the changes that were made to the legislation in committee and the potential positive impact this legislation could have on ensuring innovative technologies are integrated into TSA’s security operations, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4561. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ). Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, my good friend JOHN KATKO , and also the ranking member, my good friend FILOVELA, and also the chairman, the full chairman of the committee, Mr. MCCAUL, for their great work. I really appreciate it. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 4561, Security Assessment Feasibility for Equipment Testing and Evaluation of Capabilities for Our Homeland, or the SAFE TECH Act. My legislation seeks to strengthen the safety of international air travel. Specifically, this bill provides an avenue for thirdparty testing of innovative technology screening capabilities to enhance airport security. The testing program authorized under this act shall include evaluating the performance of detecting explosives and other prohibited items. Additionally, the SAFE TECH Act will look into alternative testing for other factors, including, health and safety concerns, operator interference, human error, environmental dynamics, reliability, and interoperability. 
The bill also assesses the feasibility of linking compatible security technology utilized by the United States and international allies in order to augment screening checkpoints. The coordinated collaboration is an essential element of strengthening global security. Currently, technical standards for safety and operating procedures at the international airports are set by international agreements. However, the standards in place are generally broad, leaving potential vulnerabilities through inconsistencies with international partners. On a recent congressional delegation trip that I appreciated the chairman including me on to review screening procedures for inbound travel to the United States at major EU hubs, I was startled by the lack of consistency in international standards and gaps in technology that support precautionary measures to ensure passenger safety. Today’s bill—and I appreciate the work of the committee, and I thank you for making it an even stronger bill—will address this concern and improve the safety of our air travel for all passengers. I have always contended that, if we are not safe, nothing else matters. The protection and security of our homeland and its citizens is our responsibility, Mr. Speaker, which is why I introduced the SAFE TECH Act. We must ensure those entrusted with the care of our citizens have the best resources and technology available to combat the growing threat of terrorism. Passage of this bill today makes air travel safer for everyone entering the United States and for our citizens, and it represents a step forward in ensuring the cooperation needed to improve global security. I urge my colleagues to support this good bill and its passage in the House. Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I would first like to point out that this series of bills that we have presented today has been worked on in a strong bipartisan fashion. I would like to thank Chairman KATKO and Ranking Member W ATSON  COLEMAN for their strong leadership on this subcommittee, Mr. BILIRAKIS for his hard work, and, of course, Chairman MCCAUL and Ranking Member THOMPSON for their leadership on the Homeland Security committee. On behalf of both Members and staff on this side of the aisle, we also wish Krista Harvey the best of luck in her future endeavors. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4561 is commonsense legislation. This bill promotes the incorporation of innovative technology in airport screening capabilities. It does so by requiring DHS to stand up a thirdparty testing program to accelerate the evaluation of promising transportation security technologies, including 3Dimaging computer tomography, or CT technology. CT scan technology holds great promise in enhancing the effectiveness of TSA screening operations insofar as transportation security officers would have the benefit of seeing a full 3D multicolor image of whatever the screener is inspecting and getting better detail about any suspect items. Presently, TSA is testing a number of systems in the lab and in the field and has said that it expects to be able to begin deployment of this new tool to airports by early 2019. Given the known ongoing terrorist threat posed by electronic devices, CT technology should be introduced into the airport environment in an expedited fashion. If done right, the establishment of a thirdparty testing program within TSA has the potential of getting innovative technologies into our transportation security systems quicker and improving the overall effectiveness of security screening. As such, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4561. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the time is long overdue to apply strong oversight and reform to the manner in which TSA develops and deploys new screening technologies across our aviation system. With persistent threats facing the aviation sector, H.R. 4561 makes much needed improvements to the innovation and procurement process at TSA. I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WEBER of Texas). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4561, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SECURING AMERICAN NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AGAINST TERRORISM ACT OF 2017 Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1486) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide funding to secure nonprofit facilities from terrorist attacks, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1486 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securing American NonProfit Organizations Against Terrorism Act of 2017’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Subtitle A of title XX of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ‘‘SEC. 2009. NONPROFIT SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill that is under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1486, the Securing American NonProfit Organizations Against Terrorism Act of 2017. This bill authorizes the Nonprofit Security Grant Program within the Department of Homeland Security. Administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, this program provides critical support to help protect atrisk nonprofit institutions, including Jewish community centers, houses of worship, and other cultural and community institutions, against threats and attacks. Security enhancements covered by the program include the installation of cameras, physical barriers or controlled entry systems, along with training for activeshooter scenarios. Nonprofit organizations in my district have told me about the positive impact this program has had on their security. In fact, the Jewish Community Center of Staten Island recently received a $75,000 grant through this program for their facility located on Arthur Kill Road in order to adequately respond to an increase in threats. I have also led letters to appropriators advocating for $50 million for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and was so glad to see that the funding level was included in the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, which passed the House last September. The bill we are considering today further demonstrates our commitment to the program by authorizing it for the first time. I was pleased to work with the ranking member on this language as part of the DHS Authorization Act that we approved this summer, and I am pleased to once again support it today. Nonprofit organizations provide vital services to our communities every day. The program authorized by the bill we are considering here today will help provide peace of mind that they will be secure as they continue to serve their neighbors. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1486, the Securing American NonProfit Organizations Against Terrorism Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1486 would authorize the Department of Homeland Security’s Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which awards grants to nonprofit organizations at risk of a terrorist attack, in statute. Since early last year, nonprofit organizations throughout the United States have experienced an uptick in threats, vandalism, and violent acts. According to the AntiDefamation League, anti Semitic incidents jumped 67 percent from 2016 to the first three quarters of 2017. Many nonprofit organizations, however, do not have the resources to make their facilities more secure by installing proper surveillance, hardening their facilities, and undergoing general preparedness activities. The need for nonprofit organizations across the country to have access to the Homeland Security grants to bolster security is substantial. Given the security challenges associated with the current terrorist threat environment, it is important that this critical Homeland Security grant program be codified in law. This bill goes further than just codifying the existing program. It expands it to include jurisdictions that are located outside funded UASIs but are still at risk of terrorism. H.R. 1486 authorizes the Nonprofit Security Grant Program at $50 million, a $25 million increase over its current funding level. Language similar to this measure was included in the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017, which passed the House earlier this Congress. I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, with the emergence of lone wolves and small terrorist cells, we have seen that acts of terror are not just limited to urban areas. As threats to our homeland continue to evolve and as violent extremists continue to exploit soft targets, the risk to nonprofit organizations grows. We need to make sure that we do our part to ensure that places of worship and other nonprofit organizations throughout the country have access to resources necessary to keep themselves safe and secure. b1315 H.R. 1486 was endorsed by The Jewish Federations of North America. I appreciate its support. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the letter of support. 
OFNORTH AMERICA , Washington, DC, December 7, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman, Hon. BENNIE G. T HOMPSON , Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. DANIEL M. D ONOVAN , Chairman, Hon. DONALD M. P AYNE , Jr., Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMEN MCCAUL AND DONOVAN AND  RANKING MEMBERS THOMPSON AND PAYNE : We commend you for scheduling the markup of H.R. 1486, the Securing American NonProfit Organizations Against Terrorism Act of 2017. The Jewish Federations strongly endorse this bill, and respectfully urge Members of the Committee to adopt Ranking Member Thompson’s amendment of the bill in the nature of a substitute, in order to align it with Sec. 2011 of Housepassed H.R. 2825, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017. The vulnerability of places of worship to violent homegrown extremists (HVEs) is a growing threat in the United States. According to a joint assessment by the National Counterterrorism Center, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, HVEs are increasingly favoring softer civilian targets, such as houses of worship, having judged them to have lower levels of security (and, for some, as a result of encouragement from overseas violent extremists, such as ISIL). Last month, the FBI released its annual hate crimes report for 2016, which found that Muslim bias crimes increased , and, for the 20th consecutive year, antiJewish hate crimes amounted to the majority of all religious bias crimes reported. This year, synagogues, churches, mosques, religious centers, cemeteries, and other nonprofits have been subjected to arson/firebombing, shooting/ mass shooting, attempted bombing, death threats, robbery, vandalism/destruction of property, hatebased/antiSemitic graffiti, assault, intimidation, and the targets of incitement to violence. According to DHS, religious facilities share a number of common vulnerabilities that make them ready targets of attack, including unrestricted access to facilities and contiguous and peripheral areas, easy identification, predictable schedules, and large congregations of people. To minimize these vulnerabilities, DHS recommends protective measures that include, access controls, barriers, monitoring, surveillance, and other physical target hardening and preparedness investments, such as planning and training. Unfortunately, DHS acknowledges that common vulnerabilities also include the limited resources nonprofit institutions have for security. Passage of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 1486 would address the vulnerabilities of atrisk nonprofit institutions, by authorizing a nonprofit security grant program for the acquisition and installation of physical target hardening, including fencing, bollards, and other barriers; lighting, surveillance, and metal detection equipment; blast proofing doors and windows; cybersecurity; and related employee training and awareness exercises. For these reasons, JFNA strongly endorses H.R. 1486, and respectfully urges Members of the Committee to adopt the bill as amended. Sincerely, ROBERT B. G OLDBERG , Senior Director, Legislative Affairs, The Jewish Federations of North America. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1486, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1486, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD the cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office regarding H.R. 1486. The cost estimate was not available at the time of the filing of the Committee report. 
U.S. C ONGRESS , CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE , Washington, DC, January 8, 2018. Hon. MICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 1486, the Securing American NonProfit Organizations Against Terrorism Act of 2017. If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Robert Reese. Sincerely, KEITH HALL. Enclosure. H.R. 1486—SECURING AMERICAN NONPROFIT  ORGANIZATIONS AGAINST TERRORISM ACT OF  2017 As ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on December 13, 2017 
SUMMARY  H.R. 1486 would authorize the appropriation of $50 million annually for fiscal years 2018 through 2022 for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide grants to certain nonprofit organizations to enhance security measures aimed at guarding against terrorist attacks. Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, CBO estimates implementing H.R. 1486 would cost $112 million over the 2018–2022 period. Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, payas yougo procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1486 would not increase net direct spending or on budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10year periods beginning in 2028. H.R. 1486 contains no intergovernmental or privatesector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). 
ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  The estimated budgetary effect of H.R. 1486 is shown in the following table. The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 450 (community and regional development). 
By fiscal year, in millions of dollars— 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2018– 2022 
BASIS OF ESTIMATE  CBO assumes the bill will be enacted near the beginning of calendar year 2018 and that the authorized amounts will be appropriated each year. H.R. 1486 would authorize the appropriation of $50 million in each of fiscal years 2018 through 2022 for FEMA to provide grants to nonprofit organizations for improvements to physical security and cybersecurity. (In 2017, FEMA allocated $25 million for such grants.) Based on historical spending patterns for such grants, CBO estimates implementing the bill would cost $112 million over the five year period and $138 million after 2022. 
DEFICITS  CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1486 would not increase net direct spending or on budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10year periods beginning in 2028. 
MANDATES  H.R. 1486 contains no intergovernmental or privatesector mandates as defined in UMRA. 
ESTIMATE PREPARED BY  Federal Costs: Robert Reese; Mandates: Andrew Laughlin. 
ESTIMATE APPROVED BY  H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1486, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
COUNTER TERRORIST NETWORK ACT Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4578) to authorize certain counter terrorist networks activities of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4578 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Counter Terrorist Network Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DUTY TO COUNTER TERRORIST NETWORKS; DETAILS AND ASSIGNMENT. 
Section 411 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 211) is amended— (1) in subsection (g)(4)— (A) in subparagraph (C)— (i) in clause (vi), by striking ‘‘and’’ at the end; (ii) by redesignating clause (vii) as clause (viii); and (iii) by inserting after clause (vi) the following new clause: ‘‘(vii) collaborate with appropriate agencies, including Federal, State, local, tribal, and international entities, to enhance border security through operations such as operations that seek to disrupt and dismantle networks, including foreign terrorist organizations (as such term is described in section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189)), that pose terrorist or other threats; and’’; (2) by redesignating subsections (p) through (r) as subsections (q) through (s), respectively; and (3) by inserting after subsection (o) the following new subsection: ‘‘(p) ASSIGNMENT OF PERSONNEL .—The Com missioner may detail or otherwise assign personnel of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to other appropriate agencies, including to serve overseas in support of global information sharing partnership operations in furtherance of enhancing border security, including by preventing entry into the United States by individuals known or suspected of being associated with a network, including a foreign terrorist organization (as such term is described in section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189)), that poses terrorist or other threats.’’. 
The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall biannually brief the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate regarding activities, during the prior six months, in furtherance of clause (vii) of section 411(g)(4) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 211(g)(4)), as added by section 2 of this Act. Such briefings may be provided in a classified setting if the Commissioner determines such is appropriate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VELA) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas. 
Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kansas? There was no objection. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4578, the Counter Terrorist Network Act. The fine men and women in uniform at U.S. Customs and Border Protection are tasked with an incredibly important mission. Every day, they protect our Nation from transnational criminal organizations, human traffickers, and terrorists who wish to exploit vulnerabilities at our Nation’s borders. To execute this critical mission, the CBP has developed a cadre of subject matter experts that are well versed in counternetwork operations. These experts work tirelessly at our Nation’s seaports, airports, and land border crossings, honing their skills, stopping the flow of illicit goods and people, and creating actionable intelligence. Given the fact that the CBP is uniquely positioned on our Nation’s front line, it would seem expected that members of the CBP would have the authority to participate in counternetwork activities that target terrorists and transnational threats, both domestically and internationally. 
However, this is not the case. Currently, the CBP lacks the statutory authority to assign CBP personnel to specialized counternetwork details and liaison assignments with a national security focus. H.R. 4578 seeks to mitigate this deficiency by giving the Commissioner of the CBP the statutory authority to assign personnel to these specialized task forces and collaborate with appropriate Federal, State, local, and Tribal entities to enhance border security operations that focus on disrupting and dismantling transnational criminal organizations and foreign terrorist networks. By granting this authority to the Commissioner, the CBP’s collaborative efforts will result in enhanced information sharing and an increase in intelligencedriven enforcement operations. Lastly, H.R. 4578 requires the Commissioner to provide a report to Congress within 6 months of enactment, substantially describing the ongoing efforts to defeat threats posed by transnational criminal and foreign terrorist groups. Mr. Speaker, I thank Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee Ranking Member VELAfor introducing this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the law enforcement community and to vote in favor of this important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4578, the Counter Terrorist Network Act. Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 4578, the Counter Terrorist Network Act, to support U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s ongoing efforts to prevent individuals who pose a known threat to our country from entering the United States. Over the years, the CBP has pushed out our borders through various programs, including international partnerships where officers are posted overseas. The CBP’s National Targeting Center, or NTC, uses the latest technology and analytical tools to identify threats and share that information with both domestic and international law enforcement partners. The CBP vets foreign nationals traveling to the United States prior to arrival through the use of various sophisticated screening techniques. Time and again, we see terrorist acts carried out by individuals who were not on the Federal radar for terrorism. In the 17 years since the September 11 attacks, we have made huge investments in this country in intelligence to better connect the dots about those risks. My legislation seeks to ensure that the NTC is positioned to continue embedding its analysts in overseas operations so that individuals associated with terrorist and transnational criminal networks are prevented from operating with impunity. H.R. 4578 authorizes the NTC to continue building its collaborative intelligence and law enforcement partnerships to stay one step ahead of those individuals who wish to do us harm or commit other criminal acts. The bill also authorizes CBP personnel to be posted abroad to perform critical preemptive operations to make sure the travelers and visa petitioners coming to our country are thoroughly screened and vetted. Mr. Speaker, it is imperative for the DHS and its law enforcement partners to do everything practicable to screen and vet individuals before they arrive at our borders. H.R. 4578 underscores this imperative by authorizing the CBP to counter terrorist and criminal networks’ efforts to infiltrate our borders in a way that has proven effective and adaptive. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4578. In closing, H.R. 4578 is a bipartisan bill that was unanimously approved by the Committee on Homeland Security late last year. The partnerships that the CBP has established to disrupt and dismantle terrorists and other criminal networks are valuable and merit congressional support. H.R. 4578 provides the CBP with statutory authority to continue these partnerships and it enables CBP personnel to be posted within different Federal and international entities in furtherance of their antiterrorism and homeland security missions. Congress must continue to support this effort, and we can do so today by passing this bill. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Homeland Security for their support, and I urge my House colleagues to pass H.R. 4578. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4578, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4578. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas. 
Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kansas? There was no objection. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman KATKO for his leadership on this important piece of legislation. It is essential that we continue to improve aviation security in order to stay ahead of the evolving threat posed by Islamist terrorists. It is clear that terrorists around the world remain intent on attacking aircraft. That is why over the past year the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration have worked to raise the global level of aviation security. One area of potential improvement is through working to increase security at overseas last point of departure airports. In October, I joined a bipartisan delegation of congressional members from the House Homeland Security Committee to several of the largest last point of departure airports, including Amman, Jordan; and Frankfurt, Germany. We examined current threats to aviation security and got to look at how our foreign partners have worked to stay ahead of all the potential threats. This legislation seeks to improve global aviation security standards by directing the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration to conduct a comprehensive review of aviation security implementation and challenges across the global aviation system. This legislation will help improve coordination and outreach, both within the United States Government and with foreign partners regarding improvements to aviation security. It makes sense for our security agencies to work with our foreign allies who are facing the same security threat that we face. This legislation will help the DHS locate and implement best practices, which are being used overseas. The fight to protect travelers isn’t one that we face alone in America, and this threat isn’t going to dissipate anytime soon. That is why this legislation is focused on ensuring that our agencies build partnerships and can learn from our foreign partners. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4559, the Global Aviation System Security Reform Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his leadership on this legislation. This legislation would require the TSA to conduct a global aviation security review in order to improve aviation standards across the global aviation system within 180 days of enactment. The security review within this bill is required to include input from the TSA’s Office of Global Strategies, Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and the Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement, and must identify best practices for foreign partners. While the TSA has taken tremendous steps to improve aviation security at airports with direct service to the U.S., there is more that can be done. In the last 12 months, we have seen the global aviation threat landscape evolve to include an increased threat to cargo security, and passenger planes being targeted with bombs hidden in large electronic devices. The TSA is continually working with global partners and stakeholders to ensure that aviation standards are being maintained and elevated as needed. Under this legislation, improvements that should be made to aviation security will be highlighted for Congress. This legislation has the potential of providing a very good roadmap for Congress to address areas of improvement for global aviation security and to ensure that we constantly strive towards the safest and most secure aviation community. Mr. Speaker, I note that, in the last couple of days, through the holiday season, those people who were either stuck in airports, and bags that were stacked, and people couldn’t find bags are not considered a security issue. It was a weather issue. But we understand how crucial it is that the traveling public has needs in the free flowing and secure flowing of aviation. Giving the Congress a roadmap, I believe, is a very important step. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4559, the ‘‘Global Aviation System Security Reform Act of 2017.’’ This legislation would require TSA to conduct a global aviation security review in order to improve aviation standards across the global aviation system within 180 days of enactment. The security review within this bill is required to include input from TSA’s Office of Global Strategies, Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and the Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement, and must identify best practices for foreign partners. While TSA has taken tremendous steps to improve aviation security at airports with direct service to the U.S., there is more that can be done. In the last 12 months, we have seen the global aviation threat landscape evolve to include an increased threat to cargo security, and passenger planes being targeted with bombs hidden in large electronic devices. TSA is continually working with global partners and stakeholders to ensure that aviation standards are being maintained and elevated as needed. Under this legislation, improvements that should be made to aviation security will be highlighted for Congress. This legislation has the potential of providing a roadmap for Congress to address areas of improvement for global aviation security, and ensure that we constantly strive towards the safest and most secure aviation community. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4559 will give this body a strong sense of the direction for global aviation security improvements. As threats to aviation security grow more sophisticated, this bill seeks to ensure that TSA is keeping pace with the threat landscape. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me again emphasize the importance of identifying best practices to be utilized by our system and to utilize these best practices to improve the security for the traveling public. H.R. 4559 will give this body a strong sense of direction for global aviation security improvements. As threats to aviation security grow more sophisticated, this bill seeks to ensure that the TSA is keeping pace with the threat landscape. b1330 Since I have no further speakers, I am closing by saying, with that, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4559. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. One of the things that we are seeing today, in an increasingly dangerous world, is how do we face these threats and work together. This bill is intended to help work to be more efficient across not just America but with our allies in making our aviation travel more safe and secure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of bill, H.R. 4559: The Global Aviation System Security Reform Act of 2017. This legislation will help raise the global baseline of aviation security and protect the traveling public from a litany of terror threats. After recently participating in a bipartisan Congressional delegation to the Middle East 
and Europe to observe international aviation security efforts firsthand, my colleagues and I returned home determined to bolster the Department of Homeland Security’s efforts to build capacity among foreign partners. When it comes to aviation security, we are only as secure as our weakest link. Unfortunately, through our oversight on the Homeland Security Committee’s Subcommittee on Transportation and Protective Security, we have grown increasingly concerned that existing standards are simply not sufficient to keep up with the changing threats to aviation. This legislation will ensure that DHS and TSA are aggressively committed to eliminating security vulnerabilities and inconsistencies at overseas airports with direct flights to the United States. I wish to thank Congressman ESTES for par ticipating in the important delegation we undertook which led to this legislation, as well as his commitment and leadership to security America’s transportation systems on my Subcommittee. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD the cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office regarding H.R. 4559. The cost estimate was not available at the time of the filing of the Committee report. 
U.S. C ONGRESS , CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE , Washington, DC, January 9, 2018. Hon. MICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4559, the Global Aviation System Security Reform Act of 2017. If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Megan Carroll. Sincerely, KEITH HALL. Enclosure. 
H.R. 4559—G LOBAL AVIATION SYSTEM  SECURITY REFORM ACT OF 2017 As ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on December 13, 2017 H.R. 4559 would direct the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), in consultation with other federal agencies, to review securityrelated standards across the global aviation system. The bill would require TSA to identify best practices for: Enhancing security by collaborating with foreign partners involved in aviation security, Identifying foreign entities that have not yet implemented international standards, Improving processes for issuing security related directives to air carriers, and Assessing cyberrelated threats to screening equipment. Using information from TSA, CBO estimates that meeting the bill’s requirements would increase the agency’s costs by less than $500,000 in 2018; such spending would be subject to appropriation. Enacting H.R. 4559 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, payasyougo procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 4559 would not increase net direct spending or on budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10year periods beginning in 2028. H.R. 4559 contains no intergovernmental or privatesector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Megan Carroll. The estimate was approved by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4559, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
CYBER VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE REPORTING ACT Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3202) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report on cyber vulnerability disclosures, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3202 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act’’. 
(a) R EPORT .—Not later than 240 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report that contains a description of the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber vulnerability disclosures, in accordance with section 227(m) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 148(m)). To the extent possible, such report shall include an annex with information on instances in which such policies and procedures were used to disclose cyber vulnerabilities in the year prior to the date such report is required and, where available, information on the degree to which such information was acted upon by industry and other stakeholders. Such report may also contain a description of how the Secretary is working with other Federal entities and critical infrastructure owners and operators to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities. (b) FORM.—The report required under subsection (b) shall be submitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified annex. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas. 
Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kansas? There was no objection. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act. It is hard to find an electronic device today that doesn’t connect to the internet. From smartphones to alarm clocks, everything is part of the Internet of Things. Americans can do everything, from personal banking to unlocking the front door, with the palm of their hands. As the world has become increasingly interconnected, vulnerabilities in computer code underlying these devices and the applications they run can often expose the average American to exploitation by hackers, criminals, and even bad actors from nation states. As more and more critical and personal information is being stored on the internet and more industrial systems are being operated autonomously, it is vital that we are able to plug the holes in vulnerable technology. It seems like every day we read about another data breach that could have been prevented if only the company had known about a vulnerability in the product or network, occurrences such as the WannCry ransomware that affected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries, and the recently reported meltdown that could affect millions of personal computers throughout the world. That is why, in this world of everincreasing intrusions, we must do our best to make sure our computer systems are as invulnerable to attack as possible. The Department of Homeland Security was given the authority by the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 to improve cybersecurity in the United States through enhanced sharing of information about cybersecurity threats. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 allows the Secretary to coordinate with industry to develop departmental policies and procedures for coordinating the disclosure of cyber vulnerabilities as described in the Vulnerabilities Equities Policy and Process published by the White House on November 15, 2016. This disclosure is important, as it highlights vulnerabilities and allows the public and private sector to work to prevent and mitigate cyber threats. H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act, is an important tool, in that it requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report to Congress on their policies and procedures for disclosing vulnerabilities. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the manager for his kind words. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act. I very much want 
to thank the committee for bringing the Jackson Lee bill to the floor and the work that we did on it in committee. I wish to speak specifically to the work that is done on the Homeland Security Committee as I discuss this legislation. I think it is very important to take note of the fact that the ranking member works very hard to generate very positive legislation and that we have been able to see a large number of bills, some that I have been able to sponsor, come to the floor of the House. Mr. Speaker, therefore, I thank the chairman, Mr. MCCAUL, and the ranking member for making the Homeland Security Committee so productive in generating important legislation to ensure the security of this Nation. I thank them for their leadership in putting the security of our Nation’s cyber assets first, whether they are computing resources used in voting technology, or industrial control systems that support the delivery of electricity, oil and gas, or management of transportation systems that are vital to our Nation’s economic health. Mr. Speaker, I was chairman of the Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee some few sessions ago. This was when infrastructure was included in the transportation and security domain. I can tell you that, even then, we began to acknowledge the crucialness of protecting the cyber system and how far reaching cyber systems can go, as far away as water systems, to bridges, to dams, and in between, and to note that a lot of our cyber system, 80 percent of it was in the private sector, probably more at this point. H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act, which I introduced, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber vulnerability disclosures. The report will include an annex with information on instances in which cybersecurity vulnerability disclosure policies and procedures were used to disclose details on identified weaknesses in computing systems or digital devices at risk. The report will provide information on the degree to which the information provided by DHS was used by industry and other stakeholders. The report may also contain a description of how the Secretary of Homeland Security is working with other Federal entities and critical infrastructure owners and operators to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities. It is important to restate that our cyber system is largely in the private sector. It does not alleviate or eliminate the role that the Federal Government should play. This legislation squarely places with the Federal Government the responsibilities of dealing with those critical infrastructure owners and operators to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities. The reason that I have worked to bring this bill before the full House for consideration is a problem often referred to as a zeroday event. A zero day event describes a situation that network security professionals may find themselves in when a previously unknown error or flaw in computing code is exploited by a cybercriminal or terrorist. The term ‘‘zeroday event’’ simply means that there is zero time to prepare a defense against a cyber attack. That is not the place that we would like to find ourselves. When a defect in software is discovered, their network engineers and software companies can work to develop a patch to fix the problem before it can be exploited by those who may seek to do us harm. We have evidence that the cyber world is a good world, but it can be a dangerous world and impact the life and quality and democracy and freedom of Americans. We want to be prepared and never have to face, in this most powerful country in the world, something called a zeroday event. H.R. 3202 seeks a report on the ongoing Department of Homeland Security’s policies and procedures for coordinating cyber vulnerability disclosures, such as zeroday events, with private sector partners. Because vulnerabilities can be used by adversaries, it is important that this sensitive information be managed securely so details are not routinely made available, neither to the public nor to Congress. H.R. 3202 provides the Congress with the opportunity to understand the process and procedures used by the Department of Homeland Security and the benefit these disclosures may have for private sector entities participating in programs in support of cybersecurity. Mr. Speaker, I thank Lillie Coney of my district and Jean de Pruneda, a fellow on the Committee on Homeland Security, for their work on this important legislation. I urge Members of the House to vote in favor of H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act. Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize again a point that I made earlier. Because vulnerabilities can be used by adversaries, it is important that this sensitive information be managed securely so details are not routinely made available, neither to the public nor to Congress. It is important to take note of the fact that the work we have to do is ongoing and continuing. H.R. 3202 will give this body important information on our governmentwide efforts to secure civilian agency networks and the collaborative ongoing work to provide information to private sector partners on computing vulnerabilities. There is no security in keeping zeroday events secure from disclosure and not working on solutions. Cybersecurity is found in finding the zeroday events, creating solutions to defend against them, and sharing the solutions broadly so that they can be deployed. Once solutions are in place, the zeroday event should be disclosed to the public so that scholars and researchers can learn from the experience. In essence, what we are saying is that we want to make sure that we are in the driver’s seat, that we know the vulnerabilities, that we can confront the zeroday events, and that we can do that, meaning the Federal Government, in working with the private sector to ensure that we do protect this Nation. Before I close, since we are dealing with Homeland Security Committee issues, I think it is important to take note of the fact of the crucialness and the importance of having a DACA fix and working together, as we have been doing, to ensure that the thousands and thousands of young people located across the Nation, who came here through no fault of their own, have a serious pathway of protection, in particular, the 140,000 that are in the State of Texas. If we can stand here as bipartisan Members, I know that we can continue to work on that crucial and important issue, which I stand with those young people to ensure to get that done. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  an article by Morgan Chalfant, ‘‘Lawmakers approve ‘cyber vulnerability’ bill,’’ written in The Hill. 
[From the Hill, July 26, 2017] LAWMAKERS APPROVE ‘CYBER VULNERABILITY ’ BILL (By Morgan Chalfant) A House panel advanced legislation on Wednesday requiring the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to give lawmakers more information on how it discloses cyber vulnerabilities to the private sector. The legislation was sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (DTexas) and received broad support from members of the House Homeland Security Committee, including Chairman Michael McCaul (RTexas). The bill would require Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to send a report to relevant congressional committees describing policies and procedures used by the DHS to coordinate the disclosure of what are called ‘‘zero days’’—cyber vulnerabilities that are unknown to a product’s manufacturer and for which no patch exists. The federal government decides whether to disclose zero days to the private sector through the vulnerabilities equities process (VEP), which was first acknowledged by the Obama administration in 2014 but is still shrouded in secrecy. While the government is said to err on the side of disclosure, the VEP has proven controversial because so little is known about it. The process has attracted increased scrutiny in the wake of the outbreak of the ‘‘Wanna Cry’’ ransomware, which is believed to be based on a hacking tool developed by the National Security Agency. Lawmakers in both chambers have sought to boost transparency of the VEP. On Wednesday, Jackson Lee touted the legislation as providing an opportunity for Congress to better understand the process by which the DHS shares threat information 
with private companies and how that information benefits the private sector. ‘‘Because vulnerabilities can be used by adversaries, it is important that the sensitive information is managed securely and the details are guarded against premature disclosure,’’ Jackson Lee said during a committee markup. ‘‘There’s no security in keeping zero day events secure and not working on solutions,’’ she said. ‘‘The protection is in finding the zero day events, creating solutions, sharing the solutions broadly, then disclosing the vulnerabilities to the public.’’ The report mandated by the legislation would include an annex of information on specific instances when the DHS disclosed vulnerabilities to private sector companies in the previous year and information on how industry acted on the information. It could also contain information about how the DHS is working with other federal agencies and departments, as well as owners of critical infrastructure, to mitigate the threat of these vulnerabilities. Kelly would be required to submit the report, which would be unclassified but could have a classified annex, within 240 days of the enactment of the legislation. The committee approved the legislation in a voice vote with no amendments, sending it to the full House for a vote. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3202, and I thank my manager as well. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerabilities Disclosure Reporting Act. I thank Chairman MCCAUL and Ranking Member THOMPSON for their leadership on putting the security of our nation’s cyber assets first whether they are computing resources used in voting technology or industrial control systems that support the delivery of electricity, oil and gas, or management of transportation systems all are vital to our nation. H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act, which I introduced, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber vulnerability disclosures. The report will include an annex with information on instances in which cyber security vulnerability disclosure policies and procedures were used to disclose details on identified weaknesses in computing systems that or digital devices at risk. The report will provide information on the degree to which the information provided by DHS was used by industry and other stakeholders. The report may also contain a description of how the Secretary of Homeland Security is working with other Federal entities and critical infrastructure owners and operators to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities. The reason that I worked to bring this bill before the Full House for consideration is the problem often referred to as a ‘‘Zero Day Event.’’ Zero Day Events are vulnerabilities in software or firmware that have gone undetected or undisclosed, but if exploited by terrorists could cause great harm to computer networks, data, or complex computing dependent systems. Our nation’s electric power grid; industrial control systems that operate bridges, dams, water treatment facilities or food processing plants are all vulnerable to the potential harm that could be caused if a weakness in software or firmware goes undetected. Critical infrastructure must be secured against terrorist attacks that may use Zero Day Event vulnerabilities to attack critical infrastructure or civilian government agency computing assets. Zero Day Events discovered in commercial software applications such as the ‘‘Heartbleed’’ and OpenSSL cryptographic software library vulnerability. Proactive and coordinated efforts are necessary to strengthen and maintain secure critical infrastructure including assets that are vital to public confidence in the cyber nation’s safety. This bill supports the ongoing work of the Department of Homeland Security in security civilian agency and coordinating with private sector computing network owners and operators. The nation’s critical infrastructure is diverse, complex, and interdependent. The overwhelming majority of critical infrastructure is privately owned or managed. Critical Infrastructure owners and operators are uniquely positioned to manage risk to their operations and assets. What is needed is a better understanding of how vulnerability discoveries lead to better protection for computing networks. Zero Day Events require a coordinated approach to assignment of responsibility for developing patches or solutions, and a means of effectively distributing the solution without alerting potential terrorist or cyber criminals. H.R. 3202 provides the Congress with the opportunity to understand the process and procedures used by the Department of Homeland Security and the benefit these disclosures may have for private sector entities participating in programs in support of cybersecurity. I thank Lillie Coney of my staff and Jean de Pruneda a Fellow on the Committee on Homeland Security for their work on this important legislation. I ask my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3202. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 3202, The ‘‘Cyber Disclosure Reporting Act.’’ I thank Chairman MCCAUL and Ranking Member THOMPSON for their leadership on putting the security of our nation’s cyber assets first whether they are computing resources used in voting technology or industrial control systems that support the delivery of electricity, oil and gas, or management of transportation systems that are vital to our nation economic health.

H.R. 3202 provides the Congress with the opportunity to understand the process and procedures used by the Department of Homeland Security and the benefit these disclosures may have for private sector entities participating in programs in support of cybersecurity. I thank Lillie Coney of my staff and Jean de Pruneda a Fellow on the Committee on Homeland Security for their work on this important legislation. I urge members of the House to vote in favor of H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerabilities Disclosure Act. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3202 will give this body important information on our government wide efforts to secure civilian agency networks and the collaborative ongoing work to provide information to private sector partners on computing vulnerabilities. There’s no security in keeping zero day events secure from disclosure and not working on solutions. Cyber security is found in finding the zero day events, creating solutions to defend against them, and sharing the solutions broadly so that they can be deployed. Once solutions are in place the Zero Day Event should be disclosed to the public so that scholars and researchers can learn from the experience. With that, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3202. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this bill. With an everincreasing reliance on technology today, we need to make sure that it is secure and safe for us to use and that the vulnerabilities are addressed so that we can maintain a safe and secure environment. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3202. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
b1345 DHS INTERAGENCY COUNTERTERRORISM TASK FORCE ACT OF 2017 Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4555) to authorize the participation in overseas interagency counterterrorism task forces of personnel of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4555 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘DHS Interagency Counterterrorism Task Force Act of 2017’’. 
Section 102 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 112) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: ‘‘(h) COORDINATION WITHOTHER FEDERAL  DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES OVERSEAS .— ‘‘(1) IN GENERAL .—The Secretary is authorized to assign Department personnel to participate in overseas interagency counterterrorism task forces to— ‘‘(A) facilitate the sharing of counterterrorism information, and ‘‘(B) combat the threat of terrorism and associated risks to the United States stemming from overseas sources of conflict or terrorism, as determined by the Secretary. ‘‘(2) PERSONNEL .—In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary may assign personnel from any component of the Department the Secretary determines necessary to participate in the overseas counterterrorism task forces referred to in paragraph (1).’’. 
Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter for three years, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall report to the Committee on Homeland Security, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Relations, Select Committee on Intelligence, and the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on activities carried out pursuant to subsection (h) of section 102 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 112), as added by section 2 of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as terrorists and foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria seek to return home or travel to other regions in the wake of the defeat of ISIS on the battlefield, cooperation among U.S. military, national security, and law enforcement agencies is vital. When these fighters move from the Middle East to the West or other regions, information collection and tracking becomes extremely difficult, especially when ensuring that all relevant Federal agencies have access to the same critical information. An enhanced, wholeofgovernment effort to share information and intelligence related to these fighters and their movements would improve security of the homeland. In order to achieve this, H.R. 4555 authorizes the Department of Homeland Security Secretary to assign DHS personnel to overseas interagency counterterrorism task forces to facilitate the sharing of counterterrorism information and combat threats stemming from overseas sources of conflict or terrorism. This will enable DHS to build on existing initiatives to colocate DHS personnel with other Federal departments and agencies that play a crucial role in the fight against terrorism. For example, assigning DHS personnel to the Department of Defense locations would facilitate better collection and sharing of information recovered from those conflict zones, which significantly improves our ability to interdict terrorists before they enter our country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4555, the DHS Interagency Counterterrorism Task Force Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4555 authorizes DHS personnel to participate in overseas interagency counterterrorism task forces. Since the attacks of September 11 and the demise of central alQaida, there has been an upsurge in the number of foreign terrorist organizations. The terrorist threat picture demands that DHS work to ‘‘push our borders out’’ and deal with terrorist threats overseas. As such, it is important that DHS deploy DHS personnel overseas to engage in counterterrorism information sharing with international partners. Our close partnerships with countries around the world, especially in Europe, are essential to preventing returning foreign fighters from attacking the U.S. homeland. However, we remain concerned that terrorist organizations, in particular, ISIS, alQaida, and their affiliates, continue to plot attacks against the U.S. homeland and our interests abroad. Authorizing the participation of DHS personnel in overseas interagency counterterrorism task forces will facilitate better counterterrorism information sharing, which will help protect the homeland and U.S. interests abroad. As such, I support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 4555 authorizes the participation of DHS personnel in overseas interagency counterterrorism task forces. This measure seeks to help safeguard our homeland by fostering DHS overseas partnerships and facilitating counterterrorism information sharing. I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) for sponsoring this legislation and for working with me on my amendment, which added reporting language on the activities authorized by this measure. This is an important step forward and, again, I might emphasize, the work that is being done between the ranking member, Mr. THOMPSON , and the full committee chair, Mr. MCCAUL, in bringing our committee together in producing a myriad of constructive legislation all geared to our task, because, when all is said and done, we are the Homeland Security Committee within the Homeland Security Department, created in the aftermath of the most heinous, horrific tragedy in the history of the United States of recent recollection that was not an incident of war. Therefore, I think the American people, and I know the American people are owed our diligence and are owed our commitment and are owed our studiousness. I am very pleased to say that, on this committee, the production of legislation that comes to the floor, all is geared to securing the homeland. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 4555. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4555, the ‘‘DHS Interagency Counterterrorism Task Force Act of 2017.’’ H.R. 4555 authorizes DHS personnel to participate in overseas interagency counterterrorism task forces. Since the attacks of September 11th and the demise of central al Qaeda, there has been an upsurge in the number of foreign terrorist organizations. The terrorist threat picture demands that DHS work to ‘‘push our borders out’’ and deal with terrorist threats overseas. As such, it is important that DHS deploy DHS personnel overseas to engage in counterterrorism information sharing with international partners. Our close partnerships with countries around the world, especially in Europe, are essential to preventing returning foreign fighters from attacking the U.S. homeland. 
However, we remain concerned that terrorist organizations, in particular ISIS, al Qaeda, and their affiliates, continue to plot attacks against the U.S. homeland and our interests abroad. Authorizing the participation of DHS personnel in overseas interagency counterterrorism task forces will facilitate better counterterrorism information sharing, which will help protect the homeland and U.S. interests abroad. I thank the gentleman from Florida, Mr. RUTHERFORD , for sponsoring this legislation and for working with me on my amendment which added reporting language on the activities authorized by this measure. With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 4555. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for her very commonsense amendment to this bill, which made it stronger and better, and I do appreciate the bipartisan work on that. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4555, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
POSTCALIPHATE THREAT ASSESSMENT ACT OF 2017 Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4564) to require a threat assessment on current foreign terrorist fighter activities, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4564 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘PostCaliphate Threat Assessment Act of 2017’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of State and Director of National Intelligence, shall conduct a threat assessment of current foreign terrorist fighter activities. Such assessment shall include the following: (1) A detailed summary of current foreign terrorist fighter travel and trends, including countries of origin, travel destinations, and means of travel. (2) An analysis of any country or region with a significant increase in foreign terrorist fighter activity. (3) An analysis of foreign terrorist fighter travel trends in and out of Iraq and Syria. (b) CONGRESSIONAL COMMUNICATION .—Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall report to the Committee on Homeland Security, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Relations, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate on the threat assessment required under subsection (a). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana. 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to offer for consideration H.R. 4564, the PostCaliphate Threat Assessment Act of 2017, for House consideration. The Homeland Security Committee’s Task Force on Denying Terrorist Entry into the United States, which I am a member of, spent the last year taking a deeper look at how terrorist organizations and lonewolf attackers are entering the nations they are targeting. One of the most concerning issues that the task force learned is that an estimated 40,000 foreign fighters traveled to ISISoccupied territories to join a force of over 100,000 radical Islamic terrorists. Through major victories by antiISIS forces, the Islamic State’s selfdeclared caliphate in Iraq and Syria has been mostly defeated as a whole, driving these terrorists into hiding. Many thousands of these battletrained jihadists are now unidentified and their location is unknown. The United States is a primary target. Of particular concern for the United States are those fighters seeking to return to Europe or the U.S. These fighters may seek to exploit direct flights to the United States as well as the Visa Waiver Program. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is about ensuring that we have the best possible data to defeat this threat. Specifically, my bill would direct the Secretary of DHS, in coordination with the Secretary of State and Director of National Intelligence, to conduct a threat assessment of current foreign terrorist fighter activity and report their findings to Congress. It would also ensure that Congress and the Executive gain better clarity on foreign terrorist travel and trends postcaliphate, which will strengthen our defenses as the diaspora unfolds. Before closing, I would like to thank task force Chairman GALLAGHER , Representative KATKO , committee Chairman MCCAUL, bipartisan members of the Homeland Security Committee, and other members of the task force and their staffs for the hard work put in over the last year to make the report we issued this past December a reality. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of this commonsense legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4564, the PostCaliphate Threat Assessment Act of 2017. The PostCaliphate Threat Assessment Act requires the DHS to conduct an intelligence threat assessment of foreign fighter activities. With the military defeat of ISIL’s caliphate, we are concerned about the threat of foreign terrorists returning to the West. While the vast majority of foreign fighters originated from Russia, Central Asia, and the Middle East, about 20,000 foreign fighters traveled to Iraq and Syria from at least 110 countries. We must address foreign fighters who are ready to return home. We must stay abreast of their movements and stop them from coming to the United States. Requiring DHS to conduct a threat assessment of current foreign fighter activities will help DHS to continue to focus on travel screening on the risk based dangers that we face. Let’s focus our policies on preventing terrorism by keeping dangerous individuals from coming to this country. H.R. 4564 requires a detailed report by the Secretary of Homeland Security, coordinating with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, on foreign fighter movements to help DHS focus on preventing their activities. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this measure. I want to thank Mr. HIGGINS for this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4564. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1400 COUNTERTERRORISM INFORMATION SHARING IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2017 Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4569) to require counterterrorism information sharing coordination, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4569 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Counterterrorism Information Sharing Improvement Act of 2017’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The President, acting though the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall ensure that, for counterterrorism purposes, the Department of the Homeland Security has access to biographic and biometric data collected by the United States Government on individuals associated with a terrorist organization. (b) COORDINATION .—The President shall direct the heads of relevant Federal departments and agencies to coordinate with the Secretary of Homeland Security to minimize and overcome any administrative, technical, capacity, or classification challenges to carrying out subsection (a). (c) PROTECTIONS .—The Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that all relevant laws, rules, and procedures, including the section 552(a) of title 5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Privacy Act’’ or the ‘‘Privacy Act of 1974’’), regarding classification levels and civil rights and civil liberties are followed while seeking to carry out subsection (a). (d) REPORT TO CONGRESS .— (1) IN GENERAL .—Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with the protection of classified information, submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report on the implementation of this section. (2) CONTENTS .—The report required under paragraph (1) shall include a description of how the data referred to in subsection (a) is utilized for Department of Homeland Security screening and vetting purposes and any challenges associated with incorporating such data into departmental screening and vetting systems. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As we destroy the caliphate in the Middle East, foreign fighters and terrorist sympathizers have fled the battlefield and are looking for new ways to spread their hatred, recruit new followers, instill fear, kill innocent people, and disrupt our way of life. The December 11 bombing at the New York City Port Authority Bus Terminal was the second terror attack in New York in less than 2 months and a grave reminder of the reality of this threat. Given this current environment, at the direction of Chairman MCCAUL, I led a task force to identify specific national security challenges and examine how terrorists might infiltrate our homeland and bring harm to our people. Subsequently, we produced a report with a series of solutions to fix any identified weaknesses that may be exploited by our enemies. This report resulted in several pieces of legislation that have come before the House today. To that end, my bill, the Counterterrorism Information Sharing Improvement Act, seeks to enhance the current informationsharing environment that exists within the Federal and military communities. Throughout the task force, we heard time and time again about the incredible amount of biometric and biographic data being pulled off battlefields in Syria and Iraq, as U.S. forces and our allies continue to roll back the territories once held by ISIS. It is often DOD personnel that encounter ISIS fighters on the battlefield, which often leads to the collection of valuable data. However, if these fighters and their associates move back to the West or try to enter the U.S., the DHS becomes the primary entity that will engage them. Therefore, it is critical that the data recovered by the DOD in the battlefield is able to reach the DHS and its systems for effective frontline screening and vetting of known or suspected terrorists. In order to verify we are utilizing this information to support our counterterrorism efforts, we must ensure that the Department of Homeland Security gets access to that data in a timely manner, particularly so that it can be used for screening and vetting purposes. My bill directs the President, acting through the Secretary of Homeland Security, to ensure that the DHS has access to biographic and biometric data collected by the U.S. Government on individuals associated with a terrorist organization. The bill also directs the Secretary to report to Congress on these efforts. The U.S. must prioritize any opportunity to identify bad actors outside the country and expand our ability to identify and deter threats before they reach the homeland. Unfortunately, informationsharing challenges among U.S. agencies can prevent valuable information from becoming available for frontline screening and vetting. Not only is this a bureaucratic challenge, given the number of separate government agencies and components involved, but legal capacity and technical issues exist as well. This bill will address these challenges and create improved collaborations between the Department of Homeland Security and its other Federal and military partners. Mr. Speaker, I therefore urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4569, the Counterterrorism Information Sharing Improvement Act of 2017. This bill seeks to ensure that the DHS gets access to biometric and biographic data collected by the United States Government to carry out its counterterrorism efforts. Since 9/11, the Democratic members of this committee have been committed to bolstering terrorism information sharing within our government. Today, terrorist threats are decentralized, spreading beyond alQaida, al Shabaab, and ISIL to a patchwork of small cells and lone wolves who stand ready to carry out violence to our country at their whim. Increasingly, this threat also includes homegrown violent extremists and domestic terrorists. Ensuring that the DHS has access to biographic and biometric data on individuals associated with a terrorist organization is critical to comprehensive assessing of all forms of terrorism and threats to our government. This legislation also requires that the DHS report on how the data is being received and utilized for screening and vetting purposes. This report will help Congress ensure that screening and vetting of travelers to the United States is conducted in a risk based manner. Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and I am prepared to close. Again, Mr. Speaker, this legislation ensures that the DHS have access to biographic and biometric data collected by our government on individuals associated with terrorist organizations. It is important that this information be integrated into the DHS’ screening and vetting programs to protect our country, our citizens, from all forms of terrorism and extremism. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank my colleagues for their hard work in generating the task force report and all of the ideas that led to the variety of bills we are doing here today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LAHOOD). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. G ALLAGHER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4569. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SCREENING AND VETTING PASSENGER EXCHANGE ACT OF 2017 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4581) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop best practices for utilizing advanced passenger information and passenger name record data for counterterrorism screening and vetting operations, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4581 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Screening and Vetting Passenger Exchange Act of 2017’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall develop best practices for utilizing advanced passenger information and passenger name record data for counterterrorism screening and vetting operations. (b) CONSIDERATIONS .—The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, to the greatest extent practicable— (1) make available to certain countries, including visa waiver program countries under section 217 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1187), the best practices required under subsection (a); and (2) provide assistance to such countries in implementing such best practices. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today to voice my full support for H.R. 4581, the Screening and Vetting Passenger Exchange Act of 2017. This legislation directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop best practices for utilizing advanced passenger information, or API, and passenger names record data, or PNR, for counterterrorism screening and vetting operations. It also enables the Secretary to share those practices with our allies, including countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program, and to provide assistance in implementing these practices in those countries. Having access to API, which is biographic information, and PNR data, which is data about reservation and itinerary information, allows our homeland security professionals to confirm the identities and travel patterns of potential criminals and terrorists before they enter the United States. Allowing our men and women on the front lines to fight against terrorism, to work with Visa Waiver Program countries to make sure that they rise to the same standards only increases the safety of our Nation, the safety of all Americans traveling abroad, and the safety of all people across the globe. This legislation is a step in the right direction toward addressing further potential emerging threats. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support our Nation’s Homeland Security by supporting my bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4581, the Screening and Vetting Passenger Exchange Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, the Screening and Vetting Passenger Act of 2017 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and share best practices for using data provided by passengers in screening and vetting operations with our allies around the world. Since 2014, more than 75 million international travelers have come to the United States. In recent years, especially during the Obama administration, great strides were made to use the information furnished by these incoming travelers to advance security screening and vetting processes. Building upon the Department’s 2017 last point of departure security enhancements that sought to raise the bar in physical screenings at overseas airports with direct flights to the U.S., this bill will further reinforce security measures and seek to provide our overseas partners with the capabilities to advance their own vetting and screening. No country is immune from terrorism, and this bill will ensure that the DHS can be a valued partner to nations that work with us. By providing best practices on passenger screening, H.R. 4581 seeks to ensure that terrorists seeking to inflict harm are not allowed to travel without detection. Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Screening and Vetting Passenger Exchange Act. I want to thank Congressman FITZPATRICK for bringing this important legislation. The United States is currently experiencing one of the highest terror threat environments since 9/11. Despite crushing the caliphate in Iraq and Syria, ISIS continues to demonstrate its capability to inspire attacks on the West, including in the homeland. The two terror attacks in New York City late last year are stark reminders of this reality and the threat facing the United States. Given the nature of this evolving threat, I established a task force on denying terrorists entry into the United States last year and I appointed Representative MIKEGALLAGHER to head up the effort. I would like to thank all of the members of the task force for their hard work in making this effort a success. I charged this task force with examining how terrorists might infiltrate the homeland, identifying challenges with current U.S. Government information sharing and vetting procedures, and reviewing the screening agencies’ structure and bureaucracy. After completing its review, the task force issued a report outlining its findings and providing seven recommendations designed to address the identified gaps. These recommendations were the basis for several of the bills we are considering today. As evidenced by the recent spate of attacks, there is a large population of radicalized individuals in Europe who are willing to commit violence in the name of terrorist groups like ISIS. We must remain vigilant and cannot forget many of these individuals are just one flight away from the United States. Given the seriousness of this threat, we must do more at home and abroad to screen and vet people seeking to enter the United States. The bills we are considering today will enhance our capabilities by improving information sharing and promoting efficiencies in the screening and vetting process, helping ensure the homeland is the best secured against terrorist infiltration. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill seeks to make international travel more secure and fosters a strong relationship between our country and our allies. All nations must increase their vigilance with respect to security screening. There are thousands of ISIL foot soldiers who may seek to enter the Western world and other nations to carry out their attacks. This legislation seeks to harness the United States’ best practices and capabilities to advance the safety of the global aviation community as we face an agile and evolving enemy. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1415 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4581. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

SECURING DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FIREARMS ACT OF 2017 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4433) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Under Secretary for Management of the Department of Homeland Security to achieve security of sensitive assets among the components of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4433 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securing Department of Homeland Security Firearms Act of 2017’’ or the ‘‘Securing DHS Firearms Act of 2017’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4433, the Securing Department of Homeland Security Firearms Act of 2017. A recent report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, entitled, ‘‘DHS’ Controls Over Firearms and Other Sensitive Assets,’’ found that, between fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2016, personnel from DHS and its components misplaced a total of 2,142 highly sensitive assets, including 228 firearms and 1,889 badges. 
DHS is charged with the safety of our Nation and its citizens. The OIG report indicates that not only are there some DHS personnel not being held accountable for failing to safeguard their sensitive assets, they are also not receiving proper training on how to properly safeguard and keep track of such equipment. Given the importance of DHS’ mission, this is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4433 follows the OIG’s recommendations and requires DHS’ Under Secretary for Management to promulgate a departmentwide directive to DHS personnel aimed at achieving adequate security over DHS firearms and other sensitive assets. H.R. 4433 mandates that this directive include descriptions of what equipment is classified as a sensitive asset, requirements for securing Departmentissued sensitive assets, and recordkeeping requirements for reporting lost or stolen firearms and other assets. H.R. 4433 also requires DHS to update its Personal Property Asset Management Program Manual to include procedures and training on how to safeguard assets, both on and off duty, in accordance with the directive. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4433, the Securing Department of Homeland Security Firearms Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, DHS is a diverse Department that has the distinction of being the largest law enforcement agency in the Federal Government. To help support its critical mission, DHS must maintain and safeguard a variety of sensitive law enforcement equipment, such as firearms, ammunition, and badges. DHS equipment in the wrong hands could result in loss of life. According to an October 2017 report issued by the DHS Office of Inspector General, the Department does not have adequate requirements to safeguard its sensitive assets. Approximately 2,100 highly sensitive assets were lost between 2014 and 2016. In response to the report, my legislation requires DHS to develop and implement policies to secure firearms and other sensitive DHS equipment at the Department. This security measure requires the Under Secretary of Management to disseminate a departmentwide directive that includes requirements for securing firearms and sensitive DHS equipment, as well as reporting these requirements. This measure outlines the responsibilities to properly safeguard firearms and sensitive assets in accordance with the directive and requires personnel to properly report lost firearms and equipment. This measure was unanimously approved by the Committee on Homeland Security last month and will help foster greater accountability and security within DHS, and I urge passage of this measure. Mr. Speaker, in closing, my legislation is intended to advance the critical mission of DHS by ensuring that firearms and sensitive assets are properly safeguarded and maintained. In my home State of California, in 2015, a 27yearold, Antonio Ramos, was shot and killed with an ICE agent’s stolen 9millimeter weapon. According to the DHS OIG, failures to safeguard important equipment and assets are still not being properly addressed. Given DHS’ mission, it is essential that the DHS workforce prioritize and properly protect the equipment that is critical to their mission. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4433, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4433, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SUPPORTING THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF IRAN TO FREE EXPRESSION Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 676) supporting the rights of the people of Iran to free expression, condemning the Iranian regime for its crackdown on legitimate protests, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. R ES. 676 Whereas, on December 28, 2017, popular protests against the Iranian regime began in the city of Mashad and rapidly spread throughout the country, in the most significant antigovernment protests in Iran since June 2009; Whereas the protesters have expressed numerous economic grievances, including the regime’s widespread corruption and the Revolutionary Guard Corps’ control of the country’s economy; Whereas protesters have decried the regime’s costly, destabilizing activities abroad, including its support for terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and the murderous Assad regime in Syria; Whereas reports indicate that more than 1,000 Iranians have been arrested and almost two dozen killed in connection with the protests; Whereas the Iranian regime has shut down mobile internet access and has blocked and pressured companies to cut off social media applications used by activists to organize and publicize the protests; Whereas Congress has provided authority to license the provision of communications technology to Iran to improve the ability of the Iranian people to speak freely; Whereas, on January 1, 2018, regime officials threatened to crack down, with Brigadier General Esmaeil Kowsari of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps stating, ‘‘If this situation continues, the officials will definitely make some decisions and at that point this business will be finished.’’; Whereas Congress has provided authority to designate and sanction elements of the Iranian regime involved in significant corruption and serious human rights abuses; Whereas Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij militia have been sanctioned by the United States for planning and carrying out serious human rights abuses against the Iranian people, including for the cruel and prolonged torture of political dissidents; Whereas the regime has routinely violated the human rights of Iranian citizens, including ongoing, systematic, and serious restrictions of freedom of peaceful assembly and association and freedom of opinion and expression, including the continuing closures of media outlets, arrests of journalists, and the censorship of expression in online forums such as blogs and websites; Whereas the Department of State’s 2016 Human Rights Report on Iran noted ‘‘severe restrictions on civil liberties, including the freedoms of assembly, association, speech, religion, and press. Other human rights problems included abuse of due process combined with use of capital punishment for crimes that do not meet the requirements of due process, as well as cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; and disregard for the physical integrity of persons, whom authorities arbitrarily and unlawfully detained, tortured, or killed.’’; Whereas, on December 29, 2017, the Department of State strongly condemned the arrest of peaceful protesters and noted that ‘‘Iran’s leaders have turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos.’’; Whereas, on January 1, 2018, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, stated that ‘‘The UK is watching events in Iran closely. We believe that there should be meaningful debate about the legitimate and important issues the protesters are raising and we look to the Iranian authorities to permit this.’’; Whereas, on January 2, 2018, the French Foreign Ministry stated that ‘‘French authorities are closely monitoring the situation in Iran. Demonstrating freely is a fundamental right. The same is true for the free movement of information. France expresses its concern over the large number of victims and arrests.’’; Whereas, on January 1, 2018, a spokesman for the Canadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that ‘‘We call on the Iranian authorities to uphold and respect democratic and human rights’’ and ‘‘We are encouraged by the Iranian people who are bravely exercising their basic right to protest peacefully. Canada will continue to support the fundamental rights of the Iranians, including freedom of expression.’’; Whereas Iran is a member of the United Nations, voted for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, among other international human rights treaties; and Whereas, in violation of these and other international obligations, Iranian regime officials continue to violate the fundamental human rights of the Iranian people: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
(1) stands with the people of Iran that are engaged in legitimate and peaceful protests against an oppressive, corrupt regime; (2) condemns the Iranian regime’s serious human rights abuses against the Iranian people, significant corruption, and destabilizing activities abroad; (3) notes the statements of support for the protestors from key allies and calls on all democratic governments and institutions to clearly support the Iranian people’s right to live in a free society; (4) demands that the Iranian regime abide by its international obligations with respect to human rights and civil liberties, including freedoms of assembly, speech, and press; (5) urges the Administration to use targeted sanctions and work to convene emergency sessions of the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Human Rights Council to condemn the ongoing human rights violations perpetrated by the Iranian regime and establish a mechanism by which the Security Council can monitor such violations; (6) encourages the Administration to expedite the license of communications technology to Iran to improve the ability of the Iranian people to speak freely; (7) calls on companies to reject requests by the regime to cut off the Iranian people from social media and other communications platforms; (8) respects the proud history and rich culture of the Iranian nation and fully supports efforts by the people of Iran to promote the establishment of basic freedoms that build the foundation for the emergence of a freely elected, open, and democratic political system; and (9) urges the President and the Secretary of State to work with the international community to ensure that violations of human rights are part of all formal and informal multilateral or bilateral discussions with and regarding Iran. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. 
Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for their swift action in putting this important and timely resolution together. The world has been witnessing the people of Iran taking to the streets en masse to protest the radical regime in Tehran. They have made it clear that the regime’s policies have done nothing but harm Iran. We have seen largescale protests in Iran before, most notably in 2009, but these protests are different, Mr. Speaker. This time, unlike in 2009, America has not shied away from doing the right thing. The administration has expressed vocal support for the people of Iran, and it has warned the regime that we are watching how it responds. The public discontent is palpable, and these protests have exposed the cracks behind the regime’s veneer. For decades, the hardline regime has squandered Iran’s vast resources in pursuit of spreading the revolutionary ideology and of achieving an illicit nuclear weapons program. The regime’s rule by fear and rule by intimidation—the human rights abuses, the silencing of the opposition, the abuses of ethnic and religious minorities, the restrictions imposed against women under sharia law, and the corruption, none of these are being taken anymore, sitting down, by millions of Iranians. Let us not be fooled, Mr. Speaker. Rouhani is no moderate. He is an opportunist, and he is a lifelong adherent to the regime and its hateful ideology. That is why this resolution is so important. We must make it clear that we truly support the people of Iran and their aspirations for a free and democratic society. Their protests are a referendum on the regime, and we must make it clear to all the regime officials that they will be held accountable for any human rights abuses in response to these protests. But, Mr. Speaker, we must also not lose sight of the bigger picture. These protests are important, and it is important that we take action on human rights abuses. But this is just one aspect of the regime’s illicit behavior, and sanctions against human rights violators is but one tool that we have at our disposal. The totality of the regime’s nefarious and illicit activity is what the people of Iran are protesting against, and it would be unwise for us to lose focus of that bigger picture. So while it is important that we stand here today in support of the people of Iran and we make it clear that there will be consequences for human rights abuses, we must make sure that we see the whole board here and connect the dots, and that means, Mr. Speaker, using all the tools at our disposal, because they are not isolated issues. They are all connected. So, with that, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to continue supporting a strong response to all of Iran’s illicit activity and the use of all of the tools that we have at our disposal. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. In this House, we were on both sides of the Iran nuclear deal, but we were united in knowing that Iran is not an ally of the United States—at least, the Islamic Republic of Iran is not—and this House never agreed to ignore extreme human rights abuses simply because the Government of Iran has agreed to limitations on its nuclear program. This resolution puts us on the right side of history by stating that the House of Representatives stands with the people of Iran and condemns the Iranian regime’s serious human rights abuses. It goes on to encourage the administration to expedite the licensing of communications technology to entities in Iran to improve the ability of the Iranian people to speak freely and also calls on companies around the world not to allow this regime to use any device or any technology to cut the Iranian people from social media and from other communications platforms. b1430 We have seen in Iran a people dedicated to democracy and dedicated to improving their own lives. Over 1,000 Iranians have been arrested, and at least two dozen have been killed; this in a country with a great history. The Cyrus Cylinder is perhaps the first human rights document in world history. A model of it stands in the United Nations to commemorate the dedication of the Iranian people to human rights. Today, they shout ‘‘No Gaza;’’ ‘‘No Lebanon;’’ ‘‘No Syria;’’ ‘‘My life for Iran,’’ because they know that this regime’s involvement in supporting terrorism around the world has not only devastated Syria, where Assad clings to power and half a million people have died, not only brings death and destruction to Lebanon and Yemen, but it has also devastated the Iranian economy, because this regime insists upon supporting Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. Those are only the terrorist regimes whose names begin with H. Of course, this regime has killed over 5,000 members of the LGBT community solely for who they are and whom they love. This is a regime whose human rights record should, indeed, be criticized by the formal adoption of a resolution by this House of Representatives. I also want to point out that the travel ban or Muslim ban implemented by this administration is harming our efforts to support the Iranian people at this time of crisis. It says that if leaders of these demonstrations want to come to my community, where they have tens of thousands of IranianAmerican supporters, they can’t do it. And if, God forbid, they fear for their lives and want to flee, even if they are carefully vetted, they cannot set foot on American soil. So I look forward to us standing with the people of Iran and eliminating the Muslim ban. I look forward to this House saying that we stand with the people who are putting their lives on the line to fight for democracy. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ), who is 
the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe and Emerging Threats. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 676, which puts America squarely on the side of courageous Iranians who risk their lives in opposition to the corruption and oppression of the mullah regime in Tehran. Iran is a country made up of oppressed minorities. It is a country made up of Kurds—there are more Kurds in Iran than there are in Iraq— Balochis, Azerias, Arabs, and yes, anticlerical Persians. These people have lived under a regime that terrorizes their population into submission and supports terrorist attacks on other nations. Unlike our last President, who closed his ears to the pleas of the Iranian oppressed and brutalized people—and also, I might add, facilitated the transfer of billions of dollars to that regime in the name of an arms control agreement—that President is gone, and our new President is making us proud today by endorsing the rights of those who are struggling for freedom and putting our country and people squarely on the side of those people who share our values in freedom and justice throughout the world. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER ). Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bipartisan resolution, H. Res. 676, offered by my friends, Chairman EDROYCE and Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL , of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I thank my friend from Florida and my friend from California for leading us in this conversation today. Less than 2 weeks ago, on December 28, protests began in towns and villages throughout Iran. These quickly and organically grew to become the largest antigovernment demonstrations the country has witnessed since those remarkable demonstrations in the summer of 2009. Iranian citizens have taken to the streets to decry the regime’s corruption, economic mismanagement, and destabilizing activities abroad, including support for such terrorist groups as Hezbollah. The Iranian people, the good men and women seeking relief from the failings of the current regime, deserve our support. Their voices deserve to be heard. Not surprisingly, the response of the regime in Tehran to these protests have been predictably draconian. News reports suggest dozens of Iranians have been killed in the crackdown on protests and more than 1,000 Iranians have been arrested. In an effort to silence the protesters, the Iranian Government has blocked access to social media platforms used to organize and spread word of the demonstrations. This most recent crackdown is part of a long history of human rights abuses by the Iranian Government, both at home through violent oppression and abroad through funding of groups that support terror. Mr. Speaker, I am proud that last month the House passed my amendment to the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act to help crack down on Iranian human rights abusers and ensure U.S. sanctions are best positioned to improve the human rights situation in Iran. This is but one step. We need to do more to stop Iran’s repression and persecution of different religious faiths, including Sunni Muslims, Christians, and Baha’is. We need to do more to stop the regime’s arbitrary and unlawful killings. We must do more to protect the Iranian people’s right to freedom of expression. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Illinois an additional 30 seconds. Mr. SCHNEIDER. This resolution is an opportunity for the American people to stand with the peaceful Iranian protesters and condemn the maligned activities of the oppressive Iranian regime. In the days ahead, I urge this administration to hold the Iranian regime accountable to its international human rights obligation as well as work with our allies at the United Nations to condemn and sanction Iran for its ongoing human rights violations. The Iranian Government is seeking to silence its people. Today’s resolution shows we are watching and that we stand with the people of Iran. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs’ Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 676 and in solidarity with the people of Iran who courageously took to the streets in the recent weeks to protest their country’s barbaric dictatorship. I thank my good friends, EDROYCE  and ELIOT ENGEL , for their leadership in bringing this resolution to the floor. I also thank the chairwoman emeritus for her tremendous work over the years towards Iran in trying to get a policy that respects fundamental human rights and also ends their barbaric reign of terror and terrorism. Mr. Speaker, over the past several weeks, tens of thousands of Iranians participated in nationwide protests to condemn the corruption, repression, and brutality that together represent the unique legacy of Iran’s nearly 40 yearold authority theocracy. The regime responded with characteristic coercion, intimidating activists and employing governmentsponsored thugs and military units to quell the unrest. Approximately 20 protesters died in clashes with security forces. At least 1,000 people were arrested. I am sure those 1,000 are being tortured as we meet here today. Some estimates place the number closer to 4,000 people. This unrest is the inevitable consequence of a dictatorship built on brutality and corruption in the service of domestic repression and regional conquest. Ambassador Haley was absolutely right when she told the U.N. Security Council: ‘‘When the rights of the people are denied, the people rightly resist. If the concerns are not acknowledged, then peace and security are inevitably threatened.’’ I am very proud of the work this Congress has done over the years. In my subcommittee, we have held hearings on human rights abuses in Iran, including with Pastor Saeed Abedini, who did a tremendous job with his wife in trying to effectuate his relief. We must hold Iran to account for the treatment of the hundreds of jailed protesters and not let their faith be forgotten with the next news cycle. We must work tirelessly to secure the liberty of our own citizens, including Xiyue Wang, a graduate student from my own State of New Jersey, who has spent the past 519 days in the Evin Prison complex. Mr. Speaker, again, I urge support of the resolution. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SUOZZI ), a member of our committee. Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, the people live like paupers while the mullahs live like gods. For weeks, tens of thousands of brave Iranians have courageously stood up in over 70 cities and chanted: ‘‘The people live like paupers while the mullahs live like gods.’’ They challenge their failed government. They have done so in the face of violent repression, imprisonment, torture, and even death. Why? They are fed up. They are fed up with poverty and unemployment; fed up with economic depravation and rampant corruption; fed up with an oppressive theocratic regime that mismanages their own country, mistreats its own people, and spends billions of dollars sowing the seeds of war and funding terrorists while its people suffer. Ayatollahs recklessly pursued nuclear weapons instead of creating jobs and building infrastructure for their own people. The regime’s apologists have long argued that these policies are popular and they give Iranians a national sense of pride, restoring their place as a regional power. A regional power? It is more like regional thugs. In Iraq, Iranianbacked militias have executed and beat civilians, looted homes, and destroyed people’s lives. In 
Lebanon, Iranianbacked Hezbollah aims tens of thousands of rockets at Israeli citizens. Syria backs Bashar al Assad’s vicious regime. Iran sends weapons and money to militants in Yemen, Bahrain, and Gaza. It has become the biggest purveyor of mayhem in the Middle East, pouring billions of dollars into nefarious activities while their own people are impoverished. Today, I rise with my colleagues to support the Iranian protesters and the bipartisan H. Res. 676. The United States and our allies should use the menu of sanctions available to us to target human rights violators and the Ayatollah’s thugs who forcefully repress their fellow citizens. We must ensure the protesters have access to social media, and we must let them know that we support them. Ayatollahs must know that the free world is watching. The people live like paupers while the mullahs live like gods. The time has come for the people to rise up and change it. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, as well as a senior member on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution condemning the Iranian regime’s crackdown on legitimate protests and to show the world that America stands with the Iranian people who want peace, prosperity, and freedom. For many years, we have known the regime in Iran has fueled radicalism and violence across the Middle East as the world’s leading state sponsor of terror. But over the last few weeks, we have seen the brutal tactics Iran’s leaders are willing to take to silence protesters who are fed up with extremism, corruption, and incompetence coming from their capital. The protesters deserve to have their voices heard without fear of retaliation. Today, Iranians are not citizens who are free to choose their own destinies. They are subject to a fanatical dictatorship that fears the people it rules by denying their freedoms. Sadly, the Obama administration believed that the Ayatollah and his radical clerics would be willing partners for peace, naively rewarding them with billions of dollars in sanction relief. It is clear, however, that, since the signing of the flawed Iran deal, the regime’s behavior has only gotten worse by continuing its support for terror groups like Hezbollah and its backing of Houthi rebels in Yemen, all in pursuit of establishing a Shia crescent. Fortunately, the current administration and this Congress will not be so easily fooled or complicit in their foreign adventurism. Leaders of rogue states will say whatever they must to bring unearned concessions from great powers. But if it is real change that is desired, we must apply more pressure. We cannot trust a country’s government to be peaceful with other nations if it resorts to violence against its own people it is supposed to protect. That is why I will soon introduce legislation that requires the Trump administration to determine whether senior members of the Government of Iran are responsible or complicit in human rights abuses, corruption, or censorship. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 30 seconds. b1445 Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, the bill also calls out the Iranian regime’s practice of taking American citizens and other foreign nationals hostage, and lays out several steps the administration should take in conjunction with our allies to put an end to this practice. A time will come when the tyrants of Tehran are held accountable for their actions. After many decades of authoritarian rule, Iranians deserve to be free. When democracy finally does flourish in Iran, the people will remember who stood by their side. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ). Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, in the past couple of weeks, tens of thousands of Iranian citizens from a broad cross section of society took to the streets to demand accountability and change in their country. This was the largest mass protest since the Green Revolution in 2009. Tragically, both ended in the same predictable darkness: harsh government crackdowns in which innocent peaceful protesters were arrested, were jailed, and were killed. In the latest episode, more than 3,700 Iranian protesters were arrested and nearly two dozen were killed. The Iranian people deserve better and they deserve the support of all peoples who value and yearn for freedom. Today’s resolution sends an important message to the Iranian people, that we stand with them in their legitimate pursuit of reforms from a regime that would silence their voices and steal their fundamental liberties. I also believe we should do more. I am proud to have introduced with Chairman MCCAUL, along with support of Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL , the Iran Human Rights and HostageTaking Accountability Act that goes one step further than condemnation to actually impose sanctions against those Iranian officials perpetrating these egregious human rights violations, as well as those responsible for kidnapping Americans, Americans like my own constituent, Bob Levinson, who has now spent more than 10 years in captivity. Last week, we welcomed in a new year, and Bob’s family again ushered in that new year without Bob by their side. For his sake and for the sake of the Iranian people trying to hold their own regime accountable for caring more about Assad and Hamas than they do about helping their own citizens, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H. Res. 676 to help bring the Iran Human Rights and HostageTaking Accountability Act to the floor, and let’s make sure that human rights remain exactly where they should in American foreign policy, right at the center of our agenda. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, who tells it just like it is. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, make no doubt about it, the number one terrorist in the world is the Ayatollah in charge of the butchery against his own people in Iran. He is the number one guy—the most wanted man in the world, as far as I am concerned, for terrorism lies at his feet. He, along with the mullahs of Iran, continues to crack down violently on the people of Iran who are exercising a human right to protest the government that is in charge. The regime’s brutality against its people knows no limit. To silence the crimes of the Ayatollah in Iran, they have blocked much of the internet and social media, including the telegram and Instagram. We must make sure that this important line of communication stays open for the Iranian people. In 2009, there were about 1 million folks in Iran who had access to social media. Now there are about 20 million people, I understand, who have access to social media. Our administration must make sure that the American businesses and technology are still available to allow the Iranian people to document the regime’s crimes against the people. The Iranian people can bring about change on their own, but we must help by providing the necessary tools to empower democratic movements that the mullahs stand in fear of. Mr. Speaker, in 2009, the Iranians rose up against the mullahs, but our government merely watched the arena of freedom in the streets of Iran while our government sat in the stands as a spectator. This is not a spectator sport. This is about freedom and human dignity. The United States must politically, publicly, and economically support the people of Iran and let them know we will not be in the stands as a spectator any longer, and we must penalize the mullahs and the Ayatollah economically for their crimes. And that is just the way it is. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank both gentlemen from California for their leadership and for their very important work on a very important crisis fight for human rights and freedom. Just yesterday I rose to the floor of the House to recount my experience over the weekend joining the Iranian American community in Houston on a busy corner at Post Oak and Westheimer. We joined together as Americans to begin to articulate that there is no divide when it comes to the freedom of speech, freedom for all to have access to protests and democracy. So today I rise to support H. Res. 676, and I rise to speak in horror of the 1,000 Iranians that have been arrested and almost two dozen killed. We mourn their loss. We recognize that it has to be all of us, our allies included, that must stand and join in the language of this resolution, and it is, of course, to ensure that sanctions are pointedly targeted at those who want to oppress the protesters. Interestingly enough, the protesters are now from rural and the middle class. The questions of the economy are very much a part of it, that Iranians are not able to live and to be able to have economic opportunity. Their young people have no growth. So this is far reaching, which is, of course, surprising to the regime. They were hoping to quash this. They have no answers. And the answers should be a concerted, committed, and dedicated group of allies, including the United States, leading in efforts to support these protesters. So I rise today to join in standing with the people of Iran in their legitimate and peaceful protest. I ask that the regime be condemned, and I ask that the communications, Mr. Speaker, be allowed to continue and that our companies don’t reject—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. I believe it is so important that the communication—the work that we are getting ready to do here in the United States, to provide communications technology, needs to go forward. We must include in our petition—meaning our petition as Members of Congress— that our companies do not deny or quash the rights of Iranians to communicate with each other for peace, freedom, and democracy. Our message to the regime is: it is time to open the doors of freedom in Iran. Iranian Americans, Americans, the United States Congress, and, of course, all of our government stand for peace, freedom, dignity, and democracy for the people of Iran. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California (Mr. R OYCE ), and I ask unanimous consent that he control that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) is recognized. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today we stand with the people of Iran. We stand with people who are engaged in legitimate protests against an oppressive, corrupt regime. There is a certain irony to this. This is a great people, the people of Iran. It was the Persian king, Cyrus the Great, who drafted the first declaration of human rights, the Cyrus Cylinder. As you enter the United Nations, you see this quotation from him. This was a document meant to protect other cultures and it secured a special place in the history of civilization. His humanitarian values that he laid out of freedom for all peoples, respect for culture, for religious liberty, recognition of the fact that it is better to be loved than to be feared, these are remarkable attributes, especially at that point in time, and they were handed down as part of this deep Persian culture. We, who live in free societies, owe a great debt to the Iranian people. They are the heirs to this culture. They are those who hold those values and ideas for governance that originally inspired the European Enlightenment, leaders of our own government here, our own Founding Fathers. It was Thomas Jefferson who told his grandson: These are the ideals you study first of Cyrus the Great in terms of governance. Now, it is amazing that Iranians at this moment enjoy far fewer rights than their forefathers did. Cyrus was lauded for the protections he offered religious and ethnic minorities. We look at the state of affairs today and we see the repression of Iran’s ethnic and religious minority populations from the Azerbaijanis to the Balochs, from the Kurds and the Arabs to the Baha’is and the Christians and the Zoroastrians. You know, the regime authorities routinely deny those citizens the most basic human rights, and they do it through harassment and intimidation and detention and violence. And if you want to know what kind of violence, talk to the young Persians or talk to the young minorities who suffered through the torture in those prisons. Why do they suffer through it? Because they are trying to bring attention to the oppressiveness of that regime. Those young people yearn for human rights. They stand for the celebrated culture of the Persian people and for human rights. As this resolution makes clear, the United States House of Representatives fully supports those who have taken to the streets in Iran to exercise the fundamental freedom of expression and assembly. We join them in the hope that their bravery will build the foundation for the emergence of a freely elected, open democratic political system in Iran. It is a moral imperative to support those who risk their lives demanding the freedoms that people in free societies enjoy every day. That is why this resolution calls on all democratic governments and institutions worldwide to join us in clearly supporting the Iranian people’s right to live in a free society. We all face a clear choice. We stand with the protesters and we stand with those who demand the basic rights and opportunities enjoyed in free societies. We are not going to stand with the oppressors, those who steal the wealth of a great nation to enrich themselves and to fund violence abroad. Supporting the people of Iran is a strategic imperative. These brave men and women are standing up against the Revolutionary Guard’s violent intervention in Syria and Lebanon as well. We must join them in demanding an end to the single greatest source of instability in the Middle East, and this is this obsession that the regime has with this ideology. In standing with the Iranian people, we must explain that they are not the target of our sanctions. U.S. sanctions target the oppressive destabilizing regime, not the people of Iran. That is why, as this resolution makes clear, Congress has provided authority to license communications technology that improves the ability of the Iranian people to speak freely. Today we call on the agencies involved to expedite those licenses. U.S. international broadcasting must also turn up the volume of its efforts in Iran and convey a message of hope and support. This should be conveyed by the young that know that this debate today in the American people’s House is about this issue. Iranians must know that they are not alone in their struggle for freedom. We also call on companies to reject requests by the regime to cut off the Iranian people from social media. b1500 These technologies are at their best when they are used to empower people and undermine the efforts of oppressive regimes. There is more we can do, and I welcome Chairman MCCAULand Congressman DEUTCH ’s introduction of bipartisan legislation that will give the administration greater leverage to target those responsible for ordering and carrying out human rights abuses in Iran. This includes the regime’s practice of holding Americans and other foreigners hostage. Many of the regime’s hostages are people of Iranian descent who came to visit family members, came to visit loved ones. I am also working to introduce legislation that has the same goal as those who have bravely taken to the streets: to push the corrupt revolutionary 
guard out of the Iranian economy. In doing so, it seeks to deny the guards the funds they use to hold power over the Iranian people while destabilizing Syria and destabilizing Lebanon. Mr. Speaker, Congress and the administration have a great opportunity. We must work together on an approach to Iran that empowers the Iranian people and targets the corrupt regime which oppresses a great people. We cannot be quiet with the passage of this resolution. We state that America stands with the Iranian people. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I commend our committee chairman for an outstanding speech. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER ). Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of H. Res. 676, to urge support for this bipartisan resolution to help stop terror. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE and my good friend Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL for their leadership on this issue, and I am glad that this bipartisan resolution has proceeded swiftly to a vote on the House floor. Mr. Speaker, the revolution of 1979 marked an enormous step backwards for global security and for the basic rights of the Iranian people, the longest suffering victims of this corrupt terrorist regime. From its very beginnings, the Islamic Republic of Iran, under the control of its Supreme Leaders, has repeatedly violated the fundamental human rights of its own citizens. In August, the U.N. Special Reporter on the Situation of Human Rights in Iran highlighted the Khamenei regime’s many ongoing abuses, ‘‘including the arbitrary detention and prosecution of individuals for their legitimate exercise of a broad range of rights; the persecution of human rights defenders, journalists, students, trade union leaders, and artists; a high level of executions, including of juvenile offenders; the use of torture and ill treatment; widespread violations of the right to a fair trial and due process of law, especially before revolutionary courts; and a high level of discrimination against women and religious and ethnic minorities.’’ Beginning late last month, protestors across the country have taken to the streets to decry their dismal economic prospects; Iran’s costly, aggressive, and destabilizing actions throughout the region; and an antidemocratic regime that stifles their rights and aspirations and supports terror. These brave men and women, engaged in peaceful demonstrations, have every right to demand change from their corrupt and oppressive terrorist government. While Iranians live under a brutal, authoritarian mullahcracy at home, their government insists on bankrolling terror throughout the region. Iran has capitalized on sanctions relief, bolstering its arsenal of conventional arms and its illegal ballistic missile program, and increasing the funding of heinous terrorist organizations and proxies in Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq, as well as propping up the murderous regime of Bashar alAssad in Syria. As the world’s leading sponsor of terror, Iran provides more than $800 million, annually, to Hezbollah and recently renewed its support for Hamas. Iranianbacked forces are also attempting to gain a foothold in Syria, right up against Israel’s border, to threaten our vital ally and the leading democracy in the region. There should be nothing partisan about having the backs of brave men and women anywhere who risk death to speak out for what is right and against a terrorist regime. This bipartisan resolution condemns the regime’s censorship, violent crackdowns, and systematic repression. We must send a clear message to Iran that its destructive behavior throughout the Middle East will not be tolerated. Mr. Speaker, the time has come for the people of Iran to enjoy their fundamental right to a peaceful and democratic government. I urge each of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan resolution to help stop terror. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ). Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, simple things mean a lot. That is why I, too, stand in support of H. Res. 676, which sends a clear message that the United States strongly condemns the arrest of peaceful protestors by the rogue Iranian regime. Mr. Speaker, the Iranian people deserve to be free. The last administration witnessed such protests about 8 years ago and turned its back. The world saw that America turned their back on the freedom effort and movement in Iran. The current administration has noticed immediately and recognized immediately, and we are here today to say that no longer will terrorism be appeased; no longer should we help pay for the funding of Hezbollah and Hamas through payments in the Iran nuclear deal. Simple things mean a lot, and simple things like this resolution, Mr. Speaker, mean that we stand with the Iranian people who breathe and live to be free, just like we do. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ), a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, thank you for demonstrating that the House of Representatives stands with the people of Iran and condemns the country’s brutal regime. I rise today to applaud the Iranian people, who are struggling for dignity, human rights, and economic security under a shadow of oppression. We are a hemisphere away, but our hearts are with the brave men and women who are raising their voices in hopes that they will finally be free from the reins of tyranny. The Iranian people are protesting the abuses of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and we must support their outrage by severely punishing and containing the IRGC with suffocating sanctions. We must work with our allies to help Iranians communicate on the internet without restrictions. We must broadcast footage from protestors and hold authorities accountable for abuses. America is an enthusiastic friend of the Iranian people. We are thrilled to support their aspirations for justice and liberty, and we stand with them as they take to the streets and demand an end to oppression. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee). The time of the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) has expired. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ), and I ask unanimous consent that he be able to control that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ). Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of this resolution demonstrating our support for the Iranian people’s cry for democracy. On December 28, 2017, tens of thousands of Iranians courageously poured into the streets to protest the brutality of President Rouhani’s regime. Instead of caring for its own people, the Iranian regime focuses all of its energy on suffocating their cry, murdering protestors, while choking off communication via the internet and social media apps. We have been down this road before. This is our second chance. The Iranian people, smothered by their own government, look to us, and, instead of the chill of silence, this time, they are rightfully met with the full, immediate, and resounding support of the United States. We stand in solidarity with millions of Iranians desperate for support to help them turn the tide in Tehran and all throughout Iran. The people of Iran will be losing a great champion with the retirement of Chairman ROYCE , who has served over the course of the last three terms as chairman of our committee. The fight continues. Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan resolution. It will put America and this Congress on the side of the Iranian people. Regardless of which side you are on as to the nuclear deal, we are all dedicated to peace and democracy in Iran and an end to its support for terrorism around the world, support that not only causes damage outside Iran’s borders but, as the demonstrators shouting in over 50 Iranian cities have clearly indicated, devastates the economy of Iran. To us here in Washington, we may believe that the face of this regime is that of Foreign Minister Zarif, the dapper, debonair diplomat, meeting with us in Geneva and Vienna. But the real face of this regime is that of Alan Kurdi, the 3yearold Kurdish child found washed up on the beach in Turkey after fleeing the war in Syria, a war that has claimed nearly 500,000 lives because, and only because, Assad has been propped up by the Iranian regime. The other faces of this regime are the real faces of Iranian protestors who put their lives on the line for the freedom of their country. Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that deserves the support of both sides of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 676. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
TAIWAN TRAVEL ACT Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 535) to encourage visits between the United States and Taiwan at all levels, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 535 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Taiwan Travel Act’’. 
Congress finds the following: (1) The Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), enacted in 1979, has continued for 37 years to be a cornerstone of relations between the United States and Taiwan and has served as an anchor for peace and security in the Western Pacific area. (2) The Taiwan Relations Act declares that peace and stability in the Western Pacific area are in the political, security, and economic interests of the United States and are matters of international concern. (3) The United States considers any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States. (4) Taiwan has succeeded in a momentous transition to democracy beginning in the late 1980s and has been a beacon of democracy in Asia, and Taiwan’s democratic achievements inspire many countries and people in the region. (5) Visits to a country by United States cabinet members and other highranking officials are an indicator of the breadth and depth of ties between the United States and such country. (6) Since the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act, relations between the United States and Taiwan have suffered from insufficient highlevel communication due to the selfimposed restrictions that the United States maintains on highlevel visits with Taiwan. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS; STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
(a) S ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that the United States Government should encourage visits between officials from the United States and Taiwan at all levels. (b) STATEMENT OF POLICY .—It should be the policy of the United States to— (1) allow officials at all levels of the United States Government, including cabinetlevel national security officials, general officers, and other executive branch officials, to travel to Taiwan to meet their Taiwanese counterparts; (2) allow highlevel officials of Taiwan to enter the United States, under conditions which demonstrate appropriate respect for the dignity of such officials, and to meet with officials of the United States, including officials from the Department of State and the Department of Defense and other cabinet agencies; and (3) encourage the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, and any other instrumentality established by Taiwan, to conduct business in the United States, including activities which involve participation by Members of Congress, officials of Federal, State, or local governments of the United States, or any highlevel official of Taiwan. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ). 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 535, the Taiwan Travel Act, and I recognize Mr. CHABOT for his longstanding dedication and support to the people of Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, Taiwan succeeded in a momentous transition, a transition which took them to democracy. They did this decades ago, and since, it has become a beacon of democracy across the AsiaPacific. Taiwan is a strong friend and critical partner to the United States. Congress has been central to this longstanding bond, championing a strong relationship with Taiwan through a number of landmark measures, like the Taiwan Relations Act, impressing successive administrations to fulfill their obligation to sell defensive arms to Taiwan. Today, Congress continues this legacy with this Taiwan Travel Act, which has gained strong, bipartisan support. We should encourage our officials to visit Taipei, to meet with their democratically elected counterparts on the many issues, the many programs, that we work on together, such as global health, commercial ties, global cooperation and training, the framework that we have in place. We should also welcome Taiwanese officials here. Mr. Speaker, there are, in fact, no laws that bar our executive branch officials at any level from visiting Taiwan. The EPA Administrator in 2014 was the last executive branch official to visit Taiwan. A total of six Cabinetlevel officials have visited Taiwan since 1979. As our 10th largest trading partner, Taiwan deserves more attention. U.S. interests in the region deserve more respect. This bill encourages officials, at all levels of the U.S. Government, including Cabinetlevel officials, to travel to Taiwan to meet their counterparts and vice versa. b1515 Mr. Speaker, we must build stronger ties in our relationship with Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, H.R. 535, the Taiwan Travel Act. I am pleased to have joined with Congressman CHABOT in introducing this bill, the Taiwan Travel Act. Taiwan is not just an important trading partner, our 14th largest market. It is not just a land of 23 million people. It is a democratic ally of the United States, a place where our values are displayed in the AsiaPacific region. Yet it would be surprising for most Americans to know that leaders from Taiwan are not allowed to visit the United States under any reasonable format. Instead, the President of Taiwan cannot visit Washington, D.C., but can visit Los Angeles for a refueling stop on the way to Costa Rica. What an absurd fiction that the President of Taiwan would fly across the Pacific again and again to visit their friends in Costa Rica or other 
Central American countries and that the refueling stop in the United States is just a 2day effort to put fuel on a jet plane. Now, my district actually benefits from this, because when the President and several different officials of Taiwan come to America, they refuel at Los Angeles Airport and they come to the Sheraton Universal Hotel in the 30th Congressional District. But in spite of the benefit both in terms of image and the economy that the current situation provides for the 30th District, it is time for us to grow up and it is time for us to realize that Taiwan is a vital ally and that its most important leaders should be visiting Washington, D.C., and talking not only to the legislative branch, but talking to the executive branch as well. We should no longer be in a circumstance where, when Members of Congress from other parts of the country want to visit with the President of Taiwan, they have to fly to Universal City and stay at the Sheraton in my district and visit there. We could communicate far better if the President of Taiwan was able to land at Dulles and be in the halls of Congress. This bill simply says that it is time to encourage travel of the highranking officials of each country to the other and meetings at the highest levels. These are important steps in ending this effort to isolate Taiwan, because by encouraging a greater level of high level visits and dialogue, we would ease Taiwan’s international isolation and reaffirm that the U.S. has a political and security commitment to the freedom of Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. CHABOT  for introducing this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), the chairman emeritus of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our esteemed chairman for his years of service to our country. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H.R. 535, the Taiwan Travel Act, authored by my good friend and colleague, Chairman STEVE CHABOT . Over the years, Steve and I have worked closely together on our Foreign Affairs Committee, and his commitment and leadership on strengthening U.S.Taiwan relations has been second to none. We have worked to shift U.S. policy on Taiwan to a more favorable position for our friend and ally, Taiwan, rather than an acquiescent policy that U.S. administration after U.S. administration continued to implement out of fear from a Chinese economic retaliation or diplomatic retaliation or military retaliation. Frankly, Mr. Speaker, it is a shame that we continue to allow China to dictate our foreign policy when it comes to Taiwan. The Taiwanese have been great partners for the United States, whereas China seeks to undermine everything we do, yet administration after administration have gone so far as to selfimpose restrictions and self impose limitations in our dealings with Taiwan, and that includes a selfimposed restriction on allowing the Taiwanese President and other highranking government officials from Taipei from coming to Washington, D.C., to meet with Congress, to meet with administration officials, to meet with other policymakers. This is unconscionable, and this farce needs to end. We should have direct dialogue with the democratically elected leadership of our ally, Taiwan, and we should not allow China or the fear of Chinese reprisal to dictate this. Without this, we are putting ourselves at a disadvantage. We are harming and insulting an ally. Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, we are damaging our national security interests and giving China, in effect, a veto over our foreign policy decisions. That is why Mr. CHABOT ’s bill is so important, Mr. Speaker. The Taiwan Travel Act states that it should be U.S. policy to not only allow visits from Taiwanese officials at all levels of the government, but to encourage these visits, to facilitate these visits. It also states that our own policymakers, including at the highest levels of our government, should visit Taiwan for facetoface meetings with their counterparts. Mr. Speaker, the United States is a global leader. We are a sovereign nation. Who we choose to meet with and who we choose to recognize is our sovereign right. We should not allow China or anyone else to impact our decision. For far too long, America has allowed China to prevent us from taking full advantage of our partnership with Taiwan. The Taiwan Travel Act is an important step toward doing the right thing for our friend and ally, and I hope that the administration will reverse these damaging policies. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the chairman of our esteemed committee, for the time. I urge all of our colleagues to support Mr. CHABOT ’s bill. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ), who is the author of this bill. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on this. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of all three of these overwhelmingly bipartisan bills. First, I would like to speak on H.R. 535, the Taiwan Travel Act, a bill which I introduced this Congress along with my colleague, Congressman SHERMAN. We appreciate his support on this and a lot of other issues in this Congress, Chairman ROYCE and other Members as well. For close to 4 decades now, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act has served as a cornerstone of U.S.Taiwan relations, and together, with President Reagan’s six assurances, we have maintained peace and stability and security in the AsiaPacific region. However, there are still major steps that we can take to further strengthen the U.S.Taiwan relationship. I believe one of the most important improvements that we can make is to allow the President of Taiwan and other highranking officials, like Taiwan’s foreign and defense ministers, to visit Washington, our Nation’s Capital, something that is currently prohibited. This is our own selfimposed policy and it is outrageous. These restrictions are only carried out because of potential diplomatic retaliation from the PRC, from China. Personally, I think restricting high level visits by senior Taiwanese officials is not only insulting, but it is counterproductive. We should be encouraging more direct dialogue with the democratically elected President of Taiwan and other highest elected officials. We let the leaders of China, the PRC, come to Washington on a regular basis and we give them the highest honors, yet we shun the democratically elected leaders of our longtime ally, Taiwan. We need to send a strong signal that the current approach to bilateral contacts and communications between the U.S. and Taiwan is outdated and it is time for it to go and be changed, and that is what this bill is all about. If we seriously want to promote greater democracy in the region, we should be as supportive as possible to the countries that are actually practicing democracy, and that is what Taiwan does. It is a longtime ally of ours. That is exactly why I introduced the Taiwan Travel Act along, again, with Congressman SHERMAN and Chairman ROYCE a year ago—January 13, 2017, to be exact. This bill, which has broad, bipartisan support from a long list of cosponsors, states that our government should encourage visits between the U.S. and Taiwan at all levels. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to quickly voice my support for H.R. 3320, a bill championed by my friend and colleague, Chairman TEDYOHO. This bill directs the Department of State to assist Taiwan in regaining observer status in the World Health Organization, WHO. Unfortunately, Taiwan has been excluded from participating in most of the really important international organizations, including the WHO, for almost 50 years now. Many of my colleagues and I have advocated for years for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the WHO, much to the dismay of China, which has consistently thwarted these efforts. Taiwan’s exclusion from the WHO creates a dangerous and unnecessary gap in global health, especially considering the stellar health research and medical resources Taiwan has to offer. 
That is why H.R. 3320 is so important. WHO membership for Taiwan is not only in the best interests of Taiwan, it is in the best interests of the rest of the world, including the United States. Mr. Speaker, lastly, I want to voice my support for H. Res. 676, Chairman ROYCE ’s and Ranking Member E NGEL ’s resolution supporting the rights of the people of Iran and condemning the Iranian regime for its crackdown on legitimate protesters. This is a commonsense measure. The current regime in Iran has never respected human rights or the rule of law. The recent situation in Iran only underscores this reality. I am pleased to see my colleagues quickly condemning the atrocities by that government this very day; however, I want to take this opportunity to stress the importance of remembering the big picture in Iran. It is a country, let’s face it, that is being run by thugs. Not only do they perpetrate violence and marginalize their own people, they harbor, promote, and finance terrorism throughout the region. They threaten America and its allies. They continue to develop ballistic missiles, which we know that one day they would like to have tipped with nuclear devices. That could be a threat not just to our allies in the region, but the United States. This most recent outbreak of civil unrest in the country should not be a surprise, considering the Iranian regime’s ruthless tactics. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues join me in support of this measure also and take further steps to hold Iran accountable for both its domestic and international violations. I urge my colleagues to support all three of these measures. Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank the gentlemen from California, Chairman ROYCE and Mr. S HERMAN , for their support on these and other measures. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, every year, China threatens Taiwan, attempts to strangle that democracy, bases missiles just over the Taiwan Straits, conducts military exercises designed to simulate an invasion, hurts the economy of Taiwan, and hurts the people of Taiwan. b1530 What is the mildest possible response that the United States could make to these provocative and hostile actions? It is the adoption of the Taiwan Travel Act, H.R. 535, to simply have meetings with Taiwanese officials and simply allow them to land, even at those airports in the United States inconvenient for refueling on the way to Costa Rica. We should welcome the leaders of Taiwan as we welcome the leaders of other allies of the United States, and this is the mildest answer we could make to the saberrattling from Beijing. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am a decadeslong supporter of Taiwan; and as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have made supporting stronger U.S. Taiwan economic and security ties a priority for our committee. I have traveled to Taiwan many times, as have members of the committee. I really want to thank Chairman CHABOT for introducing this important measure, and I want to thank him for being a longtime champion for Taiwan, especially when he was chairman of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee. The U.S. and Taiwan share a common commitment, and that commitment is to democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. Taiwan’s successes serve as an example of what can be built on these important principles. We should be supporting countries that have achieved democracy to serve as an inspiration for those values across the world. The Taiwan Travel Act is important because it will encourage more interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan. This is long overdue. It is needed, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 535. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 535. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DIRECTING THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO REGAIN OBSERVER STATUS FOR TAIWAN IN THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3320) to direct the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to regain observer status for Taiwan in the World Health Organization, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3320 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the following findings: (1) The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations, charged with coordinating health efforts within the United Nations system. The World Health Assembly (WHA) is the decisionmaking body of the WHO, which convenes annually in May to set the policies and priorities of the organization. Statehood is not a requirement for attendance at the WHA, and numerous observers, including nonmembers and nongovernmental organizations, attended the most recent WHA in May 2017. (2) Taiwan began seeking to participate in the WHO as an observer in 1997. In 2009, with strong support from successive United States Administrations, Congress, and likeminded WHO Member States, and during a period of improved CrossStrait relations, Taiwan received an invitation to attend the WHA as an observer under the name ‘‘Chinese Taipei’’. Taiwan received the same invitation each year until 2016, when following the election of President TsaiIng Wen of the Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan’s engagement in the international community began facing increased resistance from the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Taiwan’s invitation to the 2016 WHA was received late and included new language conditioning Taiwan’s participation on the PRC’s ‘‘one China principle’’. In 2017, Taiwan did not receive an invitation to the WHA. (3) Taiwan remains a model contributor to world health, having provided financial and technical assistance to respond to numerous global health challenges. Taiwan has invested over $6 billion in international medical and humanitarian aid efforts impacting over 80 countries since 1996. In 2014, Taiwan responded to the Ebola crisis by donating $1 million and providing 100,000 sets of personal protective equipment. Through the Global Cooperation and Training Framework, the United States and Taiwan have jointly conducted training programs for experts to combat MERS, Dengue Fever, and Zika. These diseases know no borders, and Taiwan’s needless exclusion from global health cooperation increases the dangers presented by global pandemics. (4) Taiwan’s international engagement has faced increased resistance from the PRC. Taiwan was not invited to the 2016 Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), despite participating as a guest at the organization’s prior summit in 2013. Taiwan’s request to participate in the 2016 General Assembly of the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) was also rejected. In May 2017, PRC delegates disrupted a meeting of the Kimberley Process on conflict diamonds held in Perth, Australia, until delegates from Taiwan were asked to leave. In June 2017, the Republic of Panama granted diplomatic recognition to the PRC, terminating a longstanding diplomatic relationship with Taiwan. (5) Congress has established a policy of support for Taiwan’s participation in international bodies that address shared transnational challenges, particularly in the WHO. Congress passed H.R. 1794 in the 106th Congress, H.R. 428 in the 107th Congress, and S. 2092 in the 108th Congress to direct the Secretary of State to establish a strategy for, and to report annually to Congress on, efforts to obtain observer status for Taiwan at the WHA. Congress also passed H.R. 1151 in the 113th Congress, directing the Secretary to report on a strategy to gain observer status for Taiwan at the ICAO Assembly, and H.R. 1853 in the 114th Congress, directing the Secretary to report on a strategy to gain observer status for Taiwan at the INTERPOL Assembly. However, in 2016 Taiwan did not receive invitations to attend any of these events as an observer. (b) AUGMENTATION OF REPORT CONCERNING  
THEPARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE WORLD  HEALTH ORGANIZATION .— (1) IN GENERAL .—Subsection (c) of section 1 of Public Law 108–235 (118 Stat. 656) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph: 
‘‘(3) An account of the changes and improvements the Secretary of State has made to the United States plan to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at the World Health Assembly, following any annual meetings of the World Health Assembly at which Taiwan did not obtain observer status.’’. (2) EFFECTIVE DATE .—The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall take effect and apply beginning with the first report required under subsection (c) of section 1 of Public Law 108–235 that is submitted after the date of the enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ). 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), the author of this important bill which counters the harmful and unacceptable efforts being made to undermine Taiwan’s inclusion at the World Health Organization. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, Mr. ROYCE , for offering this bill, or the opportunity to offer this bill. I would also like to say I, too, support H.R. 535, the Taiwan Travel Act. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3320, a bill that directs the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to regain observer status for Taiwan in the World Health Organization. I would like to give particular thanks to Chairman ROYCE , Ranking Member E NGEL , and Ranking Member SHERMAN for supporting this bill and working with me to advance it through the committee process. Mr. Speaker, over the last few years, the People’s Republic of China has stepped up its campaign to marginalize Taiwan. Last year, Beijing poached one of Taiwan’s few remaining diplomatic partners, the Republic of Panama. Beijing also successfully blocked Taiwan from participating in a number of international organizations, including the World Health Organization. Taiwan’s exclusion from the World Health Organization’s annual summit, the World Health Assembly, serves no purpose other than to placate Beijing. The WHO exists to address shared transnational health challenges, and Taiwan has proven, time and time again, that it is a model contributor to world health. Since 1996, Taiwan has invested over $6 billion in international medical and humanitarian aid efforts impacting over 80 countries. It has made significant financial contributions to The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis. And as this bill finds, in 2014, Taiwan responded to the Ebola crisis by donating $1 million and providing over 100,000 sets of personal protective equipment. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 3320. Clearly, Taiwan should be a full member of the World Health Organization. All nations should be full members of the World Health Organization, especially one with an advanced health system that can help us stop pandemics from spreading from one country to another. That is why it makes sense for us to advocate Taiwanese participation in all international bodies, but particularly the U.N.’s World Health Organization. I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation that is critical to preparing to prevent pandemics. Look at the nonsense that is being foisted on the world by Beijing. For political reasons, in an effort to say that Taiwan doesn’t exist except as a province, they are endangering the health of the world because pathogens have not been told that they are not to go to Taiwan. The epidemics have not been told to spare humankind from the inefficiencies and glaring omissions that occur when an important country is excluded from the World Health Organization. Taiwan’s exclusion, even from observer status, from the World Health Organization is a terrible symbol, an attempt to deny selfdetermination to 23 million people. But it is worse than a terrible symbol. It is a practical impediment to stopping epidemics. It is a practical impediment to world health, and it is time for the United States to have a strategy to reach out to the world and say Taiwan needs to be part of health planning. Taiwan needs to be part of the lifesaving initiatives of the World Health Organization. So I look forward to working with our colleagues to pass this legislation and working with the State Department to implement it. I look forward to the day when we do not put the world at risk of an epidemic that could have been contained but for the malicious symbolism being foisted on us by Beijing. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), our chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman again for yielding more time. I also recognize Congressmen CHABOT  and CONNOLLY for being cosponsors of this bill. While Taiwan’s contributions to global health deserves praise, its isolation from international organizations and exclusion from the WHO has proven dangerous, if not hazardous. During the 2002–2003 outbreak of SARS, official WHO notifications and technical assistance were either blocked or delayed, all while patients in Taiwan died and the virus continued to spread. These diseases know no boundaries and, with extensive transit and trade links, Taiwan’s participation at the WHO is essential. Congress has long supported Taiwan’s participation in international organizations that do not require statehood, and this legislation will continue this important work. My bill will ensure that the U.S. diplomatic strategy to advocate for Taiwan’s presence at the WHA, the World Health Assembly, adapts to Beijing’s increased efforts to box out Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, Taiwan is a benevolent actor on the international stage. It deserves to keep that place it has earned. The next World Health Assembly meeting will take place in May of this year. Passage of my bill will be a timely opportunity for the House to recommit to longstanding U.S. policies and to take a firm stand in the face of Beijing’s increasingly oppressive tactics. I urge my colleagues to support Taiwan’s participation in the WHO as an observer by supporting this legislation. Again, I thank Chairman ROYCE for the opportunity. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it was 20 years ago that we here in Congress spoke with one voice. We passed a law to support Taiwan’s inclusion in the World Health Organization. It took a decade of advocacy; it took pressure before Taiwan was finally invited to participate in that assembly for the first time in 2009. So you can imagine it is with great disappointment that we learned that Taiwan was excluded from the meetings last year for the first time after 8 years of consecutive participation in Geneva. Mr. Speaker, Taiwan’s participation at the World Health Organization is a matter of public health, as our friend, Mr. SHERMAN , and as the chairman of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, Mr. YOHO, have both reminded us. This is a matter of public health. Taiwan has contributed greatly, so greatly to the international efforts to prevent epidemics. It has provided critical humanitarian aid and medical training around the world; financial assistance, investing $6 billion in international medical and humanitarian aid efforts since 1996, all over this globe, 80 countries. During the 2014 Ebola crisis, it was Taiwan that was there, providing also 100,000 sets of protective gear for health workers. Through the global cooperation and training framework, the U.S. and Taiwan have jointly conducted training programs for experts to combat diseases from Dengue fever to Zika. Mr. Speaker, yes, as Mr. YOHO reminded us, and Mr. SHERMAN , we know 
from this experience that infectious diseases know no borders. They so quickly spread, and the global health community does not benefit when Taiwan is kept in the dark on these critical matters. We are all safer when Taiwan has meaningful, unobstructed participation in international health cooperation forums. All of us recall that Taiwan had an awful experience during the SARS epidemic that was 15 years ago when the World Health Organization directed Taiwan officials not to approach them, but to approach Beijing for informationsharing instead. It is clear that Taiwan’s exclusion from last year’s World Health Assembly will only hurt. The health and safety of the people of Taiwan should not be needlessly held hostage by politics, and world health should not be put at risk. Taiwanese doctors have so much to offer, given their experience providing this humanitarian assistance around this world. Last fall, I met with the Director General of the World Health Organization. b1545 I pressed him for Taiwan’s participation. Unfortunately, this meeting did not relieve my concerns about Taiwan’s future outlook. And it is for this reason, Mr. Speaker, that it is all the more important that the U.S. use all of its diplomatic leverage to support Taiwan’s efforts to regain observer status to the WHO. I applaud the administration for sending our Health Secretary to meet with the delegation Taiwan sent to Geneva for bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the assembly meeting last year, and I think, by doing so, the U.S. demonstrated leadership by putting international cooperation ahead of politics. Passage of this bill demonstrates our support for Taiwan’s inclusion. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), chairman emeritus of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our esteemed chairman for this time, and I want to thank my Florida colleague, TEDYOHO, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, for offering this important bill as well as for his constant friendship and assistance to our strong and indispensable ally, Taiwan. His bill, H.R. 3320, directing the Secretary of State to develop a strategy for increasing Taiwan’s participation at the World Health Organization, is an important first step, an important piece of our foreign policy toward our ally, Taiwan. Congress has, for years, been pushing for Taiwan to have greater access, to have equal representation at so many institutions. Unfortunately, as with so many other international organizations, Taiwan’s lack of observer status at the World Health Organization, or WHO, is caused by an orchestrated and dangerous campaign by China to constrain Taiwan’s participation in global affairs. In the case of the WHO, China is depriving the international community from access to a wealth of Taiwan’s highlevel healthcare information. Due to its superb talent, due to its data collection, due to its quarantine and treatment facilities, Taiwan has excellent infectious disease control capabilities. Fourteen years ago, Taiwan’s cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control was crucial in stemming the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS. Before the last World Health assembly in May, I wrote a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services urging greater efforts to ensure that Taiwan received an invitation to the summit. The Secretary agreed with me, writing that Taiwan is an indispensable member of the global health society and is a ‘‘strong health partner that demonstrated the value of its expertise and contributions to health issues of global concern.’’ Unsurprisingly, however, Mr. Speaker, China once again put its dangerous and shortsighted policies first, using its influence with World Health Organization member states to deny Taiwan an invitation to the assembly. We cannot continue allowing China to threaten global efforts to mitigate infectious disease, and, more importantly, Mr. Speaker, we cannot continue to allow China to bully Taiwan or to have a veto over our own foreign policy decisions. It is time to develop new ideas and new strategies so that we can put a stop to China’s bullying and ensure that Taiwan gains observer status at the WHO and everywhere else. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this important measure, and, as always, I thank our esteemed chairman for the time. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. This legislation has support from just about everyone, bipartisan. It is obviously necessary for Taiwan to be part of the World Health Organization. To exclude it is to put the health of anyone who might be affected by a pandemic, to put that interest below Beijing’s interest in strangling Taiwan diplomatically and economically. I urge the adoption of this legislation, and I look forward to working with the State Department until we achieve our objective, which is, at a minimum, Taiwan’s return to observer status at the World Health Organization. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I would like to share with the body that I led a delegation to Taipei this last summer, and I was there when Taiwan pledged to donate $800,000 in disaster relief to Houston. That was in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. It is generous actions like this that I can think of, 80 occasions, that remind us again and again that Taiwan is a positive actor in the international community, and that is why we must continue to support Taiwan’s international standing and wellbeing. So I would like to say in closing that I thank my colleagues for being original cosponsors on this bill. In addition to Mr. YOHO and myself, I want to thank Mr. ENGEL . And I want to thank Mr. SHERMAN . I want to thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue, and Mr. CONNOLLY as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of two critical pieces of legislation, H.R. 535 and H.R. 3320. These bills are important to U.S. national security because the spread of pandemics do not respect borders. These bills are also important because they will enhance the position of Taiwan, a true and vibrant democracy, with which we have had longstanding ties. I commend my good friend and colleague, Mr. STEVE CHABOT , for introducing the Taiwan Travel Act. Currently, the President of Taiwan, Vice President, Premier, Defense Minister and Foreign Minister of Taiwan are not allowed to come to Washington, D.C. for consultations. These are U.S. selfimposed restrictions that are practiced due to fear of potential Chinese diplomatic retaliation. Restricting highlevel visits by senior Taiwanese officials is both insulting and counterproductive. This policy should be changed. Mr. Speaker, China will never be happy with U.S.Taiwan policy or the Taiwan Relations Act. Communist China will never be placated by our selfimposed restrictions on travel and consultations. We should not try. Mr. Speaker, I also stand today in support of H.R. 3320, introduced by my good friend and chairman of the subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, Mr. TEDYOHO. H.R. 3320 would designate that the Secretary of State devise a plan to include Taiwan in the World Health Organization. Taiwan has been excluded from participating in the WHO due to Chinese pressure, and sadly, the international community has acquiesced. We here in Congress have been advocating for many years that the U.S. should take action to ensure Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the WHO. As a major transport and shipping hub in the Asia Pacific region, with enormous volumes of people and goods passing through on a daily basis, Taiwan’s exclusion creates a dangerous gap in the global health and safety information network. Mr. Speaker, the full participation of Taiwan in the WHO and other multilateral bodies cannot be overstated as a U.S. national security interest. China’s efforts to exclude Taiwan from international bodies like WHO creates needless blind spots in the international system where terrorism and disease can spread undetected. Mr. Speaker, Taiwan must join the WHO as a full member. Regaining observer status is 
only a first step. Full WHO membership for Taiwan is not only in the interest of Taiwan, it is in the interest of the rest of the world. I urge my colleagues to pass these critical measures to strengthen the bond between the U.S. and our democratic ally, Taiwan. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3320. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Wayzata High School on being named Minnesota’s best public school by USA Today. Strong public schools are the foundation of our community, and while Minnesota has many great public and private schools, Wayzata does stand out among them. The schools are evaluated on standardized test scores, student teacher ratios, graduation rates, Advanced Placement enrollment, and more. Wayzata High School has over 3,200 students, a student ratio of 17 to 1, and an average SAT score of 1420. Across the Nation, 80 percent of students graduate from high school. In Minnesota, 88 percent graduate, and in Wayzata, 93 percent of their students graduate. Their Advanced Placement enrollment is high, Mr. Speaker. Over 25 percent of 10th graders, 36 percent of 11th graders, and 34 percent of seniors are enrolled in AP classes at Wayzata. Mr. Speaker, Principal Scott Gengler, all of the teachers and staff, students and parents, and the Spartan community deserve this recognition. Congratulations to Wayzata High School. 
HONORING JORDAN THOMAS FOR RECEIVING THE RHODES SCHOLARSHIP (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jordan Thomas, a senior at Princeton University and a graduate of University High School in Newark, New Jersey, for being selected as a 2018 Rhodes Scholar, one of only 32 in the country. This young man, who graduated high school in my district, is the first Newark Public Schools student in over a decade to receive this prestigious honor. In addition to getting straight A’s since his freshman year at Princeton, Jordan is writing a thesis on school based support services that Newark Public Schools offers pregnant and parenting teens. In the next year, he will be taking his talents abroad to study social policy at Oxford College in England. Jordan plans to return to his home of Newark as a public servant. He told the Star Ledger newspaper: ‘‘Newark built me. Newark shaped me.’’ As a lifelong resident of Newark myself, I know that feeling. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Jordan Thomas for his successes, service, and future. His love for his community shows that our country’s future is in good hands. f 
b1645 NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. Law enforcement officers courageously put their lives on the line to protect our homes, our businesses, and our schools. They are truly the unsung heroes of our communities. We are grateful to the men and women in blue who service the front line of defense here at home. Today and every day, we must stand with our members of law enforcement and their families to honor the sacrifices and the contributions they make to ensure that our families remain safe. I also especially thank the United States Capitol Police force, who work each day to ensure that Members, staff, and visitors to the Nation’s Capital are safe and secure. Let us not forget to honor the service and sacrifice of all who serve in law enforcement, especially in New York State: our New York State Police, the New York State Park Police, county, city, and village police forces, and, of course, corrections officers throughout the great State of New York. 
HONORING LIEUTENANT DEBRA CLAYTON AND DEPUTY NORM LEWIS (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the lives of Lieutenant Debra Clayton of the Orlando Police Department and Deputy Norm Lewis of the Orange County Sheriff’s Office. Lieutenant Clayton was an outstanding officer, a loving wife, mother, and friend. One year ago today, she was shot and killed while attempting to apprehend a murder suspect. Deputy Lewis was killed the same day while searching for Lieutenant Clayton’s killer. Deputy Lewis was deeply admired by all of his colleagues: a man described as a ‘‘gentle giant,’’ who played for the UCF Knights and went on to be a true public servant. Mr. Speaker, it has been said that when a law enforcement officer falls, a part of America dies. Today we recognize these two public servants and pay tribute to them for paying the ultimate sacrifice. Today we also take a moment on Law Enforcement Appreciation Day to thank law enforcement officers throughout our Nation who serve and protect us and our families. 
IRANIAN PEOPLE ARE ENSLAVED BY THE MULLAHS (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, cracks are beginning to form in the iron grip of the Iranian regime. The oppressed people of Iran have taken to the streets to demand an end to the corrupt and brutal dictatorship. The mullahs in Tehran have stolen the wealth of the country and the people, lining their own pockets and funding terror throughout the Middle East. Like in 2009, when the Iranian people rose up to confront the corruption of the regime, these Iranians have been met with harsh violence and been murdered in the streets. Thousands of others have been imprisoned. In 2009, however, the United States sat in the stands as a spectator and watched the Ayatollah crush freedom. I applaud this President’s show of support for freedom in Iran. The United States must show political and public support for our friends for liberty in Iran. As President Kennedy once said: ‘‘Let every Nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we will pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.’’ Like our friends in Iran. And that is just the way it is. 
CELEBRATING THE HISTORY OF TEXAS (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I have often come to this floor to remind my colleagues of the devastation that the people of Texas have experienced with Hurricane Harvey. I certainly don’t intend to ignore our other friends in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, and California who have experienced their own devastation, along with Louisiana. But I am excited today, Mr. Speaker, because I am introducing a bill that celebrates the history of Texas. H.R. 4745 is the emancipation national historic trail. Many people know that the Emancipation Proclamation was not heard in Texas but for 2 years later in 1865. This emancipation national historic trail recounts the journey of many of those individuals: freed slaves going from the Osterman Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas; along Texas State Highway 3, Interstate Highway 45 North, Freedmen’s Town, and Emancipation Park in Houston, Texas; following the migration route of newly freed slaves and other persons of African descent; from the major 19th century seaport of Galveston. It is a collaboration with people from both parties throughout the community. It is one of unity, Mr. Speaker. It is one where we are coming together. I look forward to passing this legislation with my colleagues—Republicans and Democrats—because it is a celebration of the history of Texas. f 
STOP THE BLEED (Mr. ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, as a physician, I rise today to raise awareness about the value of comprehensive training aimed at preventing deaths after a traumatic injury occurs. Last fall, I took part in a ‘‘Stop the Bleeding’’ training course offered by the American College of Surgeons. This simple training teaches individuals how to treat bleeding injuries and help save a life. Each year, more than 180,000 people die from traumatic injuries. The most common and easily preventable cause of these deaths is too much blood loss in the critical minutes before trained first responders arrive. With an average response time of 8 to 12 minutes once 911 is called, it is the responsibility for all of us to prepare to help others in the event of a traumatic injury. I look forward to working with my fellow Members of Congress and advocates, such as my friends of the American College of Surgeons, to raise awareness of the value of this lifesaving technique. 
WOMEN AND THE TAX SCAM (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, last month, Republicans rammed through a terrible tax bill with devastating consequences, and women are among the hardest hit. This tax plan drains funds from working mothers while giving huge tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy. Women are breadwinners for half of the American families with children. These women often do more work for less pay. Nearly six in ten workers in low wage jobs are women. Women earn 82 cents on the dollar. In Michigan, it is even lower: 74 cents. The tax plan takes away the individual mandate, so 9.5 million women could lose healthcare—annual exams, birth control, cancer screening, pregnancy support—and lose economic security. Under this new law, the wealthiest continue to prosper at the expense of hardworking women in this country. We deserve better in America. People deserve better than this reckless tax bill. f 
NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. In 2017, 128 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty. Despite the significant danger they face, these brave men and women continue to put their badge on every day, leaving their loved ones at home, to protect our friends, our families, and our communities. I was fortunate to be a member of the thin blue line for nearly a decade and a half as an FBI special agent. During that time, I worked with some of the most dedicated, missionoriented professionals in the Nation, to include Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers. I ask that today, and every day, all Americans take a moment to reflect on what our law enforcement officers do to protect our liberties and to ensure the safety of our communities. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their service and for their sacrifice. As I did last year, I urge the President to observe this day by lighting the White House blue this evening. 
CONGRATULATING COLONEL BRIT HATLEY AND THE HAPPY HOOLIGANS (Mr. CRAMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, no U.S. Air Force unit has ever won more than 19 Outstanding Unit Awards. This last Saturday, I was honored to be in Fargo 
as the North Dakota Air National Guard’s 119th Wing was awarded their 19th. The 119th Wing, known as the Happy Hooligans, has received this prestigious recognition nearly constantly since 2006. The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award is given to numbered units of the Active Duty Air Force, Air National Guard, and U.S. Air Force Reserve that have distinguished themselves by exceptionally meritorious service or outstanding achievement. The mission of the 119th Wing is to provide trained and ready airmen, executing world class MQ–9 and reconnaissance kinetic and nonkinetic target intelligence production, and expeditionary support capabilities for the Nation and State. Mr. Speaker, Aristotle said: ‘‘We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.’’ Freedomloving people around the world are grateful to the Happy Hooligans from Fargo for making excellence in defending liberty a habit. Congratulations, Colonel Brit Hatley and Hooligans, and thank you for your outstanding service to the cause of freedom around the world. 
DREAMERS (Mr. ROHRABACHER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to the American people to information that is being kept from them. So often the good will and goodheartedness of the American people is manipulated to achieve goals that sometimes are detrimental to our people and detrimental to our country as well. Today, the American people are being told that there are young people who are here illegally, brought by their parents at an early age—they call them DREAMers—and that we must be concerned about them, as we are. Of course, we are concerned about them. Our sympathy is with young people anywhere who want a better life. But what the American people are not being told is that there are 850,000 of these young people. That is being left out of the discussion. They are looking to be legalized. When they are legalized, that means they can apply for family reunification, which means that they then will receive government benefits and even more people will come in under their platform. I suggest that we take a look to see what 850,000 more young people and the millions more who will come will do to the American people. 
NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. But it isn’t just a day for all of us; it should be every day. They are on the front lines protecting our families, our lives, our homes, and our values. We need to keep that in mind: to appreciate them every day. When you see them in the community, they are not someone to be afraid of. They are our neighbors. They are doing the same things we are: raising their kids, sending their kids to school, going to the park, and enjoying life, just as we do. With all of the misunderstanding about law enforcement these days, it is really disheartening to see what some of our law enforcement officers have to put up with in order to do a job to protect all of us. Each year, we lose many officers. At least 125 were lost in the line of duty last year, including eight in my home State of California. I want to tell them that we do appreciate them: from the California Highway Patrol that keeps an eye on our offices, the Capitol Hill Police here, our city police, our county sheriffs, all of them. We do appreciate them because we know they are on the front line and they are just like us. We want to honor them constantly for stepping forward to do a very difficult task that is sometimes misunderstood and unappreciated. The vast majority of us Americans and northern Californians do appreciate them. God bless them all and may they be safe. 
b1700 NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY (Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to our Nation’s law enforcement men and women. The safety and security of our communities is the result of our law enforcement men and women, who wake up every single day to protect neighborhoods from criminals, fight crime, ensure justice, and keep the peace. In 2017, 125 officers died in the line of duty. Their deaths are a sober reminder that our Nation’s law enforcement officers face danger every day they carry out their duty to protect the American people. They run towards danger while everyone else is running away. No matter what, they serve and protect. They serve and protect so that you and I may be free from harm. Their diligent service does not go unnoticed, and today, on behalf of Mississippi’s Fourth Congressional District, we thank them for their bravery, fortitude, and sacrifice. So thank you to the men and women in blue. We are a safer nation because of the bravery of you and your families. Thank you for choosing to live a life of service. Your sacrifice and heroism will never be forgotten. Happy Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, and God bless you. f 
PROTESTS IN IRAN The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNN). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GARRETT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BISHOP ). 
Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day with a heavy heart to pay tribute to two of Michigan’s finest Oakland County sheriff’s deputies and their legacy of service. Oakland County Sheriff’s Deputy Eric Overall, a 22yearold veteran of the sheriff’s department, was killed this past Thanksgiving while serving and protecting. Deputy Overall was pursuing a suspect who posed a threat to the public and died ensuring no one else’s life was put in danger that day. He is remembered by his friends and family as someone who lived by the mantra ‘‘never quit.’’ Sonja Overall, the widow of Eric Overall, described her husband as a man of integrity who truly left his stamp on everyone’s heart. His life and legacy will never be forgotten. Now, just 5 days ago, the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office suffered yet another tragedy. Oakland County Sheriff’s Deputy David Hack, a 17year veteran of the sheriff’s office, was securing a car accident scene when he was critically struck by a passing car. Deputy Hack is well known in the Rochester community, as he serves as the sheriff’s liaison at Rochester Adams High School in Rochester Hills, Michigan. He is currently in critical condition. I would like his family to know that all the students, educators, and staff at Adams High School and the Rochester community schools are praying for his recovery and his continued strength to keep fighting until he is fully recovered. Indeed, our entire Rochester community sends our prayers. Please join me in a moment of silence for Deputy Hack’s recovery and to honor the memory and mourn the loss of Deputy Eric Overall. Mr. Speaker, on this National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, I send my deepest condolences to their family, friends, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard, and the entire Oakland County Sheriff’s Office during this time of tragedy and loss. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, 39 years ago, a collective nightmare was foisted 
upon the people of the nation of Iran, and so when roughly 2 weeks ago, while on recess, I became aware of the courage manifest in the action of the Iranian people in standing up to a brutal totalitarian regime, I immediately contacted our office and suggested that we secure this Special Order hour, and reached out to a number of my colleagues, several of whom join me today, to speak loudly and clearly on behalf of the United States and the nearly 6 million people represented by myself and the individuals who will speak here today in support of those who would stand up and risk their very existence for those most basic human rights, which we as Americans take, tragically, for granted. As I stand in this well, Mr. Speaker, in cities that the bulk of Americans have never heard of, in Isfahan and Karaj and Tabriz and Mashhad and Tehran, indeed, tens of thousands stand in the face of a regime with a record of destroying not only freedom but life itself in the instance of those who would stand up and demand freedom, stand up and demand basic human rights and dignity. Mr. Speaker, to put this into perspective, if you were to take the population of the nation of Iran circa 1979 and compare it to the population of the United States circa 1941 and then align the numbers of Americans killed in combat during the entire Second World War, it would proportionally be roughly equal to the number of people who have given their lives at the hands of the brutal Iranian regime inside the borders of Iran. Think about that for a moment. Roughly 60,000 during the coup d’etat revolution in 1979, about 12,500 from 1981 to 1984, almost 33,000 during the 1988 uprising. We don’t know how many were murdered in 2009, when this Nation stood silent as Iranians, brave, took to the streets to demand selfdetermination and toleration; that a regime should not be able to dictate how one worships, who one marries, what one believes; that people should be given basic rights to selfdetermination. Today, we know very little about what is going on in Iran except for the brave women and men who are confronting challenges that we, by virtue of the fortune of our birth as Americans, will hopefully never have to confront. We know that roughly 50 have been murdered; we know that roughly 3,000 are imprisoned. This time, I will not be silent. I have spoken with Iranian Americans of all different facets from a number of different groups. I ask these Iranian Americans, as well as those resisting within Iran and Iranians disbursed across the globe, to set aside their political differences and join together for the common goal of deposing a regime that murders its own sons and daughters to a tune that is comparable to the total number of American combat deaths during the Second World War. Enough is enough. Today, I stand beside an image of Habib Khabiri. Habib was the former captain of the Iranian national soccer team. He and 40 others were executed in 1984 at the Evin Prison for having the temerity to criticize their government. He was 29 years old. The evidence indicates that he was tortured before he was executed. In fact, again, as we stated earlier, over 12,000 people were executed by the Islamic Republic Security Forces just from 1981 to 1984. Next is a young woman who tragically became something of an international folk hero for those who were paying attention, in that she had the temerity to stand and protest during the Green Revolution in 2009, suggesting that the Iranian people had a right to selfdetermination, when she was publicly, on film, murdered in the streets, 26 years old. The United States remained silent. The second of three children from a middle class neighborhood, she had the courage to stand up and point out injustice when she saw it, and paid with her life. Indeed, the protesters with whom she marched shouted, ‘‘America, you are either with us or with the mullahs,’’ and we did not respond. Today, I am responding. This administration is responding. The Iranians, with whom I have spoken across a diverse sect of opposition, do not want tanks and bombers and missiles, nor do I, having worn the uniform of this Nation, but while we can’t rule out any particular alternatives, all they ask is a word of support; that when we act legislatively in this body and in the Chamber down the hallway, we have the followthrough to ensure that our actions are backed up; that unlike the 1990s, when the Iran Sanctions Act was passed, we don’t let our socalled European allies turn a blind eye as their corporate entities continue to do business with the IRGC that uses the money generated through this business not only to murder their own citizens but to fund the likes of Hezbollah, and fast forward to current day, create instability, peril, death, and destruction literally across the entire region from the Mediterranean to the Khyber Pass. There is no blind eye being turned this time. Next we see Shekar Mohammadzadeh. A nurse, she was arrested, imprisoned, and tortured for rendering medical assistance to other Iranian brothers and sisters who were brutalized by the revolutionary guards in the streets of Iran. She was tortured viciously at Evin Prison, served a significant portion of a prison sentence, 7 of 15 years, before being executed along with nearly 33,000 others circa 1988. Now, three names, three faces, three stories, probably 30 seconds to a minute on each. Let me put this into perspective, Mr. Speaker. If we were to take 5 minutes to show the pictures and speak briefly on every individual murdered by the mullah regime in Iran, we would be here for over a year going 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I don’t stand here saber rattling, suggesting American military action. I stand here suggesting that what my IranianAmerican friends and what people of Iranian dissent who are dissidents throughout the world have suggested to me is that if the American Government will stand up and say, ‘‘We stand with you against these mullahs,’’ that is the support that they need to continue the movement to see that there is a regime change, which leads to selfdetermination and democracy in Iran and the lifting of a dark cloud of terror from across the globe. Don’t believe me? I was born in 1972, and I have grown up with the perpetual mention of Hezbollah. There are those who think that Hezbollah is something that has been around for a long time, but I point out today that Hezbollah is actually younger than the mullah regime; that, in fact, the mullah regime created Hezbollah; and Hezbollah has the unique distinction of being one of a very few terrorist entities that has actually killed human beings on every single inhabited continent on planet Earth. No trade with Iran, no money to the IRGC; no money to the IRGC, no money to Hezbollah; no money to Hezbollah, we have selfdetermination in Lebanon, we have less of an oppressive interference in Iraq, we have more stability in Syria, and we have freedom in Iran. Enough is enough. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for standing with me today, and I ask the American people and my colleagues to take the time to inform themselves about places like Isfahan and Karaj and Tabriz and Mashhad, and to think about the women and men who have the courage to walk through the threshold of a door of a home where, when they leave, they know full well they may very well not come back. The time is now, the cause is just, the mullah regime must go. Enough is enough. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CURTIS ). b1715 Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman GARRETT for his leadership on this issue and for arranging this today. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a few minutes to express my concern about the way the Government of Iran has trampled on the rights of its people to express their discontent with the current regime, which has resulted in at least 21 deaths and more than 450 arrests. It is, quite frankly, disturbing the way the Iranian Government has used its military might to show an unacceptable and a disproportionate amount of force to quell and to attempt to control protests. Additionally, Iran’s judiciary has disregarded the rights of protesters to express themselves and to peacefully assemble, by threatening harsh punishments. I have read reports that the 
government has blocked the Internet and social media services which, I believe, constitutes a violation of fundamental rights of free speech. People in Iran are suffering. Their economy is stagnant, and their wages aren’t keeping up with the costs of living. People are hungry, and they have grown weary of a radical and a corrupt regime set on sponsoring terrorism and pursuing an illadvised plan for nuclear capabilities rather than focusing on improving the lives and stability of the people and their nation. The people of Iran were hopeful that Iran would see some relief from the sanctions and would see economic improvement after their government entered into a deal in 2015 regarding its nuclear program. But because of widespread corruption and failed economic policies of Iran’s Government, as well as its failure to live up to its commitments to the international community, Iran’s people have only continued to suffer from poverty, high unemployment, and inflation. It should be no surprise to the leadership of Iran that its people are calling for change because of its failure and poor leadership that have led the people to protest. Mr. Speaker, I stand with those protesters in Iran who have lost faith in their increasingly failed government. They deserve a country that ensures their freedom to express disapproval. They deserve a government with equality and justice, to improve the lives of Iranians. Although Iran’s Government may, by force, ultimately be successful in putting an end to these public protests, this dissatisfaction with the regime will continue. I hope that someday the people of Iran will see the freedom and the kind of leadership they seek and they deserve. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO). Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. GARRETT , for organizing this on this important topic. Today, we passed several bills about Iran. One was H. Res. 676, calling out the Iranian regime to stop suppressing and oppressing their citizens who just want those things that are innate to all human beings on this planet, that we believe in as Americans, and that are those inalienable rights that come from our Creator: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Iranian people are staging legitimate protests to condemn the Iranian regime for corruption of the economy and funding of terrorist organizations while neglecting the basic needs of the Iranian citizens, only to have their protests in opposition of the corruption by the Iranian regime be shut down and crushed through unwarranted bloodshedding and arrests. If you look at the Iranian regime over the last 30 years since they took control of Iran, it has been nothing but bloodshed and mayhem. And if you look at the conflicts that we have been involved in in the Middle East since the entry of Afghanistan and the Iraqi wars, if you look at our servicemen and women who have been harmed in those battles or injured or died, 70 percent of those were caused by IEDs. Ninety percent of those IEDs were supported and produced by the Iranian regime. The people of Iran stood up in 2009. The administration of the United States at that time refused to back the Iranian people who wanted those basic rights that we just talked about: freedoms and liberties. Our Nation was founded on the idea that every individual is granted three basic rights: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And again, we, as Americans, believe in these inalienable rights. I find it appalling that the Iranian regime is using deadly force in order to deny the Iranian people their basic freedoms. We are in the 21st century in the world, and you see a clear divide: the Western ideologies that believe in these Godgiven rights that we have, and then you see the regimes and dictatorships around the world that are suppressing the very innate abilities that we are all born with. They are trying to suppress these innate abilities. By doing that, they do it through intimidation, coercion, torture, death. The leader of the IRGC came out in a statement, and it is in EDROYCE ’s resolution that we voted on today, H. Res. 676, that said they will investigate it, they will bring it to an end, and they will quash these protests and it will be done with. So that is the intent of the Iranian regime, to bring this to an end through force because they fear free thinking people. We are so blessed in our country of having the ability to speak out, to be able to protest peacefully, to assemble peacefully; and that is something I think sometimes we, as Americans, take for granted. This is something that all you have to do is look at what is going on around the world to see a despotic regime that is afraid of empowering its people. The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, must be recognized for what he is: the dictator of an oppressive regime which once again showed the world its true colors by its horrific response to the peaceful and legitimate protests that began on December 28, that saw thousands in prisons, with the leaders being threatened with death, and over two dozen having been killed. I want to send the message that we, the United States, support the rights of those brave Iranians who are peacefully protesting the oppressive Iranian regime; and they are peacefully protesting, again, for the right to pursue life, liberty, and happiness. Again, I want to thank Mr. GARRETT  for putting this on and thank him for allowing me to participate. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ). Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. GARRETT for organizing this Special Order today to shed light on what has been going on in Iran not just the last couple of weeks, but, really, since 1979. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out for the good people of Iran who are protesting against an oppressive regime that has imposed tyranny on them for nearly four decades. Scores of people have been arrested and some killed for daring to speak out against their government. Mr. Speaker, they have good cause. For far too long, the authoritarian terrorists of Tehran have pursued an aggressive military buildup and a massive police state that oppresses its people. Since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, their leaders have chosen global and regional conflict instead of promoting a healthy domestic economy and peaceful relations with their regional neighbors. I could spend a long time highlighting the litany of basic human rights violations of the regime as well, but the Iranian Government’s malfeasance, public corruption, and betrayal to their citizenry needs to be brought to light on the world stage. Mr. Speaker, as recently as last year, in the State Department’s annual Country Reports on Terrorism, Iran was once again identified as the foremost state sponsor of terror. The crime and terror Iran spreads are conducted at the expense of ordinary Iranians whose taxes go everywhere but to themselves and their prosperity. The unemployment rate is over 12 percent, according to the World Bank, and youth unemployment is staggeringly high. And all of this, despite Iran being rich in natural resources and having potential for having a great economy. Two years ago, the U.S. entered a deal in hopes of encouraging a more peaceful Iran, not to mention passing along billions in direct cash payments to them. Furthermore, if that wasn’t enough, it has been recently reported that the Department of Justice, under President Obama, abandoned a massive international narcotics investigation against one of Iran’s international terrorist clients, Hezbollah, just to not upset the Iranian regime during the negotiation of the nuclear deal. That is right, Mr. Speaker. Hezbollah is not just in the global terror business; it is a transnational criminal organization that is a major global drug trafficker, including right here in the Western Hemisphere and Latin America. For anyone who has not read the recent article in Politico Magazine, titled, ‘‘The Secret Backstory of How Obama Let Hezbollah Off the Hook,’’ it is worth your time. You will learn how Hezbollah is operating throughout Latin America and, indeed, facilitating the transfer of drugs into this country. Despite all of their contrition and dealmaking, the Iranian regime has 
not changed. This perilous regime is still exporting and smuggling weapons to its clients in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. Hezbollah and Iran continue to threaten Israel, among other nations, and are still a destabilizing force throughout the Middle East. After all of the Iranian regime’s terror, crime, and corruption, do you think the Iranian people would have benefited from this? Mr. Speaker, all you have to do is turn on the TV to see the Iranian people’s answer, and it is obvious that they have had enough. This kind of tyranny does not belong anywhere, especially in the 21st century. The everyday people in Iran want the same thing the average American wants: freedom to live without fear of their government, to live and work in peace, to be with their loved ones, and to worship as they see fit. The good people of Iran are standing up to tyranny, and we should stand with them. I want those protesters seeking freedom from oppression to know that we are with them, that the American people are with them. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. GARRETT , again, for organizing this Special Order on this very important topic. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD). Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GARRETT ) for organizing this in support of those protesters in Iran. It is the ongoing protests that started late last month in Iran that are significant not just for their people, but also for the world. While these protests started because of a dire economic situation in Iran, with upwards of 40 percent of its youth unemployed, it has grown to be a nationwide movement that is about much more than just the economy. Over the past couple of weeks, we have seen the Iranian people flood the streets in favor of fundamental freedoms, economic opportunity, and a government that represents their interests, not Hezbollah’s. There are even reports of people chanting, ‘‘We don’t want an Islamic Republic,’’ or, ‘‘We will die, but we will take Iran back.’’ This has been a long time coming. A State Department report in 2016 found that Iran is the top state sponsor of terrorism in the whole world. Whether it is providing financial support to Hezbollah or providing arms to Islamic rebel groups in Yemen, the Iranian Government’s priorities are obviously more focused on wreaking international havoc than they are on addressing the pressing issues within their own country. And while we are talking about issues with Iran, the protesters are pleading for fundamental freedoms. For example, married women aren’t even allowed to travel outside the country without permission from their husbands. They also risk being put in jail or even to death if they take off their hijab in public. But brave women throughout Iran have been unmasking themselves during the last couple of weeks in protest. To many in our country, this may seem insignificant, but videos of these women and their courage have been shared millions and millions of times around the globe. Mr. Speaker, those who dislike President Trump have criticized his approach to foreign policy, but these same people fail to praise his strong defense for freedom when it comes to Iran. As soon as the protests started, President Trump put out a statement that said the Iranian people are hungry for food and for freedom. He also said that it is time for a change, and I couldn’t agree with him more. This is the opposite of the Obama administration that preached moral authority and, yet, sided with the corrupt Iranian regime and the corrupt Iranian Government when antiregime protesters took to the streets back in 2009. So now that President Trump has proven his credibility on the global stage by siding with the protesters, the question is: Now, where do we go from here? Well, Mr. Speaker, first we should increase the sanctions on the Iranian Government in response to their crackdown on protesters for freedom in recent weeks. President Trump should also strongly consider pulling out of the nuclear deal that was struck by President Obama in 2015. b1730 We have already seen the Iranian Government break parts of the agreement, and we should have a zero tolerance for these breaks because the consequences are just too grave. Mr. Speaker, the people of Iran are bravely speaking out against their government and they are calling for change. For the United States to continue to be a shining example of freedom and liberty, we must continue to vocalize our support for these protesters in Iran and make sure that they know that we have their back. Again, I thank my colleague, Mr. GARRETT from Virginia. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for his remarks. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN ). Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding. I want the folks in Iran to know that the United States of America stands with the people of Iran. As a closed society, I doubt they will hear our words here tonight, but they should know that, in our hearts, in our prayers, and in our thoughts, we have the people of Iran and their best wishes in mind. I have been here for 7 years in Congress, and during that 7 years, Iran keeps coming up to the forefront; whether it is the Obama administration’s failed Iranian nuclear deal, which is coming up for authorization— I think on the 19th of this month, the 15th, the 19th—or if it is the protests, and since I have been in Congress, this is the second round of uprising protest against the Government within Iran. Now, the dichotomy is the Obama administration ignored the people in Iran. But the Trump administration has told the people in Iran: We stand with you against an oppressive government. Iran keeps coming up even in a Politico magazine article. They had a well sourced account of an alleged Obama administration scandal last month. This prompted review by the Department of Justice and interest by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The article alleges the Obama administration restrained classified efforts by the Drug Enforcement Administration to shut down an international criminal operation, Hezbollah. Now, Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, is a proxy of Iran. And when you hear Hezbollah, you might as well think Iran. They are one and the same. So I am deeply troubled by the idea that President Obama’s motivation was getting past by any means necessary his failed Iranian deal. He could not get anything in the way of that legacy. Now, if this article is true, President Obama is more concerned about passing his agenda item opposed by Members of both parties and a majority of the American people than protecting the safety of the American people. We all know about the pallets of cash that were given to Iran. Now, they could have spent it on their economy. They could have paid down debt. They could have done anything, but I would bet that the largest state sponsor of terrorism, the country of Iran, used the bulk of that money to continue funding terrorist operations around the globe. The number one recipient of Iranian help is Hezbollah. Now, let me bring you a little bit closer to home. In 2012, I authored a bill called Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012, signed into law by President Obama, directing the State Department to actually do an indepth study into the Iranian activities in the Western Hemisphere, specifically, South America. They did a halfway limpwristed report that even the 2014 GAO reported only 2 of the 12 requirements mandated in that law were fully addressed. The Obama administration acted in complete disregard to the law. Six others of my legislation were only partially addressed; four were not addressed at all. Meanwhile, the activity of Hezbollah in the Western Hemisphere continued, and it is continuing today. There is an area in South America known as the triborder region. It is where the borders of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay all come together. Some would even say it is a lawless act area. 
It is controlled by elements of Hezbollah. And two acts of terror happened in Argentina, in Buenos Aires. The 1994 bombing of the AMIA Jewish cultural center in Buenos Aires was the singlelargest loss of life from an act of terrorism in the Western Hemisphere prior to 9/11, believed to be hatched in the triborder region by elements of Iran and Hezbollah. It was sort of swept under the rug by the Argentine Government of Cristina Kirchner. But there was a brave individual, a special prosecutor named Alberto Nisman, who took this on his own to say: We know what happened at the AMIA. We know Iran was involved. He set out to prove it. He compiled massive amounts of data. And the morning before he was scheduled to testify in front of the Argentine Congress about his findings, implicating the Kirchner regime for hiding some of this because they wanted to coddle up to Iran—they wanted Iran’s help. They wanted to sell Iran nuclear technology, I believe. They wanted Iran’s help with money. The morning before Alberto Nisman was going to implicate the Kirchner regime for the AMIA bombing and hiding the facts from the Argentine people and the world with regard to Iran’s activities in that AMIA bombing in 1994, Alberto Nisman was assassinated in his apartment, even though he had multiple security personnel guarding him. Shot behind the ear. Now, the Kirchner regime tried to say that that was suicide. There was no gunpowder on his hands. And it has now been proven that it was not suicide, that it was an assassination, possibly by elements of Iran as well. I say all that to let the folks listening tonight here in America and around the world know that Iran isn’t just in the area in the Middle East known as Persia. They have elements, like Hezbollah, that are operating globally. Iran has said that they want to wipe the Big Satan and the Little Satan, Israel and the United States, off the map. They don’t have our best interest at heart. But as a free people here in the United States of America, I can tell you that we have the best interest of the Iranian people at heart. When we stand on this floor and we talk about the uprising, the protests that are going on in Iran now, we have the best interest of the Iranian people at heart, because we don’t stand to benefit in any way for us standing up for freedom, for folks who want selfgovernment, for folks who want less oppression, who want some sayso in their livelihood and how their government operates. That is what the Iranian people are talking about in these protests. So, unfortunately, the Obama administration and the State Department did not take the Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act very seriously. But Iran is here. They have opened cultural centers and embassies in Latin America. I don’t know the number right off, but they continue to be more involved here closer to home. There are no cultural ties, very limited economic ties between Iran and Latin America. So you have to question yourself as to why the Persians are here. You have to be aware that Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism with billions—hundreds of billions of dollars that we released to them, palletloads of cash that could find their way into terrorist organizations that don’t have America’s interest at heart. So I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia for giving us an opportunity tonight to focus on Iran; to focus on its proxy, Hezbollah; to focus on primarily the Iranian people in their quest for more freedom. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN ) for his remarks. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 21 minutes remaining. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ). Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr. GARRETT for yielding. It is important that we discuss what has been going on in Iran. I recall I was on Active Duty in the United States Army back when President Carter stood by and basically encouraged the taking out of the Shah of Iran. No prince according to his own conduct, but he made a statement welcoming the Ayatollah Khomeini back to Iran as what he called him, I believe it was a man of peace. He could not have been more wrong. There has been less peace because the Ayatollah Khomeini took over a state government, a national government, and a powerful military than any time since World War II. They have been the largest state sponsor of terrorism. They have, we have been told, probably provided most of the IEDs that have killed and maimed Americans fighting for freedom in the Middle East, especially in Iraq. They have worked to stir up trouble all over the Middle East, north Africa, and have created massive mayhem, and they are looking to do even more. And with the $100 billion or more that President Obama sent to Iran, they have been able to make more IEDs to kill more Americans, create more havoc, and stir up more sentiment against the United States since that unconstitutional sending under a treaty that was never ratified was done by the last administration. Some have blamed President Trump for the problems in Iran. That is a bit ridiculous. The problems are the radical Islamist leadership in Iran. In fact, the same people that would like to blame President Trump are some of the same ones who hailed the $100 billion sent under a treaty that was never ratified that would be used to kill innocent people around the world, including Americans. The people of Iran are to be congratulated for saying: Enough is enough. There is a great article from Commentary magazine titled: ‘‘What the Iran Protests Have Already Achieved.’’ Sohrab Ahmari says: ‘‘More than 1,700 arrests and at least two dozen deaths later, the Tehran regime seems to have suppressed Iran’s latest mass uprising. Scattered protests and skirmishes continue nationwide, according to the citizenjournalists who, braving regime violence, continued to post footage on social media. But for now, the demonstrations don’t seem to be growing in numbers or frequency. Yet outside observers tempted to write off the movement should recall that the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the Shah began decades earlier. There were lulls through the years, which tempted President Carter at one point to describe the Shah’s Iran as an ‘island of stability’ in the Middle East. ‘‘Whatever the ultimate outcome, however, the protesters have already accomplished a great deal and shattered many myths in the West. Let’s review their achievements: ‘‘First, the Iran protests showed that the people are not rallying to the regime under the press of President Trump’s hawkish rhetoric.’’ b1745 ‘‘Far from being ‘swept up in a wave of nationalist fervor,’ as The New York Times’ Thomas Erdbrink reported a few weeks before the uprising, Iranians still detest their corrupt, repressive regime. As my colleague’’—and this is the author, Mr. Ahmari, speaking— ‘‘Noah Rothman has noted on our podcasts, Americans have an almost religious conviction that world events revolve around the U.S. and specifically the White House. To be sure, America remains the most important Nation on the world stage. Yet the average Iranian doesn’t wake up in the morning cursing Donald Trump for trying to undo the nuclear deal. More likely, he curses the fact that he can’t even afford eggs to feed his children, and there are more proximate actors whom he blames for that: namely, the mullahs. ‘‘Second, the uprising revealed, once and for all, that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has been no moderate, and that the reformer versus hardliner distinction is meaningless. Ever since he came to power, Rouhani has been the subject of adulation among members of the Western foreign policy establishment. The media attached the ‘moderate’ and ‘reformer’ labels to Rouhani on the night of his first election, in June 2013, and refused to remove them even as evidence mounted that he was no such thing. There was Rouhani’s leading role in the violent repression of the 1999 student uprising; his support for the post2009 crackdown; his long record of antiAmerican rhetoric (‘the 
beautiful cry of ‘‘Death to America’’ unites our nation’); his decidedly immoderate cabinet; his work overseeing Iran’s campaign of assassinations targeting dissidents abroad; and much else of the kind. ‘‘But now Iranians themselves are plainly telling the West that Rouhani is no moderate. Their slogans—‘Not Gaza; Not Lebanon; My Life Only for Iran’ and ‘Let Syria Be; Do Something for Me’—are a reminder that Tehran has continued to underwrite terror and bloodshed across the Middle East during the 4plus years of Rouhani’s Presidency. The people have also been chanting, ‘Reformists; Hardliners; the Whole Game is Over.’ Let’s hope the same realization soon dawns in Washington and Brussels. ‘‘Third, the protesters put the lie to the Obama administration’s claims about the 2015 nuclear deal. Remember when senior Obama officials reassured Americans that Iran would use the sanctions relief under Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to improve the lots of its people? Here is how Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew put it in an April 2015 address: ‘Many Americans, and many of our closest allies, are understandably concerned that Iran will use the money it receives as a result of sanctions relief to fund terrorism and support destabilizing proxies throughout the Middle East. We share those concerns, and we are committed to maintaining sanctions that address these activities, even after Iran takes the steps required to get relief from nuclear sanctions. But it is important to note that the connection between nuclear sanctions relief and Iran’s other malign activities is complicated, and most of the money Iran receives from sanctions relief will not be used to support those activities.’’’ I would interject here he had absolutely, 100 percent, no basis for making such ridiculous statements. ‘‘Two months later, Colin Kahl, a National Security Advisor to thenVice President Joe Biden, told the Truman Center: ‘It is our assessment . . . that the Iranians are not going to spend the vast majority of the money on guns. Most of it will go to butter.’’’ I would insert here he had no basis whatsoever for making such statements. The article said: ‘‘Millions of jobless and impoverished Iranians now beg to differ. It turns out that the regime was happy to spend the JCPOA’’—the Iran treaty that was never ratified—‘‘funds on Hezbollah, Hamas, the Yemeni Houthis, and other nasties, even if that meant Iranians would go hungry. And those hungry people aren’t mistaken about the roots of their hunger. Iran remains the world’s top state sponsor of terror, according to the U.S. State Department. Deal opponents warned of this, only to be brushed aside by Obama and his media allies. The Trump administration now has an opportunity to correct course, by walking away from Obama’s bad deal. The American people are under no obligation to finance Iran’s terrorist statecraft. ‘‘The mullahs would have no one to blame but themselves. The Iranian people, defeated but unbowed, are sure to have another day.’’ So, Mr. Speaker, let me just add here: God bless President Donald J. Trump for recognizing the Iranian treaty for the horrible deal it was and is to peace in our time. He paid for war, he paid for terrorism, and it is time to stop it. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ), who is my good friend, for speaking. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ). Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to participate in this message to the Iranian people tonight and also a message that we will deliver to the American people as well. To those brave souls who are now in the streets to oppose the mullah dictatorship that now governs Iran, we send you this message: We are with you. We are thinking of you. You are within our vision. We are siding with you against tyranny. Do not think you are alone. The American people, our hearts and our souls, are with you; and, yes, we are proud of our President for making sure the world knows that we are officially on the side of those people who are struggling in the streets of Tehran, as we speak, to make sure that the mullah dictatorship is overthrown and replaced by a democratic government. These people have a right to democratic government just the same as anyone else. We talked about it in our Declaration of Independence. We talked about rights that are given by God to every individual, and that government only has those powers that are granted to it by the consent of the governed. Yes, we had our own revolution. Remember, the French helped us in that revolution. The French helped us win our freedom. We owe that to people who have helped us win our freedom to side with people who are struggling in Iran today and against other radical Islamic dictatorships today to help them create a more democratic society. In fact, as I look around in this Hall tonight, I see that there are only two pictures on the floor of the House. One is George Washington, and one is Marquis de Lafayette. Look into Lafayette’s eyes. This is a picture of a man who came to us 50 years after our revolution and was the ultimate American hero for helping us win our freedom. Are there tears in his eyes tonight? No. But there were tears in his eyes in the picture of Lafayette when we sided with the mullah regime during the last administration when we actually cut a deal with the mullahs keeping them in power, not giving any support to those who were struggling for democracy in order to give them $1 billion to get them to go along and sign up for a bogus arms treaty. Now, this President of the United States today has left those policies behind. We are proud of this President for what he is doing, and we send this message to the American people: We will stand for freedom, and we will be safe. If we cower and we don’t support those people struggling for freedom throughout the world, we will not be safe. Nowhere is that more evident than in the streets of Tehran tonight. People of Iran, we are with you, just as the French were with us when we won our freedom. We will make this a better world, we will make it a safer world for all people who believe in any type of democratic, open government. The mullah regime must be overthrown but by its own people, and we must be true to those patriots who established our own country by supporting those who are struggling for freedom in Iran. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I will conclude. If we were to spend 5 minutes on each of the individuals murdered by the Iranian regime since that regime took power some 39 years ago, we would be here 24/7 for over a year. If we were to name each country and spend 1 day where Iran and their proxies, such as Hezbollah, have taken human life, we would literally be here for months, 1 day per country. Mr. YOHOarticulated basic concepts of natural law, that people are endowed by their Creator with fundamental rights to include the right to life, the right to freedom, and the right to pursue happiness. Mr. DUNCAN , Mr. R OTHFUS , and Mr. ROHRABACHER spoke to the JCPOA, and the circumstances surrounding it, how our Nation turned its back on the multibilliondollar criminal enterprise wholly subsidized by Iran that is Hezbollah, making a bad deal, ignoring trafficking of deadly narcotics throughout the world and, indeed, in our own country to get a worse deal. I stand with my colleagues who renounce the JCPOA, and I would point out that it is my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the broad bipartisan opposition to the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which I have referred to repeatedly, and only somewhat jokingly, as the ‘‘Joint Comprehensive Piece of Something, JCPOS.’’ But if you want to see the JCPOA go away, the best way to do that is to empower the people of Iran to empower themselves, and that is why I thank my colleagues, one and all, for standing with me here today to speak loudly and clearly. Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that people watching at home will take to social media where the youth of Iran have fomented this revolution, that hashtags such as #freeiran, #iranprotests and #iran will pick up steam, that the world can communicate with those who risk their very lives to assert their basic, fundamental, and Creatorgranted rights of 
life, liberty, and the right to pursue happiness by showing them that we support them. Mr. Speaker, I would point out that Mr. GOHMERT so articulately spoke to the role of Rouhani in Iran and the fawning Western media that speaks to his role as a moderate. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Rouhani, quite literally, represents the mullahs, and so, as such, that would be as if suggesting that Mr. Goering or Mr. Goebbels was a moderate Nazi. There is nothing moderate about the leadership of this regime. So with this, I conclude: Americans have been killed by Iran or its proxies in this country, in Lebanon, in Iraq, in Kenya, and in Tanzania. People have given their lives at the hands of Iran in Australia, Argentina, Syria, Israel, Germany, the United Kingdom, in Tanzania, Malaysia, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. It is time for this to end. Enough is enough. I would quote Edmund Burke: ‘‘All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.’’ This time we will not stand idly by. Enough is enough. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
THE TAX SCAM AND THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to talk about a couple of issues here on the floor of the House. I really have two things I want to talk about today. One is the incredible tax bill that was passed by the Congress and signed by the President just before Christmas, a tax bill that has profound effects on the American economy, most of them negative and bad, but also a tax—I will use the word ‘‘scam’’—that will really—well, if you happen to be superwealthy, it is terrific. I guess, Mr. Speaker, the President, when he went to his Christmas party at MaraLago, spoke to his guests, most of whom I suspect were rather wealthy, and he said: I just made you a whole lot richer. Indeed, he did. So we will talk about that in a little more detail. I also want to talk about the ongoing Mueller investigation. On the floor of the House, from time to time, many of my colleagues from the Republican side come here to the floor, or on cable television, and attack Mueller, attack the FBI, and anybody else who happens to be standing nearby, in an effort to discredit the special counsel’s investigation of what happened in the 2016 Presidential election. It seems to me that here in America, since the very first days of our constitutional government, we have always said that we are a country of laws and that the laws dictate what we do. b1800 We are not a country of individuals that dictate what happens but, rather, a country of laws. What is happening here in this effort to discredit the Mueller investigation is to move away from that nearly century and a half of profound importance in how people govern themselves not by the will of an emperor or the will of a king or even the will of a President, but we govern ourselves by the laws that are enacted by elected representatives: Senators, Members of the House of Representatives, in the case of the National Government, or legislatures, county commissioners, county supervisors, or city council members. We are a country ruled by laws that are enacted by the citizens; however, the effort to discredit, to derail, to stop the investigation of the appropriate entity—in this case, the Department of Justice, acting through the special counsel—is contrary to the fundamental foundation of the way in which we govern ourselves. That is to say that that discrediting, that effort to stop the investigation of whether laws were broken, disobeyed, or not followed completely undermines the foundation of our government and our relationship as individuals. None of us want to be subject to the whims of an individual like a king or an emperor or a President. We want them—in this case, the President—to act through the law, that is, to follow the law and, in this case, an agency within the executive branch, the Department of Justice, to carry out its responsibility to determine if the laws have been followed, if there has been a breach of law, if there has been some other element that is contrary to the rule of law. It is that simple. So I would ask my Republican colleagues here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate and those who are constantly on cable television who are attempting to knock down the Mueller investigation, to discredit his investigation, to discredit the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies of the Federal Government to slow down, to stand back, and to let the operation that is fundamental to our wellbeing, that operation of enforcing the law to occur and see where it goes, let the investigation play itself out and not get caught up in questions of whether the Steele dossier was the reason for the investigation. It was not. Clearly, today, we have learned from Senator FEINSTEIN , whom I thank and whom all of us should thank, for making public the 10 hours of testimony from Fusion GPS available for all of us to see so that we can, as individuals, judge the validity of the charge that has been made that somehow the Steele investigation is all that this is about. It is not. It was not and is not. It is about information that came to the FBI from multiple sources, including counterintelligence information developed by our intelligence agencies. That then led to the investigation and eventually to the establishment of a special counsel. So take a deep breath. Let this process unfold. Let the facts lead the way. Let the development of those facts be done, and let us then judge the outcome of the investigation. It seems to me that a lot of the heat that has been put on the FBI and the Mueller team comes from a fear that there is something to fear. So the question should be asked: What is it that you fear? Why is it that you are doing so much to try to waylay, discredit, stop the investigation? Is there something that you know that the American public should know? Is there something that you fear that Mr. Mueller will find out about the 2016 Presidential campaign, about connections to Russia? Do you know something that would cause you to so aggressively try to stop the investigation? Perhaps you do, in which case, come to the floor and share with us. I will let it go at that. It just seems to me that we ought to recognize that we are a nation of laws. We are not a nation of a king or an emperor or of a President. We are a nation of laws in which the President’s task is to faithfully carry out the Constitution and the laws. If you don’t like the laws, come here and change them or go to the Supreme Court and get a ruling that somehow that law is not constitutional. That is the way we should do it. So enough of that. I have taken a few moments to look at this profoundly important issue about the very nature of government in the United States. Let me take up another issue, which I actually opened on for just a few moments, and that was tax policy. I have stood here on the floor before, many times, and talked about the tax bill as it was being developed, and I raised the alarm that somehow this tax bill would not be good for American families and working men and women in America. I always want to start this discussion with this placard. Those of you who have followed me on the floor may have seen it before, but I want to frame what I am concerned about. I want you to understand the scope of this discussion and why it is of concern. I found this to be an extremely useful way to frame my values and, I think, to frame the values of my colleagues in the Democratic Party. What is it that we want to accomplish? What is the value that we put forth? What is our goal? What are we trying to do with our public policy statements? What did we attempt to do with our unanimous opposition to the tax bill that the House of Representatives and the Senate passed and the President signed? This is the framework. If you would, this is the statement of values. It 
comes from Franklin Delano Roosevelt. That is actually etched in marble at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial here in Washington, D.C. These are his words: ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much.’’ Let me repeat that: ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.’’ For myself, and I know for my Democratic colleagues, this is the touchstone. These words are the touchstone about our policies, about the programs that we push forward. These words are the touchstone that give us a foundation upon which we then analyze the legislation and come to a conclusion to vote ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no.’’ In our analysis of the tax scam, we found that that legislation, now law, failed this test. It failed the fundamental test. Did that legislation help those who have little or did it add to the abundance of those who have much? The answer is this from the Joint Tax Committee: during the 10year life of this legislation, the result of the tax scam is that 83 percent of the $1.5 trillion goes to the top 1 percent. How can that be? How could it be that a piece of legislation that has been enacted and is now the law of the land will, over the next decade, shift more than $1.5 trillion to those who are already the richest men and women in this Nation, if not in this world? Why? Why would we add a king’s ransom—no, a national ransom—to those who already have 80 percent of the wealth of this Nation? Why would we do that? Why? Why would we ignore this test? We didn’t. We Democrats did not. We said ‘‘no’’ 186 times because it fails the fundamental test of fairness. We know across this Nation, it is in economic study after economic study, that America has concentrated wealth in the handful of the top 1 percent to an extent only seen once in America’s history before this time, and that was the Gilded Age at the turn of the 19th century. Never, other than now and then, did so few have such a high concentration of America’s wealth. Now, there are those who would argue that is a good thing because all of that wealth will be spent and trickle down to the rest of America. There is not one economic study anywhere that says that trickle down will actually happen; but, rather, what the tax scam bill does is to continue the concentration of wealth for the next decade. So what of the poor, what of the elderly, what of the students in school who are borrowing vast sums of money so they can get an education? What of the men and women who have been able to acquire a health insurance policy through the Affordable Care Act because they were able to have that cost of the premium subsidized? What of those people? The working men and women of America were dealt a very, very bad hand. But, Mr. Speaker, as the President said when he walked into his club for a Christmas party after signing the bill: I have made you so much wealthier. So here we are. We had meetings today with military. We need to build new nuclear bombs. We need to build new missiles. We need new ships. We need new tanks. b1815 Whether they do or not, you can debate, but there is an incredible demand for money from the military. By the way, we need to fight wars. We need to prepare for conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Need, need, need, we need—yes, they do need. Not all of it. I would disagree with much of it, but nonetheless, enormous demand. And in this tax bill, where is the money for that? Where is the money for the military? If you are a military hawk, ask yourself: Where is the money? It went to the top 1 percent and American corporations that already had $2.5 trillion of cash stashed away in their treasury. They didn’t need more money. They were not even investing what they had, yet they received even more as a result of this tax scam. So what is the purpose of all of this? Oh, did I mention that in this bill— for that family out there that was able to get health insurance for the first time so they could have a baby, so they could have an operation that they needed, so they can have continuing access to preventative care, do you know what was in this bill? Do my colleagues understand what was in this bill? Six, seven, eight million of our American families will lose their health insurance as a result of this bill, and all the rest of us are going to wind up paying anywhere from 10 to 20 percent more premium cost as a result of the language that was in this bill that restricts and literally guts the Affordable Care Act. A test of our progress. So what did the tax scam do? It shifted a king’s ransom—excuse me—a Presidential ransom to those who already have much, the top 1 percent. There you have it, 83 percent of it. And it purposely harms millions of Americans because they will lose their health insurance as a result of the language of this bill that guts the Affordable Care Act’s programs. How could it be? How could we do that? We Democrats didn’t. We said: No. This is bad public policy. Now, guess what. That was step one of what I like to call the Texas Two Step. Do you know what step two is? Step two is to suddenly wake up and realize: ‘‘Oh, my, we have just added $1.5 trillion plus interest, maybe another 3 or $400 billion of interest to the national debt. Oh, my goodness. We have to do something,’’ they say. In fact, it has already been said by our esteemed Speaker. Not the gentleman that is in the chair at this moment, but Mr. RYAN. He has already said: We have to take the next step now. We have to cut entitlements. Oh, my, the entitlements, we have to cut them in order to deal with the huge new deficit that was created by the tax plan. Wait a minute. Mr. Speaker, you just created the deficit and now you want to go after entitlements. Stop. Time out. Do we understand what an entitlement is? Do we know what an entitlement is? Let me tell you. Social Security. Medicare. Oh, we are talking about seniors. Social Security. Seniors. You mean we have got to cut entitlements, Social Security? Oh, Mr. Speaker, that is what you want us to do? You want us to cut Medicare? You are suggesting we do that by raising the eligibility age, not from 65, but maybe 67, 68. Terrific. And you just cut the ability for these people to get health insurance at the same time? How does that calculate? In my mind, it doesn’t. Did I mention Medicaid? You know those programs—Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, education— those are entitlements. That is what you want to cut? When 60, 70 percent of Medicaid goes to seniors, nursing homes, other disabled people, extended care, and nursing home facilities, that is what you want to cut? Guaranteed, as sure as I am standing on the floor at this moment, that is the second step. And I am not dreaming this up. These are the words of the Republican leadership in this House and in the Senate. So be prepared, America, there is a critical fight, an absolutely important fight that is taking place in your National Legislature, the Congress of the United States. It is about the very future of this fundamental notion. What are we here for? Are we here for the superwealthy, those who have much? Or are we here for the rest of America? I know where the Democrats are. I know why we are here. I know why we fight every single day for policies that address issues that help those who have little. We respect those who have much. They are wonderful people. Well, not all of them. But that is not our concern. They are doing quite well by themselves. It is those who have little. I see my colleague from New York has joined us. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES .) Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from California for yielding and for his forceful advocacy and brilliant articulation of 
the GOP tax scam and all that it represents. It really is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It is the ultimate hustle. It is nothing but a classic bait and switch. It is a fraudulent Ponzi scheme. The notion that this bill is designed to help benefit middle class folks and working families, those who aspire to be part of the middle class, is such complete fiction when 83 percent of the benefits of the GOP tax scam will go to the wealthiest 1 percent in America. We know that at least 36 million middle class families, if not more, will experience a tax increase. Medicare, as was just articulated, will be undermined, the deficit will explode, and our children and grandchildren are being asked to shoulder at least $1.5 trillion in additional debt to pay for tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, special interests, corporations, and big donors to our friends on the other side. Don’t take my word for it. There have been Members of this House who have indicated they needed to get this massive tax cut for wealthy individuals done or their donors would stop contributing. We didn’t say that. That is folks from this Chamber on the other side of the aisle when talking about the urgency of jamming this reckless tax scam down the throats of the American people. As the Congressman, the distinguished gentleman from California, just articulated, the whole premise that anyone other than the wealthy and the well off is going to benefit is built upon the fraud of trickledown economics, when there is absolutely no evidence that trickledown economics has ever done anything for everyday Americans. When Ronald Reagan cut taxes on millionaires in 1981, we didn’t get explosive economic growth. We got an explosion in the deficit. When George W. Bush cut taxes on millionaires and billionaires in 2001 and 2003, we didn’t get explosive economic growth. We got the Great Recession in terms of the legacy of the Bush economy. Then there was the socalled great Republican experiment in Kansas, where a Republican State Legislature and a Republican Governor massively cut taxes on the wealthiest, top folks in Kansas. And was there massive economic growth? No. We got prison riots, overcrowded classrooms, and crumbling infrastructure. Those are the facts. That is what so called trickledown economics has yielded, and now this fraud is being perpetrated on the American people. It is shameful. It is our children and grandchildren who are going to deal with the consequences of this highly partisan effort to benefit the wealthiest amongst us. It is a raw deal for the American people. We are going to offer a better deal for the American people; focus on better jobs, better wages, and a better future; focus on higher pay, lower cost; and giving the American people the tools to succeed in the 21st century economy by focusing on a real infrastructure bill, real training, real community college opportunity, real tax reform for middle class Americans and those who aspire to be part of it. I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding, for his leadership in this area, and I look forward to working together to deliver to the American people the better deal that they deserve. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. JEFFRIES very much for his remarks. If he can stick around, maybe we can have a colloquy here and discuss this a little better. Mr. JEFFRIES and his two colleagues, the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ) and the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS ), developed the Better Deal discussion, and I would like to talk about this in the context of infrastructure. Now, in the next couple of weeks, the President says he is going to deliver to the Congress his infrastructure plan. Well, we know across this Nation that we definitely need infrastructure. He just talked about it a moment ago. And the question will arise: How do you pay for it? This year, right now, the current fiscal year where we are talking about ‘‘can we fund government before it shuts down,’’ $150 billion was ripped out of the Treasury. It is gone for the wealthy tax cuts. So where do we get the money to pay for infrastructure? How do we do that? Here is my fear. My fear is that the wealthy 1 percent, top 10 percent, the big corporations have already got their big chunk of the pie, 83 percent of it. Where do you go to get the money? I think that the proposal coming from the President will be to tax fees on folks who are using the transportation system. And who are they? They are the American families. They are the people commuting to work on the trains or in the buses or in the cars. We need to think through how is it that we can do the infrastructure so there are better jobs, better wages, and better life for Americans? Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. JEFFRIES  to expand on the way in which the Better Deal proposal that we talked about can accomplish that transportation education. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, it certainly is the case that because of the GOP tax scam, because of the $1.5 trillion in additional debt that we, as a country, will now have to shoulder so that massive tax cuts can be provided to millionaires, billionaires, special interests, corporations, and big donors, that we are not necessarily in a position to responsibly fund the type of infrastructure plan that the Nation deserves to fix our crumbling bridges, roads, and tunnels. b1830 We believe, as Democrats, that the American people, in that regard, deserve a better deal, a better deal, again, focused on higher pay, lower costs, and the tools to succeed in the 21st century economy. One of the ways that you deliver better jobs is through a meaningful infrastructure plan that is appropriately funded, not on the backs of working families, middle class folks, and everyday Americans. It should be funded in an appropriate way. Those who can afford to pay should be paying their fair share. But we just went through a reverse Robin Hood process as it relates to this tax bill, and that is unfortunate. I am hopeful that we will proceed in a bipartisan way. The President has indicated that he thinks that would be an appropriate approach. We will see whether that is a genuine articulation of a way forward or not. But we cannot repeat the mistakes that were just attendant to the process of jamming this tax bill down the throats of the American people and jamming us in a way that will hurt everyday Americans. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for laying out the essential agenda of the better deal proposal that the Democrats are putting forth. There are many, many elements to this. He mentioned education. Infrastructure is a piece of it, medical care, research, and so forth. Staying with the infrastructure, the Democrats have proposed several different ways to pay for the infrastructure program. Two of those, or one big one, is now gone. American corporations held $1 trillion—I think, almost $2 trillion—of profits offshore. In the tax, bill that money cannot be retrieved. It is going into the coffers of the corporations if they bring it back to the United States, with a very small tax. One of the proposals brought forward by the Democrats was to repatriate, bring that money back to the United States and use it to support infrastructure, to use it to pay for immediate bonds, that we could then sell those bonds and use that money for infrastructure investment. That, of course, is gone as a result of the tax bill. There is another proposal that really, I think, dovetails with the extraordinary rampup of the stock market. A lot of that has to do with transactions, billions of transactions every day. A small fee of less than one onehundredth of a penny on each transaction would raise billions of dollars and go directly to deal with what is a problem in the stock market, and that is computerized gambling that goes on in the stock market. There are other ways that we have proposed to raise the money, but one of the things that I fear is that the President is going to come up with a plan that saddles working men and women of America with the infrastructure cost. 
Already, working men and women pay for most of the infrastructure. They are the ones who are driving the cars, paying the fees and so forth. This, we have to tackle. We need to do it in a bipartisan way as Mr. JEFFRIES has suggested, but we ought to do it in a way that tries to claw back as much of that unnecessary wealth that has been transferred to the superwealthy. I yield to the gentleman from New York. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I think that is exactly right. The gentleman’s concerns and suspicions are wellfounded based upon the approach that was taken by this Congress on the other side of the aisle in connection with the tax bill. So the individual tax cuts, to the extent that there are any that will be felt by the American people, are modest; the corporate tax cuts are massive. The individual tax cuts are temporary; the corporate tax cuts are permanent. The ability of individuals to take a State and local tax deduction has been decimated; the ability of corporations to use the State and local tax deduction on their corporate tax return is untouched. The moving expense deduction for individuals has been eliminated, but corporations can continue to take moving expense deductions for closing down a factory or a plant here in America and shipping those goodpaying American jobs overseas to China, India, or other parts of the world. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, did I hear the gentleman correctly that an individual who lost their job, for whatever reason, and moves to another State can no longer deduct the moving expense? Is that correct? Mr. JEFFRIES. That is correct. Mr. GARAMENDI. However, a corporation that decides to close that plant, that facility, that laid off that individual, and open a factory in China can deduct the cost of doing that? Mr. JEFFRIES. Absolutely. Mr. GARAMENDI. Something is radically wrong here. Mr. JEFFRIES. It is totally outrageous, and it is exactly why the gentleman’s concern about what our colleagues may be attempting to do with respect to the infrastructure bill is real. Because what we have just seen is an effort to massively transfer wealth from individuals and from everyday Americans to wealthy Americans and incredibly welloff corporations in ways that should never be possible in the United States of America. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I was reading the tax bill yesterday, which is not a good read, and I found a provision that was of particular interest to me. Back in the 1990s, I was Deputy Secretary for the Department of the Interior, and we were trying to deal with the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. We have also, since that time, had this little thing called the Deepwater Horizon. There has been a small 9 centsperbarrel fee that the petroleum industry has been paying for the cleanup of oil spills. The big ones, Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon, there was even more money as a result of the legal action taking care of them. Little oil spills in the rivers and lakes and harbors are cleaned up using that fee. It is about $400 million a year—small, but absolutely essential. In the tax bill, they eliminated that small fee, and it is a $400 million windfall to the petroleum industry. You go: Why would you do that? Who, then, is left to clean up? It is going to be the taxpayer in the State. Mr. Speaker, did the gentleman mention State and local taxes? He is from New York. I am from California. Perhaps the two of us can get in a bit of a rage that the tax bill forces Californians, New Yorkers, Pennsylvanians, and Illinoisans to pay a tax on a tax that they have paid. I yield to the gentleman from New York. Mr. JEFFRIES. Absolutely. And I found this sort of whole discussion of trying to punish taxpayers in California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, and Pennsylvania to benefit States in the Deep South or other parts of the country that already receive more from the Federal Government than they give in return to taxes to be outrageous, and this will just continue the inequity. New York regularly sends $40 billion more to the Federal Government than we get back in return, and they have just made a bad situation worse. The same for California. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, it is probably not really appropriate that we get into a rage about the way in which this tax bill purposefully harms contributor States and forces the taxpayers in those States to pay Federal taxes on the taxes that they have paid to the State governments. We could probably go on and on here for some time about the inequities and the harm that this tax bill does, and we certainly should. We should probably come back tomorrow and every day thereafter and tell the American people what has happened to them as a result of this tax scam. In doing so, I really want to thank the gentleman and his two colleagues for developing, within the Democratic Caucus, a set of proposals, legislative proposals, policy changes, that will give the American public a better deal. We can juxtapose that against the tax bill, which is a raw deal for the American working family, but the gentleman has developed a better deal. In the days ahead, I would love to join the gentleman and his colleagues juxtaposing the tax bill against the proposal that it is beneficial to working men and women in America, so perhaps we can do that. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would like to wrap up, I will follow him with a wrapup. I yield to the gentleman from New York. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I look forward continuing to work together for the gentleman’s advocacy. We will dissect this tax bill for the American people, continue to discuss it, expose its fraudulent nature, and also lay out in clear terms the better deal we are offering, focused on better jobs, better wages, and a better future. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank Mr. JEFFRIES , Mr. C ICILLINE , and Mrs. BUSTOS for developing the Better Deal program for our caucus. Mr. Speaker, I am going to end where I started. So, for the American people, I want them to know where we are coming from as Democrats: ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.’’ If you want to know where I am coming from, read that sentence. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ESTES of Kansas). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we keep hearing about action that needs 
to be taken on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. I have spent a lot of time down on our Nation’s southern border, and I was quite pleased, last year, when Border Patrol friends told me information indicated that, after President Trump was sworn in, the number of people coming into the United States illegally slowed to a trickle, that it was a dramatic decrease, and that continued for awhile. But, during the summer, as discussion about DACA started coming out, I was told, and, apparently, the numbers indicate, the surge began anew. What I have heard over the years is anytime anyone in Washington starts talking about amnesty, legalization of any kind for people who have come into the United States illegally, there is a fresh surge across our border. I have been told by border patrolmen, they hear people talking who have come in illegally—whether before processing, during processing, after processing, during the holding procedure, it is made very clear, since they are willing to come into the country illegally in violation of United States laws, that they want to get here before there is any legalization. And it makes sense, as I am told, that they are willing to come in in violation of U.S. law. They are also willing to say that they came in a previous time and, you know, backdate it, different identity, different date they came in, whatever is required in order to get legal status. b1845 I appreciate hearing from my constituents, I always do, and I appreciate getting the opinions and thoughts of constituents from my district, the First District of Texas. They are always welcome. In the last couple of days, I have gotten a stack of petitions in my office regarding a push to support what they are calling a clean Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals reform, but it raises some questions. The best I can tell by the words ‘‘clean bill,’’ they mean one that provides amnesty with no strings attached. However, all these petitions have been provided, actual names and addresses are only on a handful of them, many have names written in the same handwriting in ink, and there are numerous unsigned blank petitions in the stack we were provided. In addition, I want to point out that, every time DACA legalization is mentioned, we have greater surges of people into our country illegally; and every time there is a surge, there are people who die trying to get into this country illegally, bodies found. We have the reports of a dramatic number of young girls, even some boys, who are pulled into sex trafficking, drug trafficking, as a way to pay off their debt to the drug cartels that control the area of the border that they were allowed to come across by the gang that brought them across. It should be noted, every young person in America has dreams. The best way to achieve the greatest number of dreams for the greatest number of people in the United States is if we enforce the law across the board fairly. I keep being amazed, and I have asked questions at our hearings: So why did these people come into the United States illegally? Well, because there are more jobs and opportunity. No, but why did they leave where they left, where they fled? Well, there was no opportunity there. Why was there no opportunity? Why were there no jobs there? Well, there is so much corruption. They don’t enforce the law fairly. So what we are being asked to do, instead of using political efforts to get these countries that people have fled to fix their political system, we are supposed to change our laws here so that those who have been working—I have helped some people 17 years trying to get into the country legally—they will be treated unfairly, because they have been trying to do things legally, in favor of people who violated the law to get here. It kind of seems like we are being asked to become the kind of country they fled, where the law is not enforced fairly across the board. It sounds like the ultimate irony. Until our border is made secure, we should not be discussing passage of any legalization bill. We should stop talking about legalization until the border is secure. When the border is secure, then we can work things out. It is so ironic to me, the very people who are demanding a big amnesty, legalization, whatever you want to call it, say, ‘‘We don’t want a wall, we don’t want the border secure,’’ which means we will have to come back and have this discussion in the next couple of years all over again. It was supposed to have ended in 1986. We will get border security in return for the amnesty. We got the amnesty, and we didn’t get the border security. I am joined by a friend, a very dear friend, who wrote speeches for his hero, a hero of mine, Ronald Reagan, who knows very well what happened in 1986. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ). Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also want to thank Mr. GOHMERT for the great courage that he has had on this issue, the fact that he has been willing to speak up for something that the establishment in this country is trying to shut us up about, trying to put blinders on the American people about what is going on and how we are losing our country. I was there with Ronald Reagan, and, yes, he was sold a bill of goods in 1986. He was told there were 3 million illegals in the country; and that is what we are going to do, we are going to legalize their status. He had a good heart, Reagan had a wonderful heart, and he saw these people were being exploited and living in the shadows. Three million people, you could take care of that, but the agreement has to be that we are now going to control our borders. Of course, back then, there was never even any question about whether someone who is here illegally should be getting a government benefit or be able to be treated just like a U.S. citizen, that wasn’t even in the works, but Ronald Reagan said: Okay. We will secure the border, and then we will make sure that we take these 3 million people and save them. Instead, how did it end up? The border security was done not even halfheartedly. We ended up, when all was said and done, with not 3 million people, but 11 million people who eventually came here based on that amnesty program. Well, today, it is a lot worse what we are facing. Today, the American people are being told a lie. Maybe someone is not just lying directly to them, but they are feeding them a false image of what the issue is today. How many people have heard about the DREAMers, these wonderful young people, yes, who came here at an early age? The American people are not being told what we are talking about when we talk about the DREAMers. Most Americans think we are talking about 25,000 or 30,000 kids at the most. That is what most Americans think we are talking about. What we are talking about is 850,000 young people, who, yes, have dreams, and most of them are fine young people, I am sure, but they are here illegally, they have been brought here illegally by their parents, and they want their status legalized. What will that do? 850,000 young people, not 25,000, almost a million young people, and all right, what will happen when they are legalized? Well, what we are not being told is, as soon as they are legalized, they then have the rights of everybody else, as anyone who is residing here legally should, and, thus, they are eligible for family reunification, and their families that are now being brought in from other countries then have the right to bring in their families. So we have a family reunification that creates a snowball effect and millions and millions more. Then, of course, we also have, with the legalization, the eligibility for government benefits, which, as I say, during Reagan’s time, there wasn’t any question you are not going to give benefits to illegal immigrants. Well, now we find illegal immigrants receiving education and healthcare benefits just as if they were American citizens. In California, they have even treated criminals as if they are citizens, setting up sanctuary cities and sanctuary States. Let me note that, with free education and free healthcare, there is no limit to the number of people around the world who will want to come here. By the way, there is no securing the border as long as we are giving education and 
healthcare benefits to people who have come here illegally. In fact, what we are talking about now is basically opening up major, major expenditures in our budget, that right now we can’t afford even to take care of our own people, yet we are going to have an obligation not just for these 850,000 young people, but all of the people whom they will bring in as well, not to mention the millions of other young people throughout the world who will say: My gosh, if I could get there. And mothers and fathers throughout the world: We have got to get our child there so they can get the education and healthcare that is being provided to young people even when they come there illegally. Now, let us note, for funds for our education system, our own young people are suffering from a lack of funds for their education; we lack money to have a very good healthcare plan for our people, yet the millions of other people who have come here illegally, we are going to let them drain that money and invite millions more people to come here from overseas. This is the most dishonest debate that we have had. That whole concept of having millions and millions more coming in because of DACA, the DREAMers? No, no. This is being kept out of the debate; this isn’t going to be part of America’s vision of what is going on. The idea that we now have veterans whom we cannot afford to take care of, we have children of our own people whom we cannot afford to educate, we have seniors whom we are trying to take care of, all of these are expenses that we have, and we are already in the hole, yet we are going to take care of millions of other people who have come here illegally, starting with the DREAMers? There are not just 10 million, by the way, 11 million people here illegally. Let me be clear. We have got, I am guesstimating, 20 million, but I bet there are other people who are much more sophisticated in their analysis than I am on this who say it is even more than 20 million people who have come here illegally. So what happens? We are draining our resources for people who have come here illegally. What does that mean? We don’t care enough about our own people. That is what we are really saying. Those people are more important than our own people. Then, of course, you have the fact that people are coming here, and, yes, they are ablebodied, yet they still get education and healthcare, but they get jobs, and, yes, they bid down the wages of people at the lowest end of our spectrum. I used to be an ice cream scooper at Marineland snack bar. That is what I did when I was in high school. I scooped ice cream. You know what, those jobs now, what we have got are people who have gone into those jobs so that in order to get people to work for them, they haven’t had to increase the wages of the people at that level. And if they have increased wages, they haven’t increased the wages as much as they would have had to had they not had groups of people there who say: I will do that work at half the price. Something else I was, I was a janitor in college. I was a janitor, and I cleaned toilets. There is nothing wrong with anybody, whatever work they have got. We know that we respect every working person in this country. Yes, I cleaned toilets, and guess what? I looked back a few years ago and found that the salary, the wages, of people who clean toilets has not gone up, the janitors are not making more money. Now, why is that? Are we saying that people who work at lowly jobs aren’t worthy of having a pay raise, they shouldn’t benefit? The income of our Nation now is three or four times higher than it was, yet those people in the lower scale have not been going up with that. The main reason is those lowly jobs that they get, they have been bid down, the salaries have been bid down by this massive flow of illegals. Now, if we care about our people, we have to ask: What is America? America is not one race, not one religion, not one ethnic group. America is a country in which we believe in freedom and we have come from every ethnic group and race in the world. What makes us Americans, then, is that we have to care for each other. We are an American family, but that being an American family means we must take care of those people who are less fortunate in our country before we spend and even borrow more money in order to take care of the needs of people who have come here illegally. Let us just note the worst part of this whole debate is that Republicans and others who are concerned about this are being labeled like we are anti immigrant. Well, in fact, we know that immigration is an important part of our country. b1900 But this is the greatest lie of all because we believe that our country has been prospered by having a legal immigration system. We, in fact, take in a million legal immigrants a year. So anyone who is thinking about this should think about it. That represents more legal immigration into our country than all the other countries of the world combined, allowing people to immigrate into their country, all the other countries of the world. Yet, because we don’t want to destroy this system, we don’t want it to go out of control, we are being labeled as antiimmigrant, even though we sing praises for those people who have come here legally. In fact, the people who are the most antiimmigrant are the ones who mix the title ‘‘illegal’’ and ‘‘legal’’ together. And what we have got now is the worst possible outcome in that we have limited resources being drained away from our own people of every race, religion, and ethnic group, and jobs that are being bid down by illegals; and everyone, including legal immigrants, are being hurt. But what we have now is a recognition that we cannot even enforce the law. We have sanctuary cities in which criminals are being kept from being arrested by Federal agents. What is that all about? Who do we care for? Now we are saying our police can’t even protect our families; and that if there is some criminal gang from another country that comes here, that we are going to have a sanctuary State or a sanctuary city for these people. This is absolutely ridiculous. It is a horror story, and it is up to us to alert the American people that we are losing our country. We are losing our country. And when I say ‘‘our country,’’ us, United States is us, every race, every religion, every ethnic group. Let us care for each other. Let anybody who is saying we care more about someone who is coming here illegally from another country, I don’t care how old they are, their children, yes, are less important than our children. Those people’s wellbeing, yes, are less important than the wellbeing of all Americans, whatever their status in this society. We need to make sure we make that clear. And DACA, if we bring in 850,000 young people and encourage millions more to come in by doing that, we have betrayed the interests of our own people, and they are looking to us to protect them. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman personally witnessed what happened after the amnesty of 1986. President Reagan rightly said that we can’t have an amnesty unless we have proper border security. They put it in the same bill. They got the amnesty and there was no followup. Let’s say we want to do the best to help young people, the world over. My friend here has already illustrated what happens. There are rules for radicals. You want to bring down the United States, apparently you bring as many people into being totally reliant on the government, so you bankrupt the government, destroy the government. That is how you eliminate the greatest, most representative government in the history of the world. Then what happens to young people around the world when there is no America to stand up against repressive regimes? What happens? Who is benefited by bringing down the United States by overwhelming our system, running the $20 trillion debt up much higher? Who is benefited? Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I believe that there are people who, with sinister motives, are trying to destroy the United States of America. They are 
there. There are people out there who hate us for what we stand for. They have always hated America. We have been what stood between the forces of evil on this planet for 200 years now. If it wasn’t for our guys—my mom and dad left North Dakota, these small farms—out to fight in World War II, we saved the world from Nazism and from Japanese militarism. And then during the Cold War, we stood firm until communism—that evil that wanted to create atheistic dictatorships throughout the world, thinking that that is going to cleanse us from our profit motive, the idea that we are going to change human nature but we are going to establish dictators and dictatorships and murder millions and millions of people, we defeated that evil. We held firm until it had a chance to collapse on its own. Now we face radical Islam, which is not a force, by the way, that—it is a powerful force. There are Muslims who hate us. There are Muslims who love us as well. But there are Muslims who hate us, who have lots of money and lots of oil. We cut deals with them, so they have lots of money and resources. And what did they do? They have financed terrorism to try to terrorize us into retreat. They hate America. They hate America. These are forces. And there are still forces in the world today that hate us, and that group is applauding when we lose control of our borders. And you know darn well the terrorists of this world have seen those open borders to the South, and the terrorists are among us. But we also have lost control of what you are talking about; that loss of control will destroy our chance to have an economic activity that succeeds in establishing a currency and a system in which prosperity and a good life for ordinary people can exist. No, it is going to go down unless we stop this massive flow. And the massive flow is already gone, but it will become a flood of people if we send the message: Kids who get here get free education, free healthcare, legalized status, and they will bring their parents in. We will have tens of millions of more people flooding our country. I can’t agree to that. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman and I have been to Iraq a number of times together, to Afghanistan, to different places in the world. It seems pretty clear, after our effort to create a democratic republic in Iraq, that if a nation’s people have not been properly prepared and educated to maintain a democratic republic, they won’t keep it. It seems pretty clear from the places we have been together. I will never forget Christian friends that I made in west Africa, who sat me down at the end of the week and said they wanted me to understand that they were so thrilled when we elected our first Black President. But since he was elected, they said: We have seen America get weaker and weaker, and we wanted to make sure you took a message back to Washington that we are Christians, we know where we go when we die. But our only chance of having peace in this life is if America is strong. I will never forget those words. They said: Please stop getting weaker. We suffer when you are weaker. And most of the people who are pouring across the United States for a better way of life, they are not coming to weaken us. They are coming with their own hopes and aspirations. But I ask: What would be better? What better neighbor would we be to continue until so many come in, our system fails and goes bankrupt, as California is doing now? Or would we be better to say: Let’s build a wall where it is necessary. Let’s totally secure our border. Let’s cut off the 70 to $80 billion that is flowing from the United States into the drug cartels of Mexico, that allows them to corrupt the Government of Mexico and the local governments and terrorist people and put police heads on stakes to terrorize us. Let’s cut off that 70 to $80 billion, however much it is. Let’s totally secure the border. And people who love their Mexican heritage are—other countries in Central and South America, they love their heritage, but they can’t make it. Why don’t we help cut off the corruption by cutting off the flow of money out and drugs into our country? Why don’t we work on that? Wouldn’t that be a better neighbor to our friends to the South? There is no reason Mexico is not one of the top 10 economies in the world. They have got the wonderful people, hardworking folks. They have got the resources. They have got a fantastic location. There is only one reason that they are not, and that is because of the corruption that their drug cartels bring from U.S. money flowing into Mexico. Maybe we would be better off helping all of those millions of people who want to come here by helping them be a country that is one of the top in the world. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, establishing the rule of law here will not only protect our own people, will not only make sure that our own less fortunate people are bid into lowpaying jobs so that people who work as janitors, as I did, and as decent people are doing now, that their wages aren’t bid down; they can live a decent life so their families can live with some security here. So by doing that, we will also take away this major instability that we are creating throughout the world by not obeying the rule of law. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I so much appreciate my friend. I don’t like to use ‘‘colleague’’ with DANA ROHRABACHER because he is so much more than that. He is a dear friend and a brother, and I will treasure most of the times that we have spent together in traveling, trying to do right for the United States and the world. One other thing, Mr. Speaker, I want to touch on before we finish up, and that is the issue that is coming, we are told, this week, regarding Section 702 reauthorization. We are told that the folks in the deep state have made very clear they want what they call a clean reauthorization. Nothing clean about it when you look at how 702 is spent. So just spend a couple of minutes here, based on an article entitled ‘‘How the FBI and DOJ Intelligence Units Were Weaponized Around Congressional Oversight’’ from January 8, 2018. It goes through this scenario. Sometime in early 2016, Admiral Rogers—talking about Admiral Mike Rogers, not the MIKEROGERS that was here in Congress—became aware of an ongoing and intentional violation of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Section 702 surveillance, specifically item 17, which includes the unauthorized upstream data collection of U.S. individuals within NSA surveillance through the use of ‘‘about inquiries,’’ where they do a surveillance of someone foreign, capture American citizens, which would violate our Fourth Amendment rights, except that those names are masked and, supposedly, all kinds of efforts to protect that, so it is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, supposedly. But this article points out that they get all of these conversations in the database, and then they can do inquiries about people, subjects, and capture that information about Americans, basically allowing them to get around the Fourth Amendment. Mr. Speaker, I commend this article. We see what occurs when we don’t have proper oversight. And Section 702, as being proposed, does not give us the proper oversight, and I hope that we will look further at that. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
b1915 MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION CRISIS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) for 30 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I stand with so many of my colleagues today in a call to action for this body to address a crisis that is at its breaking point for pensioners across our country, retired workers, who have come from the building trades, miners, truck drivers, so many more—actually, hundreds of thousands of Americans—losing their pensions or about to lose them. Millions of American retirees have worked and earned pensions that they contributed to through the multiemployer pension programs. In fact, I met one retiree recently who paid over 
$225,000 into his plan and has not been able to access one penny—not one penny. Yet hundreds of these plans face serious financial shortfalls, leaving millions of retirees facing an uncertain retirement future. For today, Congress needs to step up and secure the pension benefits these workers have earned. And there should be no pension cuts for workers who contributed to their own plans and should have a right to the money that they invested. Congress can no longer kick the can down the road. There simply is no more time. This problem does not go away if Congress continues to ignore it. Rather, the financial stress mounts for the retirement funds and, of course, for the retirees and for their families so severely impacted. Indeed, the costs the Federal Government will bear if we don’t solve this problem now become exponentially more significant as time ensues. Over the last 4 years, I have heard extensively from retirees forced to ride this terrible economic roller coaster. It is almost like a corkscrew, right side up, upside down. They are caught in this as their retirement security careens out of their control through no fault of their own. There are thousands, tens of thousands of Americans who did everything our country asks of its productive citizenry, retirees who worked for decades for a company and thought they would have a secure retirement but now they face a stark reality. From Toledo, Ohio, such retirees as Carol Jones, who drove a truck for over 30 years and who missed holidays and major life milestones because of his work on the road, the knowledge that he was earning a pension helped in those moments, but now he says it all feels like a pipe dream. And when you drive a truck for over 30 years, things happen to your knees; they happen to your back. Bouncing over concrete for three decades has severe costs for so many. But if a solution is not passed now, Carol won’t even be able to continue to care for his disabled daughter. Or how about Ernest Frye, a teamster for 54 years? He and his wife currently can live on what they earned through his pension, but, with its threatened cuts, everything will fall apart for them. They will have to rely on the government to cover the difference. And with the rising cost of medical expenses, they run the risk of also losing their home if his pension is cut. What kind of cruelty is this? Or how about Cindy Grimley, who was hired in 1978, and has taken pride in being able to take care of herself? Even with the pension she earned and lives on, she cannot afford medications her doctor tells her she needs, and she can’t afford to lose a single dollar of her promised pension. Or how about Tom Brady, who worked 30 years—30 years—with Roadway Express and is a Vietnam veteran? He faced a 50 percent cut under the Central States Pension Fund application. They call it MPRA. Any cut to his pension won’t only impact him. He has six grandchildren and seven great grandchildren whom he and his wife help support. I hear countless stories across this country of how retirees are caring for children with disabilities, supporting their own ill and aged parents, or supporting children and grandchildren with life expenses. These cuts impact more than just the individual who earned the pension. And, really, don’t these workers who retired have a right to the money that they put into these plans? You know, there were hundreds of companies that walked away from their pension promises. They didn’t keep their promise to the workers. The workers put their money in, and some of the companies walked away. Is it the worker’s fault? Ask any retiree or responsible economist, if we fail to fix this pension crisis, we will create a tremendous deficit to our economy both locally and nationally. Some retirees already live under the financial constraint of us not solving this challenge, and some have already had 70 percent cuts to their pensions. For example, Ironworkers Local 17 in Cleveland. How about the New York State Teamsters? How about the United Furniture Workers pension and the International Association of Machinists Motor City pension? They have all seen that decisions were made forcing cuts upon their retirees. And millions more live on that precipice: money that should be coming to them because they earned it, they put it away, and then it was taken away. This House has continued to let these retirees down. There has not been a single hearing to fully understand the financial plight confronting retirees. How irresponsible is that for the leadership of this House? The Senate has only taken a bit of action, but no solution. Immediately after the House passed the scam pension bill a few years ago— that is the original Multiemployer Pension Reform Act—I set to work to correct the unfairness that it allowed, and we introduced the Keep Our Pension Promises Act, which, back then, had the number H.R. 2412. We called it KOPPA. It would have prevented these draconian cuts to earned pensions by filling the financial gap of many of these plans, such as the Central States Pension Fund, and reinstate the anti cutback provisions that are contained in the ERISA legislation, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The bedrock of that law was that, if workers work and they put money aside for their pensions, that pension money will be there for them. But our bill lacks sufficient bipartisan support. So back last December, it was very reassuring for me to stand with my colleagues Representative RICHIE NEAL of Massachusetts and, from the other body, Senator SHERROD  BROWN as we introduced the Butch Lewis Act, H.R. 4444 and S. 2147. In the House, this legislation now has two Republican cosponsors, and I hope many more of our colleagues’ support will follow. But there is not time to recruit cosponsors one or two at a time. Retirees across our country are waiting for true leadership to push an equitable solution so they aren’t led to the guillotine on their pensions. It is time for real congressional leadership to identify the impact this crisis will have and organize an effort here either to create a new bipartisan solution or pass the already bipartisan Butch Lewis Act. If we fail to act, we can no longer wonder why the middle class is angry at Washington and this Congress, for they see this as just another broken promise by Washington. We can no longer wonder why they believe the system is rigged, because here are more than a million honest Americans who worked for a living decade after decade. They worked hard. They followed the rules, and now they are getting thrown under the bus. The companies they worked for reneged on their promises. And you know what? Unless we do something, the promise under ERISA will remain unfulfilled, and that is their pension security. I would say to my colleagues, if you ever wonder why tens and tens of millions of Americans are angry and deeply disappointed or feel betrayed by their government and the companies they worked for, look no further than this issue. I remember one man who didn’t come from my State, but I met him here in Washington. He said: Congresswoman, I earned and put away $225,000 in my pension plan, and they told me I had to work 20 years. So I drove 20 years, drove a truck 20 years. And he said: I started to have back problems. And when I got to my 20th year and I made it through, I said to them: Well, I am ready to apply. And the company said: You know what? We changed the rules. You have to work 2 more years. So he said: Two more years? Okay. So he made every effort that he could under great pain to work those 2 years up through his 22nd year of employment as a driver, and then at the 22nd year, the company said: You know what? We changed the rules. Now you are going to have to work an additional 3 years. Imagine having promises broken all the time. And now he is disabled. He has difficulty standing, sitting. He has pain all the time. And he has not been able to gain access to a penny of money that he earned. Surely, if someone at the White House is listening to this, if you think about President Trump’s travels through Ohio when he talked to the miners and he sought their vote, or in Chicago with those who drove a 
truck and paid into the Central States Pension Fund, the promises that were made, surely we can find a way to help keep the pension promises that these workers earned. I want to thank all of the Members who cosponsored our former bill, the Keep Our Pension Promises Act, and the Butch Lewis Act, and I thank Members of both parties for trying to find a solution, a real solution, for this crisis. We are moving toward it. We really don’t have any time to waste because Congress must reach a solution early this year, and we should look no further than including that pension relief in the upcoming spending deal that is being negotiated between the White House and this Congress now. Pensions now. Pensions now. These workers have earned their pension. Why has the government of the United States made it so difficult and made their retirement years so stressful by not reaching a solution to date? I make a strong appeal on behalf of over a million workers across this country who so justly earned the pension benefits that they deserve. I thank my colleagues who are listening. I thank the American people for writing us and for sharing their personal stories with us. I have great hope, in these final negotiations on a spending bill for 2018 which is currently under negotiation at the highest levels, that this pension issue finally will be resolved.

PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer: Let us pray. O God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come, enter the lives of our lawmakers today and give them pure hearts. Enlighten and illuminate their minds that they may know You, who are the way, the truth, and the life. When they are tired, refresh them; when they are lonely, cheer them; when they are tempted, strengthen them; and when they are perplexed, guide them. Lord, help them so to live that they will be prepared to see Your face in peace. Make our Senators positive people who are expectant of Your best for our Nation and world. Radiate Your hope through them so that America will remain a shining city on a hill. We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
