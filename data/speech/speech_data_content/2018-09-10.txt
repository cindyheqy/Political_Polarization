HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE HONORABLE LAWRENCE DENARDIS, PH.D. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 10, 2018 Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to the life of an outstanding member of our community, and my good friend, the Honorable Lawrence DeNardis, who passed away earlier this week. Larry was an extraordinary human being whose good work touched countless lives in many ways. He will be deeply missed by all of those fortunate enough to have known him. Larry served in public life where he demonstrated a unique commitment to public service. He served five terms in the Connecticut State Senate as well as one term in this body as the United States Representative for Connecticut’s Third Congressional District. After his term in Congress, Larry went on to serve as the Acting Assistant Secretary for Legislation at the United States Department of Health and Human Services. He was also appointed by former President George W. Bush as a member of the Board of Regents of the National Library of Medicine—a position which he held for four years. Larry spent much of his life as an educator and administrator in higher education. Long before either of us were involved in politics, Larry served for sixteen years as the Associate Professor and Chairman of Political Science at Albertus Magnus College, where he hired me to teach a course on international politics. He was also Visiting Professor of Government at Connecticut College, Guest Scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institution, and seminar instructor at Yale University. At the close of his professional life, Larry served for over a decade as President of the University of New Haven and under his leadership and direction the University truly prospered. I have often spoke of our nation’s need for talented, creative educators, willing to help our young people learn and grow—Larry was just that kind of teacher. His good work and diligent efforts to provide a quality education touched the lives of thousands of young people—going a long way in providing them with a strong foundation on which to build their futures. It is not often that you find an individual who so willingly dedicates himself to the betterment of his community. In addition to his professional contributions, Larry has worked with numerous local business and service organizations aimed at providing a better quality of life for the residents of the Greater New Haven area. We may have come from different political viewpoints, but I could always count on Larry to provide insight or guidance when I asked. I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with him and to call him my friend. Larry was many things to many people, teacher, community leader, friend, and mentor, but first and foremost, he was a husband, father, and family man. My deepest sympathies go out to his wife, Mary Lou; his four children Larry, Jr., Gregory, Mark, and Lesley; family, friends, and colleagues as we remember Lawrence DeNardis and the inspiring legacy of service he left to us all. 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 10, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. James Norlyn Hoff and remember his rich and full life. Mr. Hoff was born in Portland, Oregon and spent his early years in Tillamook and Grand Pass, Oregon. His family moved to Eureka, California when he was twelve years old. Mr. Hoff graduated from Eureka High School and then interned for California Assemblyman Frank Belloti in Sacramento, California. He followed this experience with a second political internship in Washington, D.C., where he worked for Congressman Don Clausen. Mr. Hoff graduated from Humboldt State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. He was the first Northern Californian to receive the Graduate Fellowship from the Rotary Foundation of Rotary International for the 1972–73 academic year. He was sponsored by the Rotary Club of Eureka and spent the year studying political science at the University of Grenoble in France. When he returned to Eureka, Mr. Hoff worked for Simpson Timber Company, where he ran their plywood plant. He eventually moved to Seattle, Washington to work in the company’s corporate office. After he spent several years working at the company’s corporate office in Seattle, Mr. Hoff left to work at his father’s radio station, KRED–AM, in Eureka. He also built and ran a radio station, KPDJ–FM, and became known as the local media giant. In 1989, Mr. Hoff started Hoff Outdoor Advertising, which he eventually sold to his mentee. Mr. Hoff met his wife Claire in Meg `eve, France when he went back to visit her parents. Two years later they met again when she was visiting the United States. They were married in Eureka in 1979 and had two beautiful children, Alexia and Henry. His son Henry currently serves in the active duty Army assigned to the 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division as a Staff Sergeant. Mr. Hoff enjoyed skeet shooting in his free time and won many father and son competitions. Mr. Speaker, James Norlyn Hoff is the husband, father, businessman and community member we should all strive to be. It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor him here today. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LUDLOW LIONS CLUB 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 10, 2018 Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and congratulate the Ludlow Lions Club on the occasion of its 75th anniversary. As the world’s largest service club organization, Lions Club International is full of members who volunteer their time to humanitarian causes, fundraising projects, and service endeavors not only in their local communities but also around the globe. The Ludlow Lions Club, chartered in 1943, certainly embodies this commitment to helping those in need, wherever need exists. The Ludlow Lions Club is one of the busiest clubs in Massachusetts and currently has over 30 members who give their time freely to help others. Their leadership, dedication, and exemplary character is undoubtedly worthy of 
recognition. Over the past 75 years, the Ludlow Lions have devoted themselves to a near countless number of diverse ventures and fundraisers, including annual food drives, college fundraisers, diabetes awareness campaigns, environmental conservation activities, emergency sight and hearing projects, and various youth development programs like the Peace Poster Project to just name a few. It is evident that the Ludlow Lions Club has made numerous positive contributions to the community of which it takes pride in being an integral part. I am confident that they will continue to serve and represent western Massachusetts with honor and distinction for years to come. Mr. Speaker, over the course of its history the Ludlow Lions Club has truly embodied the motto ‘‘We Serve.’’ Its loyal members have routinely demonstrated an exceptional commitment to helping those less fortunate. That passionate dedication is a hallmark of the agency’s long and admirable tradition of service in western Massachusetts. On the occasion of the Ludlow Lions Club’s 75th anniversary, I wish the organization and its devoted members all the best and much continued prosperity. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE COMBATING IMPLICIT BIAS IN EDUCATION ACT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 10, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Combating Implicit Bias in Education Act. My bill would create a $25 million grant program for schools to train teachers, principals and other personnel on implicit bias, including with respect to actual or perceived race, religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), disability, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The Department of Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection for the 2015–2016 school year found that students of color, males and those with disabilities received far more severe and frequent punishment than white, female and nondisabled students. Despite the findings of this report, the Trump Administration and U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos are considering eliminating the Obama Administration’s guidance seeking to curb exclusionary discipline. Students experiencing implicit bias and even outright discrimination face far greater expulsion and suspension rates, fueling the schooltoprison pipeline and widening the student achievement gap. The bill aims to reduce the effect of implicit bias on school discipline, academic achievement and academic attainment through researchbased training for education personnel. Providing teachers and school officials with training could help close the achievement gap and reduce suspensions and expulsions. Under my bill, the Institute of Education Sciences under the Department of Education is tasked with evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of the training. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation. f

Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to join the Connecticut Democratic Party as well as friends, family, and colleagues from across the state in extending my heartfelt congratulations and sincere thanks to an outstanding Connecticut leader and my good friend, Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman, as she is honored with the 2018 Ella Grasso Award. The first woman to be elected Governor of Connecticut, and the first woman in the nation to be elected without having been the spouse or widow of a former governor, Ella Grasso was a trailblazer for women in the world of politics. Each year, the Connecticut Democratic Party honors a woman serving in public life whose contributions to our state reflect Ella Grasso’s leadership and vision. I can think of no one who has shown more dedication and commitment to making our state a better place for all of our residents than our own Nancy Wyman. Nancy was an xray technician and mother of two when she first ran for public office seeking a seat on the Tolland Board of Education. She was successful in her pursuit and thus began a career in public service that has spanned more than three decades. Following her eightyear tenure as a member of the Board of Education, Nancy went on to run and serve in Connecticut’s State House of Representatives for four terms before seeking statewide office in 1994. Nancy was the first woman to be elected Comptroller, a position which she held for sixteen years and only left when she was asked by nowGovernor Dannel Malloy to be his Lieutenant Governor. As Lieutenant Governor, Nancy has chaired the Board of Access Health CT, Connecticut’s official health insurance marketplace. Created in 2011 to comply with the federal Affordable Care Act, her leadership has helped Access Health CT to become nationally recognized as one of the best health exchanges in the country and a model on which other states have developed their exchanges. Whether on the Board of Education, in the State House, as Comptroller, or Lieutenant Governor, Nancy has served our state and its residents with honor and distinction, earning her the respect and admiration of all of those who worked with her no matter their political persuasion. Nancy is one of Connecticut’s most beloved politicians. With her witty sense of humor, her straightshooting honesty, and the skyhigh heels she is known for wearing for everything from press conferences to parades, Nancy connects with people from every walk of life. You know she is in your corner every time. I, like so many others, consider myself fortunate to call her my friend and I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to thank her for the countless times she has been there for me. She is my soulsister—a kindred spirit whom I have been proud to work with and I cannot thank her enough for her friendship, support, and good work on our behalf. Nancy Wyman, in so many ways, is a reflection of the very spirit in which the Ella Grasso Award is given, and I am honored to have this opportunity to join all of those gathered to recognize her and her legacy of service to Connecticut. I wish Nancy, her husband Michael, their two daughters and their husbands, Stacey and Steve Papa and Meryl and Bill Baldwin, and her grandchildren Kyle, Taylor, Lindsey, Max and Sydney, all the best for many more years of health and happiness.
