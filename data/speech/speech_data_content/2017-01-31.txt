Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of a community leader, public servant, proud veteran, personal mentor, and great American, Lewis Odom. Lewis Odom lived a life many strive to emulate, a life filled with purpose, integrity, and selfless commitment to those around him. He had such a genuine impact on my life and the lives of so many others. From a young age, Lewis held himself to a standard of excellence. Upon graduation from high school, Lewis enlisted in the U.S. Navy Reserve and was selected to join the prestigious V– 12 Naval College Training Program during World War II and thereafter. Through this program, he attended Millsaps College and Tulane University and went on to serve in the Navy aboard the USS Mississippi. After serving, Lewis continued his education at the University of Alabama where he received a law degree, and, soon after, commissioned as a first lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force in 1951, serving as a legal officer in Korea. Lewis Odom’s career of service was only just beginning when he left the military. His hard work and integrity as a lawyer were recognized as he became the general counsel of the U.S. Senate Small Business Committee. He would go on to serve as administrative assistant to Alabama Senator John Sparkman before being named staff director and counsel for the Senate Banking Committee. He played a critical role in shaping many of our Nation’s financial regulations during this important time period. Probably one of his most memorable accomplishments during his career on Capitol Hill was to plan and organize the inauguration ceremony for President John F. Kennedy. He often spoke of the great challenge and honor of that job. Following his time on Capitol Hill, he served as deputy to the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. He was eventually appointed senior Deputy Comptroller of the Currency before retiring from Federal service in 1981. After his years of service in the Federal Government, Lewis returned to practice law in Mobile, joining the law firm of Miller, Hamilton, Snider & Odom. That was when I met Lewis. As a newly minted lawyer, Lewis took me under his wing and served as an important mentor. Lewis was a thorough and exact lawyer who paid attention to detail and helped instill those traits in me and many others that he worked with. He inspired in me the confidence to hold myself to a standard of excellence, but he did so without being overbearing or harsh. He took a new lawyer and allowed me to gain invaluable experience. As a young lawyer, Lewis taught me an important lesson that every young lawyer must learn: to choose your battles wisely. This lesson applied to more than just the field of law, however, and I have continued to use this principle in many of the other skills that I learned from Lewis throughout my life and career. Lewis was also a true community leader committed to making Alabama a better place. From his first days in Mobile to his last, Lewis was ever present in the community, serving in any way he could, always giving his time and his devotion. During his years in Mobile, Lewis served as the chairman of the Alabama Ethics Commission, the chairman of the Mobile water board, chancellor of the Episcopal Diocese of the Central Gulf Coast, and chairman of the Mobile Museum Board. He was also a strong supporter of the University of Alabama, serving as president to various alumni chapters and as a founding member of the Farrah Law Society for the University of Alabama School of Law. It is true that Lewis worked just as hard for his community in his retirement as he had earlier in his legal career. Sadly, Lewis Odom passed away on January 16 of this year at the age of 91. My wife, Rebecca, and I were both heartbroken to learn of his passing because he was such a dear friend. During this time of sadness, we take great 
comfort in remembering the impact he had on each of us as well as on our community, State, and country. I hope his wife, Janelle; son, Mike; daughter, Patty; beloved grandchildren and greatgrandchildren can take comfort in the same. Mr. Speaker, Lewis was a man of great integrity and set an example for all those around him to hold ourselves to such a level of excellence and service. He was a great man, and he will be sorely missed. 
TRUMP MUSLIM BAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise out of deep concern for our country, our people, and those who serve us in uniform. The executive order signed by President Trump on Friday has not only sown chaos and created a backlash being felt across the world, it is also endangering our people here at home and our troops overseas. It bans refugees and is, for all intents and purposes, a ban on Muslims entering our country. It is a religious test. It plays right into the hands of ISIS, al Qaeda, and other extremist groups that mean to do us harm. It arms them. Their message in recruiting and propaganda has been that America is at war with Islam and that when we say we are tolerant and inclusive, it is a lie. We must not let it be a lie. Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, this order will do nothing to make America safer from terrorism. Our enemies will use this Muslim ban to their full advantage, broadcast to all of those who, for whatever reason, may be teetering on the edge of extremism, one image, one tweet, one excuse away from radicalization. And our Muslim allies are scratching their heads in disbelief and disappointment. CBS News reported this morning, Mr. Speaker, that a senior Iraqi general who commands the elite counterterrorism force trained by the United States military was supposed to come here next week but is now banned from doing so. He told CBS news: ‘‘I am a fourstar general. I have been fighting terrorism for 13 years and winning. Now my kids are asking me if I am a terrorist.’’ That general, Talib al Kenani, has been coming here for over a decade meeting with senior U.S. military leaders at CENTCOM, but now he is banned from entering the country. This policy is dangerous, counterproductive, and extremely unfortunate. It is important to note, Mr. Speaker, that of the seven countries included in this ban—hear me, my colleagues—of the seven countries included in this ban, no refugee or immigrant from any of those nations has committed a terrorist act in the United States. The President of the United States has a responsibility—a sacred and public trust—to do everything in his power to protect our Nation. We have that same responsibility. This Congress has a sacred duty to hold the President accountable and ourselves for doing so in a way that respects our Constitution and our values. That, Mr. Speaker, is patriotism. So I urge my colleagues on both sides: Stand against this order. Stand up for America. Stand up for the Constitution. Stand up for our values. Stand against an act that does nothing but empower our enemies and erode faith in our highest principles in our country and around the world. The Nation, Mr. Speaker, is watching. The world, Mr. Speaker, is watching. I urge us to action. Representatives LOFGREN and C ONYERS have introduced a bill to block this executive order. I have cosponsored it, along with 160 other Members of this House. This is a time when party should not be put before country. Party should not be put before patriotism. Party should not be put before principle. Join me, and let us deny our enemies this potent tool and remind the world what truly makes America great. 
IMPORTANCE OF FIREFIGHTERS IN RURAL AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the unsung heroes in many rural communities throughout America: our volunteer firefighters. These dedicated volunteers answer the call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They spend time away from their families and homes. The training that is required can be costly and very time consuming. Our volunteer firefighters make these sacrifices because they care deeply about their friends and neighbors. They care about their communities. But rural America is facing a real problem with dwindling numbers of those who are willing to volunteer. A National Fire Protection Association report published last year shows the number of volunteer firefighters per 1,000 people has been decreasing since 1986. Gone are the days when those seeking to volunteer had to add their names to a waiting list to join their local fire department. Sometimes volunteers could wait for years to be added to the roster, but that is not how it is anymore as fewer individuals are interested in signing up. This is not unique to Pennsylvania, but it is happening in communities across the country. Small communities reap the benefits of having volunteer forces. According to a 2016 National Fire Prevention Association study, the time donated by volunteer firefighters saves localities across the country an estimated $139.8 billion a year. The savings are clear, and the service could not be more important. That is why last year I hosted two fire summits in my district to speak directly with local firefighters and try to identify not only the challenges that they face, but also some solutions to those problems. Funding is always a problem that plagues volunteer departments and can truly decline quickly when we think of what it costs to purchase new equipment and be compliant with the latest regulations. Small communities are often already stressed economically and do not have a tax base that can assume another increase; but equipment replacement is paramount, and it can sometimes mean the life or death of a firefighter. Volunteer fire departments also face training challenges. Firefighters in rural communities regularly need to travel long distances for instructional courses, and paying for the necessary training can be difficult. Training sessions might not focus enough on firefighting in rural communities, which is different from that in urban communities in a number of ways. Personnel challenges remain a constant issue with declining populations, aging firefighters who are not being replaced with those of a younger generation, and a lack of tangible retention incentives. b1015 Yet, with all of these challenges, fire departments are faced with higher call volumes than ever before, according to a study from the National Volunteer Fire Council. Most fire departments across the country have experienced a steady increase in calls over the past two decades. This is a major source of the increased time demands on volunteer firefighters. The number of calls, coupled with the decline in the number of volunteer firefighters, means that fire departments are continuously spread too thin. Most of the increase is attributed to a sharp rise in the number of emergency medical calls, false alarms, and the use of mutual aid as the number of firefighters has decreased. Mr. Speaker, the dangerous work that these men and women do in order to protect the homes and livelihoods of Americans is not something that should be taken for granted. These first responders put their lives on the line and make great sacrifices in order to protect their neighbors and communities from harm. As a volunteer firefighter and EMT rescue technician myself and as a member of the Congressional Fire Caucus, I am grateful for the services that our first responders— brothers and sisters who serve the communities—provide and the constant state of readiness that they operate under. While we must not forget those who have made the ultimate sacrifice through their service, we must also ensure that their colleagues and all of 
our Nation’s first responders are respected and have the resources they need to safely perform their jobs. That is why I am working with the volunteer fire departments in Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District to develop solutions—ideas—to not only recruit more firefighters but to retain them. It is my hope that, by increasing awareness and examining incentives, we might be able to strengthen and grow the rosters of our volunteer fire departments. We know that this service is critical, and we must respect those who are willing to show up, day or night, to protect their neighbors. Thank you to all of our volunteers who answer when the alarm sounds. We value you; we respect you; and I hope we can find more of you to serve. 
I AM AN AMERICAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, I am an American man, born in Chicago, to parents who were born citizens of the United States. The ban on legal immigration from seven countries does not impact me or my family directly, but, as an American, I am speaking up today. I am an immigrant. The proposed roundup of millions of immigrants will not hit my house directly, but, as an American, I am standing up today to say I, too, am undocumented. I have not fled systematic persecution, but, today, like a lot of Americans, I am speaking out and saying clearly that I, too, am a refugee. Today, I am an 81yearold man who was originally from Iran who traveled with a heart problem to the United States—with my American family and a green card in my hand—and was detained at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago. Today, I am a Fulbright scholar who was put on a plane back to Iran because our government did not understand what the new President was doing, how he was doing it, or what people already traveling should do. Today, I am a citizen of the United Kingdom—I am English—with a green card, who was blocked entering at O’Hare with my U.S. citizen wife and my U.S. citizen child. That is who I am today. Today, I am a student who is in the middle of my academic career at the University of Chicago who does not know whether I can come back to school and continue my education. Today, I am one of more than 67,000 refugees who is already approved for travel and certified by both the United States and the U.N. in a painstaking process that took me years to complete, but I am stranded overseas. Today, I am gay or Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Shia, Sunni, am from a tribe or ethnic group that is systematically targeted for persecution, or am living in a country anywhere in the world that cannot protect my basic safety, and the United States is closed to me. Today, I am an immigrant who has a green card and who has followed all of the rules to the letter, but I cannot renew my green card or lawfully apply for citizenship here in the U.S. because I am from one of seven mostly Muslim countries on Trump’s list where, incidentally, there are no Trump hotels, buildings, or golf courses. By now, the entire world knows that the President of the United States screwed up bigly last week and caused an international and domestic crisis and that his staff is lying when they say it was a ‘‘huge success.’’ When the German Chancellor has to lecture your President about the Geneva Convention, you have made one hell of a bad decision. When the Prime Minister of England is saying on one day that the U.S. and Britain have a special relationship but that, on the very next day, you are keeping her citizens out of your country when they are green card holders, your country has made a mistake. When Rudy Giuliani—of all people— makes it clear that the President requested a Muslim ban and that they dressed up the policy to make it look better but still carved out exceptions to help Christians, you are probably acting in an unconstitutional manner. That is not what one but two Federal judges thought: that there are significant enough constitutional issues that have been raised by recent executive actions to stop the President’s order from being implemented. Honestly, even at this hour, I am not sure they are fully complying with the orders or will reverse the actions of government officers at airports who coerced—intimidated—green card holders into signing away their rights and being deported. On Sunday, the glaring bald spot of the President’s executive order was combed over by the Secretary of Homeland Security, who said that keeping out travelers who already live in the U.S. and have green cards is not in the interests of the United States, to which the entire world said, sarcastically: Ya’ think? Today, I am an American, and I am standing up. Today, I am one of the millions of Americans who went to airports, Trump hotels, or town squares and who is marching peacefully, praying privately, and preparing personally to act as an advocate for immigrants and other families in our communities—women, Jews, gentiles, LGBT, and every one of every color and shape. Today, they did not come for us, but we could not be quiet. We joined arms and worked together as Americans. We pledged to stand up for those who are being targeted so that we can protect each other and stem the next wave of targeted attacks. DETECTIVE JERRY WALKER: TEXAS LAWMAN—LITTLE ELM, TEXAS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Texas has lost another one of our finest men in blue. Last month, Detective Jerry Walker responded to a call of a man brandishing a rifle and screaming and hollering in his backyard. So the officers arrived, and they ordered the man to drop the weapon, but the outlaw did not comply. He ran into the house and started firing his weapon—shooting at the officers from inside the cover of his home. During the shootout with the officers, the outlaw was killed, but Detective Walker—a 48yearold father of four and an 18year veteran of the force—was shot during the shootout. This is a photograph of him. His fellow officers rushed to Detective Walker, and he was later airlifted to the hospital, but he died at the hospital. As his body was transported from the hospital, dozens of officers and emergency responders lined the street, saluting their fallen detective. The song ‘‘Amazing Grace’’ could be heard on bagpipes as his body was taken away and traveled down the street. Not only was Detective Walker an outstanding member of the Little Elm Police Department, but he also wore another uniform. He wore the uniform of a soldier in the United States Army. Walker served our country both at home and abroad. Mr. Speaker, Little Elm is in north Texas. It has a population of about 3,500 people. It has approximately 21 police officers, and Detective Walker was the longestserving officer in that town. Detective Walker’s youngest child is only a few months old. His four children need to remember that their father died a servant of the people of Little Elm, Texas. He will be remembered by his family, his friends, and his community as a model officer who protected the innocent. Most importantly, he will be remembered as someone who genuinely cared about the people of the community that he lived in. Before he became a detective with the Little Elm Police Department, Walker served as a school resource officer at Little Elm High School. Students there remember him as someone who could talk to the students and put them at ease. In fact, the kids just loved him. They often would arm wrestle with their beloved officer during lunchtime. One such student, Lionel Valdez, met Walker at school at about the same time that Valdez started getting into trouble. Valdez’ father had walked out of his own life; so Walker took on a parent’s role in making sure that Valdez kept his nose clean and stayed out of trouble while he was in school. He even went so far as to make sure 
that he showed up in class. Years after Valdez graduated from high school, he would return to the school and have conversations with Walker—the one man who showed him the light during his darkest times as a student at school. Jerry Walker was a realtime hero. Detective Walker, Mr. Speaker, is the sixth officer killed in the line of duty in the first 17 days in 2017. Six deaths in 17 days is tragic. Our Nation must honor those men and women who wear the badge—the badge of honor, sacrifice. We must back the blue, Mr. Speaker—back the blue—and back officers like Jerry Walker of Little Elm, Texas. And that is just the way it is. 
MUSLIM BAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, three centuries ago, Hans Christian Andersen wrote a fairy tale about a king who was so vain and insecure that nobody dared challenge him. Andersen wrote: ‘‘He cared nothing about reviewing his soldiers, going to the theater, or taking a ride in his carriage except to show off his new clothes.’’ Sound familiar—a leader so vain and insecure that those around him are afraid to challenge him? a man who thinks he is so smart that he can ignore intelligence briefings and who thinks he is so powerful that he can attack an entire religion without respecting the Constitution, consulting Congress, or even his own Cabinet? The White House claims its ban on Muslims entering our country is about ‘‘keeping America safe.’’ Don’t be fooled. It is about keeping America scared. I am not naive. There is good and evil in this world. My argument is that the administration has the two sides confused. On Saturday, a 5yearold Maryland boy was held for hours at the Washington Dulles International Airport while his frantic Iranianborn mother waited outside. Meanwhile, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, altright provocateur Steve Bannon reassured the President that their extreme vetting was protecting us from evil. Okay, Mr. Bannon. Let’s talk extreme vetting. Before refugees make it to America, they are first vetted by the U.N. Commission for Refugees. Then the State Department investigates and interviews them overseas, checking them against databases with data from battlefields, email intercepts, intelligence, and other interviews. If they make it this far—and many do not—they are fingerprinted and investigated again by the FBI. This process can take up to 2 years, and everyone is vetted—in fact, extremely vetted; but no extreme seems extreme enough for the extremists who are currently in the White House. And how did they choose the seven countries to target? In the past 40 years, there hasn’t been a single terrorist act in America by someone from Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, or Iraq. Of course, that is not all these countries have in common. They are also nations in which The Trump Organization has no business. Meanwhile, the homes of every one of the 9/11 hijackers—Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Lebanon—were left off the list. The Trump Organization has holdings in three out of the four. Last weekend, at the San Francisco International Airport, an Afghani interpreter for our military was detained—held—and questioned after risking his life for our country. In Chicago, Sahar Algonaimi traveled from Syria to care for her dying mother. Despite having a valid visa, she was put back on a plane and sent home. Before she left, her sister said she was coerced into signing papers that canceled her visa. b1030 Other detainees say they were asked their views on the current President. What does that have to do with anything? If having a negative view of the man in the White House is cause for getting kicked out of the country, we are going to need a lot more planes. Since Friday, hundreds have been detained and thousands of legal residents and visa holders are in limbo overseas. ISIS is rejoicing, and American troops and travelers are in danger. So how does the White House describe the results? ‘‘ . . . a massive success story . . . on every single level.’’ If this is the Trump administration’s idea of success, God help us all when they fail. At the end of his famous story, Hans Christian Andersen’s foolish emperor parades naked down the street while those around him marvel at his magnificent clothes. Andersen wrote: ‘‘No costume the Emperor had worn before was ever such a complete success.’’ Then a child cried out: ‘‘But he hasn’t got anything on.’’ We all know how the story ends. Just like in the fairy tale, sometimes it takes a child to show us the truth. 
HONORING CHIEF SPECIAL WARFARE OFFICER WILLIAM ‘‘RYAN’’ OWENS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. TAYLOR ) for 5 minutes. Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Chief Special Warfare Officer William ‘‘Ryan’’ Owens and his wife and his children. The Department of Defense announced his death January 28 in the Arabian peninsula after wounds sustained in a raid against al Qaeda. It should also be noted that two others were wounded in the raid and three others injured in a crash landing. I looked for my own words today, but I came across the profound writing of Andrew Stumpf, and I shall recite his powerful words today in honor of Chief Owens and his family: ‘‘A Debt That Cannot Be Repaid.’’ ‘‘In a country that most would struggle to find on a map, in a compound that few possess the courage to enter, men from my previous life took the fight to our enemy. ‘‘In that compound, they found men that pray five times a day for your destruction. Those men don’t know me, they don’t know you, and they don’t know America. They don’t understand our compassion, our freedoms, and our tolerance. I know it may seem as if those things are currently missing, but they remain, and I know they will return. Our capacity for them is boundless, and is only dwarfed by their hatred for you. They don’t care about your religious beliefs; they don’t care about your political opinions. They don’t care if you sit on the left or the right, liberal or conservative, pacifist or a warrior. They don’t care how much you believe in diversity, equality, or freedom of speech. ‘‘I’m sorry that you have never smelled the breath of a man who wants to kill you. I am sorry that you have never felt the alarm bells ringing in your body, the combination of fear and adrenalin, as you move towards the fight, instead of running from it. I am sorry you have never heard someone cry out for help, or cried out for help yourself, relying on the courage of others to bring you home. I am sorry that you have never tasted the salt from your own tears, as you stand at flag draped coffins, burying men you were humbled to call your friends. I don’t wish those experiences on you, but I wish you had them. It would change the way you act, it would change the way you value, it would change the way you appreciate. You become quick to open your eyes, and slow to open your mouth. ‘‘Most will never understand the sacrifice required to keep men from that compound away from our doorstep, but it would not hurt you to try. It would not hurt you to take a moment to respect the sacrifices that others make on your behalf, whether they share your opinions or not. It would not hurt you to take a moment to think of the relentless drain on family, friends, and loved ones that are left behind. Ideas are not protected by words. Paper may outline the foundation and principles of this nation, but it is blood that protects it. ‘‘In that compound, a man you have never met gave everything he had, so that YOU, have the freedom to think, speak, and act however you choose. He went there for all of us, whether you loved him, or hated what he stood for. He went there to preserve the opportunity and the privilege to believe, to be, and to become what we want. This country, every single person living inside its borders and under the banner of 
its flag, owe that man. We owe that man everything. We owe him the respect that his sacrifice deserves. ‘‘Saying thank you is not enough. ‘‘We send our best, and lose them, in the fight against the worst this world has to offer. If you want to respect and honor their sacrifice, it needs to be more than words. You have to live it. ‘‘Take a minute and look around. Soak it in, all of it. The good, the bad, and the ugly. You have the choice, every day, as to which category you want to be in, and which direction you want to move. You have that choice, because the best among us, the best we have ever had to offer, fought, bled, and died for it. ‘‘Don’t ever forget it.’’ 
FIGHT CLOSED DOORS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, I visited a community health center in Worcester, Massachusetts. There, at a place dedicated to healing those in their community, I met one of their patients. It was a 42yearold Muslim refugee from Baghdad who arrived in the United States this past November. He, his wife, and his children spent 3 years in a Turkish refugee camp after fleeing their home country. His family had been targeted in Iraq. He had been hospitalized four times with bombing injuries. He and his wife had both been shot. He watched his own brother burn to death in front of his eyes, and countless members of his family are still missing. He was a musician back home, but he struggled to keep up his craft as he has fled. A doctor in that health center managed to track down a used trumpet and presented it to that man as a gift. Now, every time he visits that health center, he brings the trumpet and plays it for the staff. My visit was no exception. He stood in front of our group and proudly played our national anthem with tears in his eyes because this country had given him a home. This country is helping him mend his wounds, has protected his family, and has given him a chance to fight another day. It is a badge of honor that he shares with every single person living in our great Nation, regardless of color or creed, that we are all bound together by the immense opportunity of those golden doors, opened at one point for our own families sometime down the road. Hours after our visit, our President— his President—told him that his relatives, his neighbors, and millions of others who have suffered just as he has were no longer welcome here. To Samira Asgari, a 30yearold doctor traveling to Boston to study cures for tuberculosis, he closed the doors. To the Iraqi general who commands an Americantrained counterterrorist force traveling here to visit his relocated family, our President closed our doors. To all of the 21.3 million refugees worldwide, the leader of our free world told them that their pain and their suffering was not his problem, and he closed our doors. And to the global community, he made clear that his government will give in to terror and will make decisions based on fear rather than strength. Mr. President, I hope you hear us loud and clear when we say that these actions are an insult to the country we all love. They are an insult to our Constitution and an embarrassment to the blood, the sweat, and the tears that generations of Americans have shed in defense of Lady Liberty. So, Mr. President, we will fight, we will march, we will protest, we will raise our voices, and one day we will win. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair and not to the President. 
A NATION THAT WELCOMES AND RESPECTS PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege of working with Republican and Democratic Presidents, and, I might add, that I have had the sadness to be standing with them during times of need of this Nation. Living knowledge, during my tenure, President George W. Bush was President during 9/11. I was in this Capitol on September 11, 2001, and so I was physically evacuated. As we were leaving with no understanding of what was happening—particularly for those of us who had come for early morning meetings, not having the full impact of what had happened in New York and not having the full knowledge. But as we were fleeing this building, we took a look to our right. We could see the billowing black smoke in the Pentagon. We were running for our lives. We were running as Americans, Muslims, Jews, Christians, people of many faiths, many races, many genders, many orientations. We were running as Americans. Those families at Ground Zero watched in horror or heard in horror of their loved ones lost, in spite of the heroic efforts of first responders. First responders were lost. There, too, was a multitude of the United Nations. This Nation has always welcomed and respected people from all over the world, and so it disturbs me when those of us who have now taken a visible and stoic stand against an unconstitutional executive order begin to receive attacks from the very person who should be bringing this Nation together. I take great insult from the firing of Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, a person whom I have worked with personally as a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee. She is of profound integrity, honesty, respectability, and professionalism. I congratulate Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates for being a patriot. Last evening, she rendered this statement: ‘‘In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution’s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful.’’ Responding to that, almost like Nixon, some decades ago, this White House fired Attorney General Yates and proceeded to make this statement: ‘‘The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States. This order was approved as to form and legality by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel.’’ Sally Yates explained it, but there is no betrayal of the Department of Justice. It is an entity. It is not the American people, and it is not a Constitution. She has no obligation to the Department of Justice. She has an obligation to the American people to uphold the Constitution. b1045 The White House proceeds to go on to say—I assume President Trump—‘‘Ms. Yates is an Obama administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration,’’ of which I don’t know their proof for such. But what I will say to you is that she was doing her civic and patriotic duty by remaining there as a senior member who was the only person there that could sign subpoenas. She was doing America a favor. So I will say, in the backdrop of that, were you at the Bush Intercontinental Airport, as I was, when an Iraqi citizen came in, a legal permanent resident with a green card, and was detained for 5 hours while his employer and lawyers were gathering and hovering outside; and CBP, to my understanding, how frightened they were, how they did not know what was going on, did not allow them to be able to speak? Or did you listen last night when an Iraqi woman indicated that her husband was murdered and she hid for 12 years in Iraq until she was able to bring her children here? Did you hear that refugees are being denied to come in for 120 days on Friday, Mr. Speaker, and that their papers will expire? Finally, Mr. Speaker, did you hear that the perpetrator in Quebec had on his social media that he was supporting or praising President Trump? Enough is enough. Repeal this order. Pass the SOLVE Act. Pass the USA Act 
that I have introduced as well that includes gender and religion. Stop this madness. The executive order is unconstitutional. 
AMERICA IS AND MUST REMAIN A COUNTRY THAT WELCOMES REFUGEES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. SWALWELL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, America is and must remain a country that welcomes refugees, and we must welcome refugees of all religions. President Trump has our country under a Muslim ban that makes us less safe and less American. Less safe because we already have in place since World War II a process for vetting refugees who come to this country, an intense process that takes 18 to 24 months before anyone can get here. Less safe because it makes us less of a team player on an international stage that requires cooperation among our allies and those in the Middle East who are helping us fight terrorism. If we are not taking on refugees, as our allies, like Jordan and Germany and others who are in the thick of this fight, we will not be seen as a team player and we will not be able to count on them for cooperation. Less safe because it motivates and inspires an enemy who is determined to dispel a message that the United States is not welcome to Muslims. It makes us less American because refugees have helped America as much as America has helped refugees. We have seen this in the wisdom of Albert Einstein, the patriotism of Secretary Madeleine Albright. I have seen this in my own congressional office with my chief of staff, Ricky Le, who came to our country at age 4, on a raft, fleeing Vietnam, and was welcomed into this country, where he was given an opportunity to be the first in his family to go to college, started working on Capitol Hill as an intern, and serves as the chief of staff in my office today. I have seen this spirit of the refugee in Mohammad Usafi, who was my guest at the State of the Union just 2 years ago. Mohammad served our country as an interpreter in Afghanistan. He lost his father, who was kidnapped and killed by the Taliban for his service. His little brother was kidnapped, and he gave his life savings to save his brother’s life. We brought Mohammad over to the United States. But today, if Mohammad was on his way to the United States, under this Muslim ban, he would be detained in an airport. But what is American? American is standing up and welcoming people in need. Being American means going to an airport, as I saw thousands do when I went to SFO airport in San Francisco this weekend. I saw the lawyers on our staff working to provide casework to anyone who was detained. I saw the spirit of generosity across our country at airports and town squares. Being an American means supporting Congresswoman LOFGREN ’s SOLVE Act, the Statue of Liberty Values Act, that will fix and end this Muslim ban. Being an American is what Sally Yates did last night when she stood up against an illegal order and she was fired. Acting Attorney General Sally Yates was not the person who deserved to be fired yesterday. To stop this Muslim ban, we must unite in this country; unite and make sure that we are safe and welcoming to those in need; unite to say we will not target people for persecution based on religion; unite to live out, indeed, what we are taught in the Bible. In Luke 10:25, a student asked Jesus: ‘‘What must I do to inherit eternal life?’’ Jesus says: ‘‘Love the Lord with all of your heart, and love your neighbor as yourself.’’ The student asks: ‘‘Who is my neighbor?’’ And Jesus tells him the story of a traveler from Jerusalem headed to Jericho who was attacked, robbed, and beaten along his journey, and stripped of all of his clothes. He encounters a priest, who walks to the other side of the road when he sees the traveler. He encounters a Levite, who also, like the priest, walks to the other side of the road when he sees this beaten, weary traveler. But then he comes across a Samaritan. The Samaritan took pity on the traveler, bandaged his wounds, and took him and paid for him to stay at an inn. Jesus asked the student: ‘‘Which of these men was a neighbor?’’ The student said: ‘‘The one who showed mercy.’’ Jesus said to the student: ‘‘Go and do likewise.’’ To my colleagues in this House, Republicans and Democrats, and Americans across this great land, refugees are our neighbors. They are the weary travelers. How will we receive them? The American spirit is to be like the Samaritan. We must go and do likewise. 
A DECADE OF SERVICE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Minnesota public servant. After nearly a decade of service to his community, my friend and St. Michael’s former mayor, Jerry Zachman, I congratulate him on his retirement. Jerry has deep roots in St. Michael, as he is a part of the fifth generation of his family to live there, and these strong ties to his beloved community, no doubt, inspired Jerry to serve. As the community began to grow and develop, his main goal was to ensure that St. Michael residents were always put first. I think it is safe to say that Jerry did just that. During his 10 years as mayor, Jerry made numerous improvements to this evergrowing community and city. One major project Jerry played a huge role in is the expansion of the I–94 corridor, which cuts through Minnesota’s Sixth Congressional District. I thank Jerry for his unwavering dedication to St. Michael and to our great State, and I wish him nothing but the best in his future. AN X GAMES STAR  
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate an athlete from my district who has persevered and conquered, achieved, despite challenges that have been presented to him during his life. This past week, snowmobile motocross racer Mike Schultz, from St. Cloud, Minnesota, won his sixth gold medal at the Winter X Games. Mike lost his left leg during a tragic accident in 2008. This past week, he competed amongst opponents who were also amputees or partially paralyzed. Mike Schultz serves as a wonderful reminder of what can be accomplished when one never gives up and displays courage in the face of extreme challenge. It is inspiring to see a young man come out on top against such adversity. We are proud of you, Mike, and I look forward to watching you compete in the 2017 International Paralympic Committee World Para Snowboard Championships in Canada later this year. I have no doubt you will be victorious once again. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of the great leaders in Minnesota. Stanley S. Hubbard, the president and chairman of Hubbard Broadcasting, has been awarded the First Amendment Leadership Award from the Radio Television Digital News Foundation. Hubbard Broadcasting owns several media outlets, including KSTP, a local news affiliate in the great State of Minnesota. Stan Hubbard is wellknown in his industry. In fact, he has already been inducted into the Broadcast & Cable Hall of Fame, and he has received the Distinguished Service Award from the National Association of Broadcasters. The First Amendment Leadership Award is presented annually to a business or government leader who has made a significant contribution to the protection of the First Amendment and the freedom of the press. This award was made for someone like Stan Hubbard. Stan Hubbard, of Hubbard Broadcasting, has spent his entire career in the media protecting and promoting free speech and a free and accountable press. Congratulations to you, Stan, and to the entire Hubbard Broadcasting family. You deserve this award because you earn it every day. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S CABINET NOMINEE, STEVE MNUCHIN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to place in the RECORD a very important story from The Columbus Dispatch newspaper. It focuses on Steve Mnuchin, President Trump’s nominee to be Treasury Secretary, and it raises issues of deep concern. 
[From the Columbus Dispatch, Jan. 29, 2017] TRUMP TREASURY PICKMNUCHIN MISLED  SENATE ON FORECLOSURES , OHIOCASES SHOW (By Alan Johnson and Jill Riepenhoff) President Donald Trump’s nominee for U.S. treasury secretary was untruthful with the Senate during the confirmation process, documents uncovered by The Dispatch show. Steve Mnuchin, former chairman and chief executive officer of OneWest Bank, known for its aggressive foreclosure practices, flatly denied in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee that OneWest used ‘‘robo signing’’ on mortgage documents. But records show the bank utilized the questionable practice in Ohio. ‘‘The guy is just lying. There’s no other way to say it,’’ said Bill Faith, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio. The revelation comes with the committee’s vote on whether to confirm Mnuchin’s nomination, currently scheduled for Monday night. Barney Keller of Jamestown Associates, who represents Mnuchin, was asked to comment for this story but did not respond before deadline. Jamestown Associates is a Washington political consulting and advertising firm that represented Trump in his campaign. ‘‘Robosigning’’ is the informal term for when a mortgage company employee signs hundreds of foreclosures, swearing they have scrutinized the documents as required by law when in fact they have not. ‘‘OneWest Bank did not ‘robosign’ documents,’’ Mnuchin wrote in response to questions from individual senators, ‘‘and as the only bank to successfully complete the Independent Foreclosure Review required by federal banking regulators to investigate allegations of ‘robosigning,’ I am proud of our institution’s extremely low error rate.’’ But a Dispatch analysis of nearly four dozen foreclosure cases filed by OneWest in Franklin County in 2010 alone shows that the company frequently used robosigners. The vast majority of the Columbusarea cases were signed by 11 different people in Travis County, Texas. Those employees called themselves vice presidents, assistant vice presidents, managers and assistant secretaries. In three local cases, a judge dismissed OneWest foreclosure proceedings specifically based on inaccurate robosignings. The Dispatch found more than 1,900 OneWest foreclosures in the state’s six largest counties from 2009 to 2015. Carla Duncan, a social worker from Cleveland Heights, was snared by OneWest’s robo signing machinery. On her way out of town for a short trip in 2010, Duncan stopped by her home to get her mail and found a note from a field inspector for her mortgage company saying that her house was vacant and was going to be boarded up. ‘‘It wasn’t vacant. I was living there,’’ Duncan said. ‘‘There were curtains on the windows. The radio was playing and the dog was there.’’ What Duncan didn’t know at the time was that OneWest had begun foreclosure proceedings on her threebedroom home even though she was uptodate on her payments. OneWest refused to accept a loan modification approved by a previous lender that had been purchased by OneWest, and it wanted to substantially increase Duncan’s interest rate and monthly payment and add late fees. The company also put a lock box on a separate rental property she owned in Cleveland. After hiring former Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann, waging a fiveyear court battle and filing personal bankruptcy, Duncan was finally able to get the foreclosures dismissed and keep her home and rental property. She said the experience was devastating. ‘‘It’s almost like being raped, like being emotionally violated,’’ Duncan said. ‘‘It got to the point that I was afraid to open my own door.’’ Court records show that Duncan’s mortgage was robosigned by Erica JohnsonSeck, vice president of OneWest’s department of bankruptcy and foreclosures. From her office in Austin, Texas, JohnsonSeck robosigned an average of 750 foreclosure documents a week, according to a sworn deposition she gave in a Florida case in July 2009. Under oath, JohnsonSeck acknowledged that she did not read the documents she was signing, taking only about 30 seconds to sign her name. To speed up the process, Johnson Seck said she shortened her first name on her signature to just an ‘‘E.’’ She said in the deposition that OneWest’s practice was to review just 10 percent of the foreclosure documents for accuracy. Dann, who now specializes in representing clients who have problems with banks and other lenders after he was forced to resign as attorney general nearly 10 years ago, said Mnuchin’s businesses were a ‘‘major offender’’ in problem mortgages. Dann said Mnuchin’s firms were known for dual tracking (pursuing foreclosures simultaneously as they allegedly worked with homeowners), fabricating documents and other tactics ‘‘that caused unbelievable devastation in people’s lives.’’ In 2010, federal laws were changed, enabling borrowers victimized by lenders to sue them. Dann said he worries that Mnuchin, as treasury secretary, would quietly work to repeal reforms, collectively known as the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. That appears to be the case. ‘‘It has been over six years since the passage of DoddFrank and it seems like an appropriate time to review all of the regulations from DoddFrank to understand their impact on the market, investors, small businesses and economic growth,’’ Mnuchin said in a written answer to the Senate. U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, DOhio, grilled Mnuchin at his recent hearing and in follow up written questions. ‘‘Mnuchin profited off of kicking people out of their homes and then gave false testimony about his bank’s abusive practices,’’ Brown told The Dispatch. ‘‘He cannot be trusted to make decisions about policies as personal to working Ohioans as their taxes and retirement.’’ Faith, the homelessness coalition director, said foreclosure practices by Mnuchin’s companies and others like them ‘‘created havoc.’’ ‘‘People were bamboozled into signing these mortgages,’’ Faith said. ‘‘We watched this train wreck happen. It’s been devastating, not only to the people who got caught in this kind of scheme, but also to people who happened to live in the neighborhood ....  It’s scary that he’s going to be treasury secretary.’’ The Dispatch analysis showed thousands of Ohio homeowners—including 245 in Franklin County—found themselves in OneWest’s crosshairs when they defaulted on their loans, the majority of them with high interest rates. Many mortgages had terms that housing and financial experts view as predatory: prepayment penalties, interestonly loans and nomoneydown loans. In addition to OneWest, which was born in 2009 from the collapse of subprime mortgage giant IndyMac, Mnuchin’s banking group also acquired Financial Freedom, a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers that went bankrupt because of its toxic mortgage portfolio. The firm specialized in loans to senior citizens cashing in on their homes’ equity. Mnuchin was labeled by critics at the time as the ‘‘Foreclosure King.’’ Of the nearly four dozen foreclosure cases filed by OneWest in Franklin County in 2010 that were analyzed by The Dispatch, a quarter were filed within three years of the homeowner taking out the loan, typically a red flag that there was a problem with the mortgage terms and/or vetting the borrowers. Thirteen of the borrowers had doubledigit interest rates, ranging from 10 percent to 17.31 percent, largely because of adjustable rate mortgage terms. In the cases in which the houses were sold at an auction, twothirds ended up in the hands of the federal government, which had backed those loans. Collectively, more than $4 million was due on those loans. Only seven borrowers were able to get a loan modification, even though former President Barack Obama’s administration had been pushing since 2009 for lenders to help Americans keep their homes by lowering interest rates and, in some cases, the principal balance. Mnuchin does have supporters, including the American Bankers Association, which sent a letter to the Senate committee saying Mnuchin’s ‘‘public statements as well as his career in finance bring us optimism with regard to the outlook for public policies focused on growth and prosperity.’’ Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, released a statement supporting Mnuchin’s nomination, in part because of his stated intention to roll back some of the DoddFrank legislation: ‘‘Mr. Mnuchin has made it clear that reforming the DoddFrank Act will be his ‘number one priority on the regulatory side’ once he becomes secretary of the treasury.’’ 
Ms. KAPTUR. According to The Columbus Dispatch, Mnuchin was untruthful to the Senate Finance Committee regarding his company’s aggressive role in hastening thousands of home foreclosures during the 2000 financial crisis and what followed, and his misdeeds deeply impacted places like Ohio. Mr. Mnuchin was the chief executive officer of OneWest Bank, which engaged in socalled robosigning of mortgage documents. That means you really don’t—you treat people like objects; you really don’t go into the details of every case. The Columbus Dispatch said its analysis of dozens of foreclosure cases in Ohio, and subsequent action, prove otherwise. The dastardly practice of robosigning, prevalent throughout the mortgage industry in the aftermath of that terrible financial crisis, had certain leaders, of which Mr. Mnuchin was at the top of the heap; and their employees signed foreclosure documents en masse without properly reviewing them and forcing unjust foreclosures. 
The Columbus Dispatch found more than 1,900 such cases in Ohio alone. Individual cases revealed OneWest Bank declared properties vacant, even though someone was living in them. OneWest Bank, time and again, refused to abide by agreedupon loan modifications. Is that the kind of person that we really want in charge of the U.S. Treasury Department? Nominee Mnuchin comes with a Goldman Sachs pedigree. Well, wouldn’t we know that? He was nicknamed the ‘‘foreclosure king’’ after buying up IndyMac, a subprime lender that evicted about 36,000 people during the financial crisis. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, while President elect Trump promised to drain the swamp, his nominee for Treasury Secretary proves he is not doing that at all. He is enlarging the swamp. The Columbus Dispatch found more than 1,900, I repeat, OneWest Bank foreclosures in our State’s six largest counties from 2009 to 2015. In addition, Mr. Mnuchin profited personally off of kicking people out of their homes. Does such a person actually deserve confirmation as Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America? Wake up, America. Wake up. Pay attention to what is happening here in Washington, D.C. This city belongs to you. This Capitol belongs to you. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to place in the RECORD a release I sent out over the weekend relating to President Trump’s executive order on immigration and refugees. 
KAPTUR STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT TRUMP ’S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON IMMIGRATION AND  REFUGEES  
OHIO HOME  WASHINGTON , DC.—Today Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (OH–09) released the following statement in light of confusion and hurt emanating from President Donald Trump’s Executive Order on immigration and refugees. ‘‘In New York harbor, not far from President Donald Trump’s office tower stands the awesome Statue of Liberty with Emma Lazarus’ immortal words, ‘Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.’ Surely, President Trump has read these words. ‘‘Ancesters of the Trump and Kaptur families both passed through that unforgettable portal as they made their way to America as immigrants. How can we deny to others the gift of freedom bequeathed to us? ‘‘I support robust efforts to make America safe and secure. But a workable solution should ensure America’s safety without destroying our heritage as an immigrant nation, dedicated to liberty and justice for all. ‘‘President Trump’s mandate will make America less safe. It penalizes worthy individuals and actually gives terrorist cells ammunition to use against America. This mandate puts people at risk who have helped America in our battle against terrorism, at home and abroad. It punishes innocent individuals caught in the crossfire fleeing terror and tribal conflict. ‘‘Dangerously this misconceived Executive Order will spur antiAmerican sentiment globally and on the Internet, spurring more terrorism, including against our troops, and it potentially aggravating religious conflict half way around the world. Reckless rhetoric puts our nation at greater risk at home and puts Americans traveling abroad in danger. ‘‘I cordially invite the President to northern Ohio to meet personally with some of the crossfire fleeing the terror of war and tribal conflict. A wellcrafted policy should enshrine liberty for all lawabiding persons while avoiding unintended consequences that can be used by our enemies to enflame terrorism.’’ Ms. KAPTUR. I just wish to say that the ancestors of the Trump family, as well as the Kaptur family, passed through the unforgettable portal of the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. And the words at the base of that statue are emblazoned in the minds of families like our own going back generations. ‘‘Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.’’ Surely, President Trump has read these words. I support robust efforts to make America safe and secure, and have served on all the committees in this Congress that aim to do that. But workable solutions should ensure America’s safety, without destroying our heritage as an immigrant Nation dedicated to liberty and justice for all. President Trump’s mandate actually will make America less safe because it penalizes worthy individuals and puts them at greater risk, and it actually gives terrorist cells ammunition to use against America. b1100 Think about it. This mandate puts people at risk who helped America in our battle against terrorism abroad and at home, and it punishes innocent individuals caught in the crossfire fleeing terror and tribal conflict. Dangerously, this misconceived executive order will spur antiAmerican sentiment globally and on the internet spurring more terrorism. The old World War II motto ‘‘loose lips sink ships’’ is going to happen because of the way this was conducted. Reckless rhetoric puts our Nation at greater risk at home and puts Americans fighting for us and those traveling abroad in greater danger. Mr. Speaker, I cordially invite the President to northern Ohio. Come and meet some of the people whose lives your order changed. I think you will change your mind. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. 
IRAQI SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISAS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, we are seeing from coast to coast demonstrations, protests, with people speaking out against the outrageous, reckless, and cruel executive order promulgated by the administration on Friday. It is wrong, and it is immoral on so many levels. It is hard to know where to start. I just left my office with the president of the Western States chiropractic college—the largest such institution in the country—Joe Brimhall has a number of students who are dual citizens who need to leave the United States to take their boardcertified tests next week in Canada. He doesn’t know what to tell them. Pursue their professional career and maybe not be able to come back to the United States and finish at the college? It is embarrassing that we can’t give him guidance about this ill thoughtout and reckless executive order that wasn’t planned and still is having the details worked out. But perhaps the worst aspect of this blanket cancelation is as it affects Special Immigrant Visas for Iraqis who are waiting to come to the United States. Whatever you think about the Iraq war, the men and women in Iraq who volunteered to help our forces were essential. They were guides, they were interpreters, and they worked on the projects. We could not have done the job over there without them. In many cases, they blended into the units in which they served. I have had cases where our soldiers have described to me how these people literally saved their lives. I have heard from veterans who care deeply and wonder about the signal that they are sending to people they regarded essentially as family. They wonder how this administration could have forgotten about them. The guard in my office in Portland, who is a veteran, was asking me what is going on. He recalled his story about an interpreter who was critical to him when he served in Iraq. How could we have forgotten them? I will tell you somebody who has not forgotten them are the Taliban and the ISIS terrorists. They regard these people as traitors. The terrorists have long memories, and want to make people pay for helping the United States. We have seen countless examples of these people being hunted down by terrorists. They have been assaulted, they have been kidnapped, they have had family members held for ransom, and they have been murdered. That is why I have worked on a bipartisan basis for 10 years establishing the Special Immigrant Visa program with the late Senator Kennedy, with Senator JOHN MCCAIN, Senator S HAHEEN , my Republican colleague A DAM KINZINGER , and Congressmen S TIVERS  and HUNTER who were veterans themselves and understood why this program was important. There is a lot of talk about extreme vetting. Trust me—the applicants for these visas are extremely vetted, taking 2 and 3 years, sometimes longer, fighting the bureaucracy, trying to make sure that they can escape to safety. Many have been killed because the extreme vetting process took so long. 
To turn their lives upside down and put them at risk because there are people in the White House who don’t understand or who don’t care is appalling. I applaud my colleagues in both parties who are speaking out and asking the administration to come to its senses on this blanket ban of Muslims from seven countries—seven countries, by the way, that have not been involved with terrorist acts. This is not going to make us any safer. Some have speculated that some of the countries that have been left out, like Saudi Arabia, where most of the 9/11 terrorists came from, were left out because the President has business interests there. I don’t know why these countries were selected, but the fact is it should end today. It should end not just because of the brave men and women under the Special Immigrant Visa program from Iraq whose lives are now at greater risk because of this reckless act. It is wrong because of the signals we are sending to foreign nationals whom we rely upon. It is not just in Iraq. We have people who work for the United States who live in many other countries who help us with the State Department programs and with the military. What message are we sending to them if the United States is not going to stand up and protect them? 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 11 o’clock and 6 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: God of the universe, thank You for giving us another day. It is Your nature to hold us in Your living presence always. It is our nature to think of You or of others only momentarily or in passing. Be with each of us that we may be our very best and prove ourselves worthy of Your love and Your grace. Bless the Members of this people’s House in their work and deliberations today that they might merit the trust of the American people and manifest the strength of our Republican democracy to the nations of the world. As the new administration finds its footing and settles into its governing principles, may this assembly assist by remaining faithful to its constitutional responsibilities with the help of Your grace and wisdom. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I wish to introduce President Trump to two Syrian families who made it to safety in Rutland, Vermont, just a week before he slammed the door. The alHallak family is from Damascus, and the Khatib family is from Aleppo. These families survived a home being bombed, al Qaeda and ISIS terrorists, and the brutal violence of the Assad regime. They found temporary refuge in Turkey. They have now found permanent freedom in Vermont. These good people endured all of this hardship to do what all parents strive to do—protect their children from harm. Madam Speaker, I wish President Trump were with me last Thursday in Rutland to meet the alHallaks and the Khatibs. Do we really fear these families when they have been so rigorously vetted? I wish President Trump were with me to meet the generous people of Rutland. They had good questions about the refugee program—its cost and their security. Yet, Madam Speaker, unlike President Trump, the folks in Rutland never, never wanted to ban Muslims and welcome only Christians. f 
PRESERVING WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS FOR LGBT FEDERAL CONTRACTORS (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am heartened by the administration’s announcement that it will preserve workplace protections for LGBT Federal contractors. This is a meaningful and positive step toward ending discrimination against hardworking LGBT Americans who only want to earn a living and provide for themselves and their families. For many years I have been working with my congressional colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect skilled, qualified, and motivated LGBT employees. Too often these individuals experience rejections at job interviews, are denied promotions, or face other types of harassment in the workplace simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This shameful practice of discrimination on the job runs counter to our core values of fairness and equality. I hope that the administration and Congress can work together to extend equal rights to LGBT individuals in every sector. 
BASIC AMERICAN VALUES IN WESTERN NEW YORK (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of so many western New Yorkers and Americans who are outraged by the President’s executive order on immigration. The story of America is defined by the struggle of immigrants overcoming 
incredible odds to claim their piece of the American Dream. The executive order on immigration is callous, unlawful, and unconstitutional. An immigration ban on anyone that is based on religion or country of origin is in conflict with basic American values and who we are as a people. Inspired by the work of the International Institute, Catholic Charities, Jericho Road, Jewish Family Services, and so many more, my western New York community continues to be welcoming to refugees and immigrants from all over the world, including from those countries that are directly affected by this order. I know my community will continue to lead by example and proudly project American values. 
RUSSIA DECRIMINALIZES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, according to a Russian proverb: ‘‘If he beats you, it means he loves you.’’ In Russia, that has become the norm. Forty percent of all violent crimes in Russia are done within the home. 36,000 people are beaten by their partners every day. Madam Speaker, this is disturbing; but the Russian Parliament has voted overwhelmingly to decriminalize domestic violence if it does not cause substantial bodily harm and does not happen more than once a year. So, if a husband beats his wife once a year, that is fine, sayeth the lords of Siberia. Madam Speaker, domestic violence is not just a family issue; it is a human rights issue. As a lifelong advocate for victims, our societies and countries must recognize the devastating effect of domestic violence. It tears at the fabric of society—and not legalize it, but stop this nightmare wherever it is. Like my grandmother always taught me, you never hurt somebody you claim you love. And that is just the way it is. 
REFUGEE BAN (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, the recent executive order signed by President Trump to ban refugees and other individuals from certain Muslim majority nations is a shameful attempt to create a religious test for entry into our country. Rather than making our Nation safer, it discredits our heritage and undermines our shared values. The American people demonstrate these values every single day. One example: just last Friday, Synagogue Am Shalom, in the 10th District, welcomed a refugee family who fled the violence in Syria. There were 22 members of the congregation who met the family at O’Hare International Airport and greeted them with flowers, toys, and well wishes. Volunteers then brought the family to their new apartment that was full of donated furniture, clothing, and food to help them start their new life here at home. This refugee family was one of the last to arrive before President Trump slammed the door shut. Madam Speaker, I am the grandson and greatgrandson of immigrants who fled the persecution of Jews in Russia a century ago in order to build a better life here for themselves and future generations. That is the American Dream. We must not allow fear to turn us inward or bar the gates to innocent refugees who seek a safe home and a better future here in America. f 
INMATE MANNING (Mr. ROGERS of Alabama asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I rise to share my disgust and contempt for the former President’s decision to commute the sentence of inmate Manning, formerly known as Bradley Manning. Manning’s commutation was even opposed by President Obama’s Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter. According to press reports, after Manning released over 450,000 Army field reports and intelligence reports, plus over 200,000 diplomatic cables, the Taliban went on a killing spree—taking out everyone who seemed to fit the description of individuals working with the U.S. It was indiscriminate killing. Madam Speaker, we are hearing the usual handwringing this morning from President Trump’s critics about the impacts of his executive order on those who helped us in Iraq and Afghanistan. These individual voices would be much more credible if they had criticized President Obama for his irresponsible commutation of inmate Manning. President Obama may be gone, thankfully, but we are still suffering from his irresponsible decisions. Change has finally come to America, Madam Speaker. Manning and other enemies of our Nation should be on notice. 
TRUMP’S MUSLIM BAN (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, for hours at SeaTac International Airport on Saturday, I worked with colleagues from the Port of Seattle, the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, the ACLU, and our Governor to get people who were being held to be released because of President Trump’s Muslim ban. In the utter chaos, I found a gentleman who had come from Somalia to be reunited with his wife. He had all of his legal papers; but, instead, he was blindly turned away without any due process. We were able to get two other individuals released—one from Yemen and one from Sudan—after a brutal and determined effort to literally stop the plane that they had been boarded onto in order for them to be deported. This wasn’t just in Seattle, Madam Speaker. This happened at airports across the Nation. Our office has been contacted by dozens of people who are absolutely terrified. These are students, legal permanent residents, and businesspeople who do not know anymore what their place in this country is. Simply put, this is unAmerican and unconstitutional. I, myself, immigrated when I was 16 years old, and it took me 19 years to become a citizen. I am intimately familiar with the barriers that people face in our immigration system, and I hope that all of the Members of this Chamber will welcome immigrants the way we always have. f 
IN MEMORY OF OFFICER DENNIS MCNAMARA (Mr. MEEHAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MEEHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of Officer Dennis McNamara of the Upper Darby Police Department in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Fifteen years ago yesterday, Officer McNamara was brutally gunned down and murdered in the line of duty while he served his community. He was survived by his wife, Diane, and his wonderful children, Spike and Melissa. I was with Diane, Spike, Melissa, and others yesterday as we dedicated a road in Dennis’ hometown of Upper Darby as the ‘‘Dennis McNamara Memorial Highway.’’ It was a fitting memorial to Dennis’ wonderful life and the legacy he has left behind, and it is one of the many ways Dennis’ own community will never be forgotten. Madam Speaker, I will soon be presenting Dennis’ family with two flags. The first flag flew over the United States Capitol yesterday, which marked the 15th anniversary of his death. The second is a flag of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Foundation, which flew over the law enforcement memorial—just blocks from here in Judiciary Square— during National Police Week. No gesture will bring Dennis back to his family, but it is my hope that these flags will continue to help his community honor his family and the ultimate sacrifice he made. 
b1215 NO NOTHING PARTY (Mr. PASCRELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, there are stark similarities between what happened in the 1850s and now. You judge for yourself. In 1856, former President Millard Fillmore ran for President as part of the KnowNothing group. A year after the failed attempt, most of the Know Nothing supporters joined the newly formed Republican Party. You can’t make this up. A primary concern of the Know Nothing movement in the 1850s was the large number of Irish and German Catholics who were coming to the United States. A concern they repeatedly professed was a worry that the character of the country would be changed because they were coming here. Lincoln said this: ‘‘As a nation, we begin by declaring that ‘all men are created equal.’ We now practically read it ‘all men are created equal, except Negroes.’ When the KnowNothings get control, it will read ‘all men are created equal except Negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics.’’’ When it comes to this, I should prefer immigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty. Russia—oh, the similarities are unbelievable—where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy. That is the difference. But there are a lot of similarities. 
KEEP AMERICANS SAFE (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, anyone who wants to protect Americans from terrorist attacks should support President Trump’s immigration executive orders. Put aside the hysteria of his political opponents. Here are the facts: There will be a temporary halt in the admission to the U.S. of those from seven designated countries, including Iraq, Iran, Libya, and Syria. These are the exact same countries designated a security threat by President Obama. Congress passed bipartisan legislation in 2015 designating these countries as security risks in order to protect our homeland from terrorism. In fact, the bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 407–19. Despite what the media and others imply, Muslims are not being targeted. Many Muslim majority countries, in fact, are not singled out. The purpose of the temporary halt is to allow time to improve procedures so better background checks can be developed. Who could possibly oppose efforts to keep Americans safe? 
SUPPORT THE REPORT ACT (Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, last week I introduced the Reporting Efficiently to Proper Officials in Response to Terrorism Act, the REPORT Act. It creates a legal requirement that the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the United States Attorney General, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the head of the National Counterterrorism Center, submit a report to Congress when an incident of terrorism occurs in the United States. Currently, there is no legal mandate for this report which would play an important role in helping lawmakers and agencies learn more and respond to extraordinary emergencies like we saw in San Bernardino. I would like to thank my colleague Representative KENCALVERT , an original cosponsor of the bill, for working with me and my office over the past year to help in the San Bernardino recovery process. I would also like to recognize Mr. Gregory Clayborn, father of Sierra Clayborn. Sierra was one of the 14 victims of the San Bernardino terrorist attack, and Mr. Clayborn worked with my office for months to help shape this legislation. This bill is a tribute to Sierra, the other 13 innocent victims, and all of those who were affected by the attack on December 2. While it does not address every issue raised by the attack, it is a commonsense change to help us understand how this and other attacks unfolded so we can prevent these types of tragedies from happening in other cities and to other families. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill and to help strengthen our national security. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF STANLEY RUSS (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of one of Arkansas’s great leaders and a dear friend, former State Senator Stanley Russ, who passed away earlier this month at the age of 86. Born and raised in Conway, Arkansas, Stanley served in the U.S. Army during the Korean war before becoming a State senator for 25 years. Stanley received numerous awards for his work, including being named of one of the Ten Outstanding State Legislators in the United States by the Assembly of State Governmental Employees. He also received the Distinguished Service Award from the Conway Chamber of Commerce and was elected into the Arkansas Tech University Hall of Distinction as well as the Arkansas Agriculture Hall of Fame. Our State and Faulkner County will miss Stanley’s smile, his enthusiasm and ability to get things done to enrich the lives of all Arkansans. I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his family and loved ones. CHANGE DIRECTION NEW HAMPSHIRE (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Change Direction New Hampshire, a firstofitskind statewide campaign to raise awareness of the five signs of mental illness and emotional suffering. Since its first launch last May, Change Direction has touched the lives of thousands of Granite Staters, helping to change the culture and erase the stigma surrounding mental illness in New Hampshire and across the country. Campaign cochairs, my dear friends, the Honorable John Broderick, Peter Evers, and Dr. Bill Gunn, have dedicated countless hours to help spread this campaign through schools, workplaces, and institutions throughout the Granite State. They have met with thousands of stakeholders and community members, holding more than 100 public presentations. They have distributed nearly 320,000 informational posters and cards, and they have placed a billboard on one of our busiest highways. The goal of Change Direction is to make the five signs of mental illness— personality change, agitation, withdrawal, poor selfcare, and hopelessness—as wellknown indicators as the indicators of a heart attack. This increased recognition will help improve treatment of mental illness, address substance misuse, and help prevent suicide among our friends and neighbors. But the impact of this campaign goes far beyond the five signs. Please join me in recognizing John, Peter, Bill, and all of those who support the Change Direction campaign. 
NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST— A WONDERFUL TRADITION (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, on Thursday, Members of Congress and leaders from across the globe will gather in Washington, D.C., to mark one of our finest traditions: the National Prayer Breakfast. This event is hosted annually on the first Thursday in February. More than 3,000 people typically gather for this international forum that allows individuals from various sectors—including political, business, and social—to build relationships and come together in faith, fellowship, and prayer. Personally, I look forward to the National Prayer Breakfast each year as a time when thousands around the world and right here at home can reflect on their faith, focus on the year ahead, and walk away from this remarkable 
event with a renewed sense of hope and faith. This nonpartisan event brings together so many unique individuals who will hear the stories of inspiration from faithfilled speakers. From the Book of First Chronicles, Scripture tells us to, ‘‘Look to the Lord and His strength; seek His face always.’’ This is what we will be seeking at the National Prayer Breakfast. It is my hope that I will see many of my colleagues there this Thursday. 
MUSLIM BAN (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, whatever you call the President’s recent executive orders, the reality is that they constitute a Muslim ban. Yesterday, one of my constituents was crossing the border into San Diego when he was singled out for having brown skin. He was asked by a CBP agent if he was Muslim as he stood in line. Well, in fact, he is an Indian American man who got his citizenship mere months ago, and he was so proud to become a U.S. citizen because it meant that he could finally vote in our elections. His wife called our office, horrified at how casually her husband’s civil rights had been violated, and she told us that she was scared now to travel with her kids because she didn’t want to tell them that they shouldn’t talk to any agents at the airport. Her voice wavered as she explained that she has lived here for 45 years, but this is the first time she ever felt scared because of her skin color. Mr. Speaker, I demand—in fact, we all should demand—that President Trump rescind these discriminatory orders immediately and that my Republican colleagues stand up against these unAmerican policies. 
EXECUTIVE ORDER TO BAN MUSLIMS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the executive order is patently and clearly unconstitutional. An executive order to ban Muslims is unconstitutional. None of us stand against the stringent review of individuals to determine who would come to do well, but who would come to do harm. A ban or a temporary suspension of all of the refugees around the world who have been vetted over and over again is clearly discriminatory. It is true that the Constitution of the United States starts with: ‘‘We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence . . .’’ and ‘‘welfare. . . .’’ Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates made the right decision. Many court jurisdictions have already said that this is an unconstitutional and discriminatory order. The office of a public servant in the United States Federal Government requires that you take an oath to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States. I believe the President should uphold his oath. REQUEST TO CALL UP H .R. 724, SOLVE ACT , AND 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, today I join with the resolve of the Deputy Attorney General, and I ask unanimous consent for the SOLVE Act, and ask unanimous consent for H.R. 724 and H.R. 735, the USA Values Act, all dealing with banning and repealing and rescinding, now, the unconstitutional executive order on banning Muslims. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COLLINS of New York). Any such unanimous consent request has not been cleared. The gentlewoman’s time has expired. 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY? (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I, like millions of Americans, have been watching over the last 10 or 11 days, and especially this past weekend, shaking my head and wondering just what is happening in our country? This is not who we are. I can’t tell you the number of people that I spoke to this weekend from all walks of life, all backgrounds, who have said this phrase: ‘‘I can’t believe I am really seeing this in America.’’ Mr. Speaker, I can understand why, in light of Brussels, Paris, San Bernardino, I can understand why many of my fellow Americans are scared. I share their concern. But let’s be clear: this illegal, unAmerican executive order signed on Friday does absolutely nothing to protect us. It makes us less safe. It was a wonderful gift to ISIS, and it must be repealed. 
SAFETY OF OUR CITIZENS IS A TOP PRIORITY (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, the safety and security of our citizens here on American soil must remain our top priority, and our borders must always be secure against anyone who would enter our country legally or illegally to cause us harm, especially those who wish to exploit our Nation’s generosity and compassion. However, compassion and security are not conflicting ideals, and we must continue our Nation’s legacy of being a beacon of hope and freedom around the world. The idea of reform, though, and oversight of our Nation’s vetting system is not in conflict with our longstanding value of accepting refugees, and it is not new. The Obama administration and the Trump administration, alike, have now both paused refugee settlements into our Nation. President Trump should have our Nation’s support to carry out his mission to protect our Nation’s borders, but he must do so without unnecessarily burdening lawful entrance into the United States. Mr. Speaker, I stand ready to work with you and my colleagues in Congress to come up with clear procedures to ensure that our refugee program can continue in the safest possible manner, and together we can live in a nation that is both secure and charitable. f 
b1230 OPPOSITION TO THE MUSLIM BAN (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to President Trump’s Muslim ban because that is exactly what it is. It is a meanspirited ban against members of a religious faith. I love my country, and I am saddened by these divisive and hateful actions being wrongfully taken in the so called name of national security. Mr. Trump’s actions make us less secure as a nation. They take a sledgehammer right through the founding principles of our Nation. America is not this nonsensical, antirefugee Nation. Quite frankly, Mr. Trump’s actions are unAmerican, beneath us, and downright dangerous. Let me remind my colleagues, there has been a protest every day since Mr. Trump took office. The people have hit the streets. We will continue to march, and we will keep demanding what is right. We will keep fighting to ensure American values are upheld and that our civil rights are not trashed like yesterday’s news. To our Muslims, LGBT, immigrants, women, and all our brothers and sisters hurt by Mr. Trump’s garbage, I mean executive orders, I am with you. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD REMOVE STEVE BANNON FROM NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on President Trump to remove Steve Bannon from the National Security Council. Mr. Speaker, the National Security Council was created in 1947, and it is 
designed to provide the President of the United States with diplomatic, military, intelligence, and economic information to coordinate, to plan, and to implement national security, and to make sound decisions affecting national security with input from professionals and not from political operatives. And the National Security Council has done that for seven decades. Yet, last week, the President issued an illconceived, dangerous, and unconstitutional executive order that bans Muslims. It puts Americans abroad, American communities at home, and American soldiers around the world at risk; and I believe that Steve Bannon, who might become a member of the National Security Council, was the architect of that executive order. Mr. Speaker, I ask President Trump, if he is not willing to remove Mr. Bannon from the White House, at least, for the safety of this country, remove him from the National Security Council. 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY (Ms. ESHOO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon really with a very, very sad and heavy heart. I don’t know anyone in our country who watched what took place across the country who wasn’t dismayed, who wasn’t heartbroken, who wasn’t confused. And as my constituents said: What is happening in our country? Now, there are some that say this must be done. This executive order must be done in the name of national security. I am a veteran of the House Intelligence Committee, but it doesn’t take a veteran of the House Intelligence Committee to understand that this harms our national security. We need to have more voices in the House. We need Republicans and Democrats standing up together, because historians will replace your surname, and those that don’t raise their voices will be called coward because this is ripping at the fabric and the soul of our Nation. It is appalling. It is unlawful. I believe it is unconstitutional. If you stood up for history and what was done to others, it is taking place right now in our country. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 38, DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 70 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 70 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 38) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of the Interior known as the Stream Protection Rule. All points of order against consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) One hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources; and (2) one motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman and my good friend from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington? There was no objection. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, just yesterday, the House Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 70, providing for the consideration of H.J. Res. 38, legislation utilizing the Congressional Review Act to overturn the final stream protection rule promulgated by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, or the OSMRE, which is at the Department of the Interior. The rule provides for consideration of the joint resolution under a closed rule, as is customary with these CRA measures. Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of a critical measure that will help protect American businesses and families from the Obama administration’s rampant regulatory overreach. H.J. Res. 38 disapproves of the final stream protection rule which was released by the Department of the Interior on December 19, 2016, representing yet another lastminute, midnight regulation from the previous administration. This burdensome rule seeks to govern the interaction between surface mining operations and streams by establishing a bufferzone rule that blocks mining within 100 feet of those streams. This was done, despite the Department of the Interior’s own reports, which shows that virtually all coal mines in this country have no offsite impacts, they are being operated safely, and that lands are being restored successfully under existing Federal and State regulation. During the rulemaking process, OSMRE and the Department of the Interior ignored existing regulatory success at the Federal and the State level and shut out the cooperating agencies, the States who are responsible for enforcing Federal mining regulations. In 2015, 9 of the 10 cooperating States withdrew as cooperating agencies in the rulemaking and development process, due to OSMRE’s exclusionary tactics, failure to provide for meaningful participation, and continual limiting of the States’ involvement over the past several years. The National Environmental Policy Act or, as we know it as, NEPA, requires OSMRE, as the lead rulemaking agency, to involve States in the drafting of the regulation and requires them to involve States. These failures, and the restrictive tactics that were employed by OSMRE, led the House Natural Resources Committee chairman, Mr. ROBBISHOP of Utah, to send a letter in 2015 to the GAO, the Government Accountability Office, requesting a review of OSMRE’s compliance with NEPA in the agencies’ development and drafting of the proposed stream protection rule. Ample evidence exists that OSMRE excluded these States from the NEPA process, in contradiction of both NEPA regulations and the memoranda of understanding between OSMRE and the States. Mr. Speaker, the stream protection rule unilaterally rewrites over 400 existing rules and regulations. It threatens over onethird of the Nation’s coal mining workforce and will send repercussions throughout the broader U.S. economy. The final rule is the definition of a onesizefitsall solution due to OSMRE’s failure to conduct the 7 year rewrite in a transparent process consistent with their statutory requirements to engage State and local stakeholders. An economic analysis conducted by the National Mining Association found that the total number of jobs at risk of loss is somewhere between 112,000 and 280,000 people, approximately 30 to 75 percent of the current industry employment levels. Further, the misguided regulation would jeopardize 40,000 to 77,000 jobs in both surface and underground mining operations, industries that are still reeling from 8 years of overregulation from the previous administration. And while the Obama administration never seemed to mind the consequences of its actions on hardworking Americans, I can assure you that the new, unified Republican government is opposed to ineffective regulations like this one which unnecessarily put people out of work, raise energy costs on consumers, and do nothing to improve the environment. By passing this rule, we have the opportunity to consider a resolution that will prevent this regulation from removing over onehalf of the total U.S. coal reserves available for extraction, while also reducing oppressive barriers to responsible coal production. The Congressional Review Act of 1996 was enacted to be a powerful tool to 
allow Congress to overturn lastminute regulations from the previous administration, under an expedited legislative process. If Congress passes a joint resolution disapproving the rule, and the resolution becomes a law, the rule cannot take effect or continue. CRAs are designed to address and invalidate problematic rules from the previous administration, and the stream protection rule clearly fits the bill. Furthermore, this CRA provides certainty to State regulatory bodies tasked with regulating 97 percent of the coal mines in the United States and enforcing Federal mining regulations by strengthening the State primacy framework provided in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. Blocking the final stream protection rule will restore an important stream of State and Federal tax revenue associated with coal extraction across the country that is benefiting hardworking American taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, every Member of this body wants to protect the environment, ensure clean water and clean air for our citizens, and encourage innovative and responsible ways to produce energy. However, these goals are not mutually exclusive, as some opponents of this legislation will argue. It is past time that we embrace commonsense, practical Federal rules and regulations that protect the environment and the countless Americans working in the industries that support our economy and provide for greater domestic energy independence. The rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of a bill that is critically important to the future economic growth and job growth of our country. By passing this CRA, we can take a badly needed step toward protecting American families and businesses from the rampant executive overreach that will be the defining achievement of the past administration. I urge my colleagues to support this rule, as well as the underlying legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1245 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Washington, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for consideration of a joint resolution disapproving of a Department of the Interior regulation known as the stream protection rule. Through this action, my Republican colleagues are now attempting to repeal a thoughtful and thoroughly vetted regulation that reflects current science, technology, and mining practices in order to better protect people and the environment from the negative impacts of mountaintop removal mining. This regulation took 7 years to develop and updates a 30yearold coal mining regulation. This regulation is not, as we have seen coming out of the administration of late, some flybynight executive order, but rather a serious attempt by serious people to make us a healthier and more environmentally conscious nation. However, what we see here today is business as usual for the Republican majority—turning a blind eye to science in order to help wealthy polluters at the expense of the public’s health and the environment. Just because my friends’ unending attempts to normalize such misguided governance have become almost numbing in their effect does not make such attempts any less appalling to those of us who believe in the scientific method and a clean and safe environment. Indeed, the paucity of care that we see here today in ridding the books of a regulation that hardworking and good people took 7 years to write with, mind you, input from all stakeholders, is starting to look like a variation of a theme when we consider the paucity of care the Republicans in the White House have exhibited over the past 10 days. As everyone knows, last Friday, President Trump issued an executive order banning Muslims from certain countries from entering the United States and callously shutting down the refugee program. What ensued, and I predict will continue to ensue as we speak here today, was nothing short of chaos. Scores and scores of people were detained for hours, including green card holders, children, the elderly, and even Iraqi translators who had helped the United States during the insurgency. Equally as horrifying as this Muslim ban that is the antithesis of everything we value as Americans is the ineptitude in which such a sweeping policy was implemented. Relevant agencies were not even consulted. In fact, Homeland Security Secretary Kelly, found out about the executive order on the phone while on a Coast Guard plane heading back to Washington. Secretary Mattis was also left off the list of those consulted. Had he been on it, he would have almost certainly expressed the sentiment he expressed during the campaign, mainly that the Muslim ban would cause great damage and send shock waves through the international community. Like Ms. ESHOO , who spoke earlier, I am a veteran of the Intelligence Committee as well. We serve there together. I can assure you our experience leads us to know—and anyone that is on the Intelligence Committee knows now—that what we are about to experience is a handout to our enemies and will cause additional shock waves in the international community. The result of this amateur hour rollout was a Customs and Border Patrol agency that wasn’t sure how to even execute the order. From management on down, no one knew what was going on while scores of people were riddled with fear that their realization of a free and fair life here in the United States was lost forever. People with visas and green cards were held for hours. Will someone please tell me what it means to issue a visa to persons if they cannot utilize the visa? People were denied access to a lawyer even after a Federal Court order stayed the executive action. Here is a small sampling of the immediate impact of this Muslim ban: A 5yearold boy, a U.S. citizen, was detained for several hours. 5 years old—a truer threat to our national security we have never faced. An 88yearold man and his 83yearold wife, both wheelchair bound and both possessing green cards, were detained for hours. He is legally blind, and she recently suffered a stroke—detained for hours. A Ph.D. student at Stony Brook University, who has lived in the United States for 12 years, was detained for more than 24 hours. The mother of an Active Duty United States servicemember was detained for more than 30 hours. Tell me, what danger do these people pose? What security objective is achieved by detaining them? I argue none. I have to agree with Senator ROB PORTMAN when he said what was so plainly obvious to see: ‘‘This was an extreme vetting program that wasn’t properly vetted.’’ As thousands arrived at airports across the country to protest the President’s executive order and hundreds of lawyers showed up to volunteer their time to write habeas petitions for those so clearly wrongfully detained, President Trump, living in a world all his own, tweeted the following: ‘‘All is going well with very few problems.’’ All is not going well, Mr. President, and there are many problems. Then he defended the hastily implemented order saying that: ‘‘If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the ‘bad’ would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad ‘dudes’ out there!’’ This is a stunningly ignorant and offensive statement that reveals to the entire world a person with no grasp of even what the refugee program is or how the visa process works. Immediately preceding this tweet, the President advised everyone to: ‘‘Study the world!’’ I encourage him to take his own advice. Beyond the human toll this foolish and callous policy has inflicted on scores of innocent people, the executive order actually undermines our efforts to defeat terrorism—jeopardizing the very safety the order purports to provide. The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, headed by JOHN MCCAIN, along with Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM , underscored this irony, and I quote their joint statement: ‘‘We fear this executive order 
will become a selfinflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,’’ noting further that President Trump’s executive order ‘‘may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.’’ So I find it interesting now that the majority of my Republican colleagues in the House, even the ones that voiced opposition to a Muslim ban during the campaign when thenPresidentelect Trump first proposed it, including our Speaker of the House, are now deafeningly silent. Instead, Republicans are using their time today not to respond to this chaosinducing executive order that so clearly violates core American values, but rather to repeal a rule that was actually properly vetted—vetted for 7 years, using the best science and technology available, and following input from the public and leaders in the industry. I caution my friends, the events of today and how you respond to them will be written in the history books tomorrow. A question emerges from the fog that is the Trump administration’s full frontal attack on our Constitution: What is more important, appeasing a man who is just as likely to tweet insults at you as he is to rush out illconceived and horrid executive orders, or protecting our Constitution and the ideals of this great Nation? The ideals and dedication to the rule of law that have inspired the poor, the tired, and the huddled masses to seek a better and freer life here in the United States. It didn’t begin with Muslims. It began with the Founders of this country, and it was followed by countless others, from Irish, Italians, Polish, Hungarians, Vietnamese, and Chinese, all over this world coming to this country to seek the kind of life that many of our ancestors sought over the course of time and some of our ancestors had no choice but to undertake. The time to act in the name of short term political expediency is over. It is time to stand up and do what is right. It is time to protect our Constitution. It is time to defend the idea that we can indeed form a more perfect Union. But we cannot do that with the kind of division that is being sold by this administration, and we cannot do that by spending what appears to be the month of February disapproving executive orders that the previous President issued. It seems to me somehow or another in that fog is going to be the kind of confusion and chaos that we just witnessed this weekend. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, getting back to the issue at hand and the stream protection rule, there are many points that my friend from Florida brought up. One occurred to me as well: Is this really a midnight rule; or could something that was started in 2008 really be considered as something that was shoved through at the last minute? I did ask that question, and the answer is a resounding ‘‘yes.’’ During the process in 2011, some of the reports came out that were leaked that the Department did not see as favorable as it related to jobs and the economy and the negative impact that it would have on that, so they stopped the process, shutting out the States violating the memorandum of understanding that they are required to work with the States on the rulemaking process leaving those States with no recourse but to withdraw from the process. In 2015, this Congress told them to reengage with the States, which they did to some degree, making it necessary for States to actually pay for the scientific evidence that was necessary for them to be engaged. So there are several problems that cause this to be an issue that we need to address today, and certainly making it a midnight rule, the last thing done as the administration walks out the door, qualifies this as something that we should be considering for many reasons and on many levels. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ), who is my good friend. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington State, whom I have been proud to serve with. I had an opportunity to visit his district, and I know natural resources are extremely important to him. I appreciate his yielding on what is germane to this discussion, which is basically trying to claw back regulations that had no basis in science that essentially were causing harm and taking away good paying jobs for Americans. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the underlying legislation, which disapproves of a midnight regulation that the Obama administration made with just 1 month left in his Presidency. The stream protection rule negatively targets coal country and will devastate communities that have already been hit hard by job losses and reduced mining activity making sure that America has affordable and reliable energy and electricity. Pennsylvania is the fifth largest coal producing State and generates roughly 25 percent of its electricity from coal fired power plants. Coalfired electricity provides roughly 30,000 jobs in my State, equaling nearly $8 billion in economic impact. Although coal continues to be an essential component of our energy mix, this rule duplicates many existing laws while providing very little environmental gain. What the rule does is expands the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement’s regulatory authority. In effect, this Federal agency would overtake the regulatory authorities of individual States. b1300 This makes no sense. States should be able to continue their own regulation of coal production. This is the epitome of a midnight rule that has more to do with empowering the Federal Government at the expense of coal miners’ jobs than it has to do with protecting streams. The Office of Surface Mining’s own reports show that virtually all coal mines have no offsite impacts. The reports year over year show that coal mines are being safely operated and the lands are being successfully restored thanks to the watchful eyes of the States that regulate 97 percent of the mines in the United States. This rule does nothing to protect our streams that State and Federal regulators are not already doing. We do not need a onesizefitsall approach from Washington, which rarely works. In order to bring realworld thinking back into the regulatory process, we must act quickly to stop this rule. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, both of my colleagues on the other side referred to the rule they seek to disapprove as a midnight rule. Well, I don’t know how you take 7 years of midnights that it took to develop this rule and call it a midnight rule—7 years. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ), my very good friend and ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly oppose H.J. Res. 38, which would disapprove the Department of the Interior’s stream protection rule. When the Obama administration announced the final stream protection rule, it was a victory for those who live in coal country. The rule prioritizes the health of our fellow Americans by establishing clear requirements for responsible surface coal mining, especially dangerous mountaintop removal mining. If this Obama rule were fully enforced, it would protect or restore 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests over the next two decades. At the time the rule was finalized, I called for stronger stream buffer zone protections, but the announced regulation was undoubtedly a win for human health, clean water, and our environment. I want to be very clear about what the stream protection rule does. This rule requires that mining companies avoid practices that permanently pollute streams and sources of drinking water, damage forests, and increase flood risks. The rule requires, for the first time, that streams around mining sites be monitored and tested for the presence of toxic chemicals, like lead and arsenic. This rule also requires mining companies to restore polluted streams and replant mined areas with native trees and vegetation. 
These provisions ensure that mining companies take responsibility for their actions and act to ensure that coal country communities do not suffer because of destructive mining practices. Now we are debating an illconceived resolution which would negate these important advances. If this rule were to be overturned, American families living near impacted streams and rivers will not be protected from toxic chemicals getting into their water. What is even more appalling is that, because the Congressional Review Act prevents substantially similar regulations from being developed in the future, this joint resolution means that these affected communities might never be protected from the impacts of mining waste in their water. Protecting our rivers and streams from the damaging impacts of mountaintop removal has been a priority for me, and it is why in past Congresses I have introduced the Clean Water Protection Act, which would end the dumping of mining waste into our country’s rivers and streams. I will be reintroducing that legislation this session. It is unfathomable that congressional Republicans would pass this joint resolution and doom generations of children and families to irreparable harm. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON ). Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. It is interesting to me that my colleagues on the other side take offense to this being referred to as a midnight rule. This is actually a midnight rule twice. Let’s look at how this thing started. In 2005, during the Bush administration, 5 years of effort went into codifying how coal mining operations should take place around streams. The last President announced, during his campaign, that he was going to make coalfired energy financially, economically impossible, thereby launching his war on coal. There was a lawsuit with the Bushera rule. The Interior Department and the administration settled, paying that settlement out of taxpayer dollars and then launching an effort to rewrite that rule. In 2011 when we came in, they were planning to release that rule in April of 2011. What took 5 years to codify, they wanted to redo in just 4 months. Not only that, but they left the States out of the equation. The States complained about that. No one in the administration was listening. When the contractors then told the truth about how many tens of thousands of jobs were going to be lost as a result of this rule, the administration fired the contractor that was doing the work. Not only that, they paid them in full. Now, go figure. We have been back and forth with the administration asking that the States be involved, asking that the rulemaking process be transparent, asking, if it really had to do with stream protection, why was it talking about and why was it going to be negatively impacting underground coal mining that takes place hundreds, if not thousands, of feet below the surface of the Earth. You answer me that. So, here we are today, and now we have the Congressional Review Act. I am so grateful that we have the opportunity to set the record straight and to do away with this rule now and forever. I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 38 when it comes to the floor this week. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, President Trump’s xenophobic executive order banning Syrian refugees and suspending emigration from certain countries is driven by fear. It demonstrates a callous indifference to human suffering; it ignores the Constitution; and it will not only tarnish our image abroad, but harm our national security. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up my good friend Representative LOFGREN ’s bill to overturn and defund this dangerous executive order. Let me be abundantly clear for people watching this debate. The question we are about to decide is: Should we even have a vote on undoing Trump’s order? A ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question will give us the opportunity to overturn this order. A ‘‘yes’’ vote means that the House will do nothing to stop Trump’s executive action. The American people watching this debate should take notice to see how their Representatives vote on this important motion, and they should hold their elected officials accountable. Did your Member of Congress turn a blind eye to Trump’s unconstitutional policy by voting ‘‘yes,’’ or did your Representative reject this attack on our core American values and vote ‘‘no?’’ Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOFGREN ), my good friend, to discuss this proposal. Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, the President’s executive order of Friday violates the law, it violates the Constitution, and it violates good sense. How does it violate the law? Section 202(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act specifically prohibits nationalitybased discrimination in the issuance of immigrant visas and other visas. That is what this order did. Now, the law is clear that individuals who pose a threat to the United States can—and I should add, should be— barred from the United States; but you can’t just legally make a blanket objection based on nationality and, I would add, based on religion. That is what the President’s order does. It suspends refugee admission completely for months. Who are these refugees? Most of the refugees admitted last year were from Burma and the Congo, not from Syria. They are people who have been vetted for years, many of whom are fleeing for their lives and will continue to live in fear. It does something else. It suspends admission even of legal permanent residents from seven countries, violating their rights to equal protection and to due process. People want to keep the country safe—we all do; of course, I do—but how does this order keep us safe? Let me just give an example. General Talib alKenani from Iraq commands the elite Americantrained counterterrorism forces that have been leading the fight against ISIS for 2 years. His family relocated to the U.S. for safety. He can’t visit them anymore. He said this: I have been fighting terrorism for 13 years and winning. Now my kids are asking: Am I a terrorist? I am a fourstar general, and I am banned from entering the United States. 
I ask you: How does this advance our safety by barring our allies who are fighting ISIS? It doesn’t. I have got to correct something else. People have said that President Obama had an order in 2011 barring immigrants from Iraq. That is false. We did additional vetting in 2011 because we wanted to make sure that anyone coming in was thoroughly examined. That slowed things down a little bit because there were new procedures, but there was never a halt to admission from those who are our allies in Iraq, those fighting ISIS with us. I would just like to say that, in addition to violating the law, causing hardship for families trying to visit people in the hospital, permanent residents who are engineers trying to come back to run their companies in Silicon Valley, this order is a gift to ISIS. They are already using it to recruit enemies of our country by saying: America is fighting Islam. As George Bush said when he was President, our argument, our fight is not with Islam. Our fight is with terrorism. To issue this order with the President’s rhetoric saying that we are going to make a distinction on who is admitted to the United States based on their religion is not only illegal, it is contrary to American values and it is contrary to our safety. So I hope that, instead of doing this antienvironment bill today, we will instead take up H.R. 724. This is a bill that would defund and rescind President Trump’s illadvised order from Friday. Let me just say this. I would like to issue a formal invitation to every Republican Member of this House to join 
me as a cosponsor of this bill. I will be sending out a formal note to each one later today, but you are on notice to please join us. We as American legislators need to make sure that the rule of law is upheld. Many of our constituents are very uncertain about whether the rule of law is going to survive this Presidency. Help give them faith and hope by cosponsoring this bill. b1315 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the good gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MOONEY ). Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule and the underlying joint resolution to begin the process of rolling back President Obama’s war on coal. That is the rule we are debating today; that is the bill before us, not to be confused with the other issue that is being discussed. I was proud that, in the last Congress, I was the lead sponsor of the STREAM Act, H.R. 1644, which would have prevented the implementation of a new coal regulation that would have cost upwards of 70,000 goodpaying jobs. My legislation passed the House of Representatives in January of 2016, with bipartisan support, and sent a clear message to President Obama’s administration that the socalled stream protection rule was bad policy. Unfortunately, my bill never received a vote in the U.S. Senate. Despite the clear message from Congress, the Obama administration, in the final days, issued a disastrous stream protection rule. Again, he did this as he was leaving the Presidency in the final days before he left office. But don’t let the clever name fool you. The new regulation will have farreaching impacts for the coal industry—an industry, I might add, that provides over 90 percent of the power generation for my home State of West Virginia. The rule prescribes a onesizefitsall approach in defiance of common sense and the Federal law. There is no need to rewrite over 400 regulations, as this rule does, other than as a blatant attempt to regulate the coal industry out of business. We cannot allow this rule to move forward, and thus we need to support the rule and the underlying joint resolution of disapproval. Let us not forget that former President Barack Obama promised that he would bankrupt the coal industry. People are losing their jobs and the dignity that comes with work. Our communities are also suffering. Fewer jobs means less economic investment and less hope. I encourage my colleagues to visit West Virginia or Appalachia and see firsthand what President Obama’s policies have done to our communities. It is heartbreaking to hear the stories and see the faces of struggling families as they try to pay their bills. I stand today with those communities in rolling back the policies that have caused so much harm and pain. These new regulations would be catastrophic to the coal industry and all of the hardworking American families that depend on coal to keep their energy costs low. The shame of it all is that it is preventable. We must end this war on coal now, and that process begins today. I made a promise to my constituents of the Second District of West Virginia that I would fight for the coal industry and bring back jobs to my State. Today is the first in many steps this Congress, along with President Donald Trump, will take to make good on the promises we made in November. Again, I encourage support for the rule and the underlying resolution of disapproval. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from wearing communicative badges while under recognition. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, would the Chair be so kind as to tell me how much time remains on both sides?

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BROWNLEY ) for a unanimous consent request. Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask this House to bring up the Lofgren bill, H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump’s refugee ban on Yazidi women from Iraq like Nada, who was not allowed to board a flight and remains separated from her husband, a former interpreter for the U.S. Army. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Did the gentlewoman make a unanimous consent request? 
Mr. HASTINGS. Yes, she did. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman from Washington has not yielded for that purpose. Therefore, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump’s refugee ban on individuals like the Syrian skin cancer researcher living in Germany whose visa to visit colleagues in Philadelphia has now been revoked. Let us vote. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. B OYLE ) for a unanimous consent request. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, you probably won’t be surprised to learn that I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump’s appalling refugee ban on individuals like the young scientist in Iran who was awarded a fellowship to study cardiovascular medicine at Harvard, but whose visa has now been indefinitely suspended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN ). Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump’s outrageous ban on Muslims so that the San Fernando Valley’s own Darrius Hicks, an American citizen, can be reunited with his wife, who is a humanitarian worker working with Afghan war victims in Iran. She has been denied even the chance to schedule a visa interview at our embassy in Abu Dhabi. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN ). Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump’s unconstitutional Muslim ban that led to a Stanford University graduate student who has lived in the United States since 1993 getting handcuffed and then detained at JFK airport for 5 hours. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) for a unanimous consent request. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump’s cold and callous refugee ban on travelers like the UK resident who holds an Iranian passport, was due to fly back to Glasgow via New York, and had her transit visa revoked. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ) for a unanimous consent request. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump’s refugee ban and help unify the family of Muktar and his wife, who spent 20 years in a refugee camp after fleeing Somalia, and will continue to be separated from their children who still live in the camp. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ) for a unanimous consent request. Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump’s refugee ban in light of mothers like Ran Chauhan, who arrived in the U.S. 5 years ago and is going through the naturalization process, but is separated from her sister and two children who are set to arrive in mid February. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) for a unanimous consent request. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump’s misguided refugee ban. Scheduled to arrive today in Toledo from wartorn Iraq was a fully vetted mother and her three young daughters, one of whom is less than a year old. They are forced to remain in Tunisia with their futures very uncertain. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. TONKO ) for a unanimous consent request. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump’s tragic refugee ban that would have barred women like the Syrian violinist who has performed at the White House and who is worried about her family that remain in Aleppo. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. TSONGAS ) for a unanimous consent request. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump’s refugee ban that keeps apart families like that of Luca Freschi, who had planned to move to Harvard Medical School in March but whose Iranian wife would not be able to join him. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ) for a unanimous consent request. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump’s refugee ban on women like Shadi Heidarifar, a philosophy student at the University of Tehran who was accepted to New York University, but is now unsure if she will be able to attend. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. b1345 
Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, with the Members who have come here and asked for unanimous consent and with its being denied by virtue of the gentleman from Washington’s not agreeing to the unanimous consent and with the notion in mind that the period for debate is what is to be recognized, my 
question is: Do the people who did come here and seek unanimous consent—although it was not accepted— have the opportunity to insert a statement in the RECORD that signifies their intentions with reference to the matter at hand? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members may insert remarks under general leave. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 5 minutes and 55 seconds remaining. The gentleman from Washington has 11
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCARTHY ), the majority leader of the Republican Conference. Mr. MCCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of the rule and the underlying legislation. Since the beginning of this Congress, we have devoted ourselves most prominently to a single goal: making Washington work for the people again. There is one thing here in Washington that consistently stands against our people, our economy, and our Constitution: the Federal bureaucracy. These agencies, bureaus, and departments—so numerous that nobody even knows how many there are—spend their lives thinking up new rules, and the rules they produce weigh down businesses, destroy jobs, and limit Americans’ rights. Career bureaucrats who can’t be voted out of office wield punishing authority with little to no accountability. They are agents of the status quo, and the revolving door of Federal employees moving to lobbying arms and consulting firms breed thousands of regulations that enrich the connected and powerful, sometimes at the great expense of the average American. This is the swamp. This is what opposes the people, and we are draining it. In recent weeks, this House has already started its twopart plan to strip the bureaucracy of its power. We started to change the structure in Washington by passing the REINS Act and the Regulatory Accountability Act. This week, we begin part two: targeting specific rules and stripping them from the books. There has been no industry in America that has been more regulated than energy. We are going to use the Congressional Review Act to repeal the stream protection rule that could destroy tens of thousands of mining jobs and put up to 64 percent of our country’s coal reserves off limits. Then we will take on President Obama’s 11th hour BLM methane emissions requirement. The oil and gas industry in America has already drastically reduced methane emissions even while increasing output, and the EPA already has the authority to regulate air emissions. Instead of helping the environment, this rule could cost America’s energy industry up to $1 billion by 2025 and force smaller operations, especially out West, to shut down and lay off employees. So, this Friday, the House will get rid of it. We will also take the ax to the SEC disclosure rule, which—now, if you can believe it—targets publicly traded American energy companies with even more regulatory compliance while it lets foreign companies off the hook. Washington should put American companies first, not put them at a disadvantage to their foreign competitors. Mr. Speaker, it is not just energy, which would be bad enough; but under President Obama, the bureaucracy has even threatened our basic constitutional rights. A new rule from the Social Security Administration would increase scrutiny on up to 4.2 million disabled Americans if they attempt to purchase firearms. For the completely unrelated circumstance of having someone help manage your finances, Social Security recipients could be kept from exercising their Second Amendment rights. In an affront to due process, the bureaucracy has even attempted to blacklist from Federal contracts any business that is accused of violating labor laws, and that could be before the company has a chance to defend itself in court. Every single one of these will be gone. With a vote in the House, a vote in the Senate, and President Trump’s signature, we will get rid of every one of these jobkilling and destructive regulations. The House is always at the service of the people. Now we are making the bureaucracy serve the people, too. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I inform the gentleman from Washington that I have no further requests for time and I am prepared to close. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time; so, yes, I am prepared to close. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. The majority leader just got through saying all of the things they are getting ready to do to drain the swamp. My feeling about what is happening— and I am speaking for myself—is they may very well drain the swamp, but if you take out the alligators and you put in crocodiles and you put in snakes, you have just made the swamp that much more dangerous to the American people. Mr. Speaker, the cavalier nature by which my friends across the aisle approach the awesome responsibility of governing is as disturbing as it is disappointing. They all own this now. They are in charge. Although I may understand the emotive desire to turn things on their head, they all would be wise to come to the realization sooner rather than later that their actions affect real people. All they have to do is just see what transpired this past weekend. The children, the elderly, the students who are waiting in airports across our country who are wishing to flee their oppressors or who are simply returning to their lives here at home are real people. They heard them being identified in the denied unanimous consent requests of my colleagues who came forward here. The children, the elderly, and all of the other folks who have to live in environments that are less clean and that are more likely to make them sick because of their flippant approach here today are real people. To be taken seriously, they must act seriously. Within that context, I would have to surmise that they all would be judged and found wanting. To truly convey the devastating consequences of what has happened these past few days, I could quote from one of the Founding Fathers about the ideal of freedom from religious persecution; or I could recite for them the inscription on the Statue of Liberty, which has guided and inspired generations of immigrants and refugees as they have come here to seek better lives for themselves and their families; or I could quote from Luke 10:25 wherein Jesus tells the parable of the Good Samaritan. I will not. Instead, I will leave them with the words of Dr. Amir Heydari, a bariatric surgeon and United States citizen who has lived in the United States for nearly 40 years and who was detained for questioning this past weekend: ‘‘I wanted to live somewhere that celebrated freedom—freedom of speech, freedom of religion, all of these kinds of things. That’s what everyone in the world thinks about the USA, and unfortunately, when these types of actions are taken, the image is not the same anymore.’’ I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and the underlying measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I would just like to take a minute to remind the American people and my friends across the aisle that we are here today, as the minority leader said, to begin the process of unwinding the burdensome regulations that are truly stifling job creation and hurting our friends and our families in each and every one of our neighborhoods across the country. Many from the other side have tried to distract with unrelated issues. I just want to be clear that the rule today does not address immigration in any way and that none of their requests went through the regular and bipartisan process to clear such requests. So let’s focus on why we are here. We are here because we must take a firm stand against the overly burdensome and restrictive regulations that have been issued in the waning days of the previous administration. By passing this CRA, we can rescind the final stream protection rule, which the OSM produced without input from the States—responsible for enforcing mining regulations—and which disregards 
existing regulations on both the State and the Federal levels that have proven to be effective. This regulation will have devastating effects on mining communities across the country and will lead to significant job losses and higher electricity costs— all while weakening U.S. energy security for decades. The stream protection rule will drastically reduce our access to coal and our ability to develop new clean coal technologies, which will result in reduced domestic energy protection and in tens of thousands of lost jobs in coalproducing States as well as in industries across the country that are reliant on this energy. If we fail to pass the underlying bill, the rule’s devastating impacts will be felt far and wide in our great land as approximately 78,000 mining jobs will be lost, which is in addition to the tens of thousands of mining jobs that have already been lost in the last 8 years. Mr. Speaker, coal is essential to the U.S. economy. It provides affordable energy that accounts for almost 40 percent of the Nation’s electricity supply—almost 20 percent in the gentleman’s home State of Florida. Because of its abundance, reliability, and affordability, electricity generated from coal is generally 30 percent cheaper than other alternative energy sources. Additionally, at current consumption rates, our country has more than 250 years of remaining coal reserves, ensuring that we will have energy security here at home for generations to come. Passing H.J. Res. 38 will protect American jobs and families from yet another burdensome regulation that has failed to follow the basic tenets of transparency, inclusivity, and cooperation with stakeholders, cooperating States, and, most importantly, the American people. Now is the time for Congress to overturn this unparalleled executive overreach and implement policies that protect communities that have been long forgotten by the former administration. The CRA was designed for this exact purpose, and we now have a unique opportunity to pass this legislation through both Chambers and see it signed into law. Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for the consideration of an important resolution that will ensure that mining communities and hardworking families are not pressed by another crippling Federal regulation. I believe this rule and the underlying legislation are strong measures that are important to our country’s future. I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 70 and the underlying joint resolution. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res. 70 and the joint resolution for which it would provide consideration, H.J. Res. 38, expressing disapproval of the Stream Protection Rule submitted by the Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. The Stream Protection Rule is a critical update to a decadesold regulation that provides clear and established requirements for responsible surface coal mining while protecting vital community health and economic opportunity across the United States. The rule, crafted in an extensive and transparent public process, includes reasonable reforms to avoid and minimize impacts on surface water, groundwater, fish, wildlife, and other natural resources. Grounded in sound, peerreviewed scientific evidence and modern technological advancements, the rule modernizes 33year old regulations to keep pace with modern mining techniques and incorporates in its guidance a broader scientific understanding of the deleterious effects caused by unmitigated surface coal mining activity. During the development of this critical rule, the Department of Interior received over 150,000 public comments, hosted 15 open houses and public meetings, and engaged in broad outreach to stake holders nationwide. This rule was carefully developed and thoroughly considered with all stakeholders provided a seat at the table. Ultimately, H.J. Res. 38 would undermine the Stream Protection Rule and begin the process to undue monumental steps in the right direction to protect the health, wellbeing, and economic prosperity of countless Americans living near coal mining sites. I strongly urge my colleagues to reject H. Res. 70, providing for the consideration of the harmful H.J. Res. 38. Any effort to undermine this important health, economic, and environmental protection results in a loselose situation for the American public and I oppose it. The material previously referred to by Mr. HASTINGS is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 70 O FFERED BY  MR. HASTINGS  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 724) to provide that the Executive Order entitled ‘‘Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States’’ (January 27, 2017), shall have no force or effect, to prohibit the use of Federal funds to enforce the Executive Order, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 724. THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
b1400 ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank Chairman SHUSTER , Subcommittee Chairman LOBIONDO , Ranking Members D EFAZIO and LARSEN , and their staff for the effort and work they put in to quickly see this measure through this committee. They do an excellent job, and it is always encouraging to work with such bright people. I also want to thank Leader MCCARTHY and his staff for their assistance in getting this measure to the floor. I look forward to working under their leadership to bring prosperity to the American people, including those in the territories. Mr. Speaker, the people of American Samoa desperately need improvement to their access to reliable transportation between the islands of Tutuila and Manu’a. The remote Manu’a islands are losing residents at an alarming pace, mostly due to the lack of reliable transportation; and it is causing a great hardship on the families and businesses who reside on these islands which lie 60 miles from the main island of Tutuila. Also, the lack of reliable transportation poses a severe health risk to those who need emergency medical care, as the only hospital in American Samoa is in Tutuila. My bill, H.R. 276, will help alleviate this issue by easing some of the burdensome red tape causing the issue, and I look forward to seeing it signed into law by the President. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. SABLAN ). Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 276, a bill to provide more reliable air service to the people of American Samoa for air travel within American Samoa. The Northern Mariana Islands are similar to American Samoa in many ways. Although the large majority of our population resides on Saipan, I have also several thousand constituents residing on the islands Tinian and Rota. We are fortunate that air travel between these islands is possible with the presence of commercial air travel. Unfortunately, in American Samoa, there are no U.S. carriers operating a route between Tutuila and Manu’a. So Polynesian Airlines, based out of Samoa, is the only carrier operating that route. H.R. 276, introduced by my good friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. RADEWAGEN ), presents a commonsense approach to cut red tape and allow regular flights to continue between these islands. It would help the people of American Samoa conduct business, visit relatives, and access health care. It has my full support, and I ask the House to pass this commonsense legislation. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. L OBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. LARSEN ) and the staff for their help on this. I urge all Members to support H.R. 276, as amended. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LOBIONDO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 276, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
Mr. L OBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. The amendment was agreed to. 
FIRST RESPONDER IDENTIFICATION OF EMERGENCY NEEDS IN DISASTER SITUATIONS Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 58) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a study on the circumstances which may impact the effectiveness and availability of first responders before, during, or after a terrorist threat or event, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 58 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘First Responder Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster Situations’’ or the ‘‘FRIENDS Act’’. 
SEC. 2. CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MAY IMPACT FIRST RESPONDERS DURING A TERRORIST EVENT. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the Committees on Homeland Security and Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report that describes select State and local programs and policies, as appropriate, related to the preparedness and protection of first responders. The report may include information on— (1) the degree to which such programs and policies include consideration of the presence of a first responder’s family in an area impacted by a terrorist attack; (2) the availability of personal protective equipment for first responders; (3) the availability of home Medkits for first responders and their families for biological incident response; and (4) other related factors. (b) CONTEXT .—In preparing the report required under subsection (a), the Comptroller General of the United States may, as appropriate, provide information— (1) in a format that delineates high risk urban areas from rural communities; and (2) on the degree to which the selected State and local programs and policies included in such report were developed or are being executed with funding from the Department of Homeland Security, including grant funding from the State Homeland Security Grant Program or the Urban Area Security Initiative under sections 2002 and 2003, respectively, of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 603 and 604). (c) HOMELAND SECURITY CONSIDERATION .— After issuance of the report required under subsection (a), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consider such report’s findings and assess its applicability for Federal first responders. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 58, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First, I welcome the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) to the committee. I look forward to working together to do good work for the American people. Mr. Speaker, firefighters, police, EMS, and other first responders are critical to our Nation’s emergency management system. First responders leave their own families, even during disasters, to protect you and me. As recently as this past August, we saw devastating flooding in Baton Rouge and southeast Louisiana. The flooding touched every home, including the homes of firefighters, police, hospital workers, and other first responders. First responders focused on rescuing flood victims, while they knew their own homes were flooded and their own families were homeless. This legislation would require a report on the State and local programs and policies in place to prepare and protect first responders and their families in times of disaster. Taking care of first responders and their families gives our firefighters, police, and other critical emergency personnel the peace of mind to focus on the task at hand, rather than worrying whether their family is safe and taken care of. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 58, the First Responder Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster Situations, or the FRIENDS Act. This bill requires the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, to submit a report on how State and local programs affect the preparedness and protection of first responders. Congress and the American people need to know whether these programs consider circumstances that may affect a first responder’s ability to respond to an event. In particular, the bill requires GAO to examine the degree to which State and local programs and policies consider the presence of a first responder’s family in an area impacted by a terrorist attack, the availability of personal protective equipment for first responders, and the availability of home MedKits for first responders and their families for biological incident response. While we are asking GAO to examine State and local programs and policies, some of these programs and policies may be funded with Federal dollars. To that extent, Congress needs to know whether these federally funded programs and policies are as effective as possible to prepare and protect first responders. This month, the State of Georgia received two Presidential disaster declarations from devastating tornados in districts neighboring my own. While these are not terrorist attacks, these tornados highlight the fact that first responders are often called upon to respond to events in their own communities where they and their loved ones live. Our heros immediately respond to the call of duty, even though they themselves or their loved ones may be impacted. Thus, it is important that State and local preparedness programs are designed and developed to consider all situations that may impact first responder preparedness. b1415 We must do everything we can to support our first responders who are often called upon to put their lives on the line to help others, even when their own families need them. So I thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), for introducing this bill and for her diligent work on this issue. In response to my chairman’s welcome, I would have to respond by saying I am just giddy about being a part of this subcommittee, and I look forward to working with him and his staff to make things good for America and for our future. I urge my colleagues to join in my support of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), the sponsor of this legislation. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia and, likewise, congratulate him for his leadership on the Transportation Committee, along with his chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, which committee has had special emphasis on protecting and responding to our first responders, and so I am excited about the fact of moving this bill forward. I thank the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I thank my Homeland Security Committee for moving this forward through an amendment process and now, ultimately, onto the floor of the House. I rise, Mr. Speaker, enthusiastically, in support of H.R. 58, the First Responder Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster Situations, or FRIENDS, Act. I thank my chairman, Mr. MCCAUL, and Ranking Member THOMPSON for the valuable assistance and support in bringing this important bill before the House for consideration during the 114th Congress. We are now in the 115th Congress. I appreciate Chairman SHUSTER and Ranking Member D EFAZIO for allowing the FRIENDS Act now to come forward, which was referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to be considered on today’s suspensions. The FRIENDS Act reflects what America is all about. The FRIENDS Act reflects what we, as Members of Congress, are all about. How many of us stop by fire stations, pat a police officer of many different levels on the back, say ‘‘thank you,’’ and recognize that that 911 number is a very special number to many of our constituents. But more importantly, when natural disasters or manmade disasters such as the horrific and heinous terrorist act of 9/11 occur, who are among the first to come? It is the first responders, and they go to faraway places. The FRIENDS Act reflects stakeholder input and bipartisan collaboration with the majority. I thank the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Association of State EMS Officials working with me, and The International Emergency Management Society for their valuable assistance and input regarding the FRIENDS Act. Our two committees, Transportation and Infrastructure and Homeland Security, really respond in a bipartisan way. Our Homeland Security Committee will be facing many mountains of concerns dealing with intelligence issues, dealing with the issues with Russia, dealing with the issues of executive orders, but we do know that we come together to honor our first responders that are our Nation’s heroes. They run into burning buildings; they rescue people trapped by dangerous floods and put themselves in harm’s way to protect others. Just last week, in San Bernardino, we saw the brave first responders heroically pursue two individuals that fled from the scene of a deadly attack recently over the last year. To do their jobs, first responders must leave their homes and families while the rest of us cling to ours. Whether it is to deal with the aftermath of a terrorist attack, as I indicated, or the fires, hurricanes, and tornadoes that we have seen across America—devastation of so many of our constituents, loss of life—first responders leave their homes to ensure that others are safe. Unfortunately, today, first responders are asked to answer the call to action without knowing whether their families will be safe as the work to rescue others proceeds. Our first responders deserve better. The FRIENDS Act directs the Government Accountability Office to conduct a comprehensive review of policies and programs designed to ensure that first responders are able to do their jobs, and effectively, by assessing, among other things, measures taken to ensure first responder families are safe, first of all, and the availability of personal protective equipment exists so that they can come home to their families. It was particularly noticed during 9/ 11. For those of us who were able to go to Ground Zero as they were still continuing the recovery, many of you know they continued to recover for months and months and months, and you saw the kind of exposure those first responders had. During committee consideration of the FRIENDS Act, my friend from New York (Mr. HIGGINS ) offered an amendment to authorize GAO to evaluate the availability of home med kits for first responders and their families in assessing the preparedness of first responders. I was pleased to support the Higgins amendment, and it adds to this bill. H.R. 58 also directs GAO to distinguish policies available in highrisk urban areas which may be better resourced, and rural areas where efforts to ensure preparedness for first responders and their families may require creative leveraging of resources. This provision will ensure that the information included in the report will be applicable and adaptable by various communities across the country as they work to better protect their protectors. Let us remember both the rural community as well as the urban community. Additionally, the FRIENDS Act directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to review its findings and assess whether the policies identified could be applicable to Federal first responders. The FRIENDS Act has been endorsed by the International Association of Fire Chiefs and a number of other organizations. Before I conclude, let me again thank all of my colleagues. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter from the International Association of Fire Chiefs and, as well, the National Association of State EMS Officials. INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION  
OFFIRECHIEFS , Fairfax, VA, January 31, 2017. Hon. SHEILA JACKSON LEE, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE JACKSON LEE: On behalf of the approximately 12,000 fire and emergency service leaders of the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I would like to thank you for introducing H.R. 58, the First Responder Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster Situations (FRIENDS) Act. The IAFC supports this legislation, because it will examine an important issue facing the nation’s first responders during a major terrorist attack: adequate preparedness for the first responders’ families. During terrorist incidents, fire, law enforcement and EMS officials will be called upon to take heroic actions to protect the public and provide fire and emergency medical response. In the case of a largescale incident or biological attack, the families of these first responders also will be at risk. Based on the experience of IAFC members during the response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the 2014 response to potential Ebola incidents in the United States, I know that the welfare of the first responders’ families weighs heavily on them as they serve the public. It is important that federal, state, and local officials make plans to provide for the safety of first responders’ families in order to ensure strong morale among local fire, law enforcement, and EMS officials during a major terrorist attack. Thank you for introducing this important legislation. We look forward to working with you to pass this legislation in the House of Representatives. Sincerely, FIRECHIEF JOHND. S INCLAIR , President and Chairman of the Board. 
OFSTATE EMS O FFICIALS , Falls Church, VA, September 28, 2015. Re: Expressing Support for the Jackson Lee Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute to H.R. 2795. Hon. MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman, House Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. MARTHA MCSALLY , Chairman, Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. BENNIE G. T HOMPSON , Ranking Member, House Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. DONALD M. P YNE, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. We are writing to express our support for the Jackson Lee Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute titled, the ‘‘Families of Responders Identification of Emergency Needs in Designated Situations’’ or the ‘‘FRIENDS Act.’’ This bill would provide an important report on the state of family support planning for the families of first responders. We believe that Federal family support planning is important to homeland security because this area of continuity of operations planning addresses the health and safety needs of first responder families during terrorist attacks or incidents as well as other emergencies. The FRIENDS Act will be an 
important first step in engaging the first responder community on the role of family in preparedness and continuity of operations. The FRIENDS Act would also engage first responder organizations to get their perspectives on best practices in family support planning programs on the local and state levels. For these reasons, we support the FRIENDS Act of 2015. Sincerely, PAULR. P ATRICK , President, National Association of State EMS Officials. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentlewoman. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is important to know of the important role that the International Association of Fire Chiefs play in the lives of first responders and their advocacy for their fellow brothers and sisters—and they call them their fellow brothers and sisters. I want to briefly read their words: 
Dear Representative J ACKSON LEE, On behalf of the approximately 12,000 fire and emergency service leaders of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, I would like to thank you for introducing H.R. 58, the First Responder Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster Situations, FRIENDS, Act. The IAFC supports the legislation because it will examine an important issue facing the Nation’s first responders during a major terrorist attack, adequate preparedness for the first responders’ families. 
It goes on to list terrorist incidents, fire, and law enforcement, and EMS officials will be called upon to take heroic action, and it recounts that their concern is what is happening to their family under these circumstances. In a letter from the National Association of State EMS Officials which I will insert into the RECORD , they indicate in their letter: 
We are writing to express our support for the Jackson Lee amendment, which was the bill the Families of Responders Identification of Emergency Needs in Designated Situations. This bill would make an important report on the state of family support planning for the families of first responders. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to my colleagues for their assistance as we move the FRIENDS Act forward, but I am more grateful to those first responders who unselfishly put themselves forward and in danger to help our constituents and help all of us. To their families, we owe them the responsibility of ensuring that they are safe during the time of their loved ones being on the front lines of saving others. I ask my colleagues to support the FRIENDS Act, H.R. 58. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 58, the ‘‘First Responder Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster Situations, or ‘‘Friends’ Act’’, and yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank Chairman MCCAUL and Ranking Member THOMPSON for the valuable assistance and support in bringing this important bill before the House for consideration during the 114th Congress. I appreciate and thank Chairman BILLSHUSTER and Ranking Member P ETER A. D EFAZIO for allowing the FRIENDS Act, which was referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to be considered under today’s suspensions. The FRIENDS Act embodies the important and fundamental idea that we have an obligation to ensure that the first responders who protect our loved ones in emergencies have the peace of mind that comes from knowing that their loved ones are safe while they do their duty. During terrorist incidents, fire, law enforcement, and EMS officials will be called upon to take heroic actions to protect the public and provide fire and emergency medical response. The FRIENDS Act reflects stakeholder input and bipartisan collaboration with the Majority. I thank the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Association of State EMS Officials, and the International Emergency Management Society for their valuable assistance and support for the FRIENDS Act. I also thank Kay Goss, the President of the International Emergency Management Society, who provided technical assistance on the work of first responders to prepare for catastrophic events. I am passionate about the work of those who dedicate themselves to public service. I hold in high regard the service of firefighters, law enforcement officers, emergency response technicians, nurses, emergency room doctors, and the dozens of other professionals who are the ultimate public servants. First responders are called to serve and few outside of their ranks can understand why they do the work they do each day—placing their lives in harm’s way to save a stranger. Law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and emergency medical technicians make our lives safer, while often at the same time putting their own lives at risk. In the case of a largescale incident or biological attack, the families of these first responders also will be at risk. Based upon the experience of International Fire Chiefs, which endorsed the FRIENDS Act, the members’ experiences during their response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the 2014 response to potential Ebola incidents in the United States, know that the welfare of their families weighs heavily on first responders as they serve the public. It is important that federal, state, and local officials make plans to provide for the safety of first responders’ families in order to ensure strong morale among local fire, law enforcement, and EMS officials during a major terrorist attack. H.R. 58 provides Congress an opportunity to let our first responders know that we know they have families and loved ones who they leave behind when they are called to duty, and their families will be protected in the first responder absence. The GAO study that will be provided as a result of this bill will report on what is being done by local and state governments to address the needs of first responder families when threats like Hurricanes Sandy, Hugo, and Katrina hit communities, or when a terrorist attack like the ones seen in New York and Boston occur. The report required by the Jackson Lee FRIENDS Act will also provide information on the availability of personal protective equipment for first responders. The issue of personal protective equipment was an acute problem for front line first responders during the 2014 Ebola crisis. First responders, including EMTs, emergency room doctors and nurses as well as law enforcement and fire department professionals, were not prepared for the crisis: 1. Nearly 80 percent of first responders report that their hospital had not communicated to them any policy regarding potential admission of patients infected by Ebola; 2. 85 percent said their hospital had not provided education on Ebola that allowed the nurses to interact and ask questions of patients; 3. Onethird said their hospital had insufficient supplies of eye protection (face shields or side shields with goggles) and fluid resistant/impermeable gowns; and 4. Nearly 40 percent said their hospital did not have plans to equip isolation rooms with plastic covered mattresses and pillows and discard all linens after use; fewer than 10 percent said they were aware their hospital does have such a plan in place. The Centers for Disease Control and only a few hospitals around the country with infectious disease units knew the right protocols and had the right protective gear to be used when treating an Ebola patient. Ebola in the United States was a frightening experience for many, but I think we saw the great work that first responders do each day— our doctors and nurses went to work and treated the sick and did what they always do—they took care of us. During the 114th Congress the Homeland Security Committee unanimously voted to report the FRIENDS Act favorably to the full House, which passed the measure by an overwhelming margin and in support of local, state and federal first responders. The Comptroller General’s comprehensive review of the range of policies and programs in place at the State level to address the preparedness and protection of first responders will also delineate high risk urban areas and rural communities; and the degree to which selected state policies were developed or executed with funding from the DHS Grant Programs or Urban Area Security Initiative authorized by the Homeland Security Act. The report’s focus will be on the presence of the family of first responders in an area affected by a terrorist attack and the availability of essential personal protective equipment. This will be the first report that focuses on the family as a critical factor that should be considered in the work of first responders during times of crisis such as a terrorist attack or public emergency like in the massive flooding that occurred in the city of Houston last year and the year before. The wellbeing of family members is a factor that one would expect to weigh on a first responder called to respond to a terrorist attack or unprecedented emergency. The bravery or dedication of first responders is not in question—they are the people who run into burning buildings to save people whom they may never have met. They are some of the best among us and we appreciate their dedication and service. Finally, the FRIENDS Act requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider the report’s findings and their applicability for federal first responders. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Natalie Matson, of the Committee’s majority staff and 
Moira Bergin, of the Committee’s minority staff, both of whom worked closely with Lillie Coney on my staff on the FRIENDS Act. I also thank the staff of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for their efforts to bring the bill before the full House for consideration. I ask all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 58, the FRIENDS Act. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 58, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 58, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INSIDER THREAT AND MITIGATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 666) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish the Insider Threat Program, and for other purposes.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KING) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP SON) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the legislation. Recent highprofile cases of government employees leaking classified information have caused drastic damage to U.S. national security and diplomacy. The names Snowden and Manning are now synonymous with the term ‘‘insider threat.’’ Unfortunately, Snowden, Manning, and others were able to conduct their traitorous work undetected because the government had at one time vetted and granted them access to secure facilities and information systems. In response to these cases, it is vital that Congress ensure Federal agencies have the tools to detect and disrupt future insider threat situations before damage is done. H.R. 666, in contrast to its unholy numbering, has the important and respectable goal of authorizing and expanding insider threat detection and mitigation efforts at the Department of Homeland Security. 
DHS has over 115,000 employees with access to classified information and many more with access to law enforcement sensitive data. Unauthorized disclosures of classified information, whether deliberate or unwitting, represent a significant threat to national security. The very nature of modern communication systems, as well as DHS’ important informationsharing role with State and local partners, adds complexity to the challenge and requires thoughtful programs to educate employees and enhance DHSwide detection capabilities. The bill directs DHS to develop a strategy for the Department to identify, prevent, mitigate, and respond to insider threats and requires DHS to ensure that personnel understand what workplace behavior may be indicative of a potential insider threat and how their activity on DHS networks will be monitored. The bill codifies a comprehensive insider threat program at DHS that can be implemented through the Department and its component agencies and, most importantly, reinforces the importance of preventing future insider attacks. I want to thank Homeland Security Chairman MCCAUL, Ranking Member THOMPSON , and Congressmen D AN DONOVAN and L OUBARLETTA for working with me to bring this bill to the floor. The same bill passed the House floor in November 2015 by voice vote. Unfortunately, lastminute scheduling issues with the Senate prevented the bill from reaching the President’s desk. I am pleased that the House is willing to take up this measure so quickly in the new Congress so we can move it through the process. I look forward to working with the Senate to move this measure forward. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can establish a comprehensive, transparent, DHSwide insider threat program. I urge support for the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 666, the Department of Homeland Security Insider Threat and Mitigation Act of 2017. H.R. 666, the Department of Homeland Security Insider Threat and Mitigation Act of 2017, authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to address the homeland and national security risk posed by trusted insiders. Typically, trusted insiders are given unrestricted access to missioncritical assets such as personnel, facilities, and computer networks. While DHS, like other Federal agencies, conducts extensive vetting of prospective employees, there is a risk that someone with insider status exploits their position to damage the United States through espionage, terrorism, or the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive national security information. As the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I am supportive of the Department of Homeland Security’s current Insider Threat Program. It is targeted at preventing and detecting when a vetted DHS employee or contractor with access to U.S. Government resources, including personnel, facilities, information, equipment, networks, and systems, exploits such access for nefarious, terroristic, or criminal purposes. b1430 Though I support the DHS program, I do have some concerns about DHS and other Federal agencies deploying continuous evaluation programs without transparency and congressional oversight. I am concerned that Federal agencies, with the understandable urge to protect their IT systems and facilities, are racing to acquire the capability before knowing whether such costly systems are even effective. Therefore, I would like to reiterate to this Congress, as I did last Congress, that prior to establishing any such program, under which certain DHS employees would be subjected to ongoing automated credit, criminal, and social media monitoring, the Department engage Congress about not only the potential costs and benefits of such a program but what protections would be in place for workers subject to such a program. Mr. Speaker, we live at a time when the threats to our Nation are complex. When this bill was considered last Congress, the prospect that a foreign intelligence agency would carry out an espionage campaign to influence the outcome of our Presidential election was material for the movies or for a good spy thriller. Today, in light of the Russian Government’s actions in the 2016 elections, we have a greater appreciation for the importance of counterintelligence efforts. As such, this bill is particularly timely. None of us wants to see someone exploit their access to DHS networks to carry out cybercrimes or other criminal activity. Even as DHS works to detect and prevent such threats, it is important that such activities be carried out in a transparent way so as not to compound the chronic morale challenges that exist within its workforce. Each time DHS considers making an adjustment to its insider threat program, thoughtful consideration must be paid to whether the operational drawbacks and costs for such an adjustment outweigh the benefits of such a change. That said, I commend General TAYLOR, the previous Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis at DHS, for the attention he gave to the insider threat challenge. I look forward to continuing to work with the Department’s successor to bolster security within the Department. I would also like to give Mr. KING particular credit for his interest in this effort to make sure that problems don’t come from the inside if we can help it. With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 666. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, at the outset, let me thank the ranking member for his support and for his kind words, and let me fully agree with him on the outstanding job General TAYLOR did during his time at DHS and throughout his career in public service. Mr. Speaker, on a daily basis, adversaries are targeting DHS and other Federal agencies seeking to acquire sensitive information. U.S. citizens with trusted access to government facilities and electronic networks have been responsible for some of the most damaging attacks to the U.S. Government. This bill provides the framework for DHS to implement an insider threat program that identifies and disrupts malicious insiders who seek to do the Department and its employees harm. It also seeks to protect the Department’s workforce by conducting a transparent process to reinforce cyber hygiene, data security, and an awareness of malicious activity through a robust training program. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KING) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 666. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY CLEARANCE MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION ACT Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 697) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to improve the management and administration of the security clearance processes throughout the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KING) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP SON) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 697, the Department of Homeland Security Clearance Management and Administration Act, and I commend the gentleman from Mississippi for sponsoring it. A security clearance is a privilege granted to individuals who have pledged to protect the American people from threats domestically and abroad. DHS has approximately 115,000 employees with varying access to classified materials. One important element of H.R. 697 is the requirement for the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct an inventory of the Department’s positions that require security clearances and assess what positions may be duplicative or are no longer necessary. It is just good government to ensure that individuals still have a need to know. In 2013, thenDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper called the number of individuals with clearances ‘‘too high.’’ In a memo to government agencies, Director Clapper expressed his concern with the growing number of individuals with access to classified information, particularly TS and SCI clearances. Security clearances are costly to investigate, adjudicate, and maintain. This bill would ensure that DHS conducts a thorough accounting of its workforce needs and reduces the number of positions if determined appropriate. The bill also includes requirements for additional transparency on how security clearances are adjudicated, including when there are reasons to suspend or deny a security clearance. H.R. 697, introduced by Ranking Member THOMPSON , is an example of the accounting that each Federal department should be conducting today and will lead to a more effective and lean Department of Homeland Security in the future. The bill is identical to the version the House passed last Congress by voice vote. I urge support for the gentleman’s bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 697, the Department of Homeland Security Clearance Management and Administration Act. Mr. Speaker, I want to start off by thanking the chairman of the Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee, Mr. KING, as well as Chairman MCCAULfor their support for my bill. I reintroduced H.R. 697, the Department of Homeland Security Clearance Management and Administration Act, to reform how the Department manages its security clearance processes. This measure, which the House approved by voice vote in November, 2015, specifically addresses how DHS carries out the complex and expensive tasks of, number one, identifying positions that warrant security clearances; number two, investigating candidates for clearances; and number three, administering its clearance adjudications, denials, suspensions, revocations, and appeals processes. Since September 11, there has been a massive proliferation of classified material across the Federal Government. Along with the enormous growth in classified material holdings has come a sizeable growth in the number of Federal positions requiring security clearances. H.R. 697 reflects regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to help ensure that national security positions are properly designated by Federal agencies. By doing so, agencies can avoid the costly exercise of recruiting, investigating, and hiring individuals at clearance levels and salaries well above what is necessary. Simply put, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 697 seeks to put DHS on a path to right sizing the number of classified positions in its workforce. Specifically, my bill directs DHS to ensure that the sensitivity levels of national security positions are designated appropriately across the Department and its components. It also requires the Department’s chief security officer to audit national security positions periodically to ensure that such security designations are still appropriate. Additionally, the bill directs DHS to develop a plan to ensure that adjudications of eligibility for a security clearance are done accurately across the Department. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, in response to growing security threats from data breaches, my bill also provides safeguards for the protection of applicants’ personal information. Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, passage of H.R. 697 will help ensure that the Department of Homeland Security takes targeted steps to improve critical aspects of its secured clearance program. If enacted, H.R. 697 would make DHS a leader among Federal agencies with respect to security clearance and position designation practices. With that, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues’ support, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, thank the gentleman and commend him for his leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 697, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KING) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 697. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 642, the Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2017, introduced by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, my good friend, Congressman LOUBARLETTA . The bill before us today, Mr. Speaker, is focused on improving the partnership between the Department of Homeland Security and the National Network of Fusion Centers. The bill amends section 210A of the Homeland Security Act to clarify and enhance partnership between DHS and fusion centers. As the United States is facing the highest threat environment since 9/11, it is vital that State and local agencies are receiving realtime threat information and have access to Federal intelligence and support. This was a key lesson learned from the 9/11 terror attacks, and, unfortunately, reinforced after the 2012 Boston Marathon bombing. DHS has a legal mandate to assist fusion centers in this effort, and H.R. 642 helps move the ball forward. The threat of lone wolves inspired by ISIS and other radical Islamist terrorist groups are not deteriorating, and it is critical that there are strong partnerships between the Federal Government and State and local law enforcement agencies. This bill will help the Department and the national network maintain and improve their current partnership. This bill passed the House last Congress by voice vote, and I am pleased the House is willing to move it again this year. I want to thank Congressman BARLETTA for leading the committee’s efforts in developing this responsible and commonsense legislation. Congressman BARLETTA ’s background as a businessman, city councilman, mayor, and Congressman has left him with a strong commitment to public safety and security. b1445 It has been a pleasure to work with LOUon the Homeland Security Committee, where he was a vocal advocate for information sharing. I urge my colleagues to support this bill to ensure that the partnership between DHS and the national network is strong and agile to protect the United States against the everchanging terrorism threat. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND  INFRASTRUCTURE , Washington, DC, January 31, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAUL: I write concerning H.R. 642, the Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2017. This legislation includes 
matters that I believe fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 642, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure agrees to forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee’s Rule X jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members of the Committee to any conference committee named to consider such provisions. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Sincerely, BILLSHUSTER , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, January 31, 2017. Hon. BILLSHUSTER , Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN SHUSTER : Thank you for your interest in H.R. 642, the ‘‘Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2017.’’ I appreciate your cooperation in allowing this legislation to move expeditiously before the House of Representatives. I understand that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, to the extent it may have a jurisdictional claim, will not seek a sequential referral on the bill; and therefore, there has been no formal determination as to its jurisdiction by the Parliamentarian. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that the absence of a decision on this bill at this time does not prejudice any claim the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure may have held or may have on similar legislation in the future. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 642, the Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, last Congress, the House approved this measure to update the law to reflect the evolution of the Department of Homeland Security’s National Network of Fusion Centers. H.R. 642 clarifies that fusion centers are State and locally owned and operated, and requires the Department’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis to provide support to centers in its network by deploying personnel and providing access to timely information. Importantly, H.R. 642 also adds several new responsibilities to DHS’ Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis with respect to the grant guidance, nationwide suspicious activity reports, and fusion centers’ access to information. The bill makes several technical changes to existing law to help ensure more information sharing resources are made available to Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials at our National Network of Fusion Centers. If enacted, H.R. 642 will go a long way to provide States and localities that have invested significant resources in standing up fusion centers with the support they need to keep their communities, and ultimately the Nation, secure. I urge passage of H.R. 642. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ), the sponsor of the legislation. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. KINGof New York for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, the Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2017. I thank Mr. KING of New York and Chairman MCCAULfor working with me to introduce this legislation. The purpose of my bill is to clarify and enhance the partnership between the Department of Homeland Security and the National Network of Fusion Centers. The bill amends the existing statute to update the Department’s responsibilities for sharing information with State and local law enforcement and other emergency personnel within the National Network of Fusion Centers. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, State and local governments created fusion centers as a way to communicate Federal homeland security information to State and local law enforcement officials, as well as fuse State and locally collected information with Federal intelligence. Congress supported this partnership by mandating that the Office of Intelligence and Analysis within the Department of Homeland Security coordinate and share information with fusion centers. There are now 78 State and locally owned fusion centers across the country. I would especially like to recognize the work of the Pennsylvania Criminal Intelligence Center, PaCIC, which is run by the Pennsylvania State Police. In 2015, our fusion center received the Fusion Center of the Year Award from the National Fusion Center Association. I want to congratulate the men and women working at PaCIC for their commitment to security and public safety. They share vital information with police departments that keep officers and our citizens safe. PaCIC provides intelligence and information products to over 1,200 local, State, and Federal criminal justice agencies, while also working with over 6,000 private and public center partners to also share information to help protect critical infrastructure and key resources. Our center has been nationally recognized for their training and compliance with issues of privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. They produce documents that highlight threats and scams that target Pennsylvanians, and help make sure that local police departments have information on public events, ranging from the Little League World Series to the visit of Pope Francis. A significant amount of progress has been made by States and fusion centers within the national network to improve information sharing and analytic support. Many centers, including PaCIC, provide all crime, all hazard support. They also maintain a focus on our homeland security missions, including protecting critical information and sharing suspicious activity reporting. H.R. 642 recognizes the progress and focuses on enhancing the Department of Homeland Security’s responsibility to support, share information, and coordinate with fusion centers. This includes improving coordination with other Federal departments that provide better operational intelligence, reduce inefficiencies, and coordinate nationwide suspicious activity reporting. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee and a former mayor, I have heard concerns raised by law enforcement in my district and elsewhere about the lack of information and coordination from several DHS component agencies, including ICE and CBP. To address this issue, I included language in this bill to direct the Department to ensure that each component is providing information and personnel to work with fusion centers. To address the need for better accountability, language is included throughout the bill requiring DHS to coordinate with fusion centers and State Homeland Security Advisers in carrying out the assigned responsibilities. Additionally, there is a requirement for the Department to submit a report to Congress on their efforts, including the components to support fusion centers, and specifically report on how they are meeting the requirements that are set forth in this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill so that we can add important requirements and accountability in how the Department of Homeland Security interacts and shares information with key State and local stakeholders. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ). Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 642, the Fusion Center Enhancement Act. I spent the last 2 years traveling across the State of Kansas, and was reminded time and time again that national security is a topthree issue for my residents. 
Why is this? After years of turmoil and the lack of strong American leadership, people in Kansas no longer feel safe. This legislation that my colleague from Pennsylvania has introduced will ensure that those on the front lines of protecting our Nation’s citizens have access to the critical information they need to evaluate threats to protect our national security. Fusion centers conduct analyses and facilitate information sharing, which are necessary and fundamental actions that assist State and local law enforcement in preventing and responding to crime and terrorism. Just this last week I had the opportunity to go back to meet with staff and visit the Kansas Threat Integration Center in Topeka, Kansas. I can assure you the work they are doing is vital to our national security and the citizens of my State. They are leveraging partnerships with the private sector and focused on protecting our critical infrastructure. I encourages my colleagues to support H.R. 642. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to express my support for this bill. I urge passage of H.R. 642, the Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2017, which, if enacted, would send the message that Congress values the investment that States and localities have made to address the challenges of a post9/11 world and stand with DHS in supporting the National Network of Fusion Centers. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 642. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge support of the gentleman’s bill. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 642 in order to bolster the information sharing environment within the Department of Homeland Security and between the Department and State and local stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KING) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 642. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP SON) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, nearly 16 years after September 11th, our country continues to face the persistent threat of terrorism. From ISIS to al Qaeda, radical groups continue to target the United States and our way of life. Last year alone, we saw more than 131 plots by ISIS alone against the West. As terrorists continue to evolve, this body must ensure that the security measures in place to protect the United States and its citizens adapt to meet these threats. Faced with the most dangerous threat environment since 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security needs to continue to focus on its core mission of protecting Americans from these threats in an increasingly expeditious manner. I am proud that this body is working to continue to strengthen our national security by debating the bill before us today. H.R. 526, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board Act of 2017, will help integrate intelligence, operations, and policy decisions to ensure the Department of Homeland Security remains adaptable, while eliminating waste and duplication. This same bill was introduced last year and passed the House by overwhelming majority. Mr. Speaker, with open investigations in all 50 States and more than 119 arrests, this body must continue to take action to protect our homeland. Further, these threats will likely expand as foreign fighters flee places like Raqqa and Mosul. Mr. Speaker, the world is witnessing the greatest convergence of radical Islamic threats in its history. More than 40,000 jihadists fighters, many of whom came from the West, have traveled to 
the battlefield in Syria and Iraq. With this threat environment in mind, I have introduced H.R. 526. Initially established at the end of 2010, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board brings together the Department of Homeland Security’s top echelon counterterrorism decisionmakers to quickly respond to threats. While my colleagues and I were conducting the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorists and Foreign Fighter Travel, we found that the Counterterrorism Advisory Board, or CTAB as it is referred to, had neither been codified nor had its charter kept pace with evolving terrorist threats. That is why we need to pass this bill: to ensure that DHS is effectively integrating intelligence, operations, and policy to better compile and understand threat information to successfully fight terrorism. This legislation formally establishes the CTAB in law and makes it the Department’s central coordination body for counterterrorism activities. b1500 The bill also updates the Board’s charter to effectively respond to tomorrow’s challenges and requires the Secretary to appoint a coordinator for counterterrorism to oversee the Board’s activities. Additionally, this legislation requires the CTAB to advise the Secretary of Homeland Security on the issuance of terrorism alerts, ensuring that top counterterrorism intelligence officials play a key role in developing these critical notices and providing them to the public. Finally, this bill ensures continued congressional oversight by requiring DHS to report on the status and activities of the CTAB so that they can be certain it is meeting its mandate. I thank Chairman MCCAULfrom the Homeland Security Committee for appointing me to lead the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel last year. This task force produced 32 key findings and more than 50 recommendations, one of which serves as a basis of the legislation before us today. I am proud to say we have now acted legislatively on more than half of the task force’s findings, largely thanks to the hard work of the members of the task force and their willingness to work across the aisle in a bipartisan manner. I also thank Mr. THOMPSON , my colleague in the minority, for working in a bipartisan manner on this and many other bills that we have before us today. I will end by urging my colleagues to support this measure. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 526, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 526 authorizes, within the Department of Homeland Security, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board, or CTAB, to coordinate and integrate the Department’s intelligence policies and activities as related to counterterrorism. Since 2010, this internal body, comprised of top DHS officials, has helped to harmonize counterterrorism programs and activities across DHS. H.R. 526 directs the Board to meet on a regular basis to coordinate and integrate the Department’s counterterrorism efforts and set forth the leadership and composition of the Board. H.R. 526 also requires DHS to report to Congress on the Board’s status and activities. To ensure that the Board remains an integral part of counterterrorism policy recommendations and responses across the Department, H.R. 526 would codify it in law. At this time, when the Homeland Security challenges we face are, in many ways, more complex and diverse than ever before, it is essential that the new DHS Secretary and any successors have a mature, stable mechanism for counterterrorism decisionmaking just as his predecessors had. Mr. Speaker, again, H.R. 526 will authorize, within the Department of Homeland Security, the Counterterrorism Advisory Board to coordinate and integrate the Department’s intelligence activities and policies as related to counterterrorism. This Board already plays a central and necessary role within DHS. Enactment of H.R. 526 will ensure that the Counterterrorism Advisory Board will remain in place for years and decades to come. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 526. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge Members to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 526, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
AIRPORT PERIMETER AND ACCESS CONTROL SECURITY ACT OF 2017 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 665) to modernize and enhance airport perimeter and access control security by requiring updated risk assessments and the development of security strategies, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 665 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Airport Perimeter and Access Control Security Act of 2017’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) shall— (1) not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, update the Transportation Sector Security Risk Assessment (TSSRA) for the aviation sector; and (2) not later than 90 days after such date— (A) update with the latest and most currently available intelligence information the Comprehensive Risk Assessment of Perimeter and Access Control Security (in this Act referred to as the ‘‘Risk Assessment of Airport Security’’) and determine a regular timeframe and schedule for further updates to such Risk Assessment of Airport Security; and (B) conduct a systemwide assessment of airport access control points and airport perimeter security.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 665, the Airport Perimeter and Access Control Security Act, sponsored by my good friend and colleague, Congressman KEATING . Over the course of the last year, we have seen a disturbing number of attacks against airports and aircrafts overseas and around the world. And in every instance, the integrity of the airport security infrastructure and the insider threat have been of serious concern. It is critical that we scrutinize the security effectiveness of our Nation’s airports and ensure that the public can have confidence that their travels will be safe and secure during the high threat environment. This important piece of legislation requires that the TSA’s comprehensive risk assessment of perimeter and access control security is more regularly updated and that TSA conducts a sectorwide assessment of airport access control vulnerabilities and mitigation efforts, something TSA has not done across the board since 2012, despite multiple security breaches at airports across the country. We cannot solely focus on the effectiveness of our passenger screening checkpoints, while allowing lapses in security around the airport perimeter and within the sterile area of airport. A dead bolt on a front door does no good if the back door is left wide open. As partners on the Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee, Congressman KEATING and I have seen firsthand disturbing vulnerabilities at airports across the United States. I commend his efforts to help enhance security for the American people. While there may be gridlock and partisan bickering at times in other places here in Washington, on the Homeland Security Committee, we all share an unshakable commitment to ensuring the security of the traveling public because we know that the consequence of failure is too great. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman KEATING for introducing this important legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in strong support of my legislation H.R. 665, the Airport Perimeter and Access Control Security Act. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be joined by my colleague from New York (Mr. KATKO ), as well as my colleagues, Ranking Member THOMPSON , and Members RICE, RICHMOND , and S WALWELL . Since I first was elected to Congress in 2010, I have worked to secure our Nation’s airports from porous perimeters and unsecure access control points. Last year, at my request, the Government Accountability Office released an independent report of all airports within the Transportation Security Administration’s presence. While TSA has made some progress in assessing risks at airport perimeters and access control security points, the GAO report revealed that the agency had not taken emerging threats or the unique makeup and design of individual airports into consideration. More and more, we have seen that terrorists are targeting the soft areas in our airport perimeters and within the airport itself. Terrorists are looking for these soft targets. We have seen it in Europe. We have seen these tragedies in Brussels. We have seen it in Istanbul. And, sadly, we have seen it here at home in Fort Lauderdale. Updating the risk assessment of airport secured with information that reflects the current threat ensures that TSA bases its decision on the latest information, enabling it to focus limited resources to the highest priority risks to airport security. The TSA’s efforts to access, really, our entire airport security around the country, has been, frankly, inadequate. The numbers are startling. From 2009 to 2015, TSA conducted comprehensive risk assessments at only 81 of the 437 commercial airports nationwide—or 19 percent. Some years, this really represented only 3 percent of the airports that were assessed at all. The Airport Perimeter and Access Control Security Act will make law the recommendations from the independent report and increase safety at airports nationwide. Further, this bill incorporates the input of major airport operators—whose concerns for lack of individualized security strategy we heard from firsthand. Last year, the Associated Press revealed that there had been at least 268 perimeter security breaches at 31 major U.S. airports. From 2004 to 2015, their investigation found that intruders breached airport fences, on average, every 13 days. This figure includes a fatal incident, a tragic incident that I investigated before I came to Congress as a district attorney when Delvonte Tisdale, a teenager from North Carolina, snuck onto the tarmac at CharlotteDouglas International Airport and stowed away undetected in a wheel well of a commercial 737 on a flight to Boston. The figures I mentioned really don’t account for the many unreported instances of perimeter breaches, including things like trespassers or people that scale the fences around the perimeter. We are lucky that all of these individuals did not harbor nefarious intentions. But that does not mitigate the risk posed by such behavior at airports, employees and others, and the passengers and travelers who rely on TSA officers and the airport operators for their security. As you may recall, this legislation passed the House of Representatives with the support of my colleagues last year and has been a long time coming. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, before I close, I commend my colleague for his unwavering dedication to this issue. His passion has shown through in the committee hearings and throughout my time with him in Congress and I commend him for it. I look forward to working on this and other issues with him moving forward. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 665. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone that worked so hard to make this bill a reality, and to have the success it did last year, and, hopefully, go all the way and get enacted into law this year. The recent tragedies demonstrated at airports remain a steady target for terrorists and nefarious actors. This bipartisan legislation will close loops in the airport security practices and procedures and bring us closer to ensuring that the access control points and the perimeters of all of the unique designs are as secure as possible. Passage of H.R. 665 is an important step in the safety of passengers, pilots, and the airport employees. I thank the chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee again, Mr. KATKO ; the full committee ranking member, Mr. THOMPSON ; and Representatives RICE, R ICHMOND , and SWALWELL for joining me in requesting this report and in supporting this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 665. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 665. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
BORDER SECURITY TECHNOLOGY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2017 Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 505) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to strengthen accountability for deployment of border security technology at the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 505 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Border Security Technology Accountability Act of 2017’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Subtitle C of title IV of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 231 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section: 
‘‘(a) P LANNING DOCUMENTATION .—For each border security technology acquisition program of the Department that is determined to be a major acquisition program, the Secretary shall— ‘‘(1) ensure that each such program has a written acquisition program baseline approved by the relevant acquisition decision authority; ‘‘(2) document that each such program is meeting cost, schedule, and performance thresholds as specified in such baseline, in compliance with relevant departmental acquisition policies and the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and ‘‘(3) have a plan for meeting program implementation objectives by managing contractor performance. ‘‘(b) ADHERENCE TO STANDARDS .—The Sec retary, acting through the Under Secretary for Management and the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall ensure border security technology acquisition program managers who are responsible for carrying out this section adhere to relevant internal control standards identified by the Comptroller General of the United States. The Commissioner shall provide information, as needed, to assist the Under Secretary in monitoring proper program management of border security technology acquisition programs under this section. ‘‘(c) PLAN.—The Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary for Management, in coordination with the Under Secretary for Science and Technology and the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a plan for testing and evaluation, as well as the use of independent verification and validation resources, for border security technology so that new border security technologies are evaluated through a series of assessments, processes, and audits to ensure compliance with relevant departmental acquisition policies and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as well as the effectiveness of taxpayer dollars. ‘‘(d) MAJOR ACQUISITION PROGRAM DEFINED .—In this section, the term ‘major acquisition program’ means a Department acquisition program that is estimated by the Secretary to require an eventual total expenditure of at least $300,000,000 (based on fiscal year 2017 constant dollars) over its life cycle cost.’’. (b) CLERICAL AMENDMENT .—The table of contents of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 433 the following new item: ‘‘Sec. 434. Border security technology program management.’’. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 
No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act. This Act and such amendments shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized for such purposes. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. 
Ms. M CSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 505, the Border Security Technology Accountability Act. This bill seeks to improve the management of border security technology projects, safeguard taxpayer dollars, and increase accountability for some of the Department of Homeland Security’s largest acquisition programs. As a subcommittee chair with responsibility for the entire 2,000mile Southern border, and as a Member whose district in southern Arizona represents 80 miles of the border, I have spent countless hours meeting with border residents, local law enforcement, ranchers, and men and women who tirelessly patrol the border every day. I know firsthand that when our border technology projects lack the proper oversight and accountability, it is bad for taxpayers, those who defend our border, and those who live along our border. That is why this bill is so important. The Government Accountability Office has repeatedly included DHS acquisition management activities on its highrisk list, demonstrating that these programs are highly susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement. b1515 The Secure Border Initiative, also known as SBInet, is a prime example of acquisition mismanagement. Initial plans developed in 2005 and 2006 call for SBInet to extend across the entire U.S.Mexico land border; however, SBInet deployment in Arizona was fraught with mismanagement, including a failure to adequately set requirements so the system would meet the needs of its users: our border patrol agents. After spending nearly $1 billion of taxpayers’ money with minimal results, DHS canceled SBInet in 2011, showing the high cost of failing to properly oversee new border acquisitions. With a renewed focus from the administration and this Congress on improving border security, this bill helps ensure Americans’ dollars are used as efficiently and effectively as possible. It requires that border security technology programs at the Department have an acquisition program baseline: a critical document that lays out what a program will do, what it will cost, and when it will be completed. The bill also requires programs to adhere to internal control standards and have a plan for testing and evaluation, as well as the use of independent verification and validation resources. Being proper stewards of our limited resources requires that programs are on time, on budget, and follow sound management procedures. We cannot afford to waste another minute or another dollar. We must put into place strong, effective technology programs to secure our border. I urge all Members to join me in supporting these basic commonsense cost control mechanisms so that we can responsibly secure our border. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 505. I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) for her work on this bill. Over the past several years, the Government Accountability Office has examined various Department of Homeland Security programs and concluded that the Department has not followed standard best practices for acquisitions management. Though DHS has taken steps to improve its performance, there remains specific deficiencies in how it carries out major acquisitions. When a DHS acquisition program falls short in terms of effectiveness or efficiency, this not only risks undermining that program, but also risks wasting the limited homeland security dollars that are available to us. We owe it to the American public not to repeat our mistakes. This bill is intended to strengthen accountability for the acquisition and use of border security technology by the Department of Homeland Security. This bill would require all major acquisitions for border security technology to have written documentation of costs, schedule, and performance thresholds and demonstrate that the program is meeting these thresholds. The bill also requires coordination and submission to Congress of a plan for testing and evaluation, as well as the use of independent verification and validation of resources for border security technology. Addressing border security technology acquisitions is an important step toward bettering acquisitions and 
management overall. We owe it to the American taxpayer to make sure we are managing these investments wisely and preventing wasteful spending. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 505 aims to focus and improve the way we invest and manage border security technology by providing a specific framework for accountability and oversight on behalf of the American taxpayer. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 505 to have transparency, accountability, and efficiency of vital border security technology projects. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 505, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
CBRN INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION SHARING ACT OF 2017 Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 677) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear intelligence and information sharing functions of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security and to require dissemination of information analyzed by the Department to entities with responsibilities relating to homeland security, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 677 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 2. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION SHARING. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Subtitle A of title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 121 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. 
Ms. M CSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 677, the CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2017. We know that terrorist groups have long sought to employ chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear, or CBRN, materials in their attacks. In his 2016 Worldwide Threat Assessment, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper noted that weapons of mass destruction continue to pose a threat to the United States, whether from North Korea’s nuclear tests or the dualuse nature of biological materials that make threats difficult to detect. In addition, last year, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons completed a year long investigation that found both Syria and ISIS have used chemical weapons. ISIS’ interest in using weapons of mass destruction material in its attack against the West is also well documented. H.R. 677 will enhance intelligence analysis and information sharing and will work to ensure that State and 
local officials get the actionable intelligence information necessary to stop or mitigate a CBRN attack. As the previous chairwoman of the Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee, I held a number of hearings on the threat posed by terrorist attacks using CBRN agents. Many national security experts, first responders, and members of the law enforcement community have testified to the need of increased information sharing with appropriate State and local officials and emergency responders. This budgetneutral bill seeks to address these findings. It requires the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at DHS to support homeland securityfocused intelligence analysis of CBRN threats, including emerging infectious diseases. It directs the Office of Intelligence and Analysis to share information with State, local, tribal, and private entities and get their feedback to improve twoway sharing of information. Finally, H.R. 677 directs the Secretary of DHS to report annually for 5 years on the Department’s intelligence and information sharing activities and DHS’ activities in accordance with relevant intelligence strategies. The House passed a nearly identical bill I introduced last Congress by a vote of 420–2. I urge Members to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 677, the CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, last Congress, the Committee on Homeland Security held several hearings to evaluate Federal, State, and local capabilities to prevent, identify, and respond to a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear attack, a CBRN threat. Although the State and local stakeholders we heard from were generally aware of the evolving CBRN threat, there was a consistent message from everyone who testified—from public health professionals to emergency managers, to first responders—improved information sharing would make our communities safer. H.R. 677 would facilitate improved CBRN information sharing by directing DHS to analyze CBRNrelated terrorist threats and share relevant threat information with Federal, State, and local stakeholders. These activities will both improve situational awareness at all levels of government and help DHS grant recipients better target their limited grant dollars to address this particular threat. The CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act passed the House overwhelmingly last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support the measure once again. Information sharing is at the core of our ability to prevent, thwart, and respond to threats posed by bad actors. H.R. 677 would facilitate information sharing in the CBRN space where the threats are constantly evolving. This commonsense legislation costs next to nothing but will reap significant benefits. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 677. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 677, this legislation that will enhance the sharing of CBRNrelated threat information. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 677. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SUPPORT TO FUSION CENTERS ACT OF 2017 Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 678) to require an assessment of fusion center personnel needs, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 678 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2017’’. 
Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct an assessment of Department of Homeland Security personnel assigned to fusion centers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 210A of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 124h), including an assessment of whether deploying additional Department personnel to such fusion centers would enhance the Department’s mission under section 101(b) of such Act and the National Network of Fusion Centers. The assessment required under this subsection shall include the following: (1) Information on the current deployment of the Department’s personnel to each fusion center. (2) Information on the roles and responsibilities of the Department’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis intelligence officers, intelligence analysts, senior reports officers, reports officers, and regional directors deployed to fusion centers. (3) Information on Federal resources, in addition to personnel, provided to each fusion center. (4) An analysis of the optimal number of personnel the Office of Intelligence and Analysis should deploy to fusion centers, including a costbenefit analysis comparing deployed personnel with technological solutions to support information sharing. (5) An assessment of fusion centers located in jurisdictions along land and maritime borders of the United States, and the degree to which deploying personnel, as appropriate, from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Coast Guard to such fusion centers would enhance the integrity and security at such borders by helping Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement authorities to identify, investigate, and interdict persons, weapons, and related contraband that pose a threat to homeland security. (6) An assessment of fusion centers located in jurisdictions with large and medium hub airports, and the degree to which deploying, as appropriate, personnel from the Transportation Security Administration to such fusion centers would enhance the integrity and security of aviation security. SEC. 3. PROGRAM FOR STATE AND LOCAL ANALYST CLEARANCES. 
(a) S ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that any program established by the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security to provide eligibility for access to information classified as Top Secret for State, local, tribal, and territorial analysts located in fusion centers shall be consistent with the need to know requirements pursuant to Executive Order No. 13526 (50 U.S.C. 3161 note). (b) REPORT .—Not later than two years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate a report on the following: (1) The process by which the Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis determines a need to know pursuant to Executive Order No. 13526 to sponsor Top Secret clearances for appropriate State, local, tribal, and territorial analysts located in fusion centers. (2) The effects of such Top Secret clearances on enhancing information sharing with State, local, tribal, and territorial partners. (3) The cost for providing such Top Secret clearances for State, local, tribal, and territorial analysts located in fusion centers, including training and background investigations. (4) The operational security protocols, training, management, and risks associated with providing such Top Secret clearances for State, local, tribal, and territorial analysts located in fusion centers. 
The Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the Chief Information Officer of the Department and representatives from the National Network of Fusion Centers, shall conduct an assessment of information systems (as such term is defined in section 3502 of title 44, United States Code) used to share homeland security information between the Department and fusion centers in the National Network of Fusion Centers and make upgrades to such systems, as appropriate. Such assessment shall include the following: (1) An evaluation of the accessibility and ease of use of such systems by fusion centers in the National Network of Fusion Centers. (2) A review to determine how to establish improved interoperability of departmental information systems with existing information systems used by fusion centers in the National Network of Fusion Centers. 
(3) An evaluation of participation levels of departmental components and offices of information systems used to share homeland security information with fusion centers in the National Network of Fusion Centers.

In this Act: (1) FUSION CENTER .—The term ‘‘fusion center’’ has the meaning given such term in subsection (j) of section 210A of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 124h). (2) NATIONAL NETWORK OF FUSION CEN TERS .—The term ‘‘National Network of Fusion Centers’’ means a decentralized arrangement of fusion centers intended to enhance individual State and urban area fusion centers’ ability to leverage the capabilities and expertise of all such fusion centers for the purpose of enhancing analysis and homeland security information sharing nationally. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. 
Ms. M CSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 678, the Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2017. Ensuring that the Federal Government is sharing intelligence and homeland security information with State and local officials is a vital component of U.S. national security and our counterterrorism efforts. I have seen firsthand the important work of fusion centers, which disseminate Federal threat and intelligence information to local law enforcement and emergency responders. These centers also collect State and local information and fuse it with Federal intelligence. There is no doubt that this effort enhances terrorist investigations and creates a more complete domestic threat picture. To help break down information sharing stovepipes, my State’s fusion center, the Arizona Counter Terrorism Intelligence Center, or the ACTIC, and the 77 other fusion centers across the country need greater access to information, particularly from the Department of Homeland Security and its components. While personnel from the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis have been deployed to most fusion centers, one remaining challenge is access to DHS component personnel and information, particularly ICE, CBP, and TSA. To address this issue, this bill requires GAO, the Government Accountability Office, to conduct an assessment of the DHS personnel detailed to fusion centers and whether deploying additional personnel will enhance threat and homeland security information sharing. This thirdparty assessment of DHS personnel deployments will be valuable when making staffing decisions moving forward. Additionally, this bill supports ongoing DHS efforts to sponsor top secret clearances to appropriate State and local analysts in fusion centers. The committee has received countless testimony from State and local law enforcement about the value additional clearances will provide. The bill also directs the DHS to review current information technology systems used to share information with fusion centers and make enhancements to ensure systems, such as the Homeland Security Information Network, are user friendly and meeting the needs of States and locals. Lastly, the bill requires the Under Secretary of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis to sign a memorandum of understanding with each fusion center. The purpose of the MOU is to lay out what type of information will be shared between DHS and the fusion centers and how that information will be protected. A critical element of the Department’s relationship with the thousands of State and local first responders working in fusion centers is trust. The MOU process will help improve this important connection. Our country is at its highest threat posture this 9/11 given the large number of foreign fighters and ISISinspired plots. This bill will help ensure our State and local law enforcement officers as well as fire and EMS personnel are getting access to the information needed to protect our communities. I urge all Members to support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 678, and I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ). I rise in strong support as a cosponsor of H.R. 678, the Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2017. Since coming to Congress, I have worked to enhance and secure intelligence information sharing among both domestic and international partners. A key mechanism to fostering such information sharing has been the development of a network of fusion centers across the Nation. These centers allow Federal intelligence and homeland security information to be shared with State and local law enforcement and other key stakeholders. For fusion centers to realize their full promise, it remains critical that personnel assigned to fusion centers be able to access Department of Homeland Security information, data, and personnel. In the course of conducting oversight of fusion centers, the committee has learned that not enough State and local analysts and officials assigned to these centers have the TS/SCI clearances necessary to foster the timely sharing of homeland security information and intelligence. b1530 H.R. 678 would authorize the DHS to sponsor such State and local analysts for security clearances. Last Congress, this bill passed unanimously by our committee. I urge the passage of H.R. 678, the Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2017. This is legislation that will help ensure that key fusion center personnel have access to the security clearances they need to keep our communities secure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, one of the core missions of the Department of Homeland Security is to share threat information with State and local first responders. Fusion centers are a key mechanism for that process. As fusion centers continue to mature into national assets, Congress must ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is supporting fusion centers with the resources that are needed to keep our communities safe. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 678. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. MCSALLY ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 678. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSONCOLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I stand before you in support of H.R. 366, the DHS Stop Asset and Vehicle Excess, or DHS SAVE, Act of 2016. In October of 2015, the DHS inspector general released a scathing report of the Federal Protective Service’s management of their vehicle fleet, a report that reads like a laundry list of poor management decisions. The IG found that the FPS had more vehicles than officers, and officers were authorized to drive from home to work with governmentowned vehicles and, actually, put more miles on the vehicles in driving from home and back to work than they did on the job, among many other things. Additionally, the report stated that the FPS was not in compliance with Federal and departmental compliance, which is why I introduced the DHS SAVE Act. This bill improves the management of DHS’ vehicle fleets by authorizing the Under Secretary for Management at the headquarters level to oversee the components’ vehicle fleets, requires the components to evaluate their fleets on an ongoing basis, includes penalties for the mismanagement of component fleets, and requires the DHS to identify alternative methods for the management of component fleets. With the second largest civilian vehicle fleet in the Federal Government, the DHS simply must have stricter controls in place at the headquarters level in order to rein in rogue components. As the new administration scrutinizes the DHS’ operations, this bill will provide important authorities to root out waste, fraud, and abuse from the Department. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 366, the DHS Stop Asset and Vehicle Excess Act. H.R. 366 seeks to improve the Department of Homeland Security’s management, acquisition, and oversight of its fleet of roughly 53,000 vehicles. H.R. 366 requires the Under Secretary for Management to provide departmental components with a standardized vehicle allocation methodology for components to utilize to develop fleet management plans. This legislation was informed by oversight that was conducted by the Department’s inspector general. The inspector general found that, in 2014 and 2015, the DHS did not adequately manage or have the enforcement authority over components to ensure that the composition of its motor vehicle fleet was right sized. This lack of effective management led to the overuse of sports utility vehicles, unnecessary discretionary equipment packages, and overpayments to the GSA. Further, the Committee on Homeland Security received testimony from the Director of the Federal Protective Service that roughly half of the 1,100 vehicles in FPS’ fleet were underutilized or had fewer than 12,000 miles. H.R. 366 grants authority to the DHS headquarters over components with respect to managing vehicle fleets. Specifically, under H.R. 366, the DHS is directed to establish requirements for components to more rigorously evaluate their fleets on an ongoing basis. Additionally, this bill directs the DHS to identify alternative methods for managing component fleets, such as a shared motor pool. The DHS has the second largest civilian vehicle fleet in the Federal Government at an operating cost of about $462 million. There is a critical linkage between the Department’s operational effectiveness in national security missions and the effective management of the resources and requirements by the DHS leadership. As such, enhancing oversight and management should help the Department more effectively spend limited taxpayer dollars on what the Department actually needs to carry out its mission. H.R. 366 seeks to improve the management of DHS’ vehicle fleet by strengthening the oversight and management of the Department’s fleet by the Under Secretary for Management. It is also worth noting that H.R. 366 includes language that I authored to ensure that the inspector general’s oversight of the DHS’ management of its vehicle fleet continues. I commend the OIG for its robust and ongoing oversight of the Department’s vehicle fleet. I also commend my colleague on the Homeland Security Committee, Mr. PERRY , for introducing this legislation and working in a bipartisan fashion to advance it. I urge the passage of H.R. 366. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague for her hard work on this bill and for her bipartisan spirit in getting it to the floor with me. I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 366. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 366. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DHS ACQUISITION DOCUMENTATION INTEGRITY ACT OF 2017 Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 347) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide for requirements relating to documentation for major acquisition programs, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 347 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘DHS Acquisition Documentation Integrity Act of 2017’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Title VII of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section: 
‘‘(a) I NGENERAL .—For each major acquisition program, the Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary for Management, shall require the head of a relevant component or office to— ‘‘(1) maintain acquisition documentation that is complete, accurate, timely, and valid, and that includes, at a minimum— ‘‘(A) operational requirements that are validated consistent with departmental policy and changes to such requirements, as appropriate; ‘‘(B) a complete lifecycle cost estimate with supporting documentation; ‘‘(C) verification of such lifecycle cost estimate against independent cost estimates, and reconciliation of any differences; ‘‘(D) a costbenefit analysis with supporting documentation; and ‘‘(E) a schedule, including, as appropriate, an integrated master schedule; ‘‘(2) prepare cost estimates and schedules for major acquisition programs, as required under subparagraphs (B) and (E), in a manner consistent with best practices as identified by the Comptroller General of the United States; and ‘‘(3) submit certain acquisition documentation to the Secretary to produce an annual comprehensive report on the status of departmental acquisitions for submission to Congress. ‘‘(b) WAIVER .—On a casebycase basis with respect to any major acquisition program under this section, the Secretary may waive the requirement under paragraph (3) of subsection (a) for a fiscal year if either— ‘‘(1) such program has not— ‘‘(A) entered the full rate production phase in the acquisition lifecycle; ‘‘(B) had a reasonable cost estimate established; and ‘‘(C) had a system configuration defined fully; or ‘‘(2) such program does not meet the definition of capital asset, as such term is defined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. ‘‘(c) CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT .—At the same time the President’s budget is submitted for a fiscal year under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary shall make information available, as applicable, to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate regarding the requirement described in subsection (a) in the prior fiscal year that includes the following specific information regarding each major acquisition program for which the Secretary has issued a waiver under subsection (b): ‘‘(1) The grounds for granting a waiver for such program. ‘‘(2) The projected cost of such program. ‘‘(3) The proportion of a component’s or office’s annual acquisition budget attributed to such program, as available. ‘‘(4) Information on the significance of such program with respect to the component’s or office’s operations and execution of its mission. ‘‘(d) MAJOR ACQUISITION PROGRAM DEFINED .—In this section, the term ‘major acquisition program’ means a Department acquisition program that is estimated by the Secretary to require an eventual total expenditure of at least $300,000,000 (based on fiscal year 2017 constant dollars) over its lifecycle cost.’’. (b) CLERICAL AMENDMENT .—The table of contents in section 1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 101 et seq.) is amended by adding after the item related to section 707 the following new item: ‘‘Sec. 708. Acquisition documentation.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSONCOLEMAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 347, the Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Documentation Integrity Act. This legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security to improve the management of its major purchases of systems to secure the border, better screen travelers, protect our shores, and other vital missions. Too often, the DHS has failed to document what these programs will cost, when they will be complete, and what they actually will deliver. It is unacceptable to spend billions of taxpayer dollars and not document this very basic but important information. H.R. 347 will help our committee and congressional watchdogs hold the Department accountable and ensure taxpayer dollars are being spent in both an efficient and effective manner. Safeguarding Americans’ hardearned tax dollars is why our constituents sent us here in the first place. I commend Ranking Member WATSON  COLEMAN for her leadership on this issue, and I ask all Members to join me in supporting this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 347, the DHS Acquisition Documentation Integrity Act of 2017. I reintroduced H.R. 347, a measure that the House unanimously approved on February 23, 2016, to ensure that the progress that the Department of Homeland Security has made with respect to how it manages acquisitions continues. H.R. 347 requires complete, accurate, timely, and valid documentation to be maintained for each of the Department’s major acquisition programs, which is defined as one with a life cycle cost estimate of $300 million or more. The required documentation includes information regarding operational requirements, a complete life cycle cost estimate, a costbenefit analysis, and a schedule. Under this legislation, the DHS component heads would also be required to submit certain documentation to the DHS Secretary for inclusion in an annual status report on the Department’s acquisitions. While there have been improvements to acquisitions management under former Secretary Jeh Johnson, the Department has struggled when it comes to delivering a specific program on time and at an established cost. Most of the DHS’ major acquisition programs continue to cost more than expected, take longer to deploy than planned, or deliver less capability than promised. For example, the DHS’ efforts to deliver a Departmentwide human resources IT system—HRIT— have spanned almost 14 years and have cost millions of dollars with little to show for it. As can be seen with the case of HRIT, anything less than up todate acquisition documentation increases the odds of cost and schedule overruns, risks delayed delivery of critical capabilities, and depletes resources needed to address future requirements. As such, H.R. 347 codifies ‘‘best practices’’ already embodied in the DHS’ acquisition policy and necessary for the success of the DHS’ mission. H.R. 347 requires the DHS Secretary, through the Under Secretary for Management, to require components to maintain specific types of acquisition documentation. Representatives MCCAULand T HOMP SON, the chairman and ranking member of our committee, and Representative PERRY , the chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency, cosponsored this legislation, which reflects a strong commitment to bolstering the effectiveness of the DHS’ acquisition programs in a bipartisan fashion. I urge the passage of H.R. 347, a bill that will help ensure that the DHS is a good steward of taxpayer dollars and can provide the DHS’ operators in the field with the tools they need to protect the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1545 Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, commend my good friend and 
colleague from New Jersey (Mrs. W ATSONCOLEMAN ) on her hard work in offering this viable and meaningful solution. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 347. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 347. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
TRANSIT SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY ACT Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 549) to amend the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to clarify certain allowable uses of funds for public transportation security assistance grants and establish periods of performance for such grants, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 549 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Transit Security Grant Program Flexibility Act’’. 
SEC. 2. ALLOWABLE USES OF FUNDS FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ASSISTANCE GRANTS. 
Subparagraph (A) of section 1406(b)(2) of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (6 U.S.C. 1135(b)(2); Public Law 110–53) is amended by inserting ‘‘and associated backfill’’ after ‘‘security training’’. 
SEC. 3. PERIODS OF PERFORMANCE FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ASSISTANCE GRANTS. 
Section 1406 of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (6 U.S.C. 1135; Public Law 110–53) is amended— (1) by redesignating subsection (m) as subsection (n); and (2) by inserting after subsection (l) the following new subsection: ‘‘(m) PERIODS OF PERFORMANCE .— ‘‘(1) IN GENERAL .—Except as provided in paragraph (2), funds provided pursuant to a grant awarded under this section for a use specified in subsection (b) shall remain available for use by a grant recipient for a period of not fewer than 36 months. ‘‘(2) EXCEPTION .—Funds provided pursuant to a grant awarded under this section for a use specified in subparagraph (M) or (N) of subsection (b)(1) shall remain available for use by a grant recipient for a period of not fewer than 55 months.’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 549, the Transit Security Grant Program Flexibility Act. With more than 10 billion riders using surface transportation annually and limited security screening, it should not be surprising to us that terrorists have an interest in targeting mass transit. We saw it in London, Madrid, Brussels, and when a terrorist left a backpack of IEDs at a transit station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, last fall. Given the repeated calls from ISIS and other radical Islamic terrorist groups for lone wolves and sympathizers to plan smaller attacks where larger crowds gather, we must ensure that the first responders and transit agencies have the tools they need to secure our transit systems. That is why, last Congress, I introduced the Transit Security Grant Program Flexibility Act. This bill addresses concerns raised during a field hearing the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held last year in Ranking Member PAYNE ’s district on preparedness for incidents impacting surface transportation. As chairman of that subcommittee, I introduced this legislation to ensure action follows our subcommittee’s oversight, and that is why I reintroduced this commonsense legislation in the 115th Congress. Witnesses at last year’s field hearing testified about the importance of the transit security grant program, but found that the period of performance was a challenging timeframe to meet, especially for completing vital, large scale capital security projects. These projects are vital to transit agencies to help enhance their security features systemwide and harden infrastructure. H.R. 549 addresses this challenge by codifying the period of performance for transit security grant program awards at 36 months for the majority of eligible projects and extending the period of performance for largescale capital security projects to 55 months. Additionally, transit security grant program awards can be used to provide personnel with effective security training. Unfortunately, recipients of these awards are not currently permitted to use transit security grant program funds to pay for backfilling personnel attending such training. In some cases, that extra cost at the transit agency has resulted in an inability to send staff for vital security training. My bill will permit transit security grant program funds to be used for this purpose, consistent with other Homeland Security grant programs. The current threat environment is evolving and complex, which makes it even more imperative that the transit security grant program provide flexible solutions for grant recipients. I am proud to sponsor this bipartisan legislation, which passed the House by voice vote last year. I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 549. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 549, the Transit Security Grant Program Flexibility Act. As the threats to our homeland continue to evolve, transit systems, domestically and abroad, have become a leading target for terrorists. Last year, the Committee on Homeland Security’s Subcommittee for Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held field hearings in New Jersey to assess how transit owners and operators and local first responders were coordinating efforts to secure domestic mass transit and to determine what the Federal Government could do to assist those efforts. At the hearing, transit operators repeatedly praised the transit security grant program, although they raised serious concerns about funding, which has decreased dramatically since its peak in 2009. Witnesses also testified that the period of the performance for the transit safety grant program was too short to support infrastructure hardening projects. Under H.R. 549, the period of performance for securityhardening projects would be extended from 36 months to 55 
months in order to make it possible for transit agencies to complete projects that may take longer than the time period allowed under current law. This bipartisan bill was passed in the House last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to again support this measure. It is very important that we give transit professionals the flexibility that they need to keep our transit systems safe and secure. H.R. 549 will allow transit security grant program grantees to use the funds designated for securityhardening projects more efficiently and within a more reasonable timeframe. I urge my colleagues to support this important measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 549. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 549. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
FIRST RESPONDER ACCESS TO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES ACT Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 687) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish a process to review applications for certain grants to purchase equipment or systems that do not meet or exceed any applicable national voluntary consensus standards, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 687 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘First Responder Access to Innovative Technologies Act’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Section 2008 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 609) is amended— (1) in subsection (f)— (A) by striking ‘‘If an applicant’’ and inserting the following: ‘‘(1) APPLICATION REQUIREMENT .—If an ap plicant’’; and (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs: ‘‘(2) REVIEW PROCESS .—The Administrator shall implement a uniform process for reviewing applications that, in accordance with paragraph (1), contain explanations to use grants provided under section 2003 or 2004 to purchase equipment or systems that do not meet or exceed any applicable national voluntary consensus standards developed under section 647 of the PostKatrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. ‘‘(3) FACTORS .—In carrying out the review process under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall consider the following: ‘‘(A) Current or past use of proposed equipment or systems by Federal agencies or the Armed Forces. ‘‘(B) The absence of a national voluntary consensus standard for such equipment or systems. ‘‘(C) The existence of an international consensus standard for such equipment or systems, and whether such equipment or systems meets such standard. ‘‘(D) The nature of the capability gap identified by the applicant and how such equipment or systems will address such gap. ‘‘(E) The degree to which such equipment or systems will serve the needs of the applicant better than equipment or systems that meet or exceed existing consensus standards. ‘‘(F) Any other factor determined appropriate by the Administrator.’’; and (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection: ‘‘(g) REVIEW PROCESS .—The Administrator shall implement a uniform process for reviewing applications to use grants provided under section 2003 or 2004 to purchase equipment or systems not included on the Authorized Equipment List maintained by the Administrator.’’. (b) INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT .—Not later than three years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report assessing the implementation of the review process established under paragraph (2) of subsection (f) of section 2008 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (as added by subsection (a) of this section), including information on the following: (1) The number of requests to purchase equipment or systems that do not meet or exceed any applicable consensus standard evaluated under such review process. (2) The capability gaps identified by applicants and the number of such requests granted or denied. (3) The processing time for the review of such requests. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise today in support of H.R. 687. This legislation would establish a review process for grant applicants seeking to purchase equipment or systems that do not meet or exceed national voluntary consensus standards. With threats consistently evolving, it is reassuring to see new technology emerge which will promote the safety of our communities and first responders. However, emerging technology is frequently developed faster than voluntary consensus standards can be implemented. Recipients of grants under FEMA’s State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative must procure equipment that meets these standards. Unfortunately, if emerging technology or equipment does not have a voluntary consensus standard and a grant recipient would like to use those funds to purchase such technology, FEMA does not have a uniform process to consider applications for that equipment. H.R. 687 requires FEMA to develop such a process for reviewing these requests. Previously, this bill was introduced in the 114th Congress by the subcommittee’s ranking member, Mr. PAYNE , and subsequently received bipartisan support by my subcommittee and the Committee on Homeland Security as well as the House when it was passed under suspension of the rules in September of 2016. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ) for reintroducing this commonsense bill. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 687 because it will ensure our first responders have the ability to purchase equipment and emerging technology needed to effectively adapt to the current threat landscape. Earlier this month, the Committee on Homeland Security released the January Terror Threat Snapshot, which found that the United States remains a top target for terrorists. It is clear that the threat to our communities is not going away. Congress has the responsibility to make America safer and stronger. We can do so by ensuring commonsense measures are in place to ensure first responders have the tools that they need to address these threats. I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 687. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 687, the First Responder Access to Innovative Technologies Act. Mr. Speaker, in my time serving as ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security’s Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I have come to learn a great deal about the very important, very challenging job of first responders. These brave men and women run toward danger with our safety as their number one priority. Since the September 11 attacks, the private sector has redoubled its efforts to develop innovative technologies for first responders to use and to carry out their vital missions. Yet, through our subcommittee’s oversight, we have seen where, in some instances, industry standards have 
failed to keep the pace with breakthroughs in technology. As a result, we have found that first responders cannot always access the most uptodate equipment because they cannot use Homeland Security grant funds to purchase equipment and technology that does not meet or exceed voluntary industry standards. H.R. 687 would require FEMA to develop a transparent process for reviewing requests to use grant funds to purchase technologies that do not meet or exceed voluntary industry standards and/or that are not on the authorized equipment list. The bill has the support of the Security Industry Association and unanimously passed the House last September. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the Security Industry Association. 
SECURITY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION , Silver Spring, MD, January 27, 2017. Hon. DANDONOVAN , Chairman, House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Communications, Washington, DC. Hon. DONALD PAYNE , Ranking Member, House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Communications, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN DONOVAN AND RANKING  MEMBER PAYNE : On behalf of the Security Industry Association (SIA), I would like to express our strong support for H.R. 687, the First Responder Access to Innovative Technologies Act, which would streamline the existing process for first responders utilizing homeland security grants to purchase innovative equipment. SIA is a nonprofit international trade association representing nearly 700 global security and life safety solutions providers, and our members develop, manufacture and integrate equipment that is vital to carrying out a variety of homeland security missions. Under current law, equipment purchased with homeland security grants must meet or exceed ‘‘national voluntary consensus standards,’’ unless an explanation as to why an exception is necessary is provided to, reviewed and approved by the Department. For some products, including first responder equipment, technology innovations have outpaced the process of developing voluntary consensus standards, and no such standards may yet exist. Among other provisions, H.R. 687 directs FEMA to develop a more consistent and transparent process for reviewing these requests, which would expedite consideration and provide more certainty to stakeholders. Like you, we believe that first responders must be able to choose the most appropriate and advanced equipment to meet urgent and changing needs as they work to protect the public. SIA and its members stand ready to serve as a resource to you as you continue work on this critical issue. Thank you for your leadership and attention to this important matter. Sincerely, DONERICKSON , CEO, Security Industry Association. 
b1600 Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, our first responders are on the front lines of emergency response. In recognition of their bravery and sacrifices they make every day, in and out, we must make sure that they have the access to the most uptodate technologies to help them do their jobs better and safer. To that end, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 687. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 687, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. JODYB. H ICEof Georgia). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 687. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
CYBER PREPAREDNESS ACT OF 2017 Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 584) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to enhance preparedness and response capabilities for cyber attacks, bolster the dissemination of homeland security information related to cyber threats, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 584 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cyber Preparedness Act of 2017’’. 
Title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended— (1) in section 210A (6 U.S.C. 124h)— (A) in subsection (b)— (i) in paragraph (10), by inserting before the semicolon at the end the following: ‘‘, including, in coordination with the national cybersecurity and communications integration center under section 227, access to timely technical assistance, risk management support, and incident response capabilities with respect to cyber threat indicators, defensive measures, cybersecurity risks, and incidents (as such terms are defined in such section), which may include attribution, mitigation, and remediation, and the provision of information and recommendations on security and resilience, including implications of cybersecurity risks to equipment and technology related to the electoral process’’; (ii) in paragraph (11), by striking ‘‘and’’ after the semicolon; (iii) by redesignating paragraph (12) as paragraph (14); and (iv) by inserting after paragraph (11) the following new paragraphs: ‘‘(12) review information relating to cybersecurity risks that is gathered by State, local, and regional fusion centers, and incorporate such information, as appropriate, into the Department’s own information relating to cybersecurity risks; ‘‘(13) ensure the dissemination to State, local, and regional fusion centers of information relating to cybersecurity risks; and’’; (B) in subsection (c)(2)— (i) by redesignating subparagraphs (C) through (G) as subparagraphs (D) through (H), respectively; and (ii) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new subparagraph: ‘‘(C) The national cybersecurity and communications integration center under section 227.’’; (C) in subsection (d)— (i) in paragraph (3), by striking ‘‘and’’ after the semicolon; (ii) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5); and (iii) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new paragraph: ‘‘(4) assist, in coordination with the national cybersecurity and communications integration center under section 227, fusion centers in using information relating to cybersecurity risks to develop a comprehensive and accurate threat picture; and’’; and (D) in subsection (j)— (i) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (5) as paragraphs (2) through (6), respectively; and (ii) by inserting before paragraph (2), as so redesignated, the following new paragraph: ‘‘(1) the term ‘cybersecurity risk’ has the meaning given that term in section 227;’’; and (2) in section 227 (6 U.S.C. 148)— (A) in subsection (c)— (i) in paragraph (5)(B), by inserting ‘‘, including State and major urban area fusion centers, as appropriate’’ before the semicolon at the end; (ii) in paragraph (7), in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by striking ‘‘information and recommendations’’ each place it appears and inserting ‘‘information, recommendations, and best practices’’; and (iii) in paragraph (9), by inserting ‘‘best practices,’’ after ‘‘defensive measures,’’; and (B) in subsection (d)(1)(B)(ii), by inserting ‘‘and State and major urban area fusion centers, as appropriate’’ before the semicolon at the end. SEC. 3. HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS. 
Subsection (a) of section 2008 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 609) is amended— (1) by redesignating paragraphs (4) through (14) as paragraphs (5) through (15), respectively; and (2) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new paragraph: ‘‘(4) enhancing cybersecurity, including preparing for and responding to cybersecurity risks and incidents (as such terms are defined in section 227) and developing statewide cyber threat information analysis and dissemination activities;’’. 
It is the sense of Congress that to facilitate the timely dissemination to appropriate State, local, and private sector stakeholders of homeland security information related to cyber threats, the Secretary of Homeland Security should, to the greatest extent practicable, work to share actionable information related to cyber threats in an unclassified form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 584, the Cyber Preparedness Act of 2017. Cybersecurity is a major national security issue and the threat is real and immediate. Day in and day out nation states or criminal actors target the United States’ critical infrastructure, the private sector, and everyday Americans, and they are succeeding. However, even with the heightened awareness on cybersecurity, it appears that the United States is not adequately prepared to prevent and respond to cyber attacks. Since 2012, FEMA has released an annual National Preparedness Report, which highlights States’ progress in meeting 32 core capabilities, as defined by the National Preparedness Goal. Every year, States have ranked their cybersecurity capabilities as one of their lowest. I found these facts very alarming and wanted to learn more about the current state of cyber preparedness. That is why, last Congress, my subcommittee, the Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee, held a joint hearing with the committee’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee to look at cyber preparedness and how the Federal Government can help States address some of the challenges they face. We heard from a Homeland Security adviser, a fusion center representative, the Center for Internet Security, a chief information officer, and a chief technology officer, who explained the great progress the United States has made in enhancing their security capabilities. However, they cautioned that challenges still remain, especially with regard to information sharing of cyber threats and risks, and whether Homeland Security grants may be used for cybersecurity enhancements. Last Congress, I introduced this bill to address the findings from that hearing. I introduced this bill in this Congress to ensure that States and first responders have the resources needed to prepare for and protect against cyber attacks. This commonsense legislation will: Enhance cyber risk information sharing with State and major urban area fusion centers; authorize representatives from State and urban area fusion centers to be assigned to the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center; and permit the NCCIC personnel to be deployed to the fusion centers. It will allow information sharing on cyber preparedness best practices with State and local stakeholders. It will clarify the eligibility of State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area Security Initiative funding for cybersecurity enhancements; and it will work to combat the overclassification of cyber risk information so that it can be shared more broadly with stakeholders who have a need to know. I appreciate that Chairman MCCAUL, Chairman RATCLIFFE , and Ranking Member PAYNE joined me again as original cosponsors of H.R. 584. This bipartisan legislation passed the House by voice vote last Congress. I am pleased that the House is willing to take up this measure again in the new Congress. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 584, the Cyber Preparedness Act of 2017, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, since I became ranking member of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications 4 years ago, States have repeatedly expressed concern about the ability to confront the cyber threat and have rated cybersecurity among the core capabilities in which they had the least confidence. Last Congress, the subcommittee held a hearing on State and local efforts to counter the cyber threat where State emergency managers and chief information officers testified about activities they were undertaking to secure their networks and infrastructure. For example, my home State of New Jersey has begun developing its own cyber informationsharing capability, similar to DHS’ National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center. Since the subcommittee held its hearing last year, the Federal Government has made significant progress in providing cybersecurity guidance to Federal, State, and local stakeholders. In December of 2016, the Department of Homeland Security issued its national Cyber Incident Response Plan, which describes roles and responsibilities among stakeholders with respect to preventing, disrupting, and responding to a cyber event. Additionally, the plan also provides guidance on information sharing related to cyber threats. H.R. 584 would help facilitate implementation of the National Cyber Incident Response Plan by promoting the sharing of cyber threat indicators and information, as well as cybersecurity’s best practices, with State and major urban area fusion centers. The bill also designates ‘‘cybersecurity’’ as an allowable use of State Homeland Security grants and Urban Area Security Initiative funds, which would help other States replicate the cyber threat informationsharing capabilities developed in New Jersey. This is commonsense legislation, passed by the House last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support the measure once again. Mr. Speaker, last fall, the range of cyber threats we faced came into focus when a foreign government attempted to interfere and undermine the integrity of our Presidential election by hacking into the campaign and political party databases. H.R. 584 includes language to address this threat by directing DHS to share cyber threat information regarding election equipment and technology with fusion centers. H.R. 584 seems to secure our critical cyber networks by improving cyber information sharing with fusion centers on the full spectrum of cyber threats. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 584, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 584, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 584. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
GAINS IN GLOBAL NUCLEAR DETECTION ARCHITECTURE ACT Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 690) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to enhance certain duties of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 690 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Gains in Global Nuclear Detection Architecture Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DUTIES OF THE DOMESTIC NUCLEAR DETECTION OFFICE. 
Section 1902 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 592) is amended— (1) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c); and (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following new subsection: ‘‘(b) IMPLEMENTATION .—In carrying out paragraph (6) of subsection (a), the Director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office shall— ‘‘(1) develop and maintain documentation, such as a technology roadmap and strategy, that— ‘‘(A) provides information on how the Office’s research investments address— ‘‘(i) gaps in the enhanced global nuclear detection architecture, as developed pursuant to paragraph (4) of such subsection; and ‘‘(ii) research challenges identified by the Director; and ‘‘(B) defines in detail how the Office will address such research challenges; 
‘‘(2) document the rational for prioritizing and selecting research topics; and ‘‘(3) develop a systematic approach, which may include annual metrics and periodic qualitative evaluations, for evaluating how the outcomes of the Office’s individual research projects collectively contribute to addressing the Office’s research challenges.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 690, the Gains in Global Nuclear Detection Architecture Act of 2016, sponsored by Representative RICHMOND . H.R. 690 directs the Department of Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to develop and maintain documentation that provides information on how the office’s research investments align with gaps in the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture and the research challenges identified by the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. It further directs the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to document the rationale for selecting research topics and to develop a systematic approach for evaluating how the outcomes of the office’s individual research projects collectively contribute to addressing the research challenges. ISIS has declared its intention to develop weapons of mass destruction, which include nuclear devices, as well as radiological dispersal devices. The key to preventing this from happening is to make sure that nuclear material never falls into terrorist hands. According to data compiled by the International Atomic Energy Agency, there were nearly 1,150 incidents involving theft, criminal possession, or loss of radiological material reported between 1993 and 2014. The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California identified 325 instances alone between 2013 and 2014 in 38 different countries where nuclear or radioactive material was stolen, lost, or outside of regulatory control. The amount of nuclear material in peaceful uses in the world has risen by 70 percent since 1999. It will continue to grow in the coming decades as global use of nuclear power increases. Just last summer, six men were convicted in Tbilisi, Georgia, for trying to sell uranium238; and in January of 2016, three members of a criminal group were detained for trying to sell caesium137, which could be used to make a dirty bomb. We must ensure that terrorists never get their hands on radioactive materials. This bill will enhance the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office’s ability to provide radiation detection devices specifically aimed at preventing terrorists from being able to obtain enough radioactive material to construct a dirty bomb. This bill will ensure that the research topics it chooses to invest in to enhance our ability to detect smuggled nuclear materials are aligned with the gaps that have been identified in the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture, a multiagency framework for detecting, analyzing, and reporting on nuclear and other radioactive materials that are out of regulatory control. Requiring the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to document their rationale for choosing research topics will ensure that the most important gaps in the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture are addressed. b1615 I would like to thank Mr. RICHMOND  for the work that he and his staff have done on this legislation. I believe this will better enable this country to detect smuggling of nuclear materials and prevent ISIS and other terrorists from carrying out a nuclear or radiological attack on American soil. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE , SPACE AND  TECHNOLOGY , Washington, DC, January 30, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : I am writing concerning H.R. 690, the ‘‘Gains in Global Nuclear Detection Architecture Act,’’ which was introduced on January 24, 2017.

In order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees, or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding, and would request that you include a copy of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, LAMAR SMITH, Chairman. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, January 30, 2017. Hon. LAMAR SMITH, Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN SMITH: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 690, the ‘‘Gains in Global Nuclear Detection Architecture Act.’’ I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will not seek a sequential referral on this legislation. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing further action on this bill at this time, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. 
Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 690. I would like to thank the gentleman from New York, Congressman DONOVAN , for his help and support and his bipartisanship. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 690 is based on a bipartisan bill I introduced last year, H.R. 5391, which passed the House in September. For decades, security experts have warned of the danger that radioactive materials could be smuggled within and across our borders and used in an act of nuclear terrorism. The DHS Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, or DNDO, brings together expertise from across the Federal Government to detect and prevent the illicit transport, storage, and assembly of nuclear and radiological weapons. These interagency partners coordinate their efforts using a multilayered framework— the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture, or GNDA. GNDA describes Federal programs, guidelines, and detection technologies and identifies research challenges and security gaps. In 2015, GAO looked at how DNDO manages its $350 million research and development program. The report found that DNDO needs to do a better job of documenting how it chooses which projects to fund and how these investments align with security gaps and research challenges—especially for vulnerabilities identified in the GNDA. H.R. 690 would resolve these issues by requiring DNDO to document the rationale it uses to prioritize research topics, explain how selected investments align with gaps and research challenges, and develop a systematic approach to evaluate the outcomes for individual projects. Such documentation is essential to ensure that DNDO is making the right research investments to keep the Nation secure. 
Mr. Speaker, my bill, H.R. 690, would help DNDO use its limited resources toward projects that actually close the vulnerability gaps. Preventing and detecting nuclear smuggling is a complex endeavor. It requires seamless coordination between law enforcement and intelligence officials across the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 690, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 690. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 690. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
SECURING THE CITIES ACT OF 2017 Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 655) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish the Securing the Cities program to enhance the ability of the United States to detect and prevent terrorist attacks and other high consequence events utilizing nuclear or other radiological materials that pose a high risk to homeland security in highrisk urban areas, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 655 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securing the Cities Act of 2017’’. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Title XIX of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 591 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section: 
‘‘(a) E STABLISHMENT .—The Director for Domestic Nuclear Detection shall establish the ‘Securing the Cities’ (‘STC’) program to enhance the ability of the United States to detect and prevent terrorist attacks and other high consequence events utilizing nuclear or other radiological materials that pose a high risk to homeland security in highrisk urban areas. Through the STC program the Director shall— ‘‘(1) assist State, local, tribal, and territorial governments in designing and implementing, or enhancing existing, architectures for coordinated and integrated detection and interdiction of nuclear or other radiological materials that are out of regulatory control; ‘‘(2) support the development of a region wide operating capability to detect and report on nuclear and other radioactive materials out of regulatory control; ‘‘(3) provide resources to enhance detection, analysis, communication, and coordination to better integrate State, local, tribal, and territorial assets into Federal operations; ‘‘(4) facilitate alarm adjudication and provide subject matter expertise and technical assistance on concepts of operations, training, exercises, and alarm response protocols; ‘‘(5) communicate with, and promote sharing of information about the presence or detection of nuclear or other radiological materials among appropriate Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial governments, in a manner that ensures transparency with the jurisdictions served by such program; ‘‘(6) provide augmenting resources, as appropriate, enabling State, local, tribal, and territorial governments to sustain and refresh their capabilities developed under the STC program; and ‘‘(7) provide any other assistance the Director determines appropriate. ‘‘(b) DESIGNATION OF JURISDICTIONS .—In carrying out the program under subsection (a), the Director shall designate jurisdictions from among highrisk urban areas under section 2003, and other cities and regions, as appropriate. ‘‘(c) CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION .—The Di rector shall notify the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate not later than three days before the designation of new jurisdictions under subsection (b) or other changes to participating jurisdictions.’’. (b) GAO REPORT .—Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate an assessment, including an evaluation of the effectiveness, of the Securing the Cities program under section 1908 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as added by subsection (a) of this section.

No additional funds are authorized to carry out the requirements of this Act and the amendments made by this Act. Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise in support of H.R. 655, the Securing the Cities Act of 2017. Representing New York’s 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and Brooklyn, and as a former district attorney, I fully understand the importance of protecting our major cities from catastrophic terrorist attacks. In keeping our pledge to never forget 9/11, it is our duty to ensure that such an attack never happens again. This legislation underscores our commitment and gives the Department of Homeland Security the tools it needs to carry out this mission. In 2015, the Committee on Homeland Security held a hearing at Ground Zero in lower Manhattan. At that hearing, we heard from Commissioner Bratton of the New York City Police Department who described the current threat environment facing New York City. In his testimony, he specifically referenced the risk that terrorists may introduce illicit nuclear materials into the city to conduct an attack. Similarly, Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly recently stated: The United States must prepare for the eventuality of a catastrophic attack given the potential impact and consequences. This bill establishes the Securing the Cities program at the Department of Homeland Security to enhance the ability of the United States to detect and prevent terrorist attacks and other highconsequence events using nuclear and other radiological materials in highrisk urban areas. The Securing the Cities program within the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office provides training, equipment, and other resources to State and local law enforcement in highrisk urban areas to prevent a terrorist group from carrying out an attack using a radiological or nuclear device. The Securing the Cities program began in 2006 as a pilot program in the New York City region which included Jersey City and Newark. Since 2007, the New York City region has purchased nearly 14,000 radiation detectors and trained nearly 20,000 personnel. The pilot program has been so successful it was expanded to the Los Angeles/ Long Beach region in fiscal year 2012, the National Capital Region in fiscal year 2014, and to the cities of Houston and Chicago in 2016. Once the Securing 
the Cities program is fully implemented, it will protect nearly 100 million people across this country. I would like to thank the Department of Homeland Security for its hard work and commitment to this program. Given the alarming terrorist threat from ISIS and al Qaeda and their willingness to carry out an attack using a weapon of mass destruction, this program could not be more vital. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 655. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 655. For over a decade, the Securing the Cities program has provided a growing number of first responders from New York City and Newark, New Jersey to Los Angeles and Long Beach to Washington, D.C., Houston, and Chicago with the tools they need to detect radiological and nuclear threats. Securing the Cities is administered by the Department of Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, DNDO, which houses the Department’s experts on preparing for and responding to rad/nuc events. The program makes funding available to participating jurisdictions for planning and analysis related to radiological and nuclear threats, as well as equipment purchases, training, and exercises. Through this program, DNDO supports grantees by providing subject matter expertise, training, coordination, and technological support. H.R. 655 would formally authorize the existing Securing the Cities program and improve it by directing the Government Accountability Office to assess the program and offer recommendations for how it could become more effective. Mr. Speaker, this bill passed the House last Congress by a vote of 441–4. Mr. Speaker, the Securing the Cities program plays a critical role in protecting communities across America from the threat posed by radiological and nuclear weapons. H.R. 655 will ensure that this important program continues and becomes more robust in future years. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 655. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 655, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 655. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS ALLOWABLE USE ACT Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 437) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to codify authority under existing grant guidance authorizing use of Urban Area Security Initiative and State Homeland Security Grant Program funding for enhancing medical preparedness, medical surge capacity, and mass prophylaxis capabilities. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 437 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act’’. 
SEC. 2. USE OF CERTAIN HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT FUNDS FOR ENHANCING MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS, MEDICAL SURGE CAPACITY, AND MASS PROPHYLAXIS CAPABILITIES. 
Section 2008 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 609) is amended— (1) in subsection (a)— (A) by redesignating paragraphs (10) through (14) as paragraphs (11) through (15), respectively; and (B) by inserting after paragraph (9) the following new paragraph (10): ‘‘(10) enhancing medical preparedness, medical surge capacity, and mass prophylaxis capabilities, including the development and maintenance of an initial pharmaceutical stockpile, including medical kits, and diagnostics sufficient to protect first responders, their families, immediate victims, and vulnerable populations from a chemical or biological event;’’; and (2) in subsection (b)(3)(B), by striking ‘‘subsection (a)(10)’’ and inserting ‘‘subsection (a)(11)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security’s Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise today in support of H.R. 437, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act. H.R. 437 was introduced by Congressman BILIRAKIS , a former chairman of the Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee. This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make it clear that State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area Security Initiative Grant funds may be used to enhance medical preparedness and purchase medical countermeasures. H.R. 437 codifies current grant guidance to ensure that recipients of the State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area Security Initiative Grants will continue to be able to use these funds for medical preparedness equipment and activities. Mr. Speaker, the threat of a terrorist attack using a chemical or biological agent is real. We must ensure our first responders have the tools and capabilities they need should such an event occur. In my district, the City of New York has put their Homeland Security grants to good use for this purpose. In 2014, they held a fullscale exercise which simulated an anthrax attack on the city. Participants from agencies across the city, including the health department, the New York City Police Department, and the Office of Emergency Management worked to set up locations to quickly distribute lifesaving medical countermeasures to city residents across the five boroughs. We must ensure that the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative funds continue to be available, despite any changes to yearly grant guidance, for exercises like the one conducted by New York City and other important medical preparedness activities. This bill does just that. Identical language to H.R. 437 passed the House last Congress by a vote of 377–2. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman BILIRAKIS for introducing this commonsense bill. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. b1630 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 437. Whether the result of a naturally occurring outbreak, like Zika or Ebola, or an intentional release of biopathogens, like anthrax attacks that shook Washington immediately after 9/11, we must ensure that our public health and medical response communities are prepared to respond to events that may stretch their capabilities. In recent years, the Metropolitan Medical Response System Program has been eliminated, and grants supported by the Department of Health and Human Services, such as the Hospital Preparedness Program, have been cut. As a result, many jurisdictions have been forced to make tough choices and, in many cases, divert other limited funding to support medical preparedness. Under current law, the Urban Area Security Initiative and the State Homeland Security Grant Program funding can be used to bolster medical preparedness capabilities, but the ability to use funds for that purpose is contingent on the grant guidance issued 
every year. H.R. 437 would make enhancing medical preparedness and medical surge capacity and capabilities eligible uses of Homeland Security Grant funds under the law. This measure passed in the House last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to again support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ). Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his support. I rise today in support of critical legislation to support public safety and first responders, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act, H.R. 437. My bill will help secure medical countermeasures for first responders, ensuring we are prepared for any type of emergency. For instance, last year, in Florida, we faced the outbreak of the Zika virus. The Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act means that reliable grant funding would be available to conduct medical preparedness activities such as planning, training, and purchasing protective equipment to combat Zika or other public health threats going forward nationwide. When the worst occurs, our first responders are there for us on the front lines. I consistently find myself in awe of these brave men and women and the sacrifices they make on the public’s behalf. They are heroes. The least we can do is make sure they have the tools they need to do their jobs and keep us safe. That is what my bill seeks to accomplish. We want to keep them safe as well, Mr. Speaker. The legislation authorizes grant funds for the stockpiling of countermeasures, including medical kits, protective gear, ventilators, and more. This should give us all peace of mind to know this vital equipment will be there in case of a crisis. Importantly, the grant fund used in H.R. 437 already exists. The bill does not require new or additional funding. Also significant, this bill has received strong bipartisan support. I thank my colleagues, Representatives SUSAN BROOKS and P ETER KING, for being original cosponsors of H.R. 437. I was inspired to write this legislation during my time as subcommittee chairman on the Homeland Security Committee after a series of hearings with folks from the emergency response community. They expressed the urgent need for stockpiling these medical countermeasures and for providing first responders the assurance that grant funding may be used to support them now and in the future. They need certainty, Mr. Speaker. I am proud to have the support of the Emergency Services Coalition for Medical Preparedness and the International Association of Fire Chiefs on this issue. The Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act is going to make a difference to protect the public and protect our protectors. I strongly urge passage today. Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 437. Developing and maintaining medical preparedness is an important part of national preparedness. State and local governments should not have to wonder whether they will be able to use DHS grant funds for this purpose from year to year. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 437. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 437. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 437. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ) and the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 612, the United StatesIsrael Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2017. I was grateful for the opportunity to work closely with my colleague, Mr. LANGEVIN from Rhode Island, on this vitally important legislation that will build upon the existing collaboration between the United States and the State of Israel on critical cybersecurity issues. Following our successful congressional delegation to Israel in May of last year to discuss homeland security and cybersecurity issues, Mr. LANGEVIN  and I worked closely to champion two important pieces of legislation. Last year, I introduced H.R. 5877, the United StatesIsraeli Advanced Partnership Act of 2016, which was signed into law on December 16 with Mr. LANGEVIN ’s help and support. That legislation expanded a current cooperative research program between the two countries by adding cybersecurity to a program that had previously focused only on border security, explosives detection, and emergency services. Today, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have H.R. 612, the United StatesIsrael Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2017 come before the House. This bill would expand the memorandum of agreement already in place between our Department of Homeland Security and the State of Israel by authorizing the Secretary to carry out a grant program at DHS to support cybersecurity research and development as well as the demonstration and commercialization of cybersecurity technologies. During our congressional delegation, Mr. LANGEVIN and I were able to meet with top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to discuss how the United States and Israel can better cooperate in these vital areas. We also had the opportunity to meet with many of Israel’s cybersecurity companies and technology startups. Over the past several years, Israel has become a leader in cybersecurity and has developed a deep and talented cyber workforce, something we need greater focus on here in the United States. To that end, much of our discussion with Israeli officials and private companies revolved around how the United States and Israel can work more closely together and learn from each other as we combat growing cybersecurity threats. This legislation is a product of those successful discussions. Mr. Speaker, the United States and Israel are both under constant threat from nationstate and other actors that wish to do our countries harm, so it is vitally important that the United States and Israel work handinhand to build our cyber defenses to combat these cyber threats together. Mr. Speaker, it is also vital that in the House both parties work handin hand on America’s national security vulnerabilities. Given the current political environment, I would like to commend and thank my colleague, Mr. LANGEVIN , for his willingness to do just that, as demonstrated by his partnership on this issue. I very much look forward to continuing to work with him on more cybersecurity issues during the 115th Congress. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 612, the United StatesIsrael Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2017. Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking Chairman RATCLIFFE for his leadership on the subcommittee and, in particular, on the issue of cybersecurity. I have greatly enjoyed our partnership on this and many issues. I appreciate his due diligence and his hard work on many national security issues. Let me also start by expressing my deep gratitude to Chairman MCCAUL and Ranking Member THOMPSON in acting so quickly to bring this bill to the floor. Both the chairman and ranking member led a very productive committee last Congress, and I am very pleased that their commitment to protect our national security has extended to swift action this year as well. That urgency is particularly relevant to this bill, the United StatesIsrael Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement Act. As Chairman RATCLIFFE mentioned, last May, he and I traveled to Israel to meet with public and private cybersecurity officials. I think I can speak for my friend when I say that we were very impressed by the Israeli’s efforts in this space. Israel was one of the first countries to recognize the potential threat posed by interconnected computer systems, and they have been leaders in cybersecurity now for decades. For instance, the first stateful firewall technology was first developed by an Israeli firm. Today, these firewalls are ubiquitous across the information security landscape. In fact, despite its size, Israel is the second largest exporter of cybersecurity goods and services, behind only the United States. U.S. companies have certainly taken notice. Mr. RATCLIFFE and I, as he mentioned, met with some of their representatives during our trip. Just last week, Reuters reported that one of the components of Microsoft’s $1 billion per year cybersecurity strategy is acquisition of three Israeli corporations. Collaboration with our closest Middle East ally only makes sense from a national security perspective. Preserving Israeli security is essential to stability in the region. We clearly have a lot to learn from each other as well, which is why I have championed governmenttogovernment interaction on cybersecurity, such as the recent letter of intent for more informationsharing between DHS and Israel that was championed by former Deputy Secretary Mayorkas. Beyond our governments working together, Chairman RATCLIFFE and I also believe the government can do more to encourage collaboration between our private sector and nonprofit entities on issues directly relevant to homeland security. That is why, upon our return, we worked in close collaboration to develop two bills to enhance these cooperative relationships. I could not have asked for a better partnership in this effort. I was thrilled that our first bill, the United States Israel Advanced Research Partnership Act, was signed into law last month. It is our second bill, which passed the House in November, but failed to make 
it through the Senate before Congress adjourned last year, that we are discussing today. Specifically, this bill creates a cybersecurity grant program for joint research and development ventures between Israeli and American entities. Projects would be selected after a merit review process and would have to address requirements in cybersecurity determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The grants would also be subject to a costsharing requirement, with at least 50 percent of project funds coming from a nonFederal source. Importantly, H.R. 612 leverages existing United StatesIsrael R&D infrastructure, specifically the Binational Industrial Research and Development, or BIRD Foundation, and the Binational Science Foundation, or BSF. Both organizations have a proven track record of encouraging joint research ventures. b1645 BIRD, for instance, has financed R&D and commercialization projects that have led to a cumulative $8 billion in commercial sales since its founding, while BSF regularly funds collaborations between the top scientists in our respective countries as 45 Nobel laureates have received support from the Foundation. Now, using the existing infrastructure, as was done in 2007 when Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act that led to the creation of BIRD Energy, also allows us to capitalize on both foundations’ robust networks of United States and Israeli entities to help seed these joint ventures. All of these factors are particularly critical in the fastmoving cybersecurity domain where offensive and defensive tactics and techniques change on a monthly or even weekly basis. As such, advances in the discipline require a near constant reexamining of assumptions, and having people from different backgrounds and security cultures working together engenders an environment where such reexamination is encouraged. While both the U.S. and Israel have robust cybersecurity communities, further collaboration will spur more advances to combat the threats that we face. Although some of these advances are technological in nature, basic cybersecurity research, such as investigations into the psychology of secure interface design and social engineering, is also supported by the bill. All told, the programs authorized in H.R. 612 will both address urgent homeland security needs and build capacity for further transnational collaboration on cybersecurity, all while matching Federal investment with private sector dollars and funds from the Israeli Government. Mr. Speaker, I normally preface my remarks on cybersecurity with an explanation of the threat our country faces. I would hope that, given recent events, I don’t have to remind my colleagues of the dangers that we face in this sphere which, as I see it, is one of the key national security challenges of the 21st century. I would hope that incidents like the recent attack on the Ukrainian power grid demonstrate the power of a computer keyboard to affect our critical infrastructure. I would hope that the breach of hundreds of millions of accounts at Yahoo, which affected around 10 percent of the world’s population, demonstrates how pervasive data collection is and its vulnerabilities. I would certainly hope that the Russian information warfare operations targeting the very foundations of our democracy, our elections, demonstrate the stakes that we face. In the face of these threats, we must join together with our allies to protect a free and open internet and ensure that the amazing benefits of technology are not overshadowed by the new vulnerabilities that they open up. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 612 is an important step to driving the innovation we need in the security space to meet these two goals. As with any bills that make it to the floor, this bill owes much to the dedicated staff on both sides of the aisle who spent countless hours behind the scenes reviewing this legislation. I thank them for their extraordinary and exceptional work. I am also very grateful, again, to Chairman MCCAUL, Ranking Member THOMPSON , and Subcommittee Ranking Member RICHMOND for their continued leadership on cybersecurity and, in particular, Chairman RATCLIFFE for his work and for their assistance in quickly actualizing the lessons that we have learned on our trip to Israel. Finally, in closing, I owe, once again, a debt of gratitude to my friend across the aisle, Chairman RATCLIFFE , who, in his first term, immediately had a substantial impact on our Nation’s cybersecurity and with whom it has been a great pleasure to work. I look forward to our continued work in this Congress and beyond. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 612 does three things: it encourages innovative approaches to address top priorities in homeland security R&D; it strengthens ties with Israel, one of our closest allies; and it does so in a publicprivate partnership that matches Federal investment. Mr. Speaker, if you indulge me for a moment, I would like to read something the Saudi Arabian Computer Emergency Response Team put out last week: ‘‘Following a recent cyberattack which targeted several national organizations, this is an urgent call for your cybersecurity team to be on the alert for Shamoon 2 and ransomware attacks that could possibly cripple your organization’s systems.’’ For those of my colleagues who are not aware, the Shamoon attacks of 2012 took down tens of thousands of computers at the Saudi state oil company, Saudi Aramco. The Shamoon 2 variant has been targeting Saudi Government agencies and private industry since November. I bring this up, Mr. Speaker, because open source intelligence reports point to Iran as being responsible for the original Shamoon attack. I believe there is a good chance that Iranian aligned actors are behind the recent incidents as well. Our Israeli partners live under this threat every day, and, to be frank, so do we. Last year, the Justice Department indicted seven Iranian hackers for attacks on the U.S. financial sector and for probing the networks of a New York dam. The same threats that leave me unable to sleep keep my friend Dr. Matania, head of the Israel National Cyber Bureau, up at night as well. Closing our aperture of vulnerability will be difficult, Mr. Speaker, but it is possible if we work together to bring our countries’ unique perspectives to bear on the problem. I know my colleagues in the Senate share these sentiments, and I hope they will move quickly to take this bill up and start fostering further collaboration as soon as possible. Let me again thank Chairman RATCLIFFE for his leadership and his outstanding work on this bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 612. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for his kind words. I also thank him and commend him for his leadership on cybersecurity issues for many years in this House. I look forward to working with him for many years, hopefully, to come. I thank him for his friendship and collaboration in helping to make America safer. Mr. Speaker, I again urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 612. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 612. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

b1725 So the resolution was agreed to. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I was detained at a classified briefing with the Secretary of Homeland Security causing me to miss these two votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 68 and ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 69. REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 36, PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A FINAL RULE OF THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 37, DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, AND THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION Mr. COLE, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–8) on the resolution (H. Res. 74) providing for consideration of the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 36) providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the final rule of the Bureau of Land Management relating to ‘‘Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation’’, and providing for consideration of the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 37) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. f 
b1730 STOP THE INTRUSION OF POLITICAL ROBOCALLS (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, every campaign season, like clockwork, families are bombarded by an endless stream of political robocalls. There is little voters can do to stop the annoyance, which all too often comes right in the middle of family dinners and bedtimes, because politicians made sure to exempt themselves from the power of the Do Not Call Registry. That is why I have introduced legislation, H.R. 740, to stop the intrusion of political robocalls in homes across America. The Robo Calls Off Phones Act, or Robo COP Act, directs the Federal Trade Commission to revise its regulations regarding the National Do Not Call Registry and prohibit prerecorded campaign messages from being sent to telephone numbers on the national registry. It gives the American people the opportunity to opt out of these bothersome interruptions. Removing the exemption for political robocalls is a matter of fairness that will help bring some peace and quiet to homes throughout the campaign season. 
RECOGNIZING FORMERREPRESENTATIVE XAVIER BECERRA (Mr. CA´RDENAS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CA´RDENAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible work of formerCongressman and now California State Attorney General Xavier Becerra. Attorney General Becerra holds nearly three decades of elected public service as a State legislator, a Member of Congress, and now as California’s attorney general. I am proud to call Xavier Becerra my friend. It has been a pleasure to work alongside him as he courageously fought for all Americans, for women, LGBTQ communities, minorities, and comprehensive immigration reform. He is the first Latino to serve as a member of one of the powerful committees in our House, and he is also the first Latino chairman of the Democratic Caucus. Through his leadership and guidance, our priorities have become more defined and have driven the legislative process. Attorney General Becerra, thank you for your tireless service and commitment to our country as you have certainly become one of the most influential leaders of our time. f 
THANKING REPRESENTATIVE XAVIER BECERRA (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, I stand here today to recognize the extraordinary leadership of Xavier Becerra who for the last 24 years proudly served the people of Los Angeles, California, as a Member of the United States House of Representatives. Xavier’s career in public service began as a call to fight for people like his parents, a clerical worker and a construction worker, who were often neglected in the policymaking process. He was elected to Congress in 1992. He most recently served as the first Hispanic member of the Committee on Ways and Means. During his tenure, he was also the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. He worked with his colleagues to increase opportunities for working families, to improve Social Security, and to strengthen Medicare. He fought for a Tax Code that was fair to hardworking families and small businesses. He stood for immigrants of all communities in his support of the DREAM Act and comprehensive immigration reform. He continues this important work now as the attorney general of California, where he is already using his position, knowledge, and experience to uphold our values by rejecting policies that this administration hopes to exact on the American people. Representative Becerra, thank you and your family for your service. Your 
community, your colleagues, your country, and I thank you for your service. 
NO WALL ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER (Mr. O’ROURKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. O’ROURKE. Madam Speaker, we have the lowest levels of northbound apprehension coming across our southern border in modern history. We have more Mexican nationals going south to Mexico today than coming north to the United States. We have less than zero migration from Mexico. In El Paso, Texas, the border community is the safest city in the United States. On top of that, there has been not a terrorist, terrorist plot, or terrorist organization that is connected to our border with Mexico. But just in case, we are being vigilant. We are spending $19 billion a year to secure that border. There are 20,000 brave members of the Border Patrol who patrol every inch of that 2,000mile border. Madam Speaker, we do not need a wall on our southern border. It is a waste of time. It is a waste of resources, and it takes our eye off of the real threats to this country. Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in opposing a wall from this new administration. 
CONGRATULATING XAVIER BECERRA (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my friend and former colleague, Xavier Becerra, for his long and effective record of service on behalf of California in Congress. Attorney General Xavier Becerra has been a true mentor and a friend to me, especially during this transition serving as a new Member of Congress. His support and his service reaffirm that the children of immigrants and immigrants themselves have a crucial role to play in our Federal Government. I want to congratulate Xavier Becerra on his welldeserved appointment to serve as California’s attorney general. While he is no longer with us in the House, I know that his new appointment will be even greater felt across our country during these troubling political times. I have no doubt that, as attorney general, Xavier will defend our Constitution and fight for families in California and help our State serve as a beacon of hope and progress in America. IMMIGRATION EXECUTIVE ORDER AND CONFLICT OF BUSINESS INTEREST (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to focus on President Trump’s curious executive action to deny U.S. entry of certain refugees and travelers who were cleared and properly vetted. The arbitrary and discriminatory nature of his order is odd in that he only identified seven countries to be included. One must ask: Why were other nations excluded? Yes, excluded from the executive order are several Middle Eastern, African, and other nations where The Trump Organization has business interests, including Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, where the majority of 9/11 terrorists originated. We know Mr. Trump has failed to divest from his company, as ethics experts have duly noted. Every American should wonder whether he designed this executive order with his own business interests, at least, partly in mind. This is the purpose of divestiture, to eliminate any possible question of doubt or possible mal intent. Without divesting from management and ownership, President Trump’s circumstance threatens the basic tenet of the rule of law that the government and all of its actors will discharge duties in the best interest of the American people, not their selfinterest or the interests of their cronies or the interest of their brand. f 
TRUMP’S REFUGEE ACTIONS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. CHENEY). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I might say it is great seeing you in the chair. You are a natural fit. Maybe we can do something about that at some point. It is an honor to speak in this hallowed Hall. There has been much ado made about contrived misrepresentations about what has gone on with President Trump’s executive order regarding seven countries that the Obama administration designated as being problems when it comes to refugees coming from those countries. It has been absolutely incredible. And I think some of us were talking that it really exemplifies why networks like CNN—that was the one, the only 24hour cable news network—have lost so much to other networks. MSNBC, CNBC, and even Fox News got caught up in some of the misrepresentations, and I couldn’t believe that they were spending the kind of time talking about a contrived issue. Now, there was a problem in some innocent people being delayed and improperly handled, people who didn’t deserve that. I am familiar with how that feels because I deal, like most of us do in this body, with TSA on virtually a weekly or even sometimes more often basis. There is a great article here by John Hayward from January 29. Mr. Hayward says: ‘‘The sober and logical reasons for President Donald Trump’s executive order on refugees and visitors are rising above the noise after an evening of hysterical overreactions and emotional meltdowns on the Nation’s TV networks. ‘‘Advocates of sane, secure immigration policy have long noted that it’s almost impossible to have a reasonable discussion of the refugee and immigration issues, because it’s been sentimentalized and politicized beyond the realm of rational thought. ‘‘This weekend brings them another superb example of mediamagnified shrieking about fascism, bleating about ‘white nationalists,’ howling about ‘religious persecution,’ false invocations of the Constitution, and theatrical sobbing on behalf of the Statue of Liberty.’’ We do have that water coming off the Statute of Liberty being analyzed, so that we can determine whether or not it is tears or something else. ‘‘For readers who want to wallow in the emotion, examples can be found in this handy dossier of hysteria compiled by the Washington Post. But clear eyed adults prefer to examine plain facts about Trump’s executive order: ‘‘1. It is NOT a ‘Muslim ban.’’’ I have the executive order here. Unlike those in the Senate and those in the media, who were just excoriating President Trump and anyone involved in this executive order, I actually read it, unlike those people. I read the executive order. b1745 And because I read the executive order, I understood there was no ban against Muslims, no ban against Islam. It was very straightforward. And Hayward’s article points that out. He said: ‘‘You will search the executive order in vain for mentions of Islam, or any other religion. By Sunday morning, the media began suffering acute attacks of honesty and writing headlines such as ‘Trump’s Latest Executive Order: Banning People From 7 Countries and More.’’ And that was from CNN. And, Madam Speaker, I am very pleased that CNN finally got around to having a more truthful headline. ‘‘Granted, CNN still slips in the phrase ‘Muslimmajority countries’ into every article about the order, including the post in which they reprinted its text in full, but CNN used the word ‘Muslim,’ not Trump. The order applies to all citizens of Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It does not specify Muslims. The indefinite hold on Syrian refugees 
will affect Christians and Muslims alike,’’ not to mention people of every other religion and people of no religion. ‘‘As Tim Carney at the Washington Examiner points out, the largest Muslimmajority countries in the world are not named in the Executive Order. ‘‘More countries may be added to the moratorium in the days to come, as the Secretary of Homeland Security has been instructed to complete a 30day review of nations that don’t provide adequate information for vetting applicants. ‘‘It is also noteworthy that the ban is not absolute. Exceptions for ‘foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C–2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G–1, G–2, G–3 and G–4 visas’ are expressly made in the order. The Departments of State and Homeland Security can also grant exceptions on a ‘casebycase basis’’’— that is all in the executive order—‘‘and ‘when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.’ ‘‘There is a provision in the Executive Order that says applications based on religious persecution will be prioritized ‘provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual’s country of nationality.’’’ And so it is important to note here, I think from the executive order, that it says applications based on religious persecution. That means that people that have applied for visas or immigration benefits to come into the United States who, themselves, raise their religion as a reason to let them into the United States, those need to be prioritized based on whether or not their religion is actually being persecuted, those holding those religious beliefs are actually being persecuted. And I think that is a rather intelligent way to approach things. But in those cases, it would be the applicant that would raise the issue of religion, not the Trump administration, not the State Department, not Homeland Security. It would be the foreign applicant trying to come into the United States who would be the one to raise that issue. Now, the article goes on: ‘‘This has been denounced as a ‘stealth Muslim ban’ by some of the very same people who were conspicuously silent when the Obama administration pushed Christians—who are the most savagely persecuted minority in the Middle East, with only the Yazidis offering real competition—to the back of the migration line.’’ So it is important to note that, for years, this administration has been part of the discrimination and persecution against Christians in the world against whom there has been a genocide in progress. So when the head of the U.N. was in charge of the refugee program and was asked why is there not a similar percentage of Christians coming in as refugees to other countries to the percentage that Christians make up in that nation they come from, basically, the man who is now head of United Nations said, well, it is important to leave them where they have this historical presence, basically. So in other words, yes, there is a genocide going on. They want to kill off every Christian in those areas, every Christian in the Middle East, and so the U.N. now Secretary General says let’s leave them in the area where they are being wiped off the map, brutally killed. Let’s leave them there until we can say this place where they were historically has now shown there are none there. They have all been brutally murdered as the U.N. watched and didn’t help. It is outrageous how uncivilized this United Nations has become. I filed a bill, and I still think we should bring it to the floor, that would require a complete defunding by the United States of the United Nations until such time as they withdraw the resolution of the Security Council that condemned Israel. I mean, it is like a teacher of mine in the fifth grade after I got beat up by a bully who had been held back two grades, was about 18 inches taller. She pointed to the class and said: This is what happens when little boys try to play with the big boys. Well, that is basically what the Obama administration had been doing. It is basically what the U.N. had been doing. They took the side of the mean bullies that had been devastating the Christians in the area. Having talked to so many Christians who were living in Syria and who the mainstream press say, oh, yeah, they are big Assad fans—no, they were not big Assad fans. They knew that he could be quite brutal, but their only point that the mainstream media in the United States and most of the world was missing is that Assad prevented Christians from being the victims of a genocide; and as Assad was weakened, the assaults and the murders and the rapes of Christians increased exponentially. I do think that the United States may still be held to account in the ledger of world history—what I would submit is God’s ledger—for having the power and the moral right to stop a genocide of Christians in the Middle East and we participated in leaving them where they were, as did the U.N., so that they could be brutally murdered. I am going back to Mr. Hayward’s article. ‘‘2. The order’’—talking about the executive order of Donald Trump. ‘‘The order is based on security reviews conducted by President Barack Obama’s deputies.’’ And, Madam Speaker, for those in the mainstream media, I think it is important to repeat that line. President Trump’s executive order that didn’t ban Muslims but that ordered a temporary pause on people from certain countries from whom we had no information or inadequate information to vet the people that were coming in, it was based on security reviews conducted by President Barack Obama’s deputies. ‘‘As White House counselor Kellyanne Conway pointed out on ‘Fox News Sunday,’ the seven nations named in Trump’s executive order are drawn from the Terrorist Prevention Act of 2015. The 2015 ‘Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015’ named Iraq, Iran, Sudan, and Syria, while its 2016 update added Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. ‘‘‘These are countries that have a history of training, harboring, exporting terrorists. We can’t keep pretending and look the other way,’ said Conway. ‘‘3. The moratorium is largely temporary. Citizens of the seven countries’’—and by the way, in this executive order that President Trump signed, there is no mention of the countries. It refers to what President Obama signed declaring, first, the four countries, and then the three countries. It just refers to that that President Obama signed. He doesn’t single out or name the countries; and I can’t help but think, as intelligent as some of the people are that are assisting President Trump, that they showed a massive amount of naivete because it appears that they thought, if in the executive order President Trump refers to documents that President Obama signed designating these countries as countries where we didn’t have adequate information, then even the mainstream media would have to go back to President Trump’s and look above his signature and see that these are places that President Obama said were threats. And then they would—having some semblance of a conscience—have to point out that actually Trump is just putting in an executive order of what basically Obama signed off on but didn’t go ahead and carry out what needed to be done based on that law. But, as I say, these folks were rather naive. And as the saying goes in Washington, no matter how cynical you get, it is never enough to catch up in this town. And so the Trump administration, the Trump advisers have a lot of growing to do to understand just how unfair the media can be. It is a valid presumption that if you don’t name the countries, you make the mainstream media go back and look at what President Obama signed that they will understand, oh, this is what President Obama proclaimed that he is basing this on, so we can’t be so mean to President Trump. Well, it didn’t turn out that way, and they are learning that just because it would make great sense, be common sense in most areas of the country— that is areas that are not the fringe 
that voted for Hillary Clinton, but most of the country would say it is common sense. It isn’t common within the original 10by10 mile boundaries of the District of Columbia, which are no longer 10 by 10 after ceding the land west of the Potomac to Virginia back in the 1840s. But number four in this Hayward article: ‘‘Obama banned immigration from Iraq, and Carter banned it from Iran. ‘‘‘Factchecking’ website PolitiFact twists itself into knots to avoid giving a ‘true’ rating to the absolutely true fact that Jimmy Carter banned Iranian immigration in 1980, unless applicants could prove they were enemies of the Khomenei theocracy. ‘‘One of PolitiFact’s phony talking points states that Carter ‘acted against Iranian nationals, not an entire religion.’ As noted above, Trump’s Executive Order is precisely the same—it does not act against an ‘entire religion,’ it names seven countries.’’ But, you know, I had some personal experience with PolitiFact. I used the word earlier today, ‘‘hack,’’ ‘‘political hack,’’ in an interview, and that is what I think of PolitiFact. They shouldn’t be called PolitiFact. They ought to be called ‘‘PolitiHack.’’ b1800 I know I was speaking here on the House floor—I think it was last year— and I made a statement based on data received by the Senate on the percentage of American citizens and the percentage of noncitizens—nonAmerican citizens—who were in Federal prison for possession of a controlled substance. The reason I singled out possession was because President Obama has tried to make it appear that people in Federal prison have gotten such a bad rap because they really—just simple possession—they didn’t deserve to be in prison so long. There is this whole intimation that, gee, there are people in Federal prison for possession of controlled substances who should have been let out a long time ago, and that is why we needed to have our laws changed. Well, since the President had mentioned people in Federal prison for possession, I singularly pointed out that the huge majority of people in Federal prison for simple possession were not American citizens. I’m going from my memory, but, apparently, PolitiFact wanted to do as they normally do and cover for the Democrats and try to do a hatchet job on a Republican since they are not political fact, they are political hack. So my communications person gets an email from ‘‘PolitiHack’’ that uses the name PolitiFact and wanted to know the source of my information because they were going to rate my statement. She provided the facts as provided by this administration to the Senate. Clearly what I had said was exactly true. I had quoted specifically from the data from the Obama administration, and it was 100 percent accurate. So then they come back—they thought they would catch me in not having proper information, and they come back to my communications person and said: Well, we have got information from the Bureau of Prisons that showed that if you look at all offenses that involved controlled substances, the percentage of noncitizens is not nearly that high. So why would he use just possession? The point was because President Obama had used simple possession to try to make it look as if people in Federal prison were not there for very serious crimes, and there is certainly a smaller number of people in Federal prison for possession than for dealing drugs and other charges. So in the end, after all the back and forth, they basically perpetuated a fraud upon the American people, PolitiFact—a bunch of political hacks—by not being willing to say that my statement was 100 percent true because they, in some contorted manner, did not want to point out that my statement was exactly true. They refer basically to, oh, that the number wasn’t near that high of people involved in controlled substance. I didn’t mention everybody with controlled substance. So that is just a parenthetical in Hayward’s article for me because I know personally PolitiFact is a political joke if what they were doing was not so serious in harming the American people by misrepresenting the true facts of what is going on. I hope that at some point being still remaining an entrepreneurial country for a little longer—at least we have got nearly 4 years to go that we can be assured of as an entrepreneurial country—at least in that time perhaps we will have an entrepreneurial group that will rise up and start scoring PolitiFact to show just how unfair they are, and, on occasion, when they are actually fair, show that as well so the American public can actually score the illegitimate scorers. But going back to this article, it says: ‘‘As for Barack Obama, he did indeed ban immigration from Iraq, for much longer than Trump’s order bans it from the seven listed nations, and none of the people melting down today uttered a peep of protest. Richard Grenell summed it up perfectly in a Tweet: ‘Obama took 6 months to review screening for 1 country. Trump will take 3 months for 7 countries. . . . ’’’ This article goes on: ‘‘5. Trump’s refugee caps are comparable to Obama’s pre2016 practices: David French, who was touted as a spoiler candidate to keep Donald Trump out of the White House during the presidential campaign—in other words, not a big Trump fan—wrote a lengthy and clearheaded analysis of the Executive Order for National Review. He noted that after the moratorium ends in 120 days’’—and that is one section. It ends in 120 days, the other section is 90 days, another part says they will have 30 days to produce a report. But it goes on to say: ‘‘Trump caps refugee admissions at 50,000 per year . . . which is roughly the same as President Obama’s admissions in 2011 and 2012, and not far below the 70,000 per year cap in place from 2013 to 2015. ‘‘Obama had fairly low caps on refugees during the worst years of the Syrian civil war. He didn’t throw open the doors to mass refugee admissions until his final year in office. Depending on how Trump’s review of Syrian refugee policy turns out, he’s doing little more than returning admissions to normal levels after a fourmonth pause for security reviews. ‘‘6. The Executive Order is legal: Those invoking the Constitution to attack Trump’s order are simply embarrassing themselves. The President has clear statutory authority to take these actions. As noted, his predecessors did so, without much controversy. ‘‘Most of the legal arguments against Trump’s order summarized by USA Today are entirely specious, such as attacking him for ‘banning an entire religion,’ which the order manifestly does not do. Critics of the order have a political opinion that it will in effect ‘ban Muslims,’ but that’s not what it says. Designating specific nations as trouble spots and ordering a pause is entirely within the President’s authority, and there is ample precedent to prove it. ‘‘It should be possible to argue with the reasoning behind the order, or argue that it will have negative unintended consequences, without advancing hollow legal arguments. Of course, this is America 2017, so a wave of lawsuits will soon be sloshing through the courts. ‘‘7. This Executive Order is a security measure, not an arbitrary expression of supposed xenophobia. Conway stressed the need to enhance immigration security from trouble spots in her ‘Fox News Sunday’ interview. French also addressed the subject in his post: ‘‘When we know our enemy is seeking to strike America and its allies through the refugee population, when we know they’ve succeeded in Europe, and when the administration has doubts about our ability to adequately vet the refugees we admit into this nation, a pause is again not just prudent but arguably necessary. It is important that we provide sufficient aid and protection to keep refugees safe and healthy in place, but it is not necessary to bring Syrians to the United States to fulfill our vital moral obligations.’’ The article goes on. It is well written, points are well made, and I would humbly submit, Madam Speaker, that we had the statistics last year that showed that for the cost of bringing one Syrian refugee to the United States for 1 year, we could help take care of 12 Syrian refugees in place in a safe zone over near their home. 
Now, I am very encouraged that even though President Obama simply would not ever agree or strive to have a safe zone in areas near the refugees’ homes so we can take care of 12 times more than we can possibly bring to our country for the same cost, and he is working on that, and he has got some agreements, and it looks like that may be a possibility. We give air cover, help create safe zones in areas there in the Middle East so the refugees can live without being killed and horribly brutally murdered and abused. That makes more sense. It appears that the President has worked with or talked with the Saudi authorities and perhaps will be able to get something like that worked out. There were people just quite emotional over the fact that Saudi Arabia was not mentioned and Egypt was not mentioned. Actually, the order did not mention any nations by name. The Trump executive order simply referred to what President Obama signed off on which included seven countries. These are seven countries where it shouldn’t even be arguable among people of common sense that we do not have, have not received, and cannot get adequate information from which to determine whether people wanting to come into the United States are actually refugees or if they are part of al Qaeda, al Nusra, and ISIS, and they want to come kill Americans and end our freedoms and our way of life. That is why such an executive order was entirely appropriate. Although I supported a different candidate for President for over a year, I applaud President Trump in caring so deeply about the American public that he would take the honorable and appropriate steps to protect Americans that the last administration would not take. A great article in Townhall from Matt Vespa is entitled: ‘‘Friendly Reminder: Obama Selected The List Of Seven Countries in Trump’s Executive Order.’’ That certainly should be noted yet again. Another great article here by Seth Frantzman says: ‘‘Obama’s Administration Made the ‘Muslim Ban’ Possible and the Media Won’t Tell You.’’ It is a good article there. I think this article from John Hayward from January 27 on Breitbart may give us insight as to why there is so much howling by CAIR and CAIR associates because there were implications of people involved with CAIR in the Holy Land Foundation trial. b1815 One just merely need to go look at the pleadings. Here in Congress, since Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch went through their entire terms as Attorneys General and continued to refuse to provide the discovery documents in the Holy Land Foundation trial that were provided in pretrial to the convicted terrorist supporters, it is pretty incomprehensible for some of us. On one occasion, when Attorney General Holder pointed out that, well, there may be some classified issues involved, I pointed out to him—apparently, it went right over his head and he couldn’t discern—the fact that the Justice Department gave the documents I am requesting to people that were then convicted of supporting terrorism. If Justice could give them to the terrorists without concern about being classified, surely they could give them to Members of Congress. Although some of us may argue in such ways that it terrifies some people, we are not terrorists and we are authorized to receive classified information. We should have been authorized in Congress to receive the same documents that the Justice Department provided to the terrorist supporters who were convicted. This article from John Hayward, January 27, points out that: ‘‘According to Reuters, a ‘factional’ debate is under way within the Trump administration over adding the Muslim Brotherhood to the State Department and Treasury lists of foreign terrorist organizations. ‘‘This is a measure often called for by critics of the Brotherhood as Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney, who once again recommended an official terrorist designation on Wednesday’s edition of Breitbart News Daily. ‘‘A source in the Trump transition team told Reuters the effort to so designate the Muslim Brotherhood is led by National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The source was personally in agreement with Flynn. ‘‘In Congress, a bill to add the Muslim Brotherhood to the official terrorist list was introduced this month by Senator TEDCRUZand Representative MARIO DIAZBALART of Florida. Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson denounced the Muslim Brotherhood as an ‘agent of radical Islam’ during his confirmation hearings, but he has not made public statements regarding adding them to the foreign terrorist organization list. However, other Trump advisers, and members of the intelligence and law enforcement communities, argue the Brotherhood has ‘evolved peacefully in some countries,’ Reuters claims. ‘‘They also expressed the pragmatic concern that going hard on the Muslim Brotherhood could complicate diplomatic relations with nations such as Turkey. It would unquestionably, however, please such U.S. allies as Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, although there have been signs the Saudis might be softening on the Brotherhood as they search for allies against ISIS in Iran. ‘‘One official familiar with the State Department’s deliberations conceded that the Muslim Brotherhood’s ideology has influenced such terrorist groups as Hamas, but since it is a large, loose organization spread over several nations, it could be legally difficult to apply the terrorist designation. Allied nations such as Britain have also expressed suspicions about the Brotherhood’s influence, while stopping short of a formal terrorist designation.’’ So this is important to note. It is a good article. But I can’t help but wonder if the Council on AmericanIslamic Relations, or CAIR, may be getting quite concerned about the potential for designating their friends in the Muslim Brotherhood. There may be a mutual relationship there. There may be people that are part of both groups. No doubt, CAIR is getting quite concerned about heightened talk about naming the Muslim Brotherhood as the terrorist organization they are. It is just that they don’t use terrorist tactics, as some of them have indicated before, when they are making great progress without terrorism, but knowing that eventually, after they get as far as they can with peaceful methods, they will ultimately be resorting to terrorism to bring the United States and other Western civilizations, countries into the international caliphate, wherein we are ruled by a caliph. So it is interesting times. Here, tonight, in perhaps an hour and a half or so, our new President will name the nominee to fill the Honorable Antonin Scalia’s spot on the Supreme Court. He is still greatly missed. He was a great man. He was a great jurist. He was a great patriot and he was great for America and our freedoms. So we will look forward to hearing that. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SANFORD ). 
Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for the way that, on a nightly basis, he comes down to the well and helps inform people. Jefferson, in the writings of our Founding Fathers, talked about how important it was to have an informed electorate. I just really appreciate the way the gentleman gives people clarity and information that they can then digest and make their decisions with. That process of informing is, I think, a vital part of the politic. He does it on the daily basis, and I appreciate it. His doing so matters to me and to the people that I represent. I appreciate so much the gentleman’s yielding because I want to talk just a couple of minutes about a bill that I introduced today entitled the REAL ID Privacy Protection Act. It is a bipartisan bill. It is supported from the Republican side by people like MARKMEADOWS . It is supported on the Democratic side by Democrats like CHELLIE PINGREE from Maine. I think they do so because it is a commonsense bill that gets at some of the deficiencies that one can find in REAL ID. Quite specifically, what it does is eliminate the requirement that your personal documentation and documents be held and archived, in essence, 
in warehouses for 10 years. It will not require your stuff to be out in government databases for 10 years. Secondly, it eliminates the requirement that the DMV databases be colinked. Thirdly, it creates uniformity with regard to the way in which extensions are granted. So the bottom line is your driver’s license could still be used to get you in the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort or it could be used to go into Joint Base Charleston or a whole host of other facilities around this country. More significantly, for the average flying public, you could still use your driver’s license next year to be able to get on a plane in the United States of America. Why is all this important? It is important because individual privacy matters. It is important because equal treatment under the law matters. It is important because the 10th Amendment really matters. States have a role in which the Founding Fathers intended the Federal Government to fit with the State government, to fit with local government, and to fit with individual prerogative. Now let’s examine each one of those couple of things. One, if you look at South Carolina driver’s licenses, just as an example, they are secure. We have holograms. We have barcodes. We have a whole host of different things that create security. Yet, in the wake of 9/11, what the Federal Government, Homeland Security, and others decided at that time was that, in essence, what they wanted was a de facto national ID card and for the Federal Government to, in essence, federalize what had previously been a State function, with State’s issuing driver’s licenses. There is not a Federal driver’s license. Texas has driver’s licenses, South Carolina has driver’s licenses, Florida has driver’s licenses. Each State may have a little bit different way of doing so, but it was a state prerogative. In the wake of that Federal requirement—I was wearing a different hat at the time; I was wearing a Governor’s hat—I joined with, for instance, Governor Schweitzer from Montana in saying: Wait, this doesn’t make sense. The States still have a vital role here. This role does not need to be federalized. We pushed back and, long story short, we were successful with many others in that effort. Yet, what is happening is many of those deadline requirements are now reemerging and approaching. The question we have to ask ourselves in Congress is: What are we going to do about it? Are we going to push back again? Or are we going to try and slow this again? Or are we just going to let the Federal Government come in and steamroll what has been a State function? I think it is important that we act, and that is why we introduced this bill. It, again, gets at three important things. One, privacy matters. Quite simply, if government doesn’t need your stuff, they don’t get your stuff. I think that is a simple premise. Again, let me say it again. If government really doesn’t need your stuff, it shouldn’t get your stuff. What do I mean by that? What I mean is, if the requirement, as is now the case, is that the Federal Government take your personal information and they archive it for the next 10 years, do you really feel that you are more secure? I would argue that is not at all the case. I would argue that it is much better to have a system that, when you take your birth certificate, you take your marriage license, you take your divorce papers, you take your citizenship papers, whatever it is that you have, take it all, let folks at the government level decide whether you are who you are or whether you are not who you are, and then give your stuff back to you. They don’t need to house it for the next 10 years. That is all this bill does. If you house it for the next 10 years, in fact, there is a considerable cost. The unfunded mandate to States is $17 billion. So what we are saying is make the determination. Take, again, all your stuff, look at it, but then give it back, rather than requiring States to archive this stuff for the next 10 years. It also matters because, again, of individual human privacy. Whether it is a divorce decree, whether it is a marriage license, whether it is citizenship papers, whatever it is, we have been in hearings over the last couple of weeks where it was proven that the Russians were quite involved in hacking of American databases. Why do we want to open that up to Chinese hackers, Russian hackers, to whoever it is, if it isn’t required and necessary from the standpoint of security? Two, this bill simply gets at the notion that States matter. The 10th Amendment matters. Patton was once attributed with saying that, if you tell a soldier to take a hill, tell them to take the hill. Don’t tell them how to attack the hill. The same is true of the Federal Government as it relates to States. Give us a secured requirement, but then allow Texas to go about their way of taking the hill and South Carolina to come with its way of attacking the hill, as long as we take the hill, which is the necessary security requirement. I think it is also important from the standpoint of security that one thing we have learned over time is that centralization of data does not make data more secure. We have a host of different breaches that have occurred at the Federal level that prove this point. I think that one of the things that is interesting about Pearl Harbor is that the boats were in one spot and it was onestop shopping for the Japanese. So, in fact, what we have seen in terms of military strategy going forward is people spread assets out. They don’t want them congregated all in one spot so that an attacker would be able to take down a multitude of different assets with one particular raid. I think the same is true in the information age, as it relates to databases. Finally, this bill is about equal treatment under the law. I think that what many States—South Carolina would be among them—are concerned about is: Is this too subjective? If you happen to be a blue State versus a red State, does that have some degree of determination in the way in which you get an extension or you don’t get an extension? b1830 Eighteen States and territories have been granted extensions. Seven States have been granted very limited extensions. All this bill does is say, Let’s make that process transparent so that States can look one to the other and say, How was it that you got an extension but I didn’t? I think that that level of uniformity would make sure that nobody suspects this system of being arbitrary or capricious by nature. That is in simple form what the bill does. Again, it is about your privacy. We have had a long debate over the course of our country on security versus freedom, and what we don’t want to do is give up certain, in essence, soul conditions, if you will, for freedom, including this notion of federalism, in our efforts to be secure. It is about recognizing that States are not wards of the Federal government, that a $7 billion unfunded liability really does matter to the taxpayers of different States. Finally, it is about equal treatment under the law. Again, the bill is called the REAL ID Privacy Protection Act. I would ask Members to join us on that bill. I would ask folks out there listening to talk to their House Member about that bill because I think it is one that makes a whole lot of sense. I would say, again, how much I appreciate the gentleman from Texas yielding. Most of all, I thank him for the way he comes down to the well on such a regular basis to inform the American public. Mr. GOHMERT. I thank the gentleman from South Carolina not merely for the bill, but this gentleman’s bills, just like the reasoned argument made here in this Chamber, well reasoned, well thought out. Having sat and listened to so many lawyers during my years on the bench, both trial bench and appellate bench, I would have welcomed the opportunity to hear from my friend from South Carolina in any courtroom where I was sitting. Well reasoned, a lot of good research in trying to solve problems. I look forward to a lot of us reading that bill and finding out because there is no doubt it involved just as good reasons as were used in your argument here today. Also, we heard from another colleague of ours, the Honorable DON YOUNG from Alaska. I am actually optimistic about so many things with this 
President in the Oval Office now, and one of them is that our friend, DON YOUNG from Alaska, may finally get some help. President Carter had identified an area that really didn’t have any wildlife to speak of. Yes, it was part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but it was an area that really didn’t have wildlife to speak of. As I understand it, there are some caribou that may walk across there from time to time, but they can’t stay because there is not enough to sustain them. But President Carter, as anticarbon energy as he was, realized that is an area that we can agree ought to be drilled for the production of oil and gas, and it has been fought over and over. Who stands to gain? Well, actually, the American public. But since so much oil has now been found out in my friend MIKECONAWAY ’s district in west Texas, up in the Dakotas, we are not as needful of that as we were. But the people who will really benefit are the people of Alaska, and then additional beneficiaries will be the people of the United States and the people who want to get out from under the iron fist of Russia rising. We will be able to help them with that by not only becoming energy independent; but after energy independent, exporting oil and gas to other nations so they don’t feel the pinch that nations like China and Russia are putting on them. I thank my friend, Mr. YOUNG from Alaska, and my friend, the former Governor of South Carolina, Mr. SANFORD . Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
PEOPLE ARE WORRIED The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today is Tuesday, January 31. It has been 11 days since the inauguration of our new President; and, oh my goodness, has it been an extraordinary 11 days. I just hardly know where to begin. Normally I come up here, and we talk about how we can grow the American economy, how we can provide jobs, how we can see a return of our manufacturing industries, but I am compelled today to pick up comments on the last 11 days. I was at a dinner out in California on Friday evening, and a wide variety of people from multiple interest groups were there: some labor unions, some farmers, senior citizens, healthcare folks, teachers. There was an overwhelming sense of concern—deep concern—about the direction this country is going. Some of these friends of mine were Republicans and others were Democrats; some liberal, some conservative. But to a person, they came up to me and said: Oh, my God, what is happening in Washington? Where is this going? What is he doing? What does it mean to us? And some of them said: Will they really actually terminate the Affordable Care Act? Is ObamaCare really going to end? What about my insurance policy; will I lose it? I am on MediCal. What will happen to me? And teachers saying: How does this fit with the effort to improve our schools? And some that had been in the military looked at some of what was going on and said: But veterans’ care, this hiring freeze affects the Department of Veterans Affairs. What does it mean to me? What is happening in Washington? Some others were concerned about, well, there is going to be this transportation bill, infrastructure bill. How are they going to fund it? Is it really going to happen? I have been to many events in my years in public office, but I have never been to an event in which there was this overwhelming concern about what’s going to happen in Washington. I have seen changes occur. Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan, there was concern, but not the kind of angst, deep emotional concern about where this country is going. I have seen George H.W. Bush to Bill Clinton, and I am sure there were many Republicans concerned about where Bill Clinton would go, and then Clinton to George W. Bush, and then to Obama, but nothing like this. It is not just last Friday night. Today, in front of my office in Davis, California, 200 people showed up to say: You have got to do something. You have got to make it clear that we can’t have these shutting down our borders. You can’t let them do that. Davis, California, the University of California, there are 5,000 foreign students and teachers on that campus. There are more than 200 from the countries that are affected by the immigration and by the ban on people coming in from those seven countries. What does it mean, they asked me? And what about the Affordable Care Act? All across this Nation people are demonstrating. It is now 20 minutes to 7 here in Washington, D.C., and I suppose at 8 tonight the President is supposed to give a nationwide address on his next Supreme Court nominee. I am quite certain that tomorrow morning there will be another eruption of concern by Americans as to what does it mean if the Supreme Court throws out the role of the Federal Government in protecting voter rights? What does it mean if the Federal Government isn’t there to assure that a woman’s body is her own? All across this Nation people are going: Oh, what is happening? Executive order after executive order, starting with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and instructions to every agency of the Federal Government to stop it, see that it doesn’t work. And here in Congress, a budget resolution that calls for the elimination of the financial support for the Affordable Care Act which, if you remove the money, what happens to the subsidies, the tax subsidies that people are able to use to be able to afford healthcare insurance, the additional money that goes to the States for their Medicaid programs? And, oh, what about the seniors? If that budget resolution actually goes through, the money that is in the Affordable Care Act to provide the seniors the opportunity to have their drug benefit costs reduced, affecting millions of American seniors, the money is gone. Will the drug benefit be gone also? Most assuredly it would unless, of course, you want to just increase the deficit. And about that free annual visit that is available to seniors that has clearly extended the life of thousands or tens of thousands of seniors because they find out they have high blood pressure. They can take a cheap pill, get that blood pressure down and not have a stroke. Or maybe diabetes, the onset of diabetes. That free annual benefit checkup, will it still be available if the budget resolution and if Mr. Trump’s attack on the Affordable Care Act actually happens? People are worried. People are frightened. And they should be. They should be. Because this goes to the very ability of Americans to carry on their tasks, protections that are necessary to protect Americans from fraud. The House of Representatives today voted to pass a rule that would lead to the elimination of protections that Americans have in their financial services. I don’t know how we repeal the Affordable Care Act. And how are we going to protect America by building a wall? What is it going to cost? 15, 20, 30 billion dollars? Most people who look at the immigration issue rationally would say it is not going to solve the problem. And besides that, the problem is dramatically reduced as a result of the Mexican economy growing and jobs being available there as a result of the enormous buildup that has already occurred with the Border Patrol and the immigration service. We have seen a dramatic reduction. I was told today by some people that work in this field in California that the people who are coming into the United States illegally are mothers and children from Central America who are seeking refuge from the horrible gangs and violence in Central America. They are not sneaking over the border. They are presenting themselves at the border as refugees. We will come back to the refugee issue in a few moments. b1845 How proud he looks, signing yet another executive order, this one on a wall. We are going to build a wall, 1,400 miles of wall between the United States and Mexico. So with a look of pride, he wants to spend anywhere 
from $15 billion to $30 billion. So tell me what you could do with $15 billion. That is the minimum cost of the wall. Most people say it is probably closer to $30 billion. What could you do with $15 billion? Well, I suppose you can build part of a wall, or you could start to build a wall. You are certainly not going to finish it. But let’s just say you have got $15 billion and that is your down payment on a wall that most everybody says wouldn’t work. That is not a joke. If you build a 50foothigh wall, someone will get a 51foottall ladder. I am familiar with the universities in California. California State University has 460,000 students. So for $15 billion, you could fund the entire California State University system, provide tuitionfree education for 3 years for 460,000 students, and pay all the faculty and the janitors and all the others. That is for $15 billion. Now, if it is a $30 billion wall, then it is 6 years. So a junior in high school, for $30 billion, could go free, tuition free, all expenses paid. Every professor, every janitor, fully paid for 6 years— 460,000 students and thousands upon thousands of professors, teachers, janitors, et cetera. Or you could replace every pipe in Flint, Michigan, 270 times over. Do you want to solve the problem in Flint, Michigan, the lead pipe problem? 270 times for $15 billion, or that is more than 500 times, 540 times. Or maybe you are concerned about Alzheimer’s. And what American family is not concerned about Alzheimer’s? If we were to spend that $15 billion on research, we would undoubtedly be able to develop a treatment—and this is what the scientists and doctors and researchers say. And we did increase the funding from around $500 million to just under $1 billion last year. But if you were able to ramp it up and develop that treatment for Alzheimer’s, you could delay the onset of Alzheimer’s in your family, or mine, by 5 years. And what does that mean? It means about a $220 billion in savings to the American taxpayers because that is money that will be spent for Medicare and Medicaid. Or maybe you are just interested in national defense. Do you like submarines, the new Virginia class submarine? Well, let’s see. We could build five of them. Or maybe you like aircraft carriers. For $15 billion, you could build one of the new aircraft carriers and an additional submarine. So President Trump, what is our choice? You don’t like these choices, and you want to build a wall that nobody believes will do much good dealing with illegal immigration? Oh, I like this next one; 27,777 4year, fullride scholarships for an undergraduate program at the University of California. That is about the total undergraduate population at the University of California, Davis, which I have the honor of representing. But we are going to build a wall. We are going to build a wall. For what purpose? 435 of us here and 100 Senators and one President have a task of making choices about what America is all about, choices about how we spend your tax money. You want your tax money spent on a wall? Oh, excuse me. Mexico is going to pay for it. Do you think so? The President has started a trade war with Mexico, has created a serious diplomatic crisis with our neighbor and our third largest trading partner, over trying to force Mexico to pay for his wall. Oh, that was really smart. But, hey, he’s the President and he thinks he can do what he wants to do. Well, the Mexican President said, no, no, it is not going to be paid for by Mexico. So who is going to pay for it? I say we have choices. I would much rather us spend our money on education, national defense, Alzheimer’s, and on things that actually help Americans in so many different ways. That is just one of the issues that is in play. Immigration? Oh, we put out a new executive order on immigration, and seven countries around the world cannot have their citizens any longer come to America for some period of time, and refugees from those countries can’t come to America. What are those countries? Well, let me see. Among the seven, I believe there is this country called Iraq. Excuse me, Mr. Trump. Isn’t Iraq our ally in fighting ISIS? I think so. It is their troops plus 6,000 of our troops that are now engaged in a bitter fight to reclaim Mosul, to wipe ISIS out of Mosul. And so you are going to put a limitation on Iraqi citizens and refugees coming to the United States? I am sorry. I don’t understand what sense that makes, Mr. President. Do you? Do you understand what you just did? There is a fourstar general in Iraq who is responsible for their Special Forces that are leading the fight in Mosul right now. This man’s family came to the United States for safety because of the problems that existed there in Iraq. He cannot visit his family. Unless there is some sort of a waiver that has suddenly been developed for fourstar Iraqi generals, he cannot go to Central Command in Tampa, Florida, to work on a strategy for the rest of the fight. Oh, my God. What is going on here? What is happening? What sense does any of this make? Foreign policy experts, national security experts, experts on ISIS, on radical Islam all say the same thing. The ban on people traveling from those seven majority Muslim states will have a negative effect on our ability to deal with ISIS. That is what they say. Not my view, that is the view of security experts all across the spectrum, from the most conservative to the most progressive and liberal and everybody in between. This makes no sense whatsoever, Mr. President. We sometimes use the word ‘‘half baked.’’ This is not even beginning the process of being baked. This was put together by somebody that didn’t know what they were doing. If they had consulted with policy experts outside of that little cabal in the White House, somebody might have said: Time out, time out, time out. Let’s think this through. Why Iraq? What is going to be the second step here? Easy enough, we are going to set the ban. But what does it mean? What does it mean to Muslim countries around the world that suddenly America is seen as shutting the door—or, shall we say, slamming the door—on Muslims? What does it mean here in the United States? It means that we are not safer. It means that our country is not protected, and, in fact, the action taken is counterproductive. That is what it means. Who did this? Who is the architect of this policy? Was it the State Department? Apparently not. Was it the Justice Department? We know from the midnight firing—well, I guess it was actually 6 o’clock firing—yesterday of the acting Attorney General that it wasn’t the Justice Department. They had an opportunity to review and look at the legality of the ban. They didn’t involve themselves, and apparently the military didn’t involve themselves. So who was it that dreamed up this ban on men, women, children, refugees coming from seven countries? None of the residents and refugees from those countries in the last 40 years has been responsible for one terrorist death in the United States. But those countries from which we know the terrorists came, from 9/11, were not included. Saudi Arabia, not included in the ban. How is that, if we are worried about this problem of refugees who are citizens from those countries coming into the United States to carry out terrorist acts? Why didn’t you look at Saudi Arabia? That is where most of the 9/11 folks came from. Or maybe Chechnya or Congo or Nigeria. So who wrote it? Who is responsible? Well, two names have emerged. One, a Mr. Miller, and another, a Mr. Bannon, a Mr. Bannon who is the architect of the emergence of the altright. We are not talking about the conservative right. We are talking about the far right White nationalist movement in this Nation. Mr. Bannon, who became Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, who is now the key person in the White House, not just on political policy, but on national security policy. He is said to have said, in 2013, that he is a Leninist and his goal is to blow up the system. He says he doesn’t remember having said that. Well, I will take him at his word. But I do know that what he did with this ban for these seven countries is to make our Nation less safe. That, we know. And just to double down on this issue of this superconservative fellow Mr. Bannon and his cohort Mr. Miller, just to make clear where we are headed, there has been a reorganization of the 
National Security Council. These are the men and women that, over the years, have been responsible for making certain that our American policy maximizes our security that deals with international issues of great concern: what to do about China in the South China Sea, what to do about North Korea. How do we handle missile defense? How do we deal with Russia in the Ukraine? The National Security Council. So what happened yesterday? Well, the President, which he has a right to do, reorganized the National Security Council. And two gentlemen, or two people, that have traditionally been on the National Security Council, who seem to know a little bit about national security, were previously in what is called the principles. These are the handful of people that meet with the President, the key national security leaders. b1900 The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is one of them and the Director of the National Intelligence organization—the two of them. The President says: I don’t need you in my little inner circle. Go away. You can be part of the larger thing, and when I want you, I will call you. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the person responsible for the collection of our national intelligence—push him aside. Who came in to take the place of the two people—the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence? Guess who? Mr. Bannon. Is he a national security expert? He spent a few years in the military decades ago, but now he is sitting as one of the principals on our National Security Council. What is his mindset? Read his history. I wouldn’t recommend you go to Breitbart—I wouldn’t spend a whole lot of time on that—but there is a history here. There is a history, and it is a dangerous history. This man is now sitting as the principal voice, because he has the President’s ear, on the National Security Council—the fellow, together with Mr. Miller, who is responsible for the ban on immigrants, travelers, and refugees from seven countries, which has become a major international, diplomatic crisis. ISIS is already using that ban— it is right here in the newspaper—to recruit in the Middle East, to recruit in Africa, and to encourage homegrown violence and terrorism here in the United States. Well done, Mr. Miller. Well done, Mr. Bannon. And very bad for our country. We are in the midst of executive orders, one after another—often two a day. My final concern is one that comes up 25 days from now. Five days ago, Trump went over to the Pentagon and signed yet another executive order. He came out of the meeting and said: We are going to have a new war plan. We are going to wipe ISIS from the face of the Earth, and the Pentagon will deliver to me in 30 days a war plan to wipe ISIS off the face of the Earth. Action. Action. Action. Go with care. Be slow to war. We will see what that plan is. My guess is it will cost millions upon millions—if not billions—of dollars. It will put our troops—boots—back on the ground in Iraq and Syria, and we will start the cycle one more time. We will see. We will see what the Pentagon comes up with in a war plan. We have not been told the specific instructions that the Commander in Chief has given to the Pentagon; but I will tell you that this member of the House Armed Services Committee is very concerned. Keep in mind that our effort against ISIS and al Qaeda is based on a 2001 authorization to use military force in Afghanistan against al Qaeda and related entities. It has been stretched. One of the things that I am quite concerned about coming out of the Obama administration is that that administration stretched the 2001—a 16 yearold—authorization to use force—a declaration of war against al Qaeda—to justify the American military actions in Iraq, Syria, Liberia, Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. We will see what the war plan is—we will learn soon enough—and I suspect that this Congress will be asked to finance it. We will be asked to pay for the men and women who will be sent into harm’s way and for the munitions and the airplanes and the other equipment necessary. I would hope that all of us take a long, long look at this and that we ask this question: If we do that, then what happens next? We didn’t ask that question when we went to war in Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002. We didn’t ask that question when we invaded Iraq a couple of years later. I am not sure we have asked that question as we reengage ourselves in the current Iraqi war and Syria; but we should always ask: What is the result of our action? What is likely to happen? We have choices. We have choices to build a wall or to educate our children or to care for our seniors. We have choices about war or not. We have choices about how we deal with people around this world, choices about what we do with refugees—people who are fleeing persecution, fleeing death—who are doing the very, very best they can to care for their families and children in the most desperate of situations. We have a choice. We can slam the door on them and say ‘‘tough luck,’’ or we can do what ought to be the American tradition, and that is to provide comfort, to provide assistance, and to show the good part of America. Mr. President, you have given us 10 days of the most disruptive chaos I have ever seen in my many years in public life. You have a choice, too, Mr. President. You have a choice to take a deep breath, to not try to carry out every one of your campaign promises, most of which I think were illfounded. You don’t have to do it on day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. You can take a deep breath, and you can think, together with Mr. Bannon or with Mr. Miller or with, perhaps, somebody outside of your little inner circle. Mr. President, you might ask other people what is the effect of what you are doing. Think about the second level of effect, and slow it down, and be aware that there are consequences. For every action, there is going to be another reaction. We are already seeing that. I am sure you have seen the millions of Americans in the streets protesting about which you have thus far done. Continue on, and you will see more because Americans are concerned. They are frightened. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. TAYLOR ). Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. For what purpose does the gentleman from California seek recognition? Mr. GARAMENDI. I know the courtesy of this House, Mr. Speaker, and we are not supposed to direct our remarks everywhere; so let me amend my remarks. Mr. Speaker, there are within the White House two individuals who I believe are responsible. So, Mr. Speaker—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend. The gentleman is not recognized for debate. 
FOR THE 115TH CONGRESS  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS  Washington, DC, January 31, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR.

Neither the full Committee Chairman or subcommittee chairman shall limit the number of television or still cameras to fewer than two representatives from each medium (except for legitimate space or safety, in which case pool coverage shall be authorized). To the maximum practicable, the Committee shall provide audio and video coverage of each hearing or meeting for the transaction of business in a manner that allows the public to easily listen to and view the proceedings and shall maintain the recordings of such coverage in a manner that is easily accessible to the public. (f) Subcommittee Meetings—No subcommittee shall sit while the House is reading an appropriation measure for amendment under the fiveminute rule or while the Committee is in session.

HEARING PROCEDURES  (a) The Chair, in the case of hearings to be conducted by the Committee shall make public announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted on any measure or matter at least one (1) week before the commencement of that hearing.

The questioning of a witness in Committee hearings shall be initiated by the Chair, followed by the ranking minority member and all other members alternating between the majority and minority. In recognizing members to question witnesses in this fashion, the Chair shall take into consideration the ratio of the majority to minority members present and shall establish the order of recognition for questioning in such a manner as not to disadvantage the members of the majority.

PRAYER The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today’s opening prayer will be offered by Rabbi Barry Block, leader of the Congregation B’nai Israel in Little Rock, AR. The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer: Divine Source of Blessing, we come before You today to ask Your blessings on the United States Senate and on the 100 men and women who serve our Nation here. Like King Solomon before them, let these Senators lead our Nation with wisdom, with Your Word and our Nation’s Constitution constantly guiding them to pursue liberty and justice, opportunity and equality, for every man, woman, and child within our borders, for those who would peacefully seek refuge on our shores, and for each of Your children on Earth. Make them ever mindful of Your command to remember the heart of the stranger— the people most unlike them and the least powerful of voices—for we were all strangers in one Egypt or another. In this age of division, unite these Senators, for only when working together across party lines do they truly represent all Americans. Temper the majority’s resolve with humility. Let the minority manifest an opposition that is as loyal as it is robust. Let all come together to ask Your choicest blessings on the United States of America. And let us say, Amen.
