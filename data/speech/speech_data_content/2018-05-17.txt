Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize recently named Macomb County Volunteer of the Year, eighthgrader Dylan Rheker. Dylan, age 14, volunteers at the Village of East Harbor senior living facility, at Francis A. Higgins Elementary School, at the Anna Mae Burdi Early Childhood Center, as well as Selfridge Air National Guard Base and the Roseville Community Schools. However, what is also impressive, in addition to Dylan’s giving spirit, is his perseverance. You see, Dylan was born with neurofibromatosis, a condition which causes tumors to form in his brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Dylan was also diagnosed with cancer and has been undergoing chemotherapy for the past 4 years. None of this deters the straightA student as he helps people across the 10th Congressional District. In fact, Dylan recently set a school volunteer hour record, with 236 hours of volunteer service last year. When asked about his volunteerism, Dylan responds that he is ‘‘happy to help’’ and ‘‘always here if someone needs help.’’ Dylan is an outstanding young man, and I am extremely proud of all the work he does in our district to make the community a better place to live and work. I wish him the best of luck in the future, and I hope all of you will as well. RECOGNIZING CARLA VILLALVAZO AS WINNER OF  
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Carla Villalvazo, a high school student from Eisenhower High School in Shelby Township, Michigan. Carla is the winner of the 2018 Congressional Art Competition for my district. Her artwork titled ‘‘Forget Me Not’’ is a watercolor painting which will hang in the Cannon tunnel of the Capitol for the next year. Importantly, it is not only wonderful artwork, it talks about the struggle the family has with a family member with Alzheimer’s. It is great artwork, but it also touches my heart and, I think, many others. I also recognize secondplace finisher Stefanie Frontera, also from Eisenhower High School, and thirdplace finisher Christina Berels from Cardinal Mooney High School. These students all submitted wonderful pieces of art. The second and thirdplace winners will hang in my office. I thank them all for their submission. f 
UNDERMINING OF OUR DEMOCRACY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. SUOZZI ) for 5 minutes. Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, Russia has been working to undermine our democracy, as well as democracies throughout Europe, including Central and Eastern Europe. Unfortunately, too many Americans and elected officials have been distracted from Russia’s secret operations because of the pitched, partisan battle regarding Putin’s involvement in the 2016 Presidential race. The bottom line is this: Democrats and Republicans can’t lose focus on Russia’s worldwide treachery due to our hyperpartisanship here at home. Instead, Democrats and Republicans in Congress must work together to expose Russia’s worldwide plan to subvert democracy. We must face the reality that Russia is a strategic competitor of the United States that is using nontraditional, nonmilitary weapons in a hybrid warfare to undermine democracies in countries that are ill equipped to combat their malign efforts. Instead of focusing on Russia’s activities during the 2016 election, I have introduced a bipartisan bill, the Russia AntiCorruption Act, with 13 Republicans and 10 Democratic cosponsors, to expose and thwart Putin and his cronies’ illicit activities in Eastern Europe and Europe as a whole. Whether bribing politicians, cyber attacks, manipulating social media networks, buying media outlets to promote propaganda, or purchasing power plants to control energy supplies to gain leverage over unstable governments, we must define, document, and 
disrupt the corruption flowing from Moscow, which imperils the democratic foundations of our U.S. allies. Our legislation would establish within the State Department an office of anticorruption relating to illicit Russian financial activities in Europe which would analyze Russia’s financial meddling in strategic European sectors, including real estate, energy, media, and infrastructure. The office will collaborate with the Treasury Department to train U.S. diplomats to work with foreign partners to uncover and prosecute illegal Russian financial activity. This office will also work with our NATO allies to elevate anticorruption operations as part of NATO’s readiness action plan. Oligarchs connected to Vladimir Putin are malevolent allies in the Russian President’s hybrid warfare scheme. They flood Europe with dirty money, bribing politicians and purchasing key assets to subvert democracy. The Panama Papers found a trail of $2 billion that leads back to the Russian President. Such money has gone to support fringe political parties in France, Germany, Austria, and elsewhere. Wellfunded Russian media outlets also play a key role in this hybrid warfare. They spread lies and weaken faith in European governments. Our allies in Central and Eastern Europe have accused Russia of a campaign of bribery meant to undermine the transatlantic alliance. All of this, of course, complements Russia’s more overt tactics, from its military aggression in the Ukraine to its campaign of assassinations on European soil. As Putin and his cronies work to discredit open societies, the dark and dangerous sphere of Moscow’s influence grows and grows and grows. That is how democracies can die. Mr. Speaker, this is not about President Trump, and it is not about Democrats versus Republicans. Members of Congress must work together to find solutions to the very serious threats posed by Russia the world over. I now yield to my friend and colleague, Mr. FRENCH HILL, the original cosponsor of the Russia AntiCorruption Act and a real leader on this critical issue. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York for yielding and compliment him for his leadership on this topic. Just like rebuilding our transatlantic relationship on NATO and our partners for military work and just like our work in exporting energy now, natural gas and oil, to Europe to offset the Russian dominance, this work, this political work, is essential. I thank my friend from New York, and I was proud to be an original cosponsor on this legislation. I want to tell you, on a recent visit in the last few months I had to Krakow, Poland, I was with the Kosciuszko Institute there in Krakow, which has studied Russian cyber attacks throughout Central Europe extensively. They were telling all of us that they are the front line of propaganda, cyber attack, testing and training for what we have seen in the United States and around the world. The institute cited Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, the Ukraine in 2011, and the 2013 Energetic Bear attack as wellknown public examples of how Russia is using Central Europe to perfect their strategies before deploying to other Western countries, including what we witnessed here in the United States. By the Congress addressing and passing Mr. SUOZZI ’s bill, we can help Europeans on the front lines of the fight against the Russian corruption, propaganda, and cyber intrusion machine. I thank my friend for the time he so generously gave to me. 
HONORING LIEUTENANT AARON CROOK OF THE BLUEFIELD POLICE DEPARTMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. JENKINS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, as our Nation honors National Police Week, I rise today to remember a fallen officer, Lieutenant Aaron Crook of the Bluefield Police Department. This week, the name of Officer Crook, along with 359 of his fallen brothers and sisters in blue, will be added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington. As our Nation honors our police officers for their sacrifices, we give thanks to the life of Officer Crook, whom we sadly lost last May. Lieutenant Crook was born in Summers County, graduated from Bluefield State College, and proudly served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve for 6 years. After serving his Nation, he exchanged his Marine uniform for that of the Bluefield Police Department in 2008. Lieutenant Crook was an outstanding police officer and devoted family man. He loved the outdoors and would never pass up an opportunity to go fishing. In fact, the city of Bluefield is planning to rename a lake in his honor so his legacy can carry on through one of his favorite pastimes. His memory is kept alive by his wife, Whitney; his kids, Brycen and Paislee; his extended family; the Bluefield Police Department; and so many others. He will never be forgotten. Our State and country lost a good man, and Officer Crook is missed each and every day. May he rest in peace. 
MEMORIALIZING OFFICERS LOST IN THE LINE OF DUTY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to speak on the House floor today in recognition of National Police Week and to memorialize the officers lost in the line of duty. For me and for the communities that I represent, it is personal. Just 2 years ago, Officers Lesley Zerebny and Gil Vega from the Palm Springs Police Department were shot and killed in the line of duty, responding to what appeared to be a routine domestic disturbance. In the wake of this tragedy, our communities came together to remember Officers Zerebny and Vega and to do more for the entire law enforcement community. Over the past year, I have worked with law enforcement, firefighters, and other local and national public safety officer leaders to draft the Heroes Lesley Zerebny and Gil Vega First Responder Survivors Support Act, legislation that honors those who have passed by serving the living. We developed this bill with one central idea in mind: that those who risk their lives for our community deserve the peace of mind to know that if something happened to them their family would be okay—that they would be able to pay off their debt, put their kids through college, and have a fair shot of making it in the world. So we did the math, looking at the existing Public Safety Officer Benefit Program to see if it achieved these principles, and we found that families of fallen first responders, those who gave their all to protect us, are being shortchanged and don’t even have enough to pay off their debt and pay for the rising cost of an education. Families of fallen public safety officers are still struggling. My bipartisan bill will correct this and provide needed relief for those who sacrifice so much. It will increase the Public Safety Officer Benefit from $350,000 to $500,000 in order to pay off the calculated national average debt most families have. It will increase the monthly education benefit from $1,024 per month to $2,000 per month to ensure they can afford the actual rising cost of an education. And it will fix a bureaucratic loophole that costs families tens of thousands of dollars for no fault of their own. Right now, our men and women who risk their lives in order to save our lives are being shortchanged. I urge all Members of Congress to do the right thing, to follow words with action and actually do something pragmatic that will improve the lives of fallen first responders’ families. I hope that all Members will cosponsor and support my bipartisan Heroes Lesley Zerebny and Gil Vega First Responder Survivors Support Act, and I urge the Speaker to bring it up for a vote immediately. Let’s support this bill and stand up for these families that have sacrificed so much for us. b1015 HONORING CHRISTOPHER ’S CLUBHOUSE  
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to honor an incredible organization in my 
district that, for more than a decade, has served the community by providing information and resources to help children, the elderly, and vulnerable individuals protect themselves from violent crimes. Christopher’s Clubhouse was started in 1996 after Mika Moulton’s son, Christopher, was kidnapped and murdered at 10 years old. The family made the brave and selfless choice to turn their grief into something positive. They realized that, while they had done everything right like telling Christopher not to talk to strangers, no one had told them that there was more that they could have done. They realized that they had not taught him what to do if someone had grabbed Christopher. They didn’t want any parent to face that same realization and that same grief, so they started Christopher’s Clubhouse to provide safety skills and personal defense techniques for children, teens, and the elderly throughout the Coachella Valley. Over the years, Christopher’s Clubhouse has served more than 100,000 people through their programs in schools, community events, and churches. There is no doubt that they have made a difference and saved lives, preventing other parents from going through their pain. I thank them and I applaud them for their years of service. While Christopher’s Clubhouse may be closing, the legacy of their work will be felt for generations. 
HONORING THE MEMORY AND SACRIFICE OF NEW YORK CITY POLICE OFFICERS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. DONOVAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory and sacrifice of New York police officers killed in the line of duty. Every day, women and men don blue uniforms and head out to the streets, unsure of what danger they may encounter. They protect my family and the 8 million people who live in New York City. I thank them for risking everything to keep us safe. The following men and women, New York’s finest, have met their end of watch while carrying out their duties since I came to office in Congress in May of 2015. I would like to honor them by reading their names here in the House Chamber: Lieutenant Jeffrey Francis, 9/11related illness Detective Miosotis Familia, gunfire Officer Michael Hance, 9/11related illness Sergeant Terrence Scott O’Hara, 9/11 related illness Deputy Chief James Molloy, 9/11related illness Detective Steven McDonald, gunfire Detective Stephen Kubinski, 9/11related illness Sergeant Paul Tuozzolo, gunfire Assistant Chief Michael Quinn, 9/11 related illness Detective Michael Glazer, 9/11related illness Lieutenant Kenneth Rosello, 9/11related illness Officer Kenneth Wolf, 9/11related illness Officer Deborah GarbuttJeff, 9/11related illness Detective Andrew Siroka, 9/11related illness Officer Juan Feliciano, heart attack Sergeant Donald Scott Conniff, vehicular assault Sergeant Michael Galvin, 9/11related illness Sergeant Wayne Jackson, 9/11related illness Lieutenant Marci Simms, 9/11related illness Officer Charles Karen, 9/11related illness Sergeant Louis Pioli, 9/11related illness Detective Randolph Holder, gunfire Sergeant Gerard Beyrodt, 9/11related illness Detective Ronald Richards, 9/11related illness Sergeant Edmund Murray, 9/11related illness Lieutenant Rebecca Buck, 9/11related illness Officer Alexander Figueroa, 9/11related illness Lieutenant Luis Lopez, 9/11related illness Officer Matthew Gay, 9/11related illness Officer James Betso, 9/11related illness Detective Leroy Dixon, 9/11related illness Detective Michael Kenneth Davis, 9/11related illness Sergeant Charles Gunzelman, 9/11related illness. May their families continue to be in our prayers. 
AMERICA NEEDS A COORDINATED 21ST CENTURY NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) for 5 minutes. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, it is Infrastructure Week. You can tell from all of the activity across the country: all of the rebuilding of the 140,000 bridges that need repair or replacement; the 40 percent of the national highway system that has failed to the point where we have to rebuild the whole thing, not just resurface it; and the $100 billion backlog in transit. It is all—well, actually, none of that is happening. In fact, despite the President being right here and talking about a $1.5 trillion plan—wow, a big surprise, up by $500 billion—during the State of the Union, the net result of what this President and this administration have done is actually to reduce spending on infrastructure and put forward a paper plan that would say you are on your own. It is called devolution; that is, we are going to say to the States and the territories: It is your obligation to build a national coordinated transportation infrastructure. This is a grand new idea from some of the rightwing think tanks: Make the States do it. How is that going to work? Well, actually, it is not a new idea. We tried it once before. Actually, we tried it by default until we had the Eisenhower plan, a Republican President, to build a national highway system. This was the net result of devolution: Kansas, Oklahoma; you build it, we will build it. Well, Kansas built it. What is this? Oh, that is the State line. This is Oklahoma: Sorry, we don’t have the money to build and continue that beautiful new freeway—1956. For 3 years, cars crashed through a wooden barrier they built at the end at the State line into Amos Sweitzer’s farm field until we had a national transportation plan, from a Republican President, funded by a user fee, a gas tax, to build out the system nationwide. And then it was Ronald Reagan who said: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We can’t just have highways. We need to have transit to serve our Nation’s largest cities and our hubs. So we added transit into this. That is all well and good. We built a system that was the envy of the world 40 years ago, 30 years ago, maybe even 25 years ago. Since then, it has been crumbling with neglect. We haven’t raised the Federal gas tax since 1993: 140,000 bridges need repair or replacement; $100 billion backlog in transit, just to build out to a state of good repair for what we have and not even give people new transit options to get out of the congestion and the traffic. We are wasting billions of dollars a year, wasting fuel from people sitting in gridlock all around the country. They are damaging their cars through potholes, and they don’t have the transit options that were promised to them. So what is going on? Well, it seems like the Republicans love to talk about it. Oh, they just love to talk about infrastructure. Everybody loves to talk about it—we are going to fill those potholes; we are going to build those bridges; we are going to take care of you—but they refuse to fund it. That is the bottom line. We need to fund an ambitious new national infrastructure plan: transit, roads, bridges, highways, harbors and ports, wastewater, clean water, and the list goes on and on and on. You can’t be a great nation if your people are mired in gridlock, if your roads are potholed, if your harbors are silted in, if your jetties are failing, if your wastewater systems are 50 years 
old and can’t take any new capacity and actually are polluting our rivers, and clean water is not available to people in some of the largest cities in the United States of America. Where is the Federal partner? There is no Federal partner with the Republicans in charge. Let the States do it. Let’s devolve this obligation to the States. That is their solution: The States should pay for it. Well, it didn’t work in the fifties. How the heck is that going to work in the 21st century? Even if one State decides now to increase capacity to move freight—say California wants to move all of the freight that comes into Los Angeles out of California to the rest of the Nation where it is going and bring the goods in to export from there, how is that going to work when you get to the Nevada State line and there is a two lane road—or no road—on the other side? This is an abject failure, and it is time for Congress to act. If the Republicans won’t act, maybe we need to replace them with a party that will act to rebuild America and make us competitive in the world for the 21st century, not devolution. We need a Federal partnership. We need Federal investment. We need a coordinated 21st century national transportation system. 
RECOGNIZING REBECCA OBERT THORN The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DONOVAN ). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize an educator in my district who is making a lasting difference in the lives of Bucks County students. Rebecca ObertThorn, of Pennwood Middle School in Lower Makefield, was recently named the winner of the Axalta AllPro Teacher of the Year Award. For this distinction, Rebecca has secured $7,000 for Pennwood to be used on materials that promote STEM education and opportunities for students. This program, which is in collaboration with the Philadelphia Eagles, honored Rebecca due to her dedication in the classroom, along with her work on the board of directors at Silver Lake Nature Center in Bristol and through STEM work at the Bucks County Community College. It also featured an event at Pennwood Middle School with Eagles wide receiver Bryce Treggs. I applaud Rebecca for her work in promoting STEM education and her commitment to building our next generation of leaders in Bucks County. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, NASA is known for hiring the brightest and most adept people in the world to execute the functions of space exploration and research. I am proud to recognize some of their youngest employees, who work not out of Houston, Texas, but from Council Rock High School South in Pennsylvania. Council Rock South is one of 125 schools in the Nation, and the only school in Pennsylvania, that participate in a unique program that enables students to develop projects that ultimately could be used by NASA itself. Indeed, NASA is currently working on one of the projects that originated from Council Rock South several years prior: a vibration isolation chamber that would protect fertilized eggs. I applaud these students for their contributions and would like to thank the technology education teacher, Fred Bauer, for the guidance and direction he provides these impressive young women and men. f 
MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about something critical to each and every person in the House and the millions of Americans whom we represent: our health. It is no secret that the Affordable Care Act was an important start toward increasing access to care and addressing longlingering health disparities that plague our communities. Thanks to the ACA, millions of Americans have access to quality, affordable healthcare, many for the first time. The impacts have been positive across the country, but especially in the African American community, where the uninsured rate has been cut in half. Mr. Speaker, this is remarkable progress, but we still have a long way to go. Globally, the U.S. ranks 24th in healthcare. Let me say that again. We, the United States, the richest country in the history of the world, ranks 24th when it comes to healthcare. Nations like Slovenia, Antigua, and Barbuda outrank us. Mr. Speaker, that is outrageous. We can and must do better. One area we desperately need to do better in is mental health. One in five Americans—that is more than 40 million of us—suffer from a mental health condition. Thankfully, the Affordable Care Act mandated, for the first time, that mental health services be included in coverage. But stigma and a persistent lack of access to care continue to prevent many from seeking and receiving treatment. It is estimated that more than half of those struggling with a mental health condition cannot, or do not, receive the care that they need. This Mental Health Awareness Month, I want to challenge my colleagues to join efforts to end stigma and bring these issues out into the open: join a rally, send a tweet on available services in your district, or host a roundtable with veterans who are struggling. b1030 Do something, anything, to help deconstruct the stigma. If every Member of this House did something, that is more than 440 moments to help tear down this stigma that keeps too many struggling without care. This month, May, is also Lupus Awareness Month. Despite affecting more than 1.5 million Americans, lupus is poorly understood and often overlooked even by medical professionals. It is estimated that a patient with lupus will go 6 years before they finally receive an accurate diagnosis. More than 90 percent of those living with lupus are women, and a disproportionate number are people of color. In fact, African Americans, Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans are as much as three times more likely to be diagnosed with lupus than White Americans. I hope that this House will mark May and Lupus Awareness Month by recommitting research, improved awareness, and increased access to care to support the 1.5 million Americans living with lupus. This month, I also want to draw attention to the fact that more than 75 million of us suffer from high blood pressure. Tragically, more than half—or 38 million—of us do not have this condition under control, leading to worsening complications, including heart disease and stroke, two of the leading causes of death in this country. High blood pressure is often called the silent killer, and I know that nearly every one of us in this House has a story of losing a friend or loved one to stroke or a heart attack. Again, as with nearly every disease, African Americans are disproportionately impacted. In fact, more than 40 percent of African American women and men have high blood pressure. Our community often tends to develop this disorder earlier and experience it more severely than our White counterparts. So this month I challenge everyone to ‘‘embrace the squeeze’’ and get your blood pressure checked. Knowing is half the battle, and it can save your life. We have a chance for Congress to tackle these issues headon. Next week, my dear friend, mentor, and colleague, Congresswoman BARBARA LEE, will introduce the Health Equity and Accountability Act, also known as the HEAA bill. This bill, that I have personally had the honor of introducing last Congress, takes a comprehensive look at where we need to address Americans’ health disparities crisis. I hope that all Members will take a careful look at this important bill and join us as cosponsors. While many of these health disparities have existed for years, they don’t need to persist. We can address them, we can solve problems, so let’s get to it. 
2018 SECRETARY OF DEFENSE EMPLOYER SUPPORT FREEDOM AWARD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DESJARLAIS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DESJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, in honor of National Police Week, I rise today to recognize the Dunlap, Tennessee, Police Department on its selection as a finalist for the 2018 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. This award, given each year by the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard, recognizes employers who go above and beyond to support their employees serving in the National Guard and military reserves. Out of 2,300 nominations nationwide, the Dunlap Police Department was chosen as one of just 30 finalists for the award, whose recipients will be announced next month. Under the leadership of Police Chief Clint Huth, who is himself a Navy Reserve Master Chief, the Dunlap Police Department has been active in their support for their guard and their reserve employees. Like many employers across the country, Chief Huth and the Dunlap PD play an important role in our Nation’s military readiness through their unwavering support of our reserve components. On behalf of Tennessee’s Fourth District, I would like to congratulate them on their recognition and offer my sincere gratitude for the commitment they have made to our citizen soldiers. 
THE FARM BILL IS A FLAWED BILL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, the debate this week in Congress centers largely around the farm bill, the most important bill that most people pay little or no attention to. Currently, there is a mad scramble for votes for a flawed bill from a fractured Republican caucus. Now, we are going to have some minor discussions on the floor. There are some amendments that will be bounced back and forth, but they are basically beside the point, not the big picture issues that need to be debated. There are fatal flaws. First and foremost, virtually everyone on our side of the aisle is adamantly opposed to the efforts to cut nutrition funding through SNAP, food stamps, rather than expanding opportunities to nutrition and healthy food. For example, they are cutting farmers market funding, for heaven’s sake, projects that are popular across the country and connect consumers directly with farmers for fresh, healthy food. This is all while they are proposing to essentially hound people off food stamps with unnecessary restrictions for employment. The vast majority of people are already employed or have difficulty being employed or there aren’t jobs available. They are going to have a job training program, about $45 per person, which anybody who works in this field will acknowledge that the bureaucracy and the trouble will be more than it is worth in terms of a benefit to people. Essentially, they will hound people off food stamps. This is at the same time where they are expanding subsidies for wealthy farming interests and expanding the ability to get those subsidies to people who aren’t actively involved with farming. This bill is going to send subsidy checks to New York City and Chicago and San Francisco, people who are cousins and nieces and nephews, not actively farming. The second major problem with this bill is it attacks conservation funding, cutting a billion dollars from essential services, cutbacks with the Conservation Stewardship Program, $5 billion cut out of the Working Lands Project, and not strengthening the ability of environmental programs to produce results. There is no requirement that we have highquality environmental outcomes. In fact, the EQIP Program has a wide variety of things that we pay farmers to do that actually don’t enhance the environment. We are paying farmers for the cost of doing business: fencing, hog lagoons. That is decidedly the wrong step to take. The worst aspect that is not getting the attention it deserves is the so called King amendment, the Protect Interstate Commerce Act, which would prevent State or local governments from regulating an agricultural product except to the extent it is already regulated by Federal law or the producing State. Think about that for a moment. States are moving to deal with the opioid crisis, and they would be prevented from having drug prohibitions that go beyond what the Federal Government does or other States. Food packaging regulations. Many States are concerned about BPAfree container requirements for baby food: prohibited. Fishing regulations. In my State, and I suspect in many others, people are serious about being able to protect fisheries, commercial and recreational, but under this bill, they would be prohibited if another State has looser requirements. My colleague from Seattle might have some concerns in her State about protecting the clamming operations, but some State like Nebraska that doesn’t have them could come in and not observe those limits. The notion that we won’t have invasive pest protections that are tailored to what our States want, product transportation laws, secure containers for animal carcasses and grease—lowest common denominator. Licensing and permitting of commercial enterprises, for example, professional licensing and pet sellers; you could not prohibit a convicted animal abuser from having a license to traffic animals if the other State doesn’t have it. These are horrific provisions trampling on States’ rights, consumer protection, environmental protection, agricultural protection. This bill should be rejected. f 
NATIONAL SALVATION ARMY WEEK The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DESJARLAIS ). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week is National Salvation Army Week, and it is a time to recognize the good that this organization does, but also a time to raise awareness about the challenges faced by more than 40 million Americans who are living in poverty, many who are stuck in poverty, quite frankly, because of programs and regulations put forth by Washington, D.C., for decades that serve as a spiderweb and makes people feel more comfortable living in poverty, which is nothing we should ever do. We should always be working to provide our friends, our neighbors, our neighbors in need with a pathway to opportunity. The Salvation Army is a great organization, actually, that accomplishes that. With the help of 3.2 million volunteers, the Salvation Army serves nearly 25 million Americans through a range of social services, including food for the hungry, relief for disaster survivors, clothing and shelter for the homeless, and opportunities for underprivileged children. National Salvation Army Week began in 1954 when Congress approved the joint resolution for President Dwight D. Eisenhower to proclaim a week to recognize the humanitarian efforts of the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army is one of the Nation’s largest and oldest faithbased health and human services providers. With a presence in every ZIP Code across the country, the Salvation Army uniquely understands the demands facing Americans in need. Last year, the Salvation Army served more than 56 million meals and provided more than 10 million nights of shelter. The Salvation Army is on the front lines of the opioid crisis, serving more than 173,000 Americans in 139 rehab centers across the United States. Since the 1900 Galveston hurricane, the Salvation Army has served survivors and first responders of every major natural disaster and numerous manmade disasters. In any given year, it helps more than 275,000 survivors receive hope, healing, and comfort. Through a wide variety of job training programs, including culinary, hospitality, and landscaping training, the 
Salvation Army helps Americans build the skills they need to acquire gainful employment and lift themselves out of poverty, help them achieve food security. The Salvation Army takes a holistic approach in addressing people’s needs. It supports the physical, emotional, and spiritual development of those that they serve. Data shows that those who utilize the Salvation Army’s spiritual and emotional care programs are more likely to reclaim their lives and get back on their feet. Mr. Speaker, the Salvation Army was established in London in 1865, and for more than 135 years, it has been supporting those in need without discrimination. Together, we can all join the fight for good. I am proud to honor this outstanding organization that for more than a century has given scores of Americans the help they need during trying times. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as a former law enforcement officer and a member of the House Law Enforcement Caucus to honor the brave men and women in uniform who have paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect, and to thank those officers who are putting their lives on the line every day to protect our communities. We owe a great debt of gratitude to these men and women and their families, who make their own sacrifices as they see their loved ones off every day. I remember when I went off every day and said goodbye to my wife and my children. I usually worked nighttime. I remember afterwards coming home, and on some nights when an officer had been killed or shot, and they would mention it on TV, but they wouldn’t give the name out until the family was notified. Those times for all the families in a large major police department or a small one are traumatic. After a while, my son, who was very young at the time, would sit on the stairway going up to the second floor and the bedrooms late in the evening until I came home. I have lost friends and partners in the line of duty; one, Erwin Jackson, after he saved my life on a robbery arrest, within a year, he was shot dead on a call. I have grieved with their families, and during the most difficult times, I have experienced firsthand the real sacrifices they make. This week, my wife, Pat, and I pause to remember our friends, reflect on their service. Mr. Speaker, last year, 129 officers died in the line of duty across this country. b1045 And so far this year, preliminary reports show 54 officers have died. Arizona has lost one brave officer so far this year. The family of Nogales Police Officer Jesus Cordova and the entire community continue to mourn his death after he was shot and killed by a carjacking suspect last month. He was the first Nogales officer to be shot and killed in 130 years. These law enforcement officers served and protected their communities admirably, and while we can never repay the debt we owe them and their families, we will forever remember their service. This week, 360 officers were memorialized on the National Law Enforcement Memorial here in Washington, D.C. Three brave Arizonans were honored: Paul Lazinsky of the El Mirage Police Department, whose watch ended last year; Alfred Moore of the Arizona Department of Liquor Control, whose watch ended in 1965; and Rupert Hopkins of the Pima County Sheriff’s Office, whose watch ended in 1950. The memorial also includes Navajo Nation Officer Houston Largo, who died last year while responding to a domestic violence call in New Mexico. As we look to the future, it is important to highlight the work being done at the local, county, and State levels to improve the relationship between police officers and their communities. I have seen firsthand how community policing practices benefit both the communities and the officers on patrol. It improves safety, increases trust, and it reduces violence. Communities across Arizona are leading the way in developing strong relationships between these two groups, and I applaud their hard work. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the support I have seen this week for our law enforcement community. I addressed how my family felt. I have spent a lot of time at funerals with the families of those that have fallen, too much time. And I have spent too many times at bedsides with seriously wounded officers. I was a homicide detective, and I investigated their shootings. Please remember in your prayers not only the officers that have fallen but their loved ones. 
RECOGNIZING INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ) for 5 minutes. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, later on this afternoon, in recognition of Infrastructure Week, I will be releasing the second annual overview of transportation and infrastructure priorities in my district, Washington’s Seventh Congressional District. The report features a number of high priority transportation and infrastructure projects. The report was developed through conversations and roundtables, tours, workshops, and planning sessions across my district that my staff and I convened. We have many cities in the district. People know the district for Seattle, which is very, very important, our Port of Seattle, an important institution, but we also have cities like Burien, which is right next to the SeaTac Airport, one of the fastest growing airports in the country, and is dealing with the many challenges that comes with that growth. Each of the priority projects that are covered in this report serves our district by enhancing sustainability, improving the community, and contributing to economic growth and job creation. My hope is that this report provides an overview of the types of improvements we desperately need to see in King County, the city of Seattle, Snohomish County, Shoreline, Edmonds, Lake Forest Park, Normandy Park, Burien, and the Port of Seattle. Our challenge, Mr. Speaker, is to keep our district the most livable, sustainable, and welcoming community in the country. It is a challenge. Just consider the facts: In 2016, we spent 54.8 hours in traffic, giving Seattle the dubious honor of being one of the top 10 cities for congestion. In 2015, the lowest earning 20 percent of households in our State spent three times as much, as a percentage of their income, on commuting costs compared to the highest income families. Especially significant are transit options for my constituents. Transit makes the ultimate difference in being able to reach a place of employment easily, which, in turn, affects how constituents are able to provide for themselves and their families. While Sound Transit has seen a 23 percent increase in ridership over the last year, we need to ensure that all communities are connected to transit networks and not forgotten. As King County Metro found in a report from 2015, while 71 percent of minority communities live within a quartermile of a Metro bus stop, only 41 percent live within a half a mile of a stop that has frequent service. Mr. Speaker, transit is also essential to addressing climate change. In our region, nearly 50 percent of our greenhouse gas pollution comes from transportation. In 2015, Washington State’s transportation sector contributed 43 tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, making it Washington’s highest level since 2007. Not only do we need to consider impacts to air quality but to water quality as well. In our region, clean water is essential to supporting our economy and national treasures like our salmon and our orcas. According to the Washington Stormwater Center, over 10,000 unique chemicals are found in urban road runoff, contributing to the continuing pollution of Puget Sound. 
Yet not a day goes by where I do not draw from the innovations and examples set by our businesses, our individuals, and institutions in our Seventh Congressional District. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that we are a model for the Nation, whether it is through ideas brought to reality, partnerships formed across diverse interests, or new mechanisms developed to maximize the leverage of any financial instruments. But there is a lot to do. Later this year, Congress will consider its annual budget and appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019, including, I hope, a potential infrastructure bill. Democratic Ranking Member DEFAZIOspoke earlier about the critical need for the Federal Government to fund a bold infrastructure plan so that our businesses and our communities across the country can succeed. That will put people back to work. It will put money into our roads, our bridges, our infrastructure needs, our water systems, our schools across our country, and our transit. Mr. Speaker, that is what I am committed to fighting for here in Congress. 
OPPOSING THE FARM BILL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today to talk about the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018. We call it the farm bill. It is supposed to be about supporting farmers, strengthening communities, making sure that we have nutritious food, looking out for our environment, and generally feeding America and even sometimes the world. Instead, this bill would allow companies to spray pesticides into our waterways, which are endangered all over this country. It will allow all sorts of environmental challenges and will diminish the quality of life for people. They won’t even allow a provision to have a Clean Water Act permit to spray pesticides. The bill is also an attack on local control. I thought local control was a hallmark of what it meant to be conservative. Apparently not, because this bill preempts local governments from taking steps to protect their communities from pesticides. I think a local community is in a better position to understand the health needs of its people than the Federal Government is. The bill would also make deep cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, a program that used to be called food stamps. There are no actual stamps anymore; this benefit is provided on a card that people use. The 5year authorization of the farm bill would cut $23 billion from SNAP—$23 billion. The proposal also adds work requirements. Now, some people think: Oh, yeah, what is wrong with making people work for a living? I work for a living. Well, the truth is, people who use the food stamp program often work for a living too. They just happen to have a tough patch in their lives where they need their neighbors—that is us—to step up and help make sure that they can have food on the table. The idea that people who have economic hardship don’t want to work is simply wrong. This body gives money out to rich people all the time and doesn’t ask for any work requirements. We don’t ask for many requirements at all, but we do it. It is all part of this shaming and blaming the poor. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this new work requirement, plus other restrictions proposed by the farm bill, as proposed, would end up denying or reducing nutritional aid to about 2 million people, mostly families with children. By the way, 70 percent of poor kids in America eligible for food stamps live in a household with somebody who works, but the Federal minimum wage is $7.25. On $7.25, that works out to about $15,000 a year. You could work fulltime and be eligible for food stamps. People who don’t work because of whatever difficult patch they hit in their life should not be shamed into not accepting food assistance. If they are not healthy and they are not well fed, how are they going to get back in the workforce? Under this proposal, most adults between 18 and 59 will be required to work parttime or enroll in 20 hours a week of workforce training to receive assistance. It would impose stricter eligibility guidelines for lowincome families who qualify for SNAP through other welfare programs. Many SNAP recipients face legitimate barriers to enrolling in these programs, such as unreliable transportation. One of my colleagues already talked about the difficulty with transportation in getting to a better paying job in this economy. Low housing security. A lot of people are homeless. It is very difficult to stay employed if you are homeless. And shifting childcare and medical schedules. SNAP helps 42 million people in nearly 21 million households. In 2016, SNAP lifted 3.6 million people out of poverty. They were in poverty; now they weren’t because of SNAP. It is a good program. In my own State of Minnesota, more than 69 percent of SNAP participants are families with children. Almost 30 percent are families with members who are elderly or people with disabilities. More than 54 percent are working families. People who use food stamp benefits work hard every day. They work harder than many of us who earn a lot more than them. SNAP kept 111,000 people out of poverty in Minnesota, including almost 60,000 children, per year from 2009 to 2012. Let me wrap up by saying that the farm bill, as currently proposed, I cannot vote for. I will have to urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I hope that we learn something important about people who struggle hard in this economy. f 
OPPOSE THE FARM BILL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I was a free lunch kid growing up. I was the young man that brought his ID card to the lunch lady and she looked on the back for the yellow sticker and I received free breakfasts and free lunches. I know what it is like to come from a home with a lot of love but not a lot of money. I can tell you for a fact that kids with backgrounds like me cannot succeed in the classroom if they are worried about the next meal. That is why this GOP farm bill is so reprehensible. Republicans are proposing SNAP cuts that will kick a quarterofamillion students off of the free lunch program. That is right, Mr. Speaker. They have just given massive tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires, but now, to save money, they are trying to pass a bill that could cause poor kids across this country to go hungry. This legislation is a direct attack on my constituents. It is a direct attack on the poor. One in four families in my district alone counts on SNAP to put food on the table. They deserve better. Our country deserves better. I urge my colleagues to oppose this shameful legislation. 
b1100 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE’S WORK ON CLIMATE CHANGE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the work being done by the Department of Defense regarding the threat of climate change, and to reinforce congressional intent on this important issue. Last year’s National Defense Authorization Act expressed the sense of Congress that climate change is a direct threat to national security. We have studied a number of readiness factors when it comes to our Armed Forces, but for too long, we have not given this major, multifaceted threat the attention that it deserves. Current and former military leaders and members of the intelligence community agree that climate change poses a security challenge that has the potential to affect our tactical and strategic readiness. Secretary Mattis was correct when he stated: ‘‘ . . . the effects of a changing climate—such as increased maritime access to the Arctic, rising sea levels, desertification, among others— impact our security situation.’’ 
Naval bases, such as Norfolk or Key West, are already at risk for flooding. In fact, Norfolk frequently deals with nuisance flooding, and that risk will only increase as storm surges increase in magnitude and tides continue to rise. Inland bases will experience other weather volatility, such as extreme heat and wildfires, all of which can impact their ability to train, and ultimately impacts readiness. The displays of dominance in the Arctic will grow, where new sealanes will connect continents more directly than ever before. The changing global climate, Mr. Speaker, will also lead to greater instability in the form of economic migration, increased competition over resources, and possibly more failed states, which we know to be breeding grounds for extremism and terrorism. Mr. Speaker, it is clear that a changing climate will alter our joint battle space. So when the U.S. Congress instructs the Department of Defense to take these threats seriously and evaluate the risk posed to our national security by climate change, we need exactly that. Our intent is clear, and there can be no room for misinterpretation. Last week, The Washington Post reported that during revision of the Department’s January 2018 Screening Level Vulnerability Assessment Survey report, Department of Defense officials omitted information pertinent to how our military installations report their vulnerability to sea level rise, how climate change is affecting the operating environment in the Arctic, and the potential risk to the Department’s ability to conduct training and testing activities that have important impacts on our readiness. While I appreciate the need to update reports when it is appropriate and necessary, it is unacceptable to attempt to bend congressional intent for political convenience. The Department of Defense must answer tough questions as to what motivated these changes, if not a skewed political narrative. In fact, the issue of climate change and its impact on national security has become more bipartisan over the last several years. In fact, last year, in the National Defense Authorization Act, Congress instructed each service within the Department of Defense to assess the top 10 military installations likely to be affected by climate change over the next 20 years. We also instructed combatant commanders to incorporate the effects of a changing climate into their strategic battle plans. Fortysix Republicans joined with Democrats to support this language on the floor of the House, and I expect that when this report is delivered to Congress later this year, it will make candid assessments in line with the clear language we supported in that floor vote and that was signed into law by the President. Mr. Speaker, we must ensure that the Department remains resilient and is prepared to address the effects of climate change on threat assessments, resources, and readiness, as well as to conduct operations both today and in the future. Congressional oversight plays an undeniable role in that process. Mr. Speaker, the dangers of climate change on our national defense are real, and we support the researchers on the front lines of these critical threat assessments. Together, we can continue to craft a sane and sober strategy to defend the United States from a variety of threats, including climate change. That is the expressed intent of Congress for the upcoming climate report, and is a necessity as we prepare for our Nation’s future. 
CONGRESS SHOULD NOT LET PEOPLE GO HUNGRY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues have a point. It is really terrible that some people take advantage of free food and drink to continue their slothful lifestyles. I agree. This conduct must stop. Of course, Members of Congress can attend lunches and receptions with free food and drink every single day, sleep on the taxpayer’s dime in their offices, and have the taxpayers do their laundry, too. The House has been in session for a measly 50 days this year, and I have compiled at least 54 receptions, which is just the tip of the iceberg of free food and drink available to Members. But even estimating a modest $10 for a glass of wine and a plate of appetizers, that means that a Member who attends a reception every night the House is in session, has received a benefit of over $500 just since the beginning of this year. That is about the same amount of money as the maximum monthly food stamp benefit for a family of three, except Congress Members are nibbling on pork sliders, and French Brie, and pate, while these poor families are expected to feed each family member three meals a day for 30 days. That breaks down to about $5.60 for each meal, or about $1.87 per person per meal. Now, I am sure none of my colleagues would think that they are better than working people who struggle to keep a roof over their heads and food on their tables. And I am sure all of us are happy to be subject to the same rules that we vote on in this Chamber. So here is my modest proposal: The congressional electronic benefits transfer card, or congressional food stamp card. We will put a little cash in it—say $1.87 per reception—and Members can figure out how to make their monthly reception budget stretch to fit their wining anddining needs. Maybe we will have Members carrying their single glass of wine from one reception to another, or maybe they will blow their whole allotment on one plate of shrimp, or maybe—just maybe—we will see more Members of Congress showing empathy for the most vulnerable in our society. Now, to be clear, there is nothing wrong with private organizations spending their own money on outreach to Members of Congress. I have certainly attended my share of receptions, as has everyone else here. But what is truly repellent in this debate, is the rank hypocrisy. Here we sit, we get paid $174,000 a year to work 4 days a week here at the U.S. Capitol, and we are considering a bill that would take food assistance away from millions of Americans. Members of Congress can literally walk down the hall for free appetizers any time of the day or the week. Yet, Republicans are proposing to deny 265,000 children school meals. Congress can’t pass an infrastructure bill or DACA, but we can debate a bureaucratic and ineffective work requirement for people struggling with hunger. Perhaps if my colleagues ran out of funds on their congressional food stamp card and got a bit peckish, they would remember that in one of the richest countries in the world, we should not let people go hungry. Period. How can we be debating on whether to starve children whose parents are struggling with lowpaying or unstable jobs? You know what should be an unstable job? Giving corporations $2 trillion in tax cuts while slashing basic food assistance to 20 million children, 5 million seniors, and 1 million veterans. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this disgusting bill. And for those who don’t, I will pray that you regret every bite of free shrimp cocktail and every sip of free wine. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 11 o’clock and 9 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida) at noon. 
PRAYER Monsignor John Zenz, Holy Name Parish, Birmingham, Michigan, offered the following prayer: Be true to Your name, O Lord, and may we also be true to Your name, O Lord. You give life to all things and make them holy. Keep us true to Your gift of life. 
You manifest Your power by mercy and compassion. May we be true to You as stewards of Your power. We call upon You as Father. Keep us true to Your providential care for the human family by our loving concern for the common good. As we approach Memorial Day, may we be true to Your promise of life eternal, remembering all who have died, especially those in the service of freedom and peace. Be true to Your name, O Lord, and may we always be true to Your name as well. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLA GHER ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. GALLAGHER led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING MONSIGNOR JOHN ZENZ The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. TROTT ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Monsignor Zenz, a staple in southeast Michigan and the pastor of Holy Name Catholic Church. Ordained almost 40 years ago, Monsignor Zenz received a doctorate in spiritual theology in 1984 and has served the faculty at Sacred Heart for over 35 years. Starting as a weekend associate at my hometown parish in Birmingham, Michigan, Monsignor Zenz became the pastor at Holy Name in 2008, where he has faithfully served our community since. He also serves on the board at the Academy of the Sacred Heart and chaplain to the Detroit Chapter of the National Christ Child Society. He is currently a chaplain to the Detroit Cardinal Club and has extensive experience working with Catholic Network of Detroit, ensuring God’s word reaches as many homes as possible. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to host Monsignor Zenz here today, and I want to thank him for his tireless service and dedication to southeast Michigan. We should all strive to serve our communities with the same rigor that Monsignor Zenz demonstrates on a daily basis. f 
MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT Messages in writing from the President of the United States were communicated to the House by Ms. Gabrielle Cuccia, one of his secretaries. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly oppose the Roskam amendment to the Agriculture and Nutrition Act. This amendment is deeply unfair to territories in the United States and contrary to the original intent of the Animal Welfare Act of 1976. That intent was to aid State and local law enforcement in jurisdictions where gamefowl events were prohibited from transport from jurisdictions which allow it. Mr. Speaker, cockfighting, like horse racing, is a longstanding recreational activity in the U.S. Virgin Islands with historical and cultural significance. It is regulated in the Virgin Islands along with Puerto Rico. I understand the concerns of those opposed to this sport and believe regulatory processes and educational outreach are the best means within those jurisdictions to address them. Outlawing cockfighting in the U.S. territories will only create underground industries, which will prove problematic and create criminality, particularly for men of color. Mr. Speaker, to pass an amendment that solely affects the territories that none of the Delegates from the territories support is pejorative, paternalistic, yes, colonialist, and downright wrong. The territories have always been treated unfairly under numerous important Federal laws and programs, and this amendment, sadly, is yet another example. 
CANCEL THE AUGUST RECESS 2.0 (Mr. GALLAGHER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I stood in this very spot about 1 year ago urging Congress to do the work of the American people, the work they sent us here to do. I introduced a piece of legislation called the Do Your Job Act, which is simple. It would not allow Congress to go into recess unless we have actually done our work, passed all of our appropriations bills. Instead, I fear that we are going to find ourselves in the same crisis that we found ourselves in just a few months ago. That is why I was glad to see that the President recently said that we should cancel the August recess, if necessary, if we can’t do our job. 
In just 2 months, we will once again adjourn for a monthlong recess without a budget or getting all our appropriations done, to say nothing of the other issues that remain unresolved, like immigration—take your pick. Once again, if we don’t make some hard choices, the government may shut down. I think that is unacceptable. We know exactly how this plays out. We saw it last year, as we careened from one budgetary deadline to the next, with one shortterm extension after another. We simply can’t keep repeating these same mistakes over and over again. To do so would be the literal definition of ‘‘insanity.’’ So I urge my colleagues: let’s put an end to this madness. Let’s stay here, if necessary, even if that means canceling recess. Let’s work with a sense of urgency and purpose to better this country, because that is what our constituents sent us here to do. 
HONORING SECOND LIEUTENANT RICHARD ‘‘RICHIE’’ COLLINS III (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago, my community was shaken by the murder of Second Lieutenant Richard ‘‘Richie’’ Collins III, a young African American stabbed to death while waiting for a bus on the campus of the University of Maryland. He was a student at Bowie State University just days from graduation. Richie was in College Park visiting friends to celebrate his recent commission as an officer in the United States Army. He was a young man of great promise, very talented and driven to success. He was popular on campus and helped create Bowie State University’s first lacrosse team. He was an avid player of golf, soccer, and baseball. Richie loved deep conversations about life, politics, and philosophy. The individual on trial for his murder has been charged with a hate crime. Mr. Speaker, we must do more to combat the spread of hatred by spreading tolerance and respect instead, and we must never forget those, like Richie Collins, whose lives were cut short by hatred and prejudice. I again offer my condolences, as I have, to Richie’s parents, Richard and Dawn, his family, his friends to mark this somber anniversary. We ask for whom the bell tolls; it tolled for us. 
RECOGNIZING STEVEN D. HOGAN (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the passing of a truly great American, the mayor of Aurora, Colorado, Stephen D. Hogan. Mayor Hogan passed away on May 13. Throughout his nearly 8year tenure as a mayor of my hometown, Steve Hogan oversaw a remarkable and exciting renaissance of the city. Aurora has become Colorado’s thirdlargest city and the driving force behind innovation, development, and economic opportunity. Aurora has also become an even greater place to live, work, and raise a family. I met Steve Hogan 35 years ago when I returned home to Aurora after having served in the Marine Corps. I have had the distinct pleasure to call him a friend ever since. Mayor Hogan’s career in public service has taken him from serving in the Colorado House of Representatives in the 1970s to serving six terms as an Aurora City Council member and, finally, two terms as the mayor of the city, a city I know he loved so dearly. Mayor Hogan exemplified the spirit of public service, and my hometown of Aurora would not be the wonderful place it is today without his vision and his leadership. We all are better off because of his decades of hard work. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have been able to call Mayor Steve Hogan a friend, and his family will remain in my thoughts and prayers. f 
AGREEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA—MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115–125) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Ways and Means and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95–216, 42 U.S.C. 433(e)(1)), I transmit herewith a social security totalization agreement with Slovenia, titled ‘‘Agreement on Social Security between the United States of America and the Republic of Slovenia’’ and the accompanying legally binding administrative arrangement, titled ‘‘Administrative Arrangement between the United States of America and the Republic of Slovenia for the Implementation of the Agreement on Social Security between the United States of America and the Republic of Slovenia’’ (collectively the ‘‘Agreements’’). The Agreements were signed in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on January 17, 2017. The Agreements are similar in objective and content to the social security totalization agreements already in force with other leading economic partners in Europe and elsewhere, including Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Norway, the Republic of Korea, and Switzerland. Such bilateral agreements provide for limited coordination between the United States and foreign social security systems to eliminate dual social security coverage and taxation and to help prevent the loss of benefit protection that can occur when workers divide their careers between two countries. The Agreements contain all provisions mandated by section 233 of the Social Security Act and, pursuant to section 233(c)(4), other provisions which I deem appropriate to carry out the purposes of section 233. I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report required by section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act on the estimated number of individuals who will be affected by the Agreements and the Agreements’ estimated cost effect. Also included are a summary of the main provisions of the Agreements and an annotated version of the Agreements with descriptions of each article. The Department of State and the Social Security Administration concluded that these Agreements are in the national interest of the United States. I commend to the Congress the Agreement on Social Security between the United States of America and the Republic of Slovenia and the Administrative Arrangement between the United States of America and the Republic of Slovenia for the Implementation of the Agreement on Social Security between the United States of America and the Republic of Slovenia. DONALD J. T RUMP .THEWHITE HOUSE , May 17, 2018. 
b1215 PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2, AGRICULTURE AND NUTRITION ACT OF 2018 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 900 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 900 Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for further consideration of the bill (H.R. 2) to provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and for other purposes. No further amendment to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such further amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such 
further amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment pursuant to this resolution the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington? There was no objection. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 900, providing for further consideration of a very important piece of legislation for America’s farmers and ranchers: H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act, commonly referred to as the farm bill. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2 under a structured rule, allowing for consideration of 31 amendments that were offered. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I traveled to every county in my district for one reason: to listen, to hear, and to get the input and the concerns from farmers, ranchers and producers across central Washington State. I traveled to Pateros, where my constituents discussed the vital need for strengthening market access and opening new sources for exporting across the globe. I visited with farmers from East Wenatchee in Douglas County who discussed the importance of commodity sourcing and stressed the need for stronger education for the public about farming and where the food that lands on our tables comes from. I heard from constituents in Prosser and Benton and Yakima Counties who stressed the importance of agricultural research from producers in Quincy, who shared their personal stories of the impacts of crop insurance on their livelihoods, and from farmers in Othello who raised concerns regarding regulatory burdens on the agricultural community. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to say that this farm bill makes great strides in addressing these challenges that face America’s farmers. The rule we bring before the House provides for further consideration of the underlying legislation, H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act, a bill that is critically important to my district in central Washington and to rural districts just like it across the country. As a farmer myself and as a former State agricultural director, I know how important these farm policies are when it comes to our agricultural economy. This farm bill strengthens the farm safety net to help America’s farmers and ranchers compete. After 5 years of depressed prices, and a 52 percent drop in farm income, our farmers need us—they need Congress— to reauthorize these important programs. Mr. Speaker, while American farmers have faced these depressed prices and severe drops in farm income, we, luckily, have a robust safety net in place. Due to the previous 2014 farm bill, our agriculture community was able to hold on and continue to provide American consumers with food in our grocery stores, in our schools, and in our food banks. It is incumbent upon us to ensure these policies continue. We must pass this farm bill and ensure a steady food supply will be on the shelves and in our markets for the years to come. The underlying legislation includes the creation of a new international market program, which I would argue is more important today than ever before. Programs within it, including the Market Access Program and the Foreign Market Development Program, are incredibly important to producers seeking to maintain and expand their export markets for U.S. agricultural products and commodities. The Market Access Program, on its own, is a net positive program, which for every $1 spent, $28 is returned to the American economy. I know these critical trade and export resources are at the top of the minds of American farmers and producers across the country, and we must continue to ensure their availability and access for the agricultural industry. This bill also maintains and strengthens the Nation’s nutrition programs to assist those who struggle to put food on the table, while providing critical training to help people attain the skills necessary to gain goodpaying jobs, financial selfsufficiency, and better futures for themselves and their families. It supports the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, without any cuts in funding. Instead, this bill adds further funding and empowers States with the flexibility on how to best administer their respective programs. The State of Washington has done innovative work in their administration of SNAP through the BFET and the RISE programs to help some of the most vulnerable populations, and I am pleased that this farm bill will allow these programs to continue if the State so chooses. This legislation contains employment and education provisions for those who need a hand up due to falling on hard times. Mr. Speaker, the farm bill contains comprehensive approaches to farm policy, nutrition, trade, conservation, crop insurance, regulatory reform, rural development, animal health, specialty and organic crops, and provisions to help beginning farmers and ranchers. This rule provides for further consideration of amendments offered by our colleagues in the House on a great variety of these issues. I look forward to listening to the robust debate on potential provisions to strengthen this legislation. As this is the first farm bill I have had the opportunity to engage in since being in Congress, I welcome input from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and from every perspective. We must continue to bring forward solutions for America’s farmers, ranchers, rural communities, and families. Mr. Speaker, this body, the people’s House, is made up of many walks of life. We have physicians. We have attorneys. We have ordained ministers. We have engineers, school administrators, former State and local government officials, scientists, and law enforcement officials. Today, I am proud to come before you as a farmer. I am not the only one. There are maybe about 20 farmers, ranchers, and producers in the House, in the people’s House. Among us are an almond farmer from central California, a blueberry farmer from the State of Maine, a rancher from South Dakota, a cattleman from Kentucky, a rice farmer from Minnesota, and, yes, a proud hops farmer from the Yakima Valley from the State of Washington. I am privileged to come before you in support of this rule and the underlying legislation, H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act. I humbly urge my colleagues to support the rule, support the bill, and strengthen the future for America’s farmers and all of those who depend on them. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ) for the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I spoke yesterday about the bigpicture numbers behind this cruel bill, how it would cut the SNAP benefits that families rely on to buy groceries by over $20 billion. That includes slashing benefits for vulnerable adults like veterans, the chronically homeless, and teenagers aging out of foster care by $9.2 billion. There is a provision in this bill that would rip benefits away from nearly 1 million people, mostly from working 
families with kids, by eliminating an important State flexibility option called categorical eligibility. The bill even included a provision that would have constructed barriers to accessing SNAP for those with disabilities who have outofpocket utility costs—that is, until Democrats shamed the majority into abandoning it as part of their manager’s amendment unveiled late last night. But get this: this fix didn’t come without a cost, Mr. Speaker. Tucked into the manager’s package—which was, yet again, written in secret—is a provision that will kick over 600,000 vulnerable adults off of SNAP in the first 2 years after enactment of this bill—2 years before their misguided work bureaucracy goes into effect. Six hundred thousand vulnerable men and women will lose their benefits before they even have the opportunity to take advantage of the majority’s new make work program. Really? What are you thinking? This entire bill is an embarrassment, and this manager’s amendment only makes it worse. It should be scrapped and sent back to the Agriculture Committee, where we can have real bipartisan negotiations and craft a bill that actually helps people, because despite some changes around the margins, the Republican farm bill remains an unmitigated disaster. b1230 Today I want to zoom in on that big picture and give telling examples of how this disastrous Republican bill would impact real people in their everyday lives, because that is what is at stake with the Republican farm bill. That is what we need to be focussed on, because it goes well beyond the numbers on a page. McClatchy reported a story earlier this month that put it succinctly, entitled: ‘‘50Something Food Stamp Recipients Could Face Tough Job Search Under Proposed Rules.’’ Take, for example, a woman named Sabrina, who was quoted in the story. She works side jobs, like cleaning houses and doing yard work, but has a difficult time finding steady employment at her age of 59. This bill will take away her benefits, because she may not meet its 20hourperweek requirement. She is working. She is exactly the kind of person my Republican friends say they want to support. Do they think she purposely found jobs that pay so little and have so few hours? That doesn’t fit so nicely into the majority’s press releases, but that is the reality. Or take, for example, Thomas, a single dad who lost his wife a few years ago and is raising his preteen daughter on his own. He has worked diligently to find stable employment, but jobs are scarce in his community. Without SNAP and reducedprice school meals, Thomas said he and his daughter ‘‘would not be able to survive.’’ These are the kind of people my Republican colleagues are demonizing during this debate, and it is deeply frustrating. Or take Lisa, a working mother of four kids earning about $14 per hour as a nursing assistant. Lisa has to stretch her monthly income to cover rent and utilities afterschool care, clothing, and car costs so that she can get to her job. Currently, she receives a modest SNAP benefit to feed her family and her kids receive free school meals, but because her income is just over the 130 percent threshold for a family of five, she would automatically lose her SNAP benefits if this bill becomes law. For Lisa, SNAP makes an incredible difference in her ability to feed her children. Or take Elton, a U.S. Navy veteran who lost his benefits for 2 years because of the strict work requirements and time limits that are already part of the SNAP law. During the 2year period he was unable to access SNAP benefits, Elton was hungry every day wondering what he could eat in order to get by. It wasn’t that Elton chose not to work. He worked physically demanding jobs his entire life, but he lost his job after an injury. He continues to struggle with health conditions and doesn’t have reliable access to transportation; issues that are exacerbating his job search. Under this bill, Elton may lose his modest food benefits entirely. These are real people, and if the majority on the Agriculture Committee actually took the time and did a hearing on the heartless nutrition title in this bill, they would have heard these and many other reallife stories. Take a moment to think about what you are doing here. My Republican colleagues are denying food benefits to veterans, single dads struggling to find work, and working moms. Why? Because PAUL RYAN asked you to? Because of a myth that people aren’t struggling? It is sickening. Mr. Speaker, this bill is just legislation by sound bite; bad legislation. It demonizes the poor and trades in stereotypes, apparently just to help some in the majority with their next hit on FOX News. This bill has real consequences. It will hurt real people, our constituents, yours and mine, in every single congressional district in this country. Now, it is obvious that this isn’t a serious attempt at legislating, because the process here was atrocious. The majority ignored the recommendations from Democratic and Republican witnesses during the Agriculture Committee’s 23 hearings on SNAP. Controversial provisions were inserted into this bill without explanation on where they came from. I asked. I still can’t find out. Democrats were left in the dark as this legislation was drafted, we were left to read about it in news reports; a total affront to the bipartisan tradition that has defined the farm bill for years. Now, the majority may be calling this a farm bill, but it is really a total transformation of our social safety net. It is a farm bill that doesn’t even improve the farm economy. Let me state, our farmers work hard, they should be valued, and they certainly deserve a hell of a lot better than what is contained in this bill. If Republicans want to hurt our workers and denigrate the poor, they are going to have to do it alone, because, make no mistake about it, that is what this bill is designed to do and that is what it will do unless the responsible adults in the Republican Party join us in defeating it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Mr. CONAWAY , and I have worked together on many issues, and I know that he recognizes that the trade promotion programs that I referenced in my opening remarks are vital to our agricultural economy. For decades, USDA export development programs like MAP have helped American farmers create, expand, and maintain access to foreign markets. Throughout their history, this successful publicprivate partnership has cultivated hundreds of billions of dollars in exports and created millions of American jobs both in the agricultural sector and in support industries, as well as the program brings a return to the United States economy. In the findings of the underlying bill, it states: ‘‘United States export development programs significantly increase demand for United States agricultural products . . . generating a return of $28 in added export revenue for each invested program dollar.’’ Additionally: ‘‘ . . . our global competitors provide substantially more public support for export promotion than is provided to United States agricultural exporters.’’ We are at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to the rest of the world when it comes to agricultural trade. Mr. Speaker, without these private contributions and the private sector’s resolve to support our export programs, it is very likely that the U.S. would not be the net agricultural exporter of the highest quality products that we are today. I think it is time that we look at our export promotion programs and take a serious look if we want to continue our exporting success. Mr. Speaker, I introduced a bill to grow the investment in the MAP and FMD programs and I also offered an amendment that would have made a smaller investment in the MAP and FMD programs, and while we are not considering those amendments today, I am grateful that Chairman CONAWAY  has agreed to come and engage in this important issue. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY ), the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. NEWHOUSE for his commitment to ensuring that American farmers and ranchers maintain the tools necessary to remain competitive on the global stage. As you well know, trade is of immense importance to the agricultural industry, with U.S. agricultural exports estimated at $140 billion per year and trade accounting for one of every $5 of agricultural production value. Through its extensive farm bill hearing series and listening sessions, the committee heard from every segment of the agricultural industry about the importance of maintaining support for our trade promotion and our market development programs, especially considering the uncertainty in the current trade climate. While I am confident that America’s farmers and ranchers are incredibly efficient and can compete with anyone in the world on a level playing field, they simply cannot be expected to compete against foreign treasuries on their own. So in addition to maintaining and strengthening the farm safety net, H.R. 2 restores and increases funding for the popular and successful Market Access Program and Foreign Market Development Program. This was no small feat, considering the CBO zeroed out funding for FMD as well as the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops Program in its most recent baseline projections. But the committee worked together to get creative and make it happen. I certainly wish we could have come closer to answering the calls for doubling funding for MAP and FMD, but am proud of the work we did, and believe that the streamlined International Market Development Program will give the newly established USDA Undersecretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs the tools necessary to continue tearing down barriers to trade and opening up new markets to U.S. agricultural products. That said, we can always do better, so I am committed to working with Mr. NEWHOUSE and my colleagues in the Senate to continue searching for additional funding for these important trade promotion efforts while we move forward. Mr. Speaker, I am very appreciative of Mr. NEWHOUSE ’s efforts and his support for these important programs. I look forward to working with him in conference when the Senate gets their work done after we get our bill passed. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman CONAWAY for his commitment to continue working on this important issue, and I look forward to working with him. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL ), and I ask unanimous consent that he may control that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as my colleague, the gentleman from Washington, is leaving, I would just urge him to read the bill, because if he did, he would realize that if this bill were to become law, there are 60,000 people in his home State of Washington who would lose SNAP benefits just due to categorical eligibility changes alone; more would lose their benefits, but just for this one tweak in this bill. The majority of the people who would lose their benefits under categorical eligibility changes are working families, working families with kids. Children, Mr. Speaker, will lose their SNAP benefits and many of them will lose access to free school meals. So, again, for all the talk on the other side about how this bill is somehow a good bill for families, read the bill. It is a pretty cruel bill for working families and for children. Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask that we defeat the previous question, and if so, I will offer an amendment ensuring that before the legislation can take effect, the President must certify to Congress that none of the administration’s recent trade and tariff actions and negotiations will harm U.S. farmers, ranchers, and other agriculture producers. I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS ), a member of the Agriculture Committee. Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate the time. Mr. Speaker, hardworking families across the heartland know firsthand what the negative impacts of trade can look like. They have lived through it in places like Galesburg, Illinois, when the Maytag plant padlocked its gates and sent every last one of those jobs to Mexico. They lived through it in Freeport, Illinois, when venture capitalists bought out the Sensata factory and sent every last one of those jobs over to China. And today, at the end of planting season, corn growers and soybean farmers and pork producers all across the heartland are getting hit in their wallet by the Trump trade war. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago I rode in a John Deere tractor with a young soybean farmer named Jared Kunkle while he was planting his soybeans. You see, right now as planting season is wrapping up, our farmers are making a lot of tough decisions. That is because in Illinois and many of our neighboring States, our soybean farmers sell about a quarter of their crops to China. In fact, in Illinois, if our State was its own country, we would be the fourth largest producer of soybeans in the world. So when President Trump’s thumbs got the better of him and started tweeting us into a trade war with China, there were very real consequences for the families that I serve. To be clear, those consequences and the harm and uncertainty that they are generating is being felt right now. In fact, just this morning, there was a headline in Bloomberg News that I want to read to you, I want to show to you: ‘‘China Buys Record Amount of Russian Soy as it Shuns U.S. Growers.’’ That is this morning. The fact is, our farmers have been struggling in a tightening market with low profit margins. So in 2016, when President Trump stood at a podium in Iowa and proudly declared that he would ‘‘end this war on the American farmer,’’ they took him at his word. Midwesterners do that; we believe people when they say something, and we also believe that promises ought to be kept. For farmers like Jared Kunkle of Cameron, Illinois, and thousands of farmers like him, that promise has been broken. It has been broken by this President, and now, if you do not support this amendment, it will also be broken by this Congress. So I urge you, please keep your word. Support this measure to protect our hardworking farmers and ranchers from this Trump trade war. Let’s work together. And as the President says, let’s ‘‘end this war on the American farmer.’’ Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I think that the gentlewoman from Illinois speaks on behalf of a lot of Members in this Chamber. Nobody wants to see a trade war. Nobody is advantaged by a trade war. I think so many of the provisions that are in this underlying bill, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2, are designed to create more stability for farm families. The gentlewoman is absolutely right when she references the instability trade war conversations create. So much more important, then, that we come together now to provide that safety net and that stability that is included here in H.R. 2. I appreciate the gentlewoman’s encouragement that we get to the other end of these trade negotiations, and I do believe that is something that we all share. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1245 Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ). Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to one of the amendments made in order 
by this rule. The FoxxDavis amendment would dramatically alter American sugar policy by eliminating the economic safety net for sugar producers. There is a Domino Sugar Refinery located in my district in Yonkers, New York, which has been a staple of the neighborhood for almost a century. According to their own figures, the refinery employs 280 people and sustains an additional 138 jobs through trucking, terminal operations, cargo handling, and ship piloting. That is more than 400 local jobs, most of them union jobs, supporting local families and pumping additional dollars into our communities. These are the men and women I represent, and they are the ones for whom I cast my vote. I will cast my vote against the FoxxDavis amendment and encourage my colleagues to do the same. America’s sugar policy is working. It has operated at zero cost to taxpayers in 14 of the past 15 years, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture projects that sugar will run at a zero cost to taxpayers over the next 10 years. According to the International Sugar Organization, food manufacturers in the U.S. pay 10 percent less for sugar than other developed countries. Meanwhile, America’s grocery shelf sugar prices are among the lowest in the world. Again, most importantly, the reason I rise is that the U.S. sugar industry provides good union jobs. Without the current sugar policy, 142,000 American jobs are in jeopardy of being outsourced, and the U.S. stands to lose nearly $20 billion in annual economic activity. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman just spoke about one of the amendments that is going to be offered today. In total, there are 51 different amendments that have been made in order both in the rule that we did yesterday and this rule that we hope that our colleagues will support today, 51 different amendments proffered by Members of this Chamber to try to make this bill better. If we pass this rule today, we will be able to move to the underlying bill for consideration of those amendments. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia for reminding us that there were 51 amendments made in order, but he forgot to mention that 54 were blocked. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. LAWSON ), who is a member of the Agriculture Committee. Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the House Republican farm bill. I really didn’t think that I would have to say the ‘‘Republican farm bill’’ when we worked so diligently in committee. This bill would strip our Nation’s most vulnerable of the necessary resources they need to feed their families. The farm bill would bring hunger and pain to children. The bill kicks 265,000 schoolkids out of free and reduced lunch, and I have attended a lot of those schools where I see the kids on free and reduced lunch. Florida will be the hardest hit State resulting from the removal of categorical eligibility. In addition, 130,000 hardworking Floridians will go hungry as a result of this farm bill. The farm bill doesn’t just hurt Floridians. It hurts the entire country. It hurts seniors. It hurts college students and young adults. It hurts the disabled, and it even hurts our active military families. The farm bill also hurts rural communities. I represent several of those rural communities in north Florida, and it also hurts the communities that we border in rural Georgia that I receive calls from. Before voting on this bill, I want to remind my colleagues of the motto of the USDA, ‘‘Do right and feed everyone.’’ The farm bill does not do right, and it surely doesn’t feed everyone. Mr. Speaker, I want to end with a quote from Isaiah 58:10. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Florida. Mr. LAWSON of Florida. ‘‘If you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.’’ Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to associate myself with the gentleman from Florida in his commitment to public service. He is a relatively new Member to this Chamber, but he has been fighting for his constituents since he arrived, and I admire him for that. There are lot of men and women in this Chamber who fit that bill, Mr. Speaker. I wish we spent more time celebrating those good public servants among us. Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure at this time to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ), a gentleman who fits exactly that mold. The gentleman from Maine has come time and time again to this floor, to committees, every single opportunity he has, to build bipartisan support, to work together with his colleagues, to work not just on behalf of the citizens of Maine, but on behalf of all Americans. He really is a model for energy and partnership on something that everyone in this Chamber would agree on. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those kind words. I would agree with him, Maine is the greatest State in the Union. I know he didn’t say that, but I know he meant that. Mr. Speaker, Maine is the home of the most honest, hardest working people you can find anywhere in this country. We grew up in a very resilient, independent time in the State of Maine, and we cared for our neighbors and friends because it is compassionate to make sure you extend a helping hand. Mr. Speaker, my 90yearold mother was a terrific nurse. She had a career in nursing, caring for thousands of folks in nursing homes and hospitals throughout central Maine. My dad, who is now 88, was a beloved seventh grade social studies teacher and a coach and a basketball official for 30 years throughout the State. I was raised in a very bighearted FrancoAmerican family devoted to helping others, and that is why I work so hard to make sure government does the same thing. I have got some great news for folks across America who are looking to escape poverty and work their way up the ladder of independence. For 2 years, I have been pushing very hard to include job training, commonsense job training, community service, and work requirements for ablebodied adults with no disabilities themselves, no young kids at home, no elderly parents they are caring for, in order to receive food stamps. We have got to be compassionate, Mr. Speaker, to help folks escape poverty instead of being trapped in a government program that has no end to it. The role of government, Mr. Speaker, is not to keep folks trapped in poverty and help make them comfortable living in it, but to try to give them a helping hand so they can learn a job skill, get a job, and live better lives with more independence. Now, my work requirement, against what the media has reported and continues to report, has no cuts to food stamps by imposing these work requirements. If the benefits are not used because someone got a job, they are simply recycled back into job training. And if you are pregnant or caring for young kids or you have a disability yourself, again, you are exempt from these requirements. But if you are able to work, we need to be compassionate and require people to work to lift themselves out of poverty. Mr. Speaker, there is one other part of the farm bill that I am really proud of that is included in the bill, and that is one that helps rural Maine and rural America. For the first time, locally grown fruits and vegetables can now be frozen or dried or pureed in order to qualify for school lunches and school snacks. That means taxpayer dollars are able to buy foods that are just as nutritious as those that are fresh, save a lot of money, and make sure our kids can eat in a healthy way year round, and it also helps our local farmers. I have one son, Mr. Speaker, who is 27, and I raised him from the time he was in diapers. Nothing was more important than making sure he had nutritious food on the table to eat. This helps us do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage everybody to vote ‘‘yes’’ for this farm bill. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Maine coming here and giving a speech to the cameras, but I would suggest he read the bill. When he says that nobody will lose their benefits, no benefits will be cut from SNAP, he is wrong. The bottom line is that benefits will be cut. Benefits will be cut to support an underfunded, unproven, ridiculous excuse for a workforce and training program. I also should say I hope nobody wants to emulate the State of Maine when it comes to dealing with people who are struggling in poverty and who need food. I would instruct my colleagues to read an article that appeared in The Washington Post last year about what Maine’s harsh policies have resulted in. A veteran who served this country with distinction lost his job due to an injury and, because of Maine’s strict work requirements, was thrown off of his SNAP benefits, became homeless, and was skinning squirrels in order to be able to survive. That is not a compassionate policy that I think any State or, certainly, this country should want to reach toward. One of the things I am proud about the SNAP program is that it means that we recognize that we have an obligation to make sure that nobody in this country goes hungry. Why is that such a radical idea? Why has this program been so demonized? When the gentleman talks about a life of dependency, read the statistics from the USDA. The average time somebody is on SNAP is less than a year. That is not a life of dependency. I am not sure what he is talking about. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ). Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, the hypocrisy of this farm bill from President Donald Trump and the Republicans in this Congress means more subsidies for the rich and greater hunger for the poor. The food stamp program is one of the most important and successful antihunger programs in our Nation. Last year, it prevented 42.2 million people from going hungry, including 4.8 million seniors and 1.5 million lowincome military veterans. And yet my colleagues in the majority are seeking to undermine food stamps as they shield farm subsidies for the rich. When you take a look at the number of people who are the farm subsidy beneficiaries and the millions of people who are the SNAP beneficiaries, what you will see is that the SNAP beneficiaries get $1,115 per year, and the farm subsidy beneficiaries get almost $10,000 a year. Farms receive more than six times the benefit of a person receiving food stamps even though the vast majority of the farm bill beneficiaries are food stamp recipients. This farm bill would kick 2 million people off of food stamps, cutting benefits by more than $23 billion. Meanwhile, Republicans refuse to include limits on subsidies provided for crop insurance, one of the few Federal programs without any eligibility caps or payment limits. That is the untold story: who benefits. In the Republican tax scam for the rich, 83 percent of the benefits went to the top 1 percent. The Republican farm bill is rigged, as well, for the rich. Farm subsidies, which the CBO says will cost $12.6 billion more than planned, are so skewed toward the rich that the top 10 percent of farms, about 76,000 farms, received over 60 percent of all farm subsidies. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, SNAP recipients have income limits, asset limits. They get $1.40 per meal. Millionaires and billionaires who pocket farm subsidies do not. SNAP recipients have work requirements. Millionaires and billionaires who pocket farm subsidies do not, even though many of them do not work the land. Nearly 18,000 people in the 50 biggest cities received farm subsidies. They do not work the land. They do not till the soil. Where are their work requirements? In fact, 23 Republican Members of this Congress who vocally oppose SNAP have financial ties to farms that receive subsidies. They are poised to support this bill. They get theirs while the kids go hungry. The country needs to know this. In the land of food abundance, in the United States, no one should go hungry. The Republican farm bill is a massive giveaway to the rich, which will deny children in our country food. It is unspeakable. We need to eradicate hunger. We do not need to eradicate the antihunger programs. b1300 Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The farm bill is a little different this year than what we have seen in years past. We would ordinarily have more bipartisan support here on the floor. We got sideways on a couple of issues early on in the process, but the arguments that we are hearing aren’t different than the arguments we traditionally hear in a farm bill, as if we are pitting those families in need of food against those families who produce the food. We are not. This bill is H.R. 2 for a reason, Mr. Speaker. A lot of folks don’t understand how bill numbers get handed out in this institution. They get handed out by order of priority. H.R. 1 was the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That bill has brought unemployment down to the lowest levels in my lifetime and economic growth to the highest levels we have seen in decades. H.R. 2 is the farm bill, because if you want to know who benefits from American farm policy, it is anybody who eats—anybody who eats. I tell folks, Mr. Speaker, we don’t need to give every child a laptop. We need to send every child on a mission trip around the globe to see how other families live, to see how other countries do it. We are so blessed in this country, and we take it for granted oftentimes. For example, I can put up charts about the distribution of farm policy until the cows come home, but the largest 15 percent of farms in this country produce almost 90 percent of all the food. I will say that again. Those folks who are doing it bigger and better than anybody else, those 15 percent of farmers produce almost 90 percent of American food. And I will tell you something, Mr. Speaker, we can’t afford to lose those 15 percent of farmers. What keeps food in this country available and affordable is a consistent farm policy, which is why, time and time again, Republicans and Democrats come together from across rural America to try to provide certainty to American agriculture. It is the largest part of the Georgia economy, Mr. Speaker: agriculture. That is true of so many districts, so many States across this land. This ought to be a partnership. It is not today, and I regret that. We are going to have opportunities to make that change going forward, but just understand, for folks who are here seeing this debate for the very first time, go back and see the farm bill debate from 5 years ago. You will see the same accusations. You will see the same recriminations. You will see the same fear and scare tactics used. Then you will see a huge bipartisan vote because this bill is so important to so many Americans. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I include in the RECORD the article that I referred for you to read called ‘‘Trump to Poor Americans: Get to Work or Lose Your Benefits,’’ which talks about a veteran in Maine that basically was shut out of his food benefit because of Maine’s policies. 
[From the Washington Post, May 22, 2017] TRUMP TO POORAMERICANS : GETTOWORK OR  LOSEYOURBENEFITS  (By Caitlin Dewey and Tracy Jan) For a period last year after he lost his food stamps, Tim Keefe, an outofwork and homeless Navy veteran, used his military training to catch, skin and eat squirrels, roasting the animals over an open fire outside the tent he pitched in frigid Augusta, Maine. The new additions to Keefe’s diet resulted from a decision by state authorities to tighten work requirements for recipients of the social safety net—forcing the 49yearold, who lost his job at a farm equipment factory because of an injury, off the food stamp rolls. ‘‘I was eating what I could find, and borrowed from friends and strangers,’’ Keefe 
said in testimony to the Maine legislature. ‘‘There were many times . . . when I would go two or even three days without food. If one was inclined to lose a lot of weight, I could recommend this diet wholeheartedly.’’ Now the Trump administration in its first major budget proposal has proposed more stringent work requirements—similar to those in effect in Maine and other states—to limit eligibility for food stamps and a host of other benefits as part of sweeping cuts to antipoverty programs. The White House budget proposal, due to be unveiled on Tuesday, would reduce spending on antipoverty programs from food stamps to tax credits and welfare payments by $274 billion over a decade, largely by tightening eligibility for these programs, according to administration officials. With additional reforms on Medicaid and disability insurance, total safety net cuts would top $1 trillion over 10 in years. Making lowincome Americans work to qualify for socalled welfare programs is a key theme of the budget. ‘‘If you are on food stamps and you are able bodied, we need you to go to work,’’ said budget director Mick Mulvaney during a White House briefing on Monday. He said the strengthened requirements in the budget focuses on putting the 6.8 million unemployed or underemployed Americans back to work. ‘‘There is a dignity to work,’’ he said, ‘‘and there’s a necessity to work to help the country succeed.’’ The White House did not offer details Monday on how the work requirements would be implemented, other than saying it would be ‘‘phased in’’ for ablebodied adults without dependent children. The White House estimated the combined reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps, would generate nearly $193 billion in savings over a decade. In addition to SNAP reforms, Trump will propose taking the earned income and child tax credits away from undocumented immigrants working in the United States, many of whom pay taxes or have American born children. That reform alone would save $40 billion over a decade, according to the White House. Antipoverty advocates say the White House could implement its desired reforms to SNAP in two ways: require recipients to work more than the current minimum of 20 hours a week, or cut the unemployment waivers in areas with high joblessness rates. The influential Heritage Foundation, as well as a number of House conservatives have championed a crackdown on waivers, leading many antipoverty advocates to conclude that is the most likely way the White House would implement its proposed reforms. Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation who has asked the White House to prioritize work requirements, said the Trump administration needs to ‘‘go after’’ the four million ablebodied adults without dependents in the food stamp program. ‘‘You say to them, ‘We will give you assistance, but come to the office one day a week to do job search or community service,’’’ Rector said. ‘‘When Maine did that, they found almost immediately that their caseload dropped 85 percent.’’ Critics say such a change could endanger people like Keefe, a veteran who has been unable to find a job after injuring his wrist on the job at a plow factory in Rockland, Maine. As a result, Keefe now is medically unable to lift more than 25 pounds—which disqualifies him from other work in manufacturing. The Navy veteran was one of several thousand former food stamp recipients who lost benefits when Maine, in 2015, declined to renew its waiver and reinstated statewide work requirements. He has spent much of the last year living in a tent. ‘‘I don’t wanna worry no one,’’ said Keefe, who recently testified to Maine’s Committee on Health and Human Services about the impact the work requirement had on him. But, he added: ‘‘I hope they understand that people fall through the cracks.’’ The Trump administration is considering other changes to SNAP. While details remain sparse, Mulvaney said the federal government would be asking states to share in the costs for the food stamps program, through a phasedin ‘‘state match’’ so they have a ‘‘little more skin in the game.’’ ‘‘We believe in, the social safety net. We absolutely do,’’ Mulvaney said. ‘‘What we’ve done is not to try and remove the safety net for folks who need it, but to try and figure out if there’s folks who don’t need it that need to be back in the workforce.’’ Suspending employment waivers would hit hard in areas with high unemployment such as southern and central California, where the unemployment rate can spike as high as 19 percent, as well as cities such as Detroit and Scranton, Pa., where joblessness remains rampant. The change would also hit hard in large portions of New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Idaho and Michigan. ‘‘It’s unconscionable, cruel and ineffective,’’ said Josh Protas, the vice president of public policy at MAZON, a national anti hunger organization. ‘‘I’m honestly not sure what their goal is.’’ Critics say the changes in unemployment waivers would be devastating for Native American families living on reservations in North and South Dakota, Arizona and Montana where there is chronic poverty and high unemployment. ‘‘The President’s budget proposal will force kids in rural America to go hungry while wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on misplaced priorities like a wall that won’t keep us safe,’’ said Senator Jon Tester (D–MT), in a statement to the Post. ‘‘Parents in Montana and across Indian Country should not have to choose between food for their tables, gas for their cars, and shoes for their kids.’’ The number of Americans on SNAP remains high, however. In 2016, 44 million Americans receive the benefits, compared to just 28 million people in 2008. ‘‘They have not come down like we would expect them to do,’’ Mulvaney said. ‘‘That raises a very valid question: Are there folks on SNAP who shouldn’t be?’’ Antihunger advocates argue that, generally speaking, there are not. Because SNAP benefits decrease gradually with increased income, there is no incentive for people to avoid work to get benefits—a phenomenon economists call the ‘‘welfare cliff.’’ And benefits are too small for people to subsist on them without working: The average food stamp benefit was $465 a month for a family of four in 2015. Most people are on the program for between seven and nine months on average. ‘‘The notion that people would prefer not to work to get that benefit, give me a break,’’ said U.S. Representative Jim McGovern, (D–Mass.) a longtime antihunger advocate. ‘‘This is a lousy and rotten thing to do to poor people. They look at SNAP as an ATM to pay for their other priorities.’’ Additionally, three quarters of households using SNAP contain children, seniors, or people with disabilities, said Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute. Without SNAP, the country would have had 3 to 4.5 million more people in poverty during the recession, she said. More than a quarter of ablebodied adults without dependents on SNAP do not have a high school diploma, Waxman said; another 57 percent don’t have college degrees—putting them at a disadvantage when it comes to finding work. A number are also veterans, young adults aging out of the foster care system, and felons recently released from jail. SNAP recipients who cannot find work, for these or other reasons, are supposed to attend job training programs—but they’re not widely available because of lack of funding. ‘‘This is the trick. On the one hand, you want people to do something, when in fact a lot of folks may not realistically be able to find a job,’’ Waxman said. ‘‘Most states don’t want to put the money in. This is a dilemma that we’re in.’’ The evidence that stricter work requirements actually cause people to get jobs is mixed, at best. In Kansas, which reinstated the requirements in October 2014, 40 percent of unemployed adults were still unemployed a year after being kicked off SNAP. Among former SNAP participants who lost benefits, the average annual income was only $5,562, according to the Foundation for Government Accountability, a rightwing think tank based in Florida. Progress has also been hotly debated in Maine, a state that conservatives regularly hold up as evidence that stricter workrequirements are effective. When the state dropped its waiver in 2015, the number of unemployed adults in the program immediately fell by nearly 80 percent. But a May 2016 report by the state found that nearly 60 percent of those affected individuals did not report any income in the year after they left the program—suggesting they were still unemployed or underemployed a year later. On the national level, Michael Tanner, a senior fellow who focuses on social welfare issues at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said he doesn’t think similar mandates will have a huge impact on moving large numbers of recipients into employment or result in significant budget savings. Most SNAP recipients who can work are already working, and many of those who are not meet one of the various exemptions such as being disabled. ‘‘It’s making a statement that Republicans think people who are on public assistance should be doing all they can to get off,’’ Tanner said, ‘‘and that means working whenever possible.’’ McGovern, who sits on the House Agriculture Committee, said he was surprised to learn about the White House proposal given Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue’s testimony before the committee last week saying he did not favor any major changes to the food stamps program. ‘‘It’s been a very important, effective Program,’’ Perdue said, according to a recording of the hearing. ‘‘As far as I’m concerned we have no proposed changes. You don’t try to fix things that aren’t broken.’’ The Trump administration is advocating other ‘‘fixes’’ to the safety net, as well. The budget will also propose requiring people to have a Social Security number to collect tax credits. Mulvaney said it is unfair that taxpayers support immigrants working illegally in this country. ‘‘How do I go to somebody who pays their taxes and say, ’Look, I want you to give this earned income tax credit to somebody who is working here illegally? That’s not defensible,’’ Mulvaney said. Rector, of the Heritage Foundation, said he also hopes Trump will prioritize work requirements for those receiving housing subsidies. Mulvaney did not address that on Monday. 
Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said the majority of Americans receiving housing subsidies are elderly, disabled or already include someone who works. Of the remaining households, nearly half include a preschool child or an older child or adult with a disability who needs the supervision of a caregiver. Establishing work requirements for the remaining six percent of households who are ‘work able’ but not employed would require state and local housing agencies already facing funding shortfalls to establish cumbersome monitoring and enforcement systems for a very narrow segment of rental assistance recipients, she said. ‘‘This is neither cost effective nor a solution to the very real issue of poverty impacting millions of families living in subsidized housing or in need,’’ Yentel said in a statement to the Post. Correction: This story incorrectly stated the average annual income for SNAP participants in Kansas who had lost and then found jobs was $5,562. That figure applied to all SNAP participants who had lost the benefit. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia suggests that we all take a mission trip around the world to see hunger and see how lucky we are here in the United States. Let me tell the gentleman, you don’t have to go halfway around the world to see hunger. I can take you halfway down the block, and you can see hunger right here in our Nation’s capital and in every congressional district in this country. There are over 41 million Americans who are hungry or foodinsecure in this country. We are the richest country in the history of the world. We all should be ashamed. We ought to do something about it, and this farm bill makes hunger worse. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ), a distinguished member of the Agriculture Committee. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I would posit to my colleague across the aisle who said that we are trying to pit farm producers against food recipients, I believe that it is this bill that has done that. We have worked in a bipartisan manner for, I understand, years before this bill was put through without being discussed, without the hearings on both sides of the aisle. I try to think about what it would have meant to impose the massive system of new SNAP requirements under the bill during the time immediately after the islands were hit by two Category 5 hurricanes. How would families submit their monthly paperwork? How would they go to jobs at businesses that were shut down? How would job slots be provided when localities must focus on providing receipts? There is no accommodation for disasterimpacted areas in this bill. And if the majority did not think to exempt out these communities, what else was overlooked in terms of reasonable standards? Unfortunately, we didn’t have the opportunity to work with the majority to get answers to such key questions before this bill was unveiled and rushed to the floor. This doesn’t add any help to farmers facing recordlow income and commodity prices or hardships due to trade retaliation, as my colleague from Illinois discussed earlier. It does not support farmer mental health, appropriate funding for broadband, or tackling the opioid epidemic. This bill cuts hundreds of millions out of rural development and energy initiatives and falls short on assisting beginning, underserved, and veteran farmers. Why? Because it is not a bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My colleague has gone through some really challenging times in her community, and this Chamber has stood with her in those times. She has been a great advocate for her community in the face of some really extraordinary disasters. We can make accusations on this floor all we like, but we could also spend some time bragging about those things that bring us together. There are already disaster provisions in law— disaster provisions that provide specifically disaster SNAP, for example, when communities are so hardhit. We do have these conversations, we do have these concerns for one another and our communities, and we do work together to address those concerns. We are not always successful, Mr. Speaker, but I promise you we are less successful when we don’t work together than when we do. My understanding—I don’t sit on the Agriculture Committee, but my friends across the aisle do—is that not a single Democratic amendment was offered in committee. It is my understanding—and, again, I don’t sit on the committee. I don’t mind being corrected. I won’t be embarrassed at all to have the RECORD  corrected. But my understanding is there were 5 hours of markup in the Agriculture Committee, and not one idea for improving the bill was offered. Now, that is a legitimate, strategic position to take if folks want to take it, Mr. Speaker. I just don’t understand it as someone who wants to get the job done and make a difference in a collaborative way on behalf of the American people. This bill is getting better every single day. It has gotten better through every conversation. As you heard my friend from Washington say in his opening statement, so many farmers with realworld experience—we heard yesterday from Members who have realworld labor and workforce development experience. This bill is getting better every time. If we support the rule that we are discussing at this time, Mr. Speaker, it will make 31 additional amendments in order so that we can improve the bill even further. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am just trying to think of a response to the gentleman from Georgia, who is trying to defend the process in the Agriculture Committee as that somehow, with this bipartisan process, Democrats didn’t want to participate. But you know what? It is just not worth it. We have been explaining it over and over and over again. This process is indefensible. It really makes a mockery of the Agriculture Committee, and it makes a mockery of this institution. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ). Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I have not had the privilege to serve on the Agriculture Committee, but, given the comments of the gentleman there, I would suggest as an amendment that, since this bill is about work, we have work for 12yearolds. Maybe boys could be shoeshine boys and the girls could be shampoo girls at the beauty salon so that they can help subsidize families. In fact, Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying that is appropriate for this discussion: ‘‘If you aren’t at the table, you are on the menu.’’ And children are definitely on the menu and at the tender mercies of the job market. This bill will cut access not only for SNAP but kids who go to school every day. This means in my State there will be 23,000 kids who will not get school lunch and breakfast because of this bill. I am going to turn in, Mr. Speaker, some of the stories of people in my district who need SNAP, real people, single people like Jana, who has worked on a job for 11 years, lost her job, and has been looking for work for 3 months and couldn’t find it. I would ask that we reject this bill for people who need SNAP to survive. This bill is not about work. It is about taking food out of the mouths of babes. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, can I inquire of the gentleman from Georgia: Do you have any speakers over there or anybody who wants to talk about this bill? Because we have a ton, and we just want to—— Mr. WOODALL. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. MCGOVERN. It is an inquiry. I don’t want to take it on my time. Mr. WOODALL. I would be happy to answer the inquiry, or we could just leave it as an inquiry. Mr. MCGOVERN. As long as it doesn’t come out of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. MCGOVERN. I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Georgia, but it is not coming out of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, we do have additional speakers remaining, and, of course, if we make this rule in 
order, if we pass this rule, we will have 31 different amendments and speakers coming down on each one of those as well. Mr. MCGOVERN. Reclaiming my time, I am just taking note of all of the excitement on your side of the aisle on this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PINGREE ). Ms. PINGREE of Maine. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague Mr. MCGOVERN  for yielding me the time and doing such a wonderful job on a very challenging bill. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to the current version of the farm bill. There are many reasons why—among them, the unrealistic challenges to food assistance programs that will have a big negative impact on my State in Maine. What I want to focus on in my limited time is how much this legislation does a disservice to the farmers in rural communities we represent. The public is very clear. They want greater access to healthy, locally grown food. They want more of it grown organically, and they want to support local farmers in rural economies. But Federal policy is way behind the times, and this legislation would make it much worse. Farmers aren’t ignoring the trends that consumers are asking us for. They are capitalizing on them. In my State, the changing market and the demand for locally grown and organic food has reinvigorated the State’s agriculture economy. Josh Girard, who is pictured here, is one of those farmers. After earning a master’s degree, working abroad in the Peace Corps, and apprenticing at local farms, Josh decided to return to his hometown to start his own farm. The small sources of Federal support available to farmers like Josh pale in comparison to what commodity farmers receive, but it can make all of the difference. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POLIQUIN ). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Maine. Ms. PINGREE. For instance, Josh uses the Organic Certification Cost Share Programs to help cover the cost of certification, which helps him get more for his product. The funding for this and many other programs is endangered in this farm bill. Over the next 5 years, consumers will continue to change their buying habits in our food system. The question is whether the Federal Government would make good policy to help farmers like Josh. Ask anyone in this Chamber if they support rural America, and they will say, yes, absolutely. So I ask that we put our money where our mouths are. We should send the message to those keeping our farming communities alive that we believe in their potential, we value their service, and we will help them succeed by voting down this terribly partisan legislation and start over on making a good bill. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE ) talked about how we are literally taking the food away from children. I want to make it clear to my colleagues, there should be no mistake: This bill is going to hurt kids. First, it cuts 1 million people off of benefits through categorical eligibility challenges alone. These people are working families with kids. And once these kids lose their SNAP benefits, CBO, the nonpartisan group of experts that we rely on, expects 265,000 children will lose access to free school meals. I ask my colleagues: Is that what you want out of a farm bill? We can do so much better. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Georgia is a rural State, like so many jurisdictions represented in this Chamber. Sometimes you have a big city in one part of the State and the rest of the State is rural. The conversations we have in Georgia are often not Republicans against Democrats politically; it is Atlanta against the rest of the State politically. Folks often don’t connect the dots between the food that they are buying on the shelf at Kroger being directly related to whether or not farmers are producing that food in the field. We have made huge strides in terms of trying to bring more fresh produce not just into our school systems but into our local farmers markets, huge strides into making sure that electronic benefits aren’t just able to be used at the local convenience store but are able to be used in farmers markets so that higher quality produce can end up on families’ tables. b1315 Again, Mr. Speaker, we can find disagreement in every bill that comes to the floor, but we can also find progress. There is a lot of progress in this bill. We will support this rule, we will get to the underlying bill, and we will spend the rest of the day discussing exactly that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS). Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in opposition to this rule and the underlying bill which, much like the Republicans’ tax measure, comforts the comfortable and afflicts the afflicted. It will have devastating impacts on SNAP recipients across the Nation, including one in seven in Nevada who are on this program. It will take away food assistance from some of our most vulnerable: young children, seniors, and the disabled. It will also force families to jump through extra hoops in order to access other needed benefits like assistance with their electricity bills. We can and should be doing more to lift families out of poverty and end hunger in the United States. Shamefully, this bill does just the opposite. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL ). Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to this cruel and meanspirited farm bill, a farm bill that will leave working families and our children out in the cold. The farm bill we are debating today cuts $23 billion from SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. That would leave 2 million Americans without the support that they need to put food on the table. Mr. Speaker, I represent both rural and urban, from Birmingham to the Black Belt of Alabama, and I can say definitely that every community in my district will be worse off under this bill. For children and working families in my district, SNAP means the difference between a hot meal or going to bed hungry. For farmers and grocery stores in my district, SNAP is an investment in our food system that creates 50,000 agricultural jobs across the country. After the Republicans have shoved down a tax bill that gives the cuts to the wealthiest Americans and adds $2 trillion to our deficit, they now want to cut the benefits for hungry children and working families. I believe this is morally wrong. You see, Mr. Speaker, the face of SNAP in my district is not the welfare mother trying to get over. No. The face of SNAP in my district—where 70 percent of the people who are beneficiaries in my district are children under the age of 17 years old—the face of SNAP in America are needy children. We must and can do better. I am going to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we feel very passionately about issues on this floor. I want to give my colleague from Alabama an opportunity to retract the accusation that this is a meanspirited and cruel bill. I know the men and women who serve on the Agriculture Committee, and they don’t have a meanspirited or cruel bone in their body. They care about farmers, and they care about families. We can argue about whether or not if you are a working aged, ablebodied, childless man in this country whether or not we ought to try to get you a job while you are collecting Federal benefits. We can talk about that. I don’t 
think that is meanspirited at all. I don’t think that is cruel at all. I think that is exactly what we ought to be doing to lift families up out of poverty. But I would say to my colleagues with their passion—which I know is heartfelt—feeding hungry children is a shared priority, and we see that every single day in the bills that are passed here; and we do damage to this institution and we do damage to the very honest and needed debates we have in this Chamber when we characterize one another in ways that we know are not accurate. I know the men and women on the Agriculture Committee. I know why they chose to serve on that committee. I believe in the work they are doing. I regret that we are having this disagreement today, but we don’t need to question each other’s motives or integrity in order to make this debate of value. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KIND). Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. I rise in opposition to the rule and to the underlying bill because it is a missed opportunity. I had offered numerous, fiscally responsible reform amendments to improve the bill, all of which were rejected last night. For instance, why is a farm entity with an adjusted gross income of over $500,000 a year still receiving taxpayer subsidies under this bill? Why can’t we at least track the crop insurance premium subsidy payments to the individual entities? Right now, that is currently prohibited under the bill. That is not right. The American taxpayer deserves to see how their tax dollars are being run. Why are we eliminating the entire Conservation Stewardship Program when three out of every four farmers applying for conservation funding assistance today are denied because of inadequacy of funds? This farm bill should be about helping our family farmers succeed, not a sop to powerful special interests here in Washington. That is why this is a missed opportunity. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ), who is one of my classmates in the class of 2011. We were once Budget Committee mates together back in the day. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of the 2018 farm bill. Missouri farmers work hard every day to feed the world, and they need the certainty that this legislation provides. This bill strengthens safeguards for our food supply and improves publicprivate risk management programs that are vital to American agriculture. In addition, the farm bill makes significant investments in broadband infrastructure in rural America by setting a minimum speed for Federal investment. This bill contains historic improvements to SNAP which helps recipients break the cycle of poverty by improving work opportunities for ablebodied adults receiving Federal nutrition assistance. This bill also promotes work and individual success while empowering those dependent on government assistance. These reforms will reduce unemployment and instill a sense of pride and work ethic by helping people move from dependency to independence and selfsufficiency. These are commonsense improvements that we are discussing today. The 2018 farm bill is a responsible and effective piece of legislation which maintains safety net programs in crop insurance for America’s farmers while making investments in job training programs to lift those in need out of poverty. This bill has my full support, and I thank and commend Chairman CONAWAY for his hard work on moving this legislation forward. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ). Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I am here to speak against an amendment included in this rule, the FoxxDavis amendment, in defense of the 2,300 factory workers and 900 family farmers who grow sugar beets in my community. The sugar program in this country supports family farmers. The company that is formed is a coop formed by local familyowned growers who come together, and all they ask for is a fair chance to compete, to grow their high quality product, and to not have to compete with statesubsidized foreign sugar that is dumped if we don’t have a program that protects our local growers. The question is really simple. It comes down to marginally increasing the profits of large corporations or supporting family farmers who support their families by growing high quality sugar beets and sugarcane in this country. This is a program that does not cost the taxpayers a dime according to CBO. It comes down to a simple question: Are we going to support our own growers, or are we going to support foreign produced sugar and moderately, if at all, increase the profits of large companies? Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan. He actually spent a good deal of his time just the other day in a Budget Committee hearing trying to help get us some bipartisan solutions. He got grilled by both the Republicans and the Democrats. Everybody wanted their ounce of Michigan flesh in that day. But at the end of that conversation—and I don’t say this flippantly—I felt more optimistic about our coming together and doing some very difficult infrastructure investments in this country than I did when I walked into that room. Those things don’t happen without people investing the kind of time and energy that Representative KILDEE has invested over his career. I want to tell the gentleman how much I appreciate that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman how many more speakers he has remaining. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would advise my friend I am prepared to close when he is. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I have to give credit where credit is due. This majority can’t balance a budget; they can’t even pass a budget. They can’t fund the government without first shutting it down. They are so busy cozying up to the big banks and passing tax cuts for the wealthy that they ignore virtually every major issue facing our Nation. Right now as we speak, this Republican majority is trying to jam through a farm bill that won’t even help most farmers. But the one thing this Republican majority is incredibly good at, and the one thing that they do with ruthless efficiency is stick it to poor people. This majority is Robin Hood in reverse. They are master legislators for the megawealthy. They might want this Chamber to look out solely for those at the top, giving them more tax breaks, making it easier for them to pollute our planet and systematically attacking the safeguards we put in place to stop another financial collapse, but while they work with unflagging, unshakeable, and dogged determination to give a helping hand to the fat cats, they tell those struggling to get by and those begging for an opportunity and a living wage that they should just work harder. Never mind that they didn’t grow up in nice neighborhoods or in a stable home with good nutrition and a quality education. Maybe they started out in life having to play catchup. Maybe they need just a little help from the Government to make the American Dream a reality in their life. Or maybe they were born with advantages but have fallen on hard times and they need a little bit of help. I am standing here today—Democrats are standing here today—giving a voice to our workers, the middle class, and those trying to break into the middle class. If my Republican friends actually listened to their voices, they would join us and vote against this monstrosity of a bill that attacks working American citizens and takes lunch money away from children. It is disgusting, Mr. Speaker. Now, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question and the rule, and I urge all of you—no, I plead with all of you— to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
I grew up in a family where helping those who were struggling was the right thing to do, the decent thing to do. Please send this bill back to committee. Surely we can do better. Let’s demonstrate to the American people that we are here to help, that we care, and that we are decent. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia commented that we are all so emotional on this side of the aisle when we are debating this issue. You are damn right we are. We are emotional. We are angry. We are frustrated because people are going to be hurt. Mr. Speaker, if you have ever met a hungry child, it should break your heart, and there are millions and millions in this country who are hungry. We are the greatest country in the history of the world and the richest country in the history of the world, and tens of millions of our fellow citizens are food insecure or hungry. Why isn’t that a priority? Why isn’t that a bigger priority than another tax cut for a big corporation? I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle deep down inside care about those who suffer in this country. Here is an opportunity to prove it. Let’s do a farm bill that actually doesn’t make hunger worse in this country. Mr. Speaker, I am not even asking you to eliminate hunger, although I wish that were a priority. I am just saying: don’t make it worse. This bill will throw millions of people off of a food benefit, and millions of children will be impacted. Mr. Speaker, they are not just people who aren’t working. You know better than that. Many of these people are working families, people who are working hard but can’t make ends meet. You are taking away a food benefit. What is wrong with this institution? We can do better. Mr. Speaker, vote ‘‘no’’ on this rule, and vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1330 Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 3
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friends on the Agriculture Committee for the work they did on this bill. It is not easy to do big pieces of legislation. We do a farm bill every 5 years. It is always a hard thing to do, and my friends on the Agriculture Committee have taken the slings and arrows. You have heard the accusations that have been made just here on the floor today. The unemployment rate in this country, Mr. Speaker, is as low as it has ever been in my lifetime, and the number of childless, workingage men who are sitting it out is as high as it has ever been in my lifetime. We can argue about how to care about people more, we can argue about how to love people more, but I will tell you, helping someone to find a job matters. Historically, Mr. Speaker, it is one of those things we agree on. For whatever reason, we have made it the topic of something we are going to pretend to disagree on today. There are more jobs available in this country than ever before. I think we owe it to families that haven’t been able to connect themselves with that job market to help them to do better. Mr. Speaker, so often, we talk about all the lawyers in Congress, all the lawyers who are bureaucrats, all the folks who are working on policy that they just don’t understand. I want to close with where my colleague from Washington State began. Of course, he is a former agriculture commissioner from Washington State. He said this. He said he is not the only farmer in this House. There are 20 farmers, ranchers, and producers serving here in the people’s House: an almond farmer from central California, a blueberry farmer from Maine, a rancher from South Dakota, a cattleman from Kentucky, a rice farmer from Minnesota, and a hops farmer from the Yakima Valley in Washington State. Mr. Speaker, this body really does reflect working Americans, folks out there trying to be the breadbasket to the world, trying to put fresh produce on the shelves for every American family to benefit from. This bill continues our commitment to serving the hungry, and it continues our commitment to being the finest agricultural production nation that this planet has ever seen. Vote ‘‘yes’’ on this rule. Let’s consider some amendments to make this bill even better, and then let’s send it to the Senate and give the American people a bill they can be proud of. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule governing debate, and the underlying bill, regarding H.R.2, the socalled ‘‘Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018,’’ the House Republicans’ failed attempt to produce a Farm Bill that is good for America. A more fitting name for this terrible and bitter legislative pill would be the ‘‘Let Poor Families and Children Starve so Billionaires Can Get Fatter Act.’’ Going back to 1962, beginning with Senators Hubert Humphrey, Bob Dole, and George McGovern, Farm Bills have always attracted bipartisan support and engendered an enduring alliance between urban and rural legislators in the common cause of ensuring livable incomes for farm families and an affordable and nutritious food supply. With this purely partisan bill, House Republicans have turned their back on this 56 year heritage. Mr. Speaker, St. Augustine, the great Catholic theologian, said: ‘‘Without justice, what else is the state but a gang of robbers?’’ There is no justice in this Farm Bill, but there is harm—lots of it—inflicted on the most vulnerable, so much so that many people are saying that the House Republican majority has produced a bill that is worthy of a gang of robbers. I oppose this rule and underlying legislation for several reasons but most of all because of its abject cruelty to American’s most vulnerable families and children. H.R. 2 slashes $23 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (‘‘SNAP’’), a lifeline depended upon by millions of families and children to provide for their daily nutrition needs. But who among us can say they are truly surprised? Since taking office sixteen months ago, the President has made abundantly clear his indifference to the most vulnerable citizens in society. And he has been aided in his endeavors by a feckless House Republican majority. The President began his presidency with a concerted and determined push to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a law which has helped over 17 million individuals gain health insurance; reduced the uninsured rate by 40 percent and, provided 89 percent of Americans with the security and peace of mind that comes with access to affordable quality healthcare. When that effort failed, the President next turned his efforts to passing the massive TrumpGOP Tax Scam, which slashed taxes for the top one percent and multinational corporations, but the negative consequences of which the TrumpGOP Tax Scam have been devastating for the average American. The GOP Tax Scam has now been revealed not to generate broadbased economic growth but instead to create annual trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see. Mr. Speaker, if we are to be honest about creating an environment where individuals have an opportunity to emerge from poverty conditions, there must be access to nutritious food. SNAP is a critical component to providing food security to lowerincome Americans. SNAP sets children up for success. Children on SNAP achieve higher test scores and are more likely to graduate from high school, helping to break the cycle of poverty and build a stronger economy in the long term. SNAP is temporary. The average family spends just ten months on SNAP, receiving assistance only during difficult times. (SNAP is critical for poor and working families. Most participate in SNAP when they are between jobs. Among households with at least one workingage nondisabled adult roughly 8o percent of SNAP households work in the year before or the year after receiving SNAP. Close to twothirds of SNAP recipients are children, elderly, or disabled. The vast majority of those who are required to work, do work. The average per person benefit is $132 per month, or about$1.60 per meal. Mr. Speaker, if this bill were to become law, it would cut $23 billion from SNAP and would kick one million households off the program. That means 83,000 Texas families would see their benefits cut, impacting more than 96,000 individuals. In Texas, over half of all SNAP beneficiaries live below the poverty line so cutting access to SNAP would be devastating. Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that we not increase food security for the least vulnerable among us. 
If our children are not adequately and safely housed, they are not protected from life’s crueler elements. If they are not fed, they lack nourishment and preparation for school and all its challenges. Mothers know this and their children know this. Everyone knows this, with the apparent exception of the President and House Republicans. The House Republicans’ eagerness to sacrifice poor and working families and children by cutting SNAP and other food assistance programs for up to 23 million people by $23 billion is an accurate reflection of their priorities and values, which favor tax cuts for multinational corporation and the top 1 percent at the expense of the poor and working class and those striving to enter the middle class. Mr. Speaker, there are other major insults, injuries, and cruelties inflicted on working families by this callous legislation. This socalled Farm Bill changes SNAP from a food program to a work program by imposing new draconian work requirements on adult SNAP participants between 18 and 59 years old, requiring documentation showing 20 hours per week of work or participation in a job training program. The changes include severe, harsh penalties if the paperwork is not filed on time, ignoring the reality of lowwage work, which is plagued by unstable, uncertain work schedules, unpredictable hours, and few benefits like paid sick or family leave. This meanspirited legislation threatens free school meals for 265,000 children and SNAP eligibility for 400,000 households by eliminating BroadBased Categorical Eligibility (BBCE), which allows states flexibility to link their social service programs to SNAP. The bill also severs the connection between SNAP and Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps families pay their energy utilities, adversely impacting working families and people with disabilities. Mr. Speaker, this wretched legislation is an equalopportunity catastrophe because it also inflicts serious damage on farm families and rural America at a time of great challenge and economic uncertainty. Farm prices are plummeting amid the self inflicted damage of President Trump’s tariffs yet this bill instead of providing relief exacerbates the economic and social pain in rural America by killing goodpaying rural jobs, cutting a gaping hole in the critical farmer safety net and shifting opportunity away from America’s small towns with cuts to vital rural development, sustainable conservation, and energy initiatives. Inexplicably, H.R. 2 fails to address the 52 percent decline in farm income and eliminates the Conservation Stewardship Program, the nation’s largest working lands conservation program, by merging it with the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, resulting in $800 million less for investments in preserving working lands and sustainable farm practices. The legislation hurts rural families in several additional ways by: Failing to increase funding for USDA’s trade assistance programs that help farmers stay globally competitive through initiatives that help to develop and expand their business in overseas markets; Abolishing the entire Energy Title, resulting in lost investments in jobs of the future in renewable energy and biofuels; Adding onerous fees to rural development guaranteed loans; Curtailing broadband assistance in remote areas by adding administrative burdens and fails to boost USDA’s telemedicine initiatives that help combat opioid abuse in rural America; Underfunding the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program, which provides funding to organizations that educate, mentor and provide technical assistance for new and veteran farmers; and Betraying the next generation of farm and food leaders by failing to provide mandatory funding for scholarships at 1890 land grant institutions. This socalled Farm Bill is so bad in so many ways to so many people that it is little wonder that it is strongly opposed by leading organizations and associations from all sides of the political spectrum, including: National Farmers Union, National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, Environmental Working Group, National Young Farmers Coalition, Union of Concerned Scientists, Agriculture Energy Coalition, American Biogas Association, Institute for Agriculture & Trade Policy, AARP, American Academy of Pediatrics, AFSCME, Alliance for Retired Americans, American Psychological Association, Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), Child Care Aware of America, Child Welfare League of America, Children’s Defense Fund, Coalition on Human Needs, Every Child Matters, Families USA, Feeding America, First Focus Campaign for Children, Food Research & Action Center, Hispanic Federation, Lutheran Services in America, MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger, Meals on Wheels America, MomsRising, NAACP, National Consumers League, National Council on Aging, National Employment Law Project, National PTA, National Urban League, National Women’s Law Center, NOW, Partnership for America’s Children, Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, SEIU, Share Our Strength, UnidosUS, YWCA USA, Heritage Foundation, R Street Institute, and Taxpayers for Common Sense. I urge all Members to join me in voting to reject the rule and this cruel, heartless legislation. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
AN AMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 900 OFFERED BY  MR. MCGOVERN  On p. 2, line 2, insert ‘‘The amendment specified in section 2 of this resolution shall be considered as adopted in the House and in the Committee of the Whole.’’ after ‘‘purposes.’’ At the end of the resolution, add the following new section: ‘‘SEC. 2. The amendment referred to in the first section of this resolution is as follows: ‘Add at the end the following: Subtitle H Protections From Retaliatory Tariffs 
This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not take effect until the President transmits a certification to Congress that the following Administration efforts will not result in adverse trade or tariff impacts against U.S. farmers, ranchers, and other agriculture producers: (1) the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement; (2) the application of tariffs and/or quotas on steel and aluminum imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962; (3) any enforcement action taken pursuant to the investigation into China’s acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974; and (4) the application of global safeguard tariffs on imports of large residential washing machines and solar cells and modules under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974.’’ THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT 
ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools 
for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

Page 487, after line 4, insert the following: (d) STEWARDSHIP PROJECT RECEIPTS .—Sec tion 604(e) of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6591c(e)) is amended— (1) in paragraph (2)(B), by inserting ‘‘subject to paragraph (3)(A),’’ before ‘‘shall’’; and (2) in paragraph (3)(A), by striking ‘‘services received by the Chief or the Director’’ and all that follows through the period at the end and inserting the following: ‘‘services and inkind resources received by the Chief or the Director under a stewardship contract project conducted under this section shall not be considered monies received from the National Forest System or the public lands, but any payments made by the contractor to the Chief or Director under the project shall be considered monies received from the National Forest System or the public lands.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. HERRERA  BEUTLER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington. Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman CONAWAY for the opportunity to speak on this important amendment that I am offering to the farm bill today. I also want to thank my colleague, Congressman WESTERMAN , for his tireless work on behalf of our rural communities that are dependent on timber. Mr. Chairman, the key takeaway here is simple: If moneys are generated during restorative work in our forests, then a portion of those moneys generated from that work ought to remain in the community. 
Traditional timber sales require that a quarter of the revenues stay in the local county. But when the U.S. Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management use what is called stewardship contracts to work in the forests, none of those proceeds remain locally. Our forested counties are facing a financial crisis right now. Federal endangered species listings have left timberdependent counties in southwest Washington with little to no revenue from timber sales. In counties that are primarily federally owned, like Skamania County in my district, which is 97percent owned by the government, they are unable to make up these drastically reduced revenues from property taxes. This means that, by no fault of their own, they lack the local tax base to support even the most basic needs of their local communities, like schools or roads or local fire and police. To help make up some of that revenue, Congress created the Secure Rural Schools program in 2000. Unfortunately, despite my and my colleagues’ persistent effort to find a long term solution through SRS, we cannot keep relying on the Federal Government’s shortterm fixes. That is not doing right by these communities. This commonsense amendment will empower desperately needed funds to stay in local communities. Individuals and families should not be victim to Federal dysfunction. Let’s not allow a Federal contracting program for timber harvest and forest restoration to leave those neighboring communities emptyhanded. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment to ensure that a portion of the proceeds from these contracts are being rightfully directed to timber counties. Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this important amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. WESTERMAN ). Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I commend the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER ) for her leadership on this issue. Mr. Chairman, the amendment that is at the desk directs a portion of revenue from stewardship contracting toward individual counties for further investment in roads, schools, and the like. This amendment has no effect on in kind contributions or exchanges of timber for goods or services provided. This amendment only affects the rare instance where stewardship contracts are exchanged for cash. Per the 1908 Forest Service revenue sharing law, counties are entitled to 25 percent of all timber receipts sold from Federal lands within their borders. This amendment simply ensures that if it looks like a timber sale, where timber is exchanged for cash, counties receive the same share they would if the Forest Service had sold the timber outright. The argument that this amendment siphons off money from the Forest Service is false. This amendment does not affect or reduce the reinvestment from inkind contributions. Furthermore, little investment can be made in our Nation’s forest at all if there are no local communities to cultivate the investment. This amendment ensures that counties can continue to invest in their forests and their children’s future, both by protecting the good work of stewardship contracting and by ensuring that our rural counties get their fair share. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support a fair share for rural communities. Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 11 OFFERED BY MR . GOSAR  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in part C of House Report 115–677. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Strike section 8331 and insert the following new section: 
Section 8206 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (16 U.S.C. 2113a) is amended— (1) in subsection (a)— (A) in paragraph (1)(B), by striking ‘‘Secretary or a Governor’’ and inserting ‘‘Secretary, Governor, county, or Indian Tribe’’; (B) in paragraph (4) by striking ‘‘Secretary and a Governor’’ and inserting ‘‘Secretary and a Governor, county, or an Indian Tribe’’; (C) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(10) INDIAN TRIBE .—The term ‘Indian Tribe’ has the meaning given the term in section 4 of the Indian SelfDetermination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304)). ‘‘(11) COUNTY .— The term ‘county’ has the meaning given the term in section 2 of title 1, United States Code.’’; and (2) in subsection (b)— (A) in paragraph (1)(A), by inserting ‘‘, county, or an Indian Tribe’’ after ‘‘Governor’’; and (B) in paragraph (3), by inserting ‘‘, county, or an Indian Tribe’’ after ‘‘Governor’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment that will empower local communities by allowing counties to be included in Good Neighbor Authority cooperative agreements and contracts in order to improve forest health and bolster watershed restoration. The base farm bill reauthorizes Good Neighbor Authority through fiscal year 2023 and contains a provision that allows tribal governments to be eligible to enter into Good Neighbor Authority cooperative agreements and contracts. Our amendment simply builds on that commonsense provision by also authorizing counties to be eligible for Good Neighbor Authority. Good Neighbor Authority projects have been remarkably successful. From 2002 to 2013, 63 projects treated more than 4,100 acres in Colorado and Utah. These worthwhile treatments mitigated the threat of catastrophic wildfire, reduced flooding, enhanced forest health, and improved water quality. Counties on both sides of the aisle requested this amendment and new authority. The problem in Coconino County, a liberal county represented by my colleague Mr. O’HALLERAN , is that the wood is lowvalue timber, so they can’t attract private industry to thin their forest for pending work they need completed. Counties want to do this type of work themselves or find a contractor if the Federal Government won’t treat their forests. All that is missing is the authorization from Congress. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources is already entering into cooperative agreements with counties to partner in the management of Wisconsin County Forests, and it is working for them as well. Some counties have actual foresters or other land management professionals on staff. These are not limited specifically to large counties either. For example, Adams County, Idaho, population of 4,000, has a natural resources committee that is chaired by a retired Forest Service employee who also serves on the local forest collaborative. Coconino County has a forest restoration director who would be in charge of these county Good Neighbor Authority agreements. This is a directorlevel executive position that reports directly to the deputy county manager. While some counties will likely contract with outside entities to perform the work, county contracts will be overseen by someone such as an auditor or a clerk. The National Association of Counties supports this amendment, stating, ‘‘NACo stands ready to work with you to promote locally supported, consensusdriven solutions to address forest management challenges and reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire. NACo encourages the United States House of Representatives to adopt your amendment to H.R. 2 and give counties the opportunity to assist our Federal partners to make our national forests healthy again.’’ In addition to NACo, I am also honored to have the support of the National Water Resources Association, the Arizona Association of Conservation Districts, the Salt River Project, the Colorado Pork Producers Council, 
and more than 20 other local and national organizations and elected officials. I urge all of my colleagues in the House to support this commonsense amendment that will empower bipartisan communities throughout the country, improve forest health, and bolster watershed restoration. Again, this is an authorization, not a requirement. It puts more power into the hands of local communities who need the work done but have nowhere to turn under the status quo. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ), my good friend and colleague, who is a cosponsor of this amendment. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment I cosponsored with Representative GOSAR that will expand the Good Neighbor Authority for counties. Good Neighbor Authority allows the Forest Service to enter into cooperative agreements and contracts with States and Puerto Rico to execute projects that perform watershed restoration and forest management services on National Forest System lands. The current text of the farm bill includes language to expand the Good Neighbor Authority to include Indian Tribes. This simple amendment seeks to build on that commonsense provision by empowering local communities and allowing the Forest Service to include counties as partners to these agreements. b1430 Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his comments. Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ). Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. GOSAR for offering this commonsense amendment. Good Neighbor Authority was one of the hardfought achievements in the 2014 farm bill that has proven useful in improving our national forests and our rural communities. I was pleased to expand the Good Neighbor Authority to Indian Tribes in the base text of this bill, and I am happy that my colleague continues to improve the forestry title with this amendment authorizing counties to be eligible. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 12 OFFERED BY MR . GIANFORTE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in part C of House Report 115–677. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of part III of subtitle C of title VIII, insert the following: 
SEC. 83ll. SALVAGE AND REFORESTATION IN RESPONSE TO CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. 
(a) E XPEDITED SALVAGE OPERATIONS AND  REFORESTATION ACTIVITIES FOLLOWING  LARGE SCALE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS .— (1) EXPEDITED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESS MENT .—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an environmental assessment prepared by the Secretary concerned pursuant to section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332) for a salvage operation or reforestation activity proposed to be conducted on National Forest System lands or public lands adversely impacted by a largescale catastrophic event shall be completed within 60 days after the conclusion of the catastrophic event. (2) EXPEDITED IMPLEMENTATION AND COM PLETION .—In the case of reforestation activities conducted on National Forest System lands or public lands adversely impacted by a largescale catastrophic event, the Secretary concerned shall, to the maximum extent practicable, achieve reforestation of at least 75 percent of the impacted lands during the 5year period following the conclusion of the catastrophic event. (3) AVAILABILITY OF KNUTSON VANDENBERG  
FUNDS .—Amounts in the special fund established pursuant to section 3 of the Act of June 9, 1930 (commonly known as the KnutsonVandenberg Act; 16 U.S.C. 576b) shall be available to the Secretary of Agriculture for reforestation activities authorized by this section. (4) TIMELINE FOR PUBLIC INPUT PROCESS .— Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case of a salvage operation or reforestation activity proposed to be conducted on National Forest System lands or public lands adversely impacted by a largescale catastrophic event, the Secretary concerned shall allow 30 days for public scoping and comment, 15 days for filing an objection, and 15 days for the agency response to the filing of an objection. Upon completion of this process and expiration of the period specified in paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned shall implement the project immediately. (b) COMPLIANCE WITHFOREST PLAN.—A sal vage operation or reforestation activity authorized by this section shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the forest plan applicable to the National Forest System lands or public lands covered by the salvage operation or reforestation activity. (c) PROHIBITION ON RESTRAINING ORDERS , PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS , AND INJUNCTIONS  PENDING APPEAL .—No restraining order, preliminary injunction, or injunction pending appeal shall be issued by any court of the United States with respect to any decision to prepare or conduct a salvage operation or reforestation activity in response to a large scale catastrophic event. Section 705 of title 5, United States Code, shall not apply to any challenge to the salvage operation or reforestation activity. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, my amendment would allow land management agencies like the U.S. Forest Service and BLM to quickly remove dead trees after wildfires to pay for reforestation and rehabilitation after devastating fires. Last year, over 1 million acres burned in Montana. Livelihoods were threatened, wildlife habitats were destroyed, and whole landscapes were scarred. My commonsense amendment was passed, verbatim, in the Resilient Federal Forests Act by this body. It would allow the agencies to quickly respond, as well as to raise funds to further rehabilitate the forest. An expedited environmental assessment would still be required and public input would still be included in order to move forward with the project. Most importantly, this amendment would require that at least 75 percent of the burned area would be reforested. These landscape scale projects are badly needed. The Rice Ridge fire burned over 160,000 acres alone. Quickly responding to the damage caused will protect our public lands and restore our watersheds for the future and restore them to the quality we have come to love in Montana. As I mentioned, similar language was included in the Resilient Federal Forests Act, which passed the House on a bipartisan basis on November 11, 2017. My amendment is supported by the Federal Forest Resource Coalition, the National Association of Counties, the National Water Resources Association, and the Idaho Forest Group. Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ). Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my good friend and colleague Congressman GIANFORTE ’s wildfire salvage operations amendment. I am glad that, with the farm bill package, we have the opportunity to look at the forest industry and wildfire issues from all sides. This amendment is part and parcel of a broader wildfire strategy that requires proactive action from Congress for the steps before, during, and after wildfires are expected. Specifically, this amendment will ensure that the National Forest System forest is cleared and replanted if a catastrophic wildfire chars it to the ground. Our National Forest System lands will be rehabilitated after wildfire devastates them, but in a way consistent with forest plans. That way, the ecosystem of the new forest will have better management and be less susceptible to another largescale burndown event. This is a forwardthinking amendment to fix a backwards system we have devised in Congress, and I urge Members to vote for this demonstration that shows Congress isn’t willing to just give up and let our forest system lands be catastrophically burnt. Mr. Chair, I applaud Representative GIANFORTE for his strong leadership and tireless efforts to reduce the threat of dangerous wildfires. I urge adoption of this commonsense amendment. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ). Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank Mr. GIANFORTE  for offering this important amendment for Montana and, quite frankly, for our National Forest System as a whole. Over the past several years, fires have had a devastating impact on our forest system lands, resulting in deteriorated landscapes. I have witnessed this firsthand across the country as the former chairman of the Committee on Agriculture’s Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry. It is vital that the Forest Service has the right tools, the ability to restore these landscapes as quickly as possible to preserve habitat, clean air, and the significant impact that these incidents can have on clean water. Unfortunately, litigation stalls many of these projects. As Madison County, Montana, Commissioner Dave Schulz noted before the House Natural Resources Federal Lands Subcommittee in May of 2015, due to the threat of litigation from outside groups refusing to meet or collaborate with the community, what started out as a consensus proposal for 100,000 acres of fire salvage and reforestation was reduced to less than 2,000 acres of salvage. ‘‘Fear of litigation prevents the Forest Service from thinking big.’’ In another quote, he offered, a ‘‘significant factor in preventing responsible management of our Nation’s forests.’’ Mr. Chair, I certainly support this amendment. It has already passed the House. I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Chair, at this time, I urge adoption of my commonsense amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in part C of House Report 115–677. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of part III of subtitle C of title VIII, insert the following: 
SEC. 8334. ANALYSIS OF ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES (ACTION VERSUS NO ACTION) IN PROPOSED COLLABORATIVE FOREST MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. 
(a) A PPLICATION TO CERTAIN ENVIRON MENTAL ASSESSMENTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL  IMPACT STATEMENTS .—This section shall apply whenever the Secretary concerned prepares an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement pursuant to section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332) for a forest management activity that— (1) is developed through a collaborative process; (2) is proposed by a resource advisory committee; (3) will occur on lands identified by the Secretary concerned as suitable for timber production; (4) will occur on lands designated by the Secretary (or designee thereof) pursuant to section 602(b) of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6591a(b)), notwithstanding whether such forest management activity is initiated prior to September 30, 2018; or (5) is covered by a community wildfire protection plan. (b) CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES .—In an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement described in subsection (a), the Secretary concerned shall study, develop, and describe only the following two alternatives: (1) The forest management activity. (2) The alternative of no action. (c) ELEMENTS OF NOACTION ALTER NATIVE .—In the case of the alternative of no action, the Secretary concerned shall consider whether to evaluate— (1) the effect of no action on— (A) forest health; (B) habitat diversity; (C) wildfire potential; (D) insect and disease potential; and (E) timber production; and (2) the implications of a resulting decline in forest health, loss of habitat diversity, wildfire, or insect or disease infestation, given fire and insect and disease historic cycles, on— (A) domestic water supply in the project area; (B) wildlife habitat loss; and (C) other economic and social factors. 
(a) B ALANCING SHORT  ANDLONGTERM EFFECTS OF FOREST MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN  CONSIDERING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF .—As part of its weighing the equities while considering any request for an injunction that applies to any agency action as part of a forest management activity the court reviewing the agency action shall balance the impact to the ecosystem likely affected by the forest management activity of— (1) the short and longterm effects of undertaking the agency action; against (2) the short and longterm effects of not undertaking the action. (b) TIMELIMITATIONS FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.— (1) IN GENERAL .—Subject to paragraph (2) the length of any preliminary injunctive relief and stays pending appeal that applies to any agency action as part of a forest management activity, shall not exceed 60 days. (2) RENEWAL .— (A) IN GENERAL .—A court of competent jurisdiction may issue one or more renewals of any preliminary injunction, or stay pending appeal, granted under paragraph (1). (B) UPDATES .—In each renewal of an injunction in an action, the parties to the action shall present the court with updated information on the status of the authorized forest management activity. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, my amendment promotes collaborative forest management, cuts red tape, and encourages the Forest Service to plan for the longterm health of our Nation’s forests. Mr. Chair, if we were to go to the doctor and we had cancer and the doctor offered a treatment for that cancer but decided it might not be in our best interests, we wouldn’t just leave. We would want to find out what the best treatment was. What is happening in our national forests is, if one plan is rejected, we do nothing, and we don’t treat the disease of mismanagement that is currently happening in our forests. Implementing sound, scientifically based management reforms is necessary to address the growing economic and environmental threats of catastrophic wildfire. Prevention through active management is the best medicine to make our forests healthy. By requiring environmental analysis of a collaboratively developed proposal to be weighed against a ‘‘no action’’ alternative—the impacts of doing nothing on forest health and wildfire risk— this amendment ensures that taxpayer dollars are spent only on analysis and project planning that protects our forests’ longterm health. Further, my amendment ensures that longterm forest health is considered by the courts when granting an injunction on critical forest management activities. This amendment previously received bipartisan support in the House as part of the Resilient Federal Forests Act. It has no cost to the American taxpayer and is supported by a variety of organizations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Association of Counties, the National Association of Home Builders, and more. Mr. Chair, inaction itself is a forest management decision. Standing by and doing nothing is the reason we continue to watch our forests burn. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, this amendment significantly alters critical environmental review requirements and limits opportunity for the public to challenge forest management projects. Restricting NEPA analysis to two alternatives may seem like it will save time and money, but this cuts right at the heart of critical environmental protections. NEPA doesn’t hurt forest management projects; bad planning, ignoring science, and disingenuous intentions hurt forest management projects. NEPA supports collaboration through public participation. It allows many voices and different voices to participate in the planning process, 
which leads to better results and reduced costs. NEPA ensures Federal agencies consider all alternatives, without requiring that agencies select the most environmentally friendly option or value the environment over other concerns. Much like the forestry provisions in the base text of this bill, we have been down this road before. House Republicans tried to include harmful provisions to scale bedrock environmental laws and restrict access to the courts during the omnibus negotiations. All of these toxic proposals were rejected by the Senate. Let’s not make the Senate say ‘‘no’’ for a second time. Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, this bill, again, does not sidestep any environmental activity. It just simply says that we have to evaluate the donothing option and what the effects to the forest are from that. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ). Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my good friend and colleague, Mr. WESTERMAN . The United States is about to embark on yet another year of ravaging catastrophic wildfire. I say ‘‘embark’’ because this is ultimately a choice. While some amount of summer wildfire is to be expected during the heat of summer, the devastation we have seen in recent years is unprecedented. 2017 was one of the worst wildfire seasons on record. More than 58,000 fires burned more than 9.2 million acres. The Forest Service spent more than $2.5 billion on suppression costs this fiscal year alone, a new record. These expenditures and destruction coincide perfectly with Congress’ dereliction of its duty to ensure our land management agencies are equipped with the tools and authorities to properly manage our forests. Congress has provided some legislative fixes this year, but I think every Member understands full well we shouldn’t pat ourselves on the back just yet. As the coming months will demonstrate, we and, by extension, the American taxpayer are still on the hook here. We are susceptible to years more of supermassive fire blanketing the country unless we build on our progress. Mr. WESTERMAN ’s amendment here does just that. It will require the government to holistically evaluate the impacts of its forestry decisions on overall forest health. By requiring the costs of inaction to be weighed, the Forest Service will have to demonstrate its decisions are ultimately in a forest’s interest. Mr. Chair, I applaud Mr. WESTERMAN  for his strong leadership and tireless efforts to improve a failing system that we have inherited. Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of the commonsense amendment. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, if my colleagues across the aisle are serious about the long term health of our forests, they should stop and pause and listen to scientists, who tell us climate change threatens in a very factual and scientific way and direct way the health of our forests, wildlife, and the everincreasing forest fires that we must confront every year. We can use NEPA as a tool to consider these impacts, and if we are smart, we will strengthen the law instead of weakening it piece by piece. The issue of forest health is a serious issue. This amendment does not deal with the complexity of the seriousness of this issue. If, indeed, we are to deal with this issue, then it has to be comprehensive and it has to be looked at, not by eliminating protections and public access, but by truly doing something for the longterm health of these forests, and that is to consider all available information and not deny scientific information in the process of blaming NEPA or any other law that exists for the public and for the protection of our forests as the reason why we are having forest fires. Forest fires are a direct result of climate change, and as such, not to consider that as part and parcel of a solution is a grave mistake that will not solve the problem. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment. It should not be tucked into this farm bill. It merits its own proper discussion and debate in this House, and that is the direction we should go. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1445 Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, this amendment does not sidestep NEPA, it does not weaken NEPA, it just simply says you have to evaluate the alternative of doing nothing. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ). Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I think that we have actually found some common ground when our colleague is saying, let’s use science. Effectively, that is what we are talking about with this amendment, to be able to have analysis, to be able to have project planning. Let me give you a reallife example in southwestern Colorado: the West Fork Complex fire, which erupted because we had trees growing not at the elevation that they should, overgrowth in our forest that resulted in a massive fire. I would suggest that if you care about endangered species, if you care about protecting our waterways, if you care about having an abundant resource to be able to develop to be able to support our schools through the rural school programs as well, this is an opportunity to be able to create those healthy forests and to be able to move forward with good commonsense planning that is going to be provided by this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I encourage the passage of the amendment and applaud Mr. WESTERMAN ’s efforts on this. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say this amendment ensures that we prioritize the longterm health of our forest and we equip the Forest Service with the tools they need to execute a plan. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the sustained health of our Nation’s forests, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arkansas will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 14 OFFERED BY MR . YOUNG OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14 printed in part C of House Report 115–677. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of part III of subtitle C of title VIII, insert the following: 
The roadless area conservation rule established under part 294 of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations), shall not apply to any National Forest System land in the State of Alaska. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, this is a simple amendment. The Clinton era Roadless Rule applies a onesizefitsall approach to areas where those policies rarely work, especially the federally locked lands in Alaska. At 16.8 million acres, the Tongass National Forest is the largest of the National Forest System. Coupled with the Chugach National Forest, Alaska contains 12 percent of the total acres of national forest lands in the total United States. The Roadless Rule is nothing more than another effort to end the multipleuse mandate of Federal forest 
lands, something that is required by law but often ignored by nameless, faceless, unelected bureaucrats. Although the Tongass is over 100 years old, only 400,000 acres have been harvested. Of the remaining acreage, much of the forest is not topographically suitable for timber harvest, and 6.6 million acres are congressionally designated as wilderness areas, national monuments, and roadless areas. Not only does the Roadless Rule violate the authorities granted under the Alaska National Lands Act, it was adopted without proper consultation or consideration of the countless communities that rely on responsible resource development. Nearly 96 percent of the Tongass National Forest and 99 percent of the Chugach National Forest are protected by ANILCA and forest management plans. Exempting Alaska from the Roadless Rule would help make certain that what is left of the timber industry in the southeast can survive. Many individuals adamantly oppose logging old growth in roadless areas. However, old growth will continue to be predominant in the Tongass, and given the remote nature of Alaska, the vast majority of the forest is in a roadless state. Over 90 percent of the Tongass is unaccessible by road. The lack of access to timber not only costs goodpaying jobs, but results in trees dying of disease and infestations. Dead trees serve no purpose other than to become kindling, creating fires. So by having a robust timber industry, we can help prevent the spread of serious wildfires like have been seen in the lower 48. To be clear, we are not talking about clearcutting the entire national forest. We just want to help it stay healthy and fulfill its multiuse mandate of the Tongass. By significantly limiting the areas that are eligible for harvesting, the implementation of the Roadless Rule actually makes conservation more difficult since locations with less conservation value often can’t be selected. If any reasonable form of timber industry is to exist in the near future, it is imperative we restore Alaska’s exemption from the Roadless Rule as quickly as possible. It has placed an undue burden on my State and the people of my State. Mr. Chairman, we worry about immigration. We worry about homelessness. We worry about employment. We worry about education. I am saying this Roadless Rule takes away the opportunity for people to supply for their family so they can have a sustainable sylviculture industry taking care of our forests in southeast Alaska. The Roadless Rule should have never applied to Alaska to begin with. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alaska. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this amendment exempts all national forests in Alaska from the Forest Service’s Roadless Rule, one of the country’s most important conservation safeguards. Inventoried roadless areas account for only 2 percent of our Nation’s land mass, but they provide invaluable benefits: clean drinking water for over 60 million Americans, wildlife habitats for numerous threatened and endangered species, and they act as critical carbon sinks that mitigate the impacts of climate change. All of these benefits are threatened by this amendment. Nationwide, the Roadless Rule is incredibly popular. Our constituents understand the importance of keeping intact roadless areas and managing our last truly wild places in a manner that protects oldgrowth forest and other precious resources from the pressures of development and extraction. It is not just people in the lower 48. Alaskans understand the importance of protecting the roadless landscape. That is why hundreds of businesses in southeast Alaska have joined together to oppose overturning the recently adopted Tongass Forest Plan and efforts like this amendment to overturn protection for roadless areas. These businesses rely on clean water and healthy forests to support thriving salmon populations and a robust tourist economy. By rolling back safeguards that protect oldgrowth forests from harmful development, this amendment threatens fundamental linchpins of the regional economy. The Roadless Rule is not a job killer, as some make it out to be, because the Tongass Forest Plan balances protections of the oldgrowth forest by allowing public roads, hydropower projects, utility connectors, and access to inholdings, including mines. So its application in Alaska does not adversely affect community access or economic development projects in the legitimate public interest. An exception for Alaska is a major policy change that hasn’t had a hearing or any other form of consideration in the House. This controversial provision shouldn’t be stuck in this farm bill without any accountability to the American public. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY ), the chairman of the full committee. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, just simply, I support the gentleman’s amendment. It is common sense. It allows Alaskans to do a better job of taking care of Alaska, and I trust them to make that happen. Mr. Chairman, I support the gentleman’s amendment and urge adoption. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, the comments from the other side of the aisle were talking about Alaskans opposing this amendment. With all due respect, I am an elected representative, and if they don’t like what I do, they don’t vote for me. I just believe in jobs. When I first got elected to this job, when I first started this Tongass battle, we had 15,000 jobs in Alaska in the timber industry in the Tongass. And through the National Land Act itself, we were told that no other jobs would be lost in the timber industry, and they slowly crept around and eliminated what remaining jobs occurred. And the sad part about it, from my point of view, they have killed the timber industry. That was not the intent. We were supposed to have a timber industry. Then along comes the Clinton era Roadless Rule that means you can’t build a road anywhere that has no road. How do you have a hydropower site? We had to fight for 4 years to get a hydropower site. This action here by an administration—this and past administrations— have to understand, this is about employment. This is about managing— managing—timber. And those who don’t want to manage anything, you destroy it. Mr. Chairman, I am urging this body, this Congress, to do what is right for the State of Alaska and right for the timber, and the right for the people that live there and that depend upon a source of income other than living off, very frankly, somebody giving them something. They want to work for it. Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, Alaska recently lost in Federal court on this very issue. The Supreme Court refused to hear the State’s appeal of a ruling that struck down the Tongass exemption. This ended the case. This amendment attempts to run around that ruling and would exempt Alaska from protections that are widely supported and intended to protect our pristine public lands. With regard to the Roadless Rule, if the very important and significant issues we confront, whether it is immigration, whether it is employment, whether it is education, the issues of poverty and hunger in this country, I would suggest that the cause for not finding solutions rests in this Chamber, it doesn’t rest with the Roadless Rule. Mr. Chairman, I recommend a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alaska will be postponed.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, this amendment deals with a small community that is kind of circled around by the Gila National Forest. This amendment basically is going to allow the Forest Service to sell parcels of Forest Service land to the village of Santa Clara. It is a small village. About 2,000 people live in it. They, like many of our mountain communities, like many of our communities in the Forest Service, are slowly starving to death. The land that the Forest Service would sell to them is adjacent to the village. It is not a part of the larger national forest. It is just an isolated parcel. The Forest Service does not want to manage this land. It is in the state that it is in because it was set apart back in 1869 as a part of the Fort Bayard Military Reservation. Because the land is reserved as a military post, it cannot be disposed of in the normal fashion by the Forest Service. They must be released by law. Back in 1968, there was a bill that released other parcels of Fort Bayard to be sold and to be distributed to the State. This parcel just was not included in that for some reason, so the amendment steps around and includes that now to where the Forest Service would be allowed to dispose of the land. It would have to be appraised. It would be sold through normal processes. It is just that it requires a law to do it. It cannot go any other way. The village is desperately in need of expansion room. Like I said, this Forest Service land butts up against the village and stops their growth, stops their economic potential, and it is a very key piece of property for the village, but it is not a key piece of property for the Forest Service. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this noncontroversial amendment, and I urge its adoption. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. b1500 The Acting CHAIR.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Chairman, the largest broadband deployment gap exists in rural communities, where more than 12 million Americans lack coverage. Wireless communications companies require access to land or infrastructure to site the antennas necessary to provide service. Often, to reach more rural areas throughout our country, they require access to Federal land to ensure more complete coverage, including for providing emergency services. This need is expected to increase as providers deploy facilities to support 5G wireless services, which will require more antennas spaced closer together. Unfortunately, the process for securing access to Federal land and property has been problematic, with redtape bureaucracy being the main issue. Providers have experienced lost or missing applications, paperwork left to languish for years, varying or undisclosed rules within agencies, redundant historical or environmental reviews, and inconsistent denials of the process. In some cases, providers do not even receive a response from Federal agencies, resulting in stalled buildout and discouragement in rural areas. This is completely unacceptable. My amendment today seeks to streamline and expedite the regulatory framework necessary to utilize Federal lands for broadband infrastructure deployments. Specifically, the language would require the Secretary of Agriculture, within 1 year of enactment, to issue regulations that would streamline the siting process for Forest Service land and ensure that the process is uniform across all of the organizational units of the Forest Service, while eliminating overlapping requirements. Applications would be trackable and deemed granted if not acted upon within 270 days, which is 9 months. Lastly, any fees collected for allowing siting on Forest Service land can be used for processing the applications and the development, management, and improvement of sites for communications facilities. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment that simply aims to improve access to rural broadband coverage for rural Americans, who deserve it, across this Nation. Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ), my colleague and good friend. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my good friend and colleague Congressman LAMALFA ’s amendment. The amendment aims to streamline a bureaucratic process that is hampering broadband infrastructure development in rural America. As chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus and Representative for Arizona’s Fourth Congressional District, I can tell you that this problem is all too real in the communities that I represent. Many families and businesses in the West still lack basic broadband. According to a November 2017 Brookings Institution study, more than 50 percent of my district live in neighborhoods without an available broadband connection. Many of you all will find this hard to believe, but a huge chunk of my district has no social media platform whatsoever. Closing the broadband availability gap should be a priority for all Members of Congress. Doing so will create jobs, improve education, and grow our economy. I applaud Representative LAMALFA  for his leadership and tireless efforts to close the broadband availability gap, and I urge adoption of this excellent amendment. 
Mr. L AMALFA. Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague from Arizona. I appreciate the support and his excellent words toward that. In closing, Mr. Chairman, again, the concerns about this might be on environmental issues. This amendment does not allow anyone to circumvent environmental protections already in place. It simply requires an agency to fix the current regulatory maze, filled with excessive red tape, to deploy broadband infrastructure. That is it. To be clear, if you wanted to deploy broadband networks across the country that support 5G, we should really be doing something about it now. Americans rely on broadband for their jobs, telemedicine, distance learning, emergency services, and many more good reasons. Again, with almost half of rural Americans not having access to good broadband internet today, they will continue to lag behind and suffer if we do not address these regulatory barriers. Mr. Chairman, 270 days, 9 months, really, that should be a long enough gestation period to process applications by these Federal agencies. Mr. Chair, I ask for the ‘‘aye’’ vote, and I appreciate support on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ). The amendment was agreed to. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 17 printed in part C of House Report 115–677. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle E of title VIII, insert the following: 
SEC. 85ll. REPORT ON WILDFIRE, INSECT INFESTATION, AND DISEASE PREVENTION ON FEDERAL LAND. 
Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act and every year thereafter, the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Interior shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate, and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a jointly written report on— (1) the number of acres of Federal land treated by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior for wildfire, insect infestation, or disease prevention; (2) the number of acres of Federal land categorized as a high or extreme fire risk; (3) the total timber production from Federal land; (4) the number of acres and average fire intensity of wildfires affecting Federal land treated for wildfire, insect infestation, or disease prevention; (5) the number of acres and average fire intensity of wildfires affecting Federal land not treated for wildfire, insect infestation, or disease prevention; and (6) the Federal response time for each fire on greater than 25,000 acres. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My amendment is simple. It calls for the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to report back on the progress they are making to address the problem of catastrophic wildfires, a problem that has continued to get worse year after year under the current program. Our current forest management process took decades of mismanagement, inaction, and neglect to create. We have essentially slowly and methodically loved our trees to death on much of our Federal lands. It will take decades to reverse the effects this mismanagement has had on our forests, during which time we will likely see more major, devastating wildfires. This amendment simply requires our Federal agencies addressing this issue to report back on how they are doing, not only so Congress can provide oversight on their progress but so the American people can know how their Federal Government is doing so that we can measure, monitor, and demand accountability. Mr. Chairman, I think I speak for this entire Chamber when I say that our goal is to reduce the effects of wildfires and be transparent for the American people each step of the way. My amendment promotes transparency and accountability as we work towards this goal. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 18 OFFERED BY MR . PEARCE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 18 printed in part C of House Report 115–677. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle E of title VIII, add the following new section: 
Section 4003 of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (16 U.S.C. 7303) is amended— (1) in subsection (d)(1)(B), by inserting ‘‘, except the Secretary may waive, on a case bycase basis, the 10year period requirement under paragraph (1)(B) of such subsection’’ after ‘‘subsection (b)’’; and (2) in subsection (f)— (A) in paragraph (4)(B), by striking ‘‘proposal’’ and all that follows through ‘‘in excess’’ and inserting ‘‘proposal in excess’’; and (B) in paragraph (6), by striking ‘‘2019’’ and inserting ‘‘2023’’. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This amendment would reauthorize the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, CFLRP, for another 5year period. This program was initiated in 2009, and, basically, it aims to restore vital sections of our national forestlands. There are two projects in New Mexico, the Zuni Mountains and the Southwest Jemez, with over 420,000 acres total, that would be covered under this collaborative project. The Zuni Mountains project supports one of the last mills in New Mexico. We used to have 123 mills that processed timber. Now we are down to just one or two. That destruction in the capacity and the infrastructure for our national forest has been devastating to our ability to really accomplish projects of selective thinning and balanced management of our forests. The extension of the program is going to provide enough certainty so that this last mill operator can make investments that will reduce the cost of conducting forest management activities in western New Mexico. If we lose the mill, if it does, in fact, close—which should not be an option— it is going to increase the cost of the projects due to transportation costs. So it makes sense for the government, it makes sense for the U.S. Forest Service, the taxpayer, and the local economy to keep this mill open and to find others that would reopen with these collaborative projects that come under this program. This program is a good starting point, and, when paired with other reforms that open up more acreage for treatment, it is going to increase the profitability of restoration projects. That will, in turn, save taxpayers money. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this noncontroversial amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 19 OFFERED BY MR . TIPTON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 19 printed in part C of House Report 115–677. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 538, after line 23, add the following new section: 
(1) C OUNTY .—The term ‘‘County’’ means Dolores County, Colorado. (2) WEST FORK FIRE STATION CONVEYANCE  
PARCEL .—The term ‘‘West Fork Fire Station Conveyance Parcel’’ means the parcel of approximately 3.61 acres of National Forest System land in the County, as depicted on the map entitled ‘‘Map for West Fork Fire Station Conveyance Parcel’’ and dated November 21, 2017. (b) CONVEYANCE OF WESTFORK FIRESTATION CONVEYANCE PARCEL , DOLORES COUNTY , COLORADO .— (1) IN GENERAL .—On receipt of a request from the County and subject to such terms and conditions as are mutually satisfactory to the Secretary and the County, including such additional terms as the Secretary determines to be necessary, the Secretary shall convey to the County without consideration all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the West Fork Fire Station Conveyance Parcel. (2) COSTS.—Any costs relating to the conveyance under paragraph (1), including processing and transaction costs, shall be paid by the County. (3) USE OF LAND .—The land conveyed to the County under paragraph (1) shall be used by the County only for a fire station, related infrastructure, and roads to facilitate access to and through the West Fork Fire Station Conveyance Parcel. (4) REVERSION .—If any portion of the land conveyed under paragraph (1) is used in a manner that is inconsistent with the use described in paragraph (3), the land shall, at the discretion of the Secretary, revert to the United States. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, West Fork is in a remote part of Dolores County, Colorado, surrounded by the San Juan National Forest. Emergency and fire response is a challenge in this part of the county because the closest fire station is currently 26 miles away. The amendment I have offered would authorize the Forest Service to convey approximately 3.6 acres of National Forest System land to Dolores County for the strict purpose of building and operating a fire station in the West Fork area. In addition to creating emergency and fire response challenges, the lack of a dedicated fire station has created insurance challenges for homeowners in West Fork. In an area surrounded by the national forestland, it is critical to have fire insurance for your home and other structures on your property. With no fire station in reasonable proximity to the area, it is nearly impossible for homeowners to obtain fire insurance in West Fork. The text of this amendment is identical to the West Fork Fire Station Act, which passed the House by a voice vote last month. I encourage my colleagues to once again support this measure as an amendment to H.R. 2. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON ). The amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO . 20 OFFERED BY MR .

Page 601, after line 26, add the following new section: 
SEC. 11105. REGIONAL CATTLE AND CARCASS GRADING CORRELATION AND TRAINING CENTERS. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Secretary shall establish not more than three regional centers, to be known as ‘‘Cattle and Carcass Grading Correlation and Training Centers’’ (referred to in this section as the ‘‘Centers’’), to provide education and training for cattle and carcass beef graders of the Agricultural Marketing Service, cattle producers, and other professionals involved in the reporting, delivery, and grading of feeder cattle, live cattle, and carcasses— (1) to limit the subjectivity in the application of beef grading standards; (2) to provide producers with greater confidence in the price of the producers’ cattle; and (3) to provide investors with both long and short positions more assurance in the cattle delivery system. (b) LOCATION .—The Centers shall be located near cattle feeding and slaughter populations and areas shall be strategically identified in order to capture regional variances in cattle production. (c) ADMINISTRATION .—Each Center shall be organized and administered by offices of the Department of Agriculture in operation on the date on which the respective Center is established, or in coordination with other appropriate Federal agencies or academic institutions.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, first, I would like to commend the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Mr. CONAWAY , for his work not only in formulating this bill but in promoting and protecting the interests of rural America. I think it is a great tribute to him dealing with a number of complex issues, and I appreciate very much a job well done. Mr. Chairman, when we go to the grocery store, we make decisions about what type of beef and what grade of beef we are going to purchase. The challenge is that the grades are different from place to place because there is not a uniform grading system across the country. My amendment requires USDA to set up three training centers to train graders so that there can be more standardization. If you are going to buy a prime or a choice steak in one place, it should be roughly the same as a prime or choice steak in another place. This will benefit consumers. It will benefit the beef industry, and I hope our colleagues will support it. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ). The amendment was agreed to. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I move that the committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. TIPTON) having assumed the chair, Mr. WEBER of Texas, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2) to provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
AGRICULTURE AND NUTRITION ACT OF 2018 The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. TIPTON). Pursuant to House Resolution 900 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 2. Will the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER ) kindly resume the chair. b1515 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 2) to provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and for other purposes, with Mr. WEBER of Texas (Acting Chair) in the chair. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. The Acting CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, amendment No. 20 printed in part C of House Report 115–677 offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ) had been disposed of. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, no further amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute referred to in House Resolution 891 shall be in order except those printed in House Report 115–679. Each such further amendment shall be considered only in the order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question.

Strike section 6410. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) and a Member opposed each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I commend my colleague MIKECONAWAY and the other members of the Agriculture Committee for their work on the farm bill. I have every intention of voting for the bill and have stated that on many occasions. Having been working on a reauthorization of a major bill recently, I can certainly sympathize with the effort here and say that, overall, this bill is an improvement on past farm bills because it responds to the desperate need of work requirements for ablebodied people. However, there is another piece of this bill that has been around for a long time, 85 years, that is not corrected, is decidedly bad policy, and is long overdue to be corrected, and our amendment does that. This amendment is not new. In fact, this body has debated it in every farm bill for over a generation. The issue of which I speak is the issue with sugar and the need for reform of the way we treat sugar, which is different from all other commodity programs. It is the only program that provides both loan supports and supply management. Supply management is the ugly cousin of direct payments. It rewards inactivity. Americans are outraged when they hear tales of direct payments to farmers for not producing something. That same injustice—reward for inactivity, protection from competition—is what we find in the sugar program. Let’s be crystalclear about what the sugar program does. It puts the government in charge of deciding how much sugar will be produced in this country, which inflates the cost, and it guarantees the processing industry a base profit by giving them subsidized loans. We stopped these practices years ago for other commodities, and only sugar is left with this sweet deal. When the government gets into picking winners and losers, American jobs are at risk. The International Trade Commission has stated that for every job the sugar program protects we lose three manufacturing jobs. Congress should not be in the business of defending a program that is a bona fide job killer. This amendment has a broad coalition of support. Free market groups, economists, environmentalists, consumer groups, and manufacturers all support this amendment. Let me tell you about the other coalition. It is not very large. It is made up of 13 vertically integrated sugar processors. That is it. Our government is transferring wealth to these processors. It shifts cost onto our Nation’s manufacturers and consumers by almost $4 billion annually. We are going to hear that the amendment subjects farmers to some new exposure to foreign imports. What they will fail to tell you is that, between our government’s suspension agreements, import quotas, and tariffs, our government already regulates every single ounce of foreign sugar coming into our market. Will our amendment weaken the ability of the USDA to regulate these imports? Not in the slightest. We simply give USDA more flexibility. We are going to hear arguments about candy bars, candy companies, and lots of other distractions. But it is all brought up to shift your attention away from the very program we are here to debate, the sugar program. In reality, the sugar program hates sunshine. It hates getting the spotlight. But I am glad we are debating it here today. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 10 minutes. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in extreme opposition to Ms. FOXX’s amendment. She singles out sugar, cuts its program back to where it was 33 years ago, and denigrates the hardworking men and women who are farmers. Those processors she mentioned are co opowned; they are owned by those hardworking farmers. There is no inactivity with respect to the sugar industry. She couldn’t be more wrong or more disrespectful of them. Her amendment would not save the taxpayer one dime. Fifteen out of the last 16 years, the sugar program has worked. The reason we have not changed it over all those years is because it does work. If we were to move it under title I to treat it exactly the way the other commodities are treated, it would cost billions of taxpayer dollars. We don’t want that, and the sugar industry is not asking for that. This amendment will not save the consumer one penny. These large sugar users, of whom I am a great customer, buy by the carload. When the price of sugar dropped to half of what it should have been in 2013 as a result of Mexico cheating on the trade deal, they did not share that profit with anybody. Quite frankly, just to put it succinctly, if sugar was such a driving cost in the cost of all production and the cost to all the jobs that the gentlewoman mentioned, my diet soda would cost dramatically less than a sugar soda. They don’t. They cost exactly the same. They still give this product away in restaurants. So, as we go about this issue, this is about protecting American jobs and American hardworking farmers from unfair, undue competition from around the world. We don’t let other products come into this country at below the cost of production. We do it when we fight steel. We had a recent fight against Turkey over the imports of steel because it was below the cost of production. We would protect all other products that way. We just simply leave this one in place because it works year in and yearout, except for the 1 year Mexico cheated. They admitted they cheated on the program, and that is when it cost the American taxpayers money. So it doesn’t cost, it doesn’t save taxpayer money, and it doesn’t save consumers money. It is simply a windfall of some amount to the sugar buyers and users. I don’t have a grudge against them at all. Like I said, I eat and drink their products. I am trying to defend American farmers from products being produced overseas by slave labor in some instances, child labor in other instances, standards under which we don’t produce. It is dumped into these markets because those governments, unlike ours, have a direct payment to their farmers and producers to keep them in business. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. KIND). Mr. KIND. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. I thank her for her leadership on this issue. This amendment is long overdue. The sugar program that currently exists has distorted the marketplace for too long. According to one estimate, it has driven up consumer prices by over $4 billion a year. And it is making it more difficult for us to negotiate greater market access in trade negotiations overseas. Mr. Chairman, I am also disappointed that many of my fiscally responsible reform amendments were rejected late last night in the Rules Committee, such as: Why do multimillionaires and billionaires still qualify for agriculture subsidies under the current bill? Why do those earning over $500,000 in adjusted gross income get subsidies under this bill? Why are multiple people on the same farm receiving the same subsidies under this bill, from husbands to wives, to sons, to daughters, the nephews, the nieces, the cousins? Why can’t we at least track where the crop insurance premium subsidies are going, which is currently prohibited under this bill? This legislation should be working for family farmers, not powerful special interests here in Washington. I fear it is a missed opportunity. This amendment at least introduces some modicum of reform, which is long overdue, in a program that has distorted the marketplace for too long. Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to accept this amendment today. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETERSON ), who is the ranking member of the powerful Agriculture Committee. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I wish my friends on the Ways and Means Committee would actually do something about the illegal subsidization that is going on in the sugar industry in the world instead of coming here and complaining about a program that actually works. I have the biggest sugar district in the country. The people who grow sugar in my district are small farmers. They use their own money to build the plant. It is probably 25 percent of the economy in the north part of my district. All this amendment would do is give these jobs and this market away to other countries that are subsidizing their people more than we are in the United States. And they are working these plants with child labor, slave labor, in these other places. Is that what you want to do? Give away our jobs to places where there are no environmental regulations? You go down to Brazil. They are making sugar out of sugarcane. They are burning it with gas. It goes right into the atmosphere. There is no EPA. There are no regulations whatsoever. They are putting this vinasse, which is like oil, right into the river. And we are going to get rid of an industry in the United States that is doing a good job? It is the lowest cost producer in the world, and we are going to give it up because other people are cheating? Now, people say that this thing costs money. It only cost money 1 year, and the reason is because the Mexicans dumped in our market and our government didn’t do anything about it. When we finally got the suspension agreement in place, then we were able to get this thing stabilized. So this is an amendment that is not needed. This is a program that works. The reason we have this program is to protect ourselves from all these other countries that are subsidizing their industries more than we are in the United States. We are the lowest cost producer in my district. We are the lowest cost producer of anyplace in the world. We can compete, but we can’t compete against governments that are dumping money in and not following environmental regulations and not following child labor laws. We can’t compete against that. So please vote down this amendment. It is something that is not necessary and is not needed. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, not my words, but the International Trade Commission says that for every job sugar protects, we lose three manufacturing jobs. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ). Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding, Mr. Chairman. I come here to the House floor as the son, grandson, and greatgrandson of farmers. I grew up working on a farm in rural Texas, and I strongly oppose Federal subsidies to agriculture in general and the sugar program in particular. Under the Federal sugar program, which dates back to the New Deal, domestic sugar prices are propped up via a Byzantine system of marketing, allotments, import quotas, price supports, and a loan guarantee program so bad it would make a Soviet commissar blush. This may be a sweet deal for sugar producers, but it is not a sweet deal for the auto mechanic in Mesquite, Texas; the store clerk in Mineola, Texas; or the teacher in Garland, Texas, that I represent in the Fifth District. Where is their government subsidy program? 
This is antijob. It is a food tax. It is income redistribution at its worst. And it is not commensurate with any free market principle I know. Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to support the amendment. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I point out that over half of all U.S. sugar processing operations in the United States since 1980 have closed. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO). Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, this is a farm policy. The farm policy is there to produce a policy so that the American farmers can go out and raise crops for the United States of America to continue to produce the highest quality, the most abundant, and the cheapest food produced in the world of any industrialized nation. That is why we have a farm policy. This amendment of Ms. FOXX goes after the American farmers for the betterment of multinational soda companies and candy companies, and the price of sugar won’t go down. In my hometown, a 4pound bag of sugar costs $2.64. I would ask every Member of Congress: How many constituents in your district have come up to you and pleaded for you to do something about the cost of sugar? b1530 This is about the American farmer, not about candy companies and soda companies. It is misdirected. I oppose it and strongly advise everybody to vote against it. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I would also point out the additional closed plants and jobs lost in the sugar growing industry. U.S. and foreignsweetened product manufacturers have announced 100 plant openings, acquisitions, or expansions within the United States over that same timeframe. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOODLATTE ). Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support fair sugar policy. The sugar program represents a hidden tax on American businesses and consumers and is responsible for the loss of U.S. food manufacturing jobs. Each month, families go to the grocery store, and unbeknownst to them, the sugar in many of the products they buy is subject to a cost that is generally 30 to 40 percent higher than the world cost. Very few, if any, will ever know that a hidden sugar tax has been imposed upon them by the sugar program. This hidden tax totals at least $2.4 billion a year for American consumers. There are more than 600,000 sugar using industry jobs in our Nation, including thousands in Virginia’s Sixth District. I want to stand up and be counted as an advocate for keeping those jobs in the United States. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for this amendment to help put an end to the hidden costs of the sugar program. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time is left on both sides. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 41⁄2minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from North Carolina has 3
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I would point out that that hidden tax that my colleagues are talking about will not be shared with the consumers. It has never been shared with the price of sugar. It goes down. It will simply shift those profits into multinational corporations that we are defending by supporting this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ). Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Chairman, as you may guess, I am a big fan of a good candy bar. In 1983, a candy bar cost 35 cents and had a cost of about 2 cents worth of sugar. Thirtyfive years later, I am still a fan of candy bars. In 2018, that same candy bar costs $1.49—they are a little slimmer—and the cost of sugar is still 2 cents. United States retail sugar costs are the lowest in the world: 59 cents a pound compared to 71 cents on the open market. The sugar program cost the taxpayers zero in the last 16 years. Rather than message about alleged conservative amendments, let’s focus on addressing meaningful changes. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, the fact is that there are lots of companies that use sugar and are behemoths. I represent a number of them in Portland, Oregon, that are confectioners, candy makers, and bakers who are concerned about this. In terms of the benefit, think about the 13 mega processors that the sugar program forces manufacturers to pay far more than they need. This is a $3 billion burden on the taxpayer. We have an opportunity here to deal with one other area. If we start getting the pricing right, there is another hidden tax in terms of the sugar system that we have, and that has been on the Florida Everglades. We have a $7.5 billion down payment because of the damage that has been inflicted on the Everglades by the massive cane sugar operation that has increased dramatically in the last 50 years, a cost that taxpayers will be footing and environmental costs to go with the burden on sugarusing industries. I strongly urge approval of the amendment. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ). Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I want to point out that the Republican chairman of the committee and the Democratic ranking member of this committee both oppose this amendment, for good reason. It is a simple question: Do we want to support local growers like the 900 families that I represent who, collectively, through a coop, own their processing facility? This notion of mega producers is really a story of 900 families that collectively bound together in a coop to own the production facility to deal with the sugar that they, themselves, grow. This is a question of local growers or foreignsubsidized sugar using child labor. That is the simple question before us. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ). Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, which will create some fairness for more than 600,000 workers across our country who are in small businesses and manufacturing facilities that use sugar as an ingredient in the products they make. Over 91,000 of those jobs and 2,300 of those businesses are in my home State of California. This amendment would make the sugar program fairer for taxpayers, manufacturers, and American consumers. By removing the many unnecessary government interventions that have kept sugar prices excessively high, manufacturers will create jobs and American consumers will no longer be on the hook for $4 billion per year in hidden sugar costs. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, the U.S. is the third largest importer of sugar in the world, and virtually all of that comes in duty free. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. CRAMER ). Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Chairman, not long ago, President Trump successfully negotiated an agreement with Mexico to stop them from dumping illegally subsidized sugar onto the U.S. market. This amendment would undo the President’s good work by reopening the floodgates to other foreign countries to send us their subsidized sugar at below their costs of production, further depressing the prices that my farmers receive. Vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 25 seconds to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES ). Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, when other militaries challenge the United States’ military might, we invest more dollars, just like we did a few months ago in our military. When the Panama Canal was widened and deepened, we invested more dollars in our ports so we would remain competitive. When other countries have lowered tax rates, we lower ours to 
make sure that we remain competitive and we can defend our folks. Mr. Chairman, I represent thousands of farmers from Louisiana who depend upon this crop. If we pass this amendment, the precedent that it sets rolling into other types of crops will devastate American farmers. This amendment is a flawed amendment. It is going to undermine our agriculture industry across the United States. I urge opposition. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SANFORD ). Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not only about being against a Sovietstyle regime and the quotas and a variety of other things that come with it, but this amendment is, hopefully, about common sense. The one thing we don’t want to subsidize are the things that cause us problems. We are now spending more than a quarter of a trillion dollars in healthcare costs as type 2 diabetes has ballooned. To give you the exact number, $327 billion a year is spent on type 2 diabetes. So the idea of saying let’s subsidize our sugar so that we can then spend more on healthcare is something that needs to be looked at. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH). Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. It is interesting to listen to the various arguments here, but certainly there is unfair competition, if you will—it is hard to even call it competition—overseas, but we have unfair trade practices. Sugar policy here helps us defend ourselves. These are manufacturing jobs in western Nebraska that utilize, very responsibly, our natural resources, and I think it is only reasonable to continue a policy that is not generally a cost to taxpayers. I urge opposition to this amendment. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY ). Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, the current U.S. sugar program represents an antifree market scheme that imposes a massive hidden tax on both American businesses and consumers for the benefit of a small, concentrated group of special interests. People say, well, we have got the safest, cheapest food source in the world in the United States. It is cheap because we are paying for it with our taxes. These are Sovietstyle policies imposing significant, unnecessary costs on the domestic food manufacturing industry and the consumer. Policies have imposed $2.4 billion to $4 billion worth of losses to sugar users across the Nation. These industries provide jobs to 600,000 Americans, including 40,000 Pennsylvanians. Mr. Chairman, I urge passage. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GONZALEZ ). Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in solidarity with south Texas sugar and in opposition to the FoxxDavis amendment. In deep south Texas, we are proud of our sugar corporation, our sugar mill, and the jobs they support. Our existing sugar policy levels the playing field for American producers in the ever volatile world of the sugar market. It works. Sugar growers in my district can attest to that. Better yet, it has come at no cost to taxpayers for 14 of the last 15 years. I ask everyone to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment. PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY  
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from North Carolina will state her parliamentary inquiry. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, do I have the right to close or does the gentleman from Texas have the right to close? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has the right to close. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM ). Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Foxx amendment. In my home State of Minnesota, sugar beet is number one. That means this amendment will directly hurt my State’s economy. Minnesota’s sugar creates more than 28,000 jobs and has an annual impact of more than $3 billion. This amendment will cost Minnesota and other sugar producing States so much more. It will hurt farmers, small businesses, schools, hospitals—real lives of real people in rural communities that this bill is supposed to help. We should be supporting American farmers instead of sending their jobs to countries that heavily subsidize sugar production, like Brazil and Mexico. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this harmful amendment, and I ask them to stand with farmers in Minnesota and all across the United States. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, in closing, our government’s current sugar program is a job killer. It ensures profits for the connected few at the expense of the many. It operates at a substantial cost to taxpayers, consumers, and businesses. It is rooted in supply management economics that were drafted nearly 90 years ago. Every other commodity program was subjected to reforms during the last farm bill except the sugar program. Economists, consumer groups, environmentalists, manufacturers, editorial boards, and groups on both the left and right of the idealogical spectrum have all endorsed the idea of substantially reforming this program. It is time to end Congress’ codification of a special interest giveaway. It is time to modernize the sugar program. I ask my colleagues to support our amendment and the farm bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I couldn’t disagree more. The savings that are touted by the folks who are in favor of this amendment will not be shared with consumers. They will be kept by these multinational corporations and, yes, the small sugar users across this country. So prices will not go down. There are no tax dollars involved, despite the rhetoric to the contrary, except for 1 year out of 16, because this program worked. This program was not changed in 2014 because it works. It doesn’t cost the taxpayers money, sugar prices are not distorted, and the manufacturers will not be able to support the one instance where they have lowered the cost of their product when sugar prices did in fact drop as a result of the unfair, unlevel playing field, unlevel competition around this world. If we could talk the rest of the world into going to a free market, to a level playing field, then I would agree completely with my colleagues who support this amendment. b1545 We are not there. We are not even headed there. We need to defeat this amendment, protect those hardworking farmers out there across this country. Say ‘‘no’’ to Foxx. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2 includes a substantive, enforceable supportive work requirement for work capable individuals 18 to 59. Waivers and exemptions were tightened to assure little abuse in a system currently rife with loopholes and gimmicks. We have also heard from our conservative stakeholders that workfare is an important tool for EP participants. Based on their feedback and explicit examples of where this has been implemented correctly, this amendment includes establishment of that. It is simply good policy to send unexpended funds back to the Treasury. This amendment does that. Our colleagues on the other side said we did not count veteranspecific workforce development programs as a part of H.R. 2. Well, in addition to the provisions of H.R. 2 that has permitted Statebased veteran workforce programs to count toward the work requirement, this amendment expands to include programs for veterans run by the Department of Labor and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Mr. Chairman, that would have been a terrific amendment for my colleagues to have offered in committee or on this floor, and we would have accepted it. They chose to stay on the sidelines. I have a great food bank in my district, West Texas Food Bank. Its chief executive related how important it was to provide a 1year certification period for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program for seniors, a program currently serving seniors. This makes sense and allows seniors easier access to this important program. It is engagements like this that is what our process is all about, and we have amended our bill through this manager’s amendment to include those. Mr. Chair, we also have changes in here that strengthen our framework for coordinating between USDA on FCA, on important operations, broadband work that is going on across jurisdictions. We want those two agencies to work together to better utilize the funding to make sure that rural America gets that broadband support that we really need. That is included in here as well. It also allows that communities will have a better opportunity to work for themselves rather than fighting the current bureaucracy here in Washington, D.C. This amendment also includes a variety of technical amendments, corrections to the bill, that you would normally have in a manager’s amendment, and I ask my colleagues to support the manager’s amendment. Mr. Chair, with that, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I just want to say for the record that both Feeding America and Feeding Texas oppose this farm bill because they believe it will increase hunger in America, and I include the letter from Feeding Texas in the RECORD . 
FEEDING TEXAS , April 17, 2018. HOUSE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE , Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN CONAWAY AND COMMITTEE  MEMBERS : Regretfully and despite years of hard work, we are writing to oppose the farm bill proposed by Chairman Conaway, as we believe it will increase hunger and make it harder for struggling Texans to succeed. Most SNAP recipients are children, seniors and people with disabilities. Among SNAP recipients who can work, most already do— just not at wages that allow them to escape poverty. To help these workers we need to address the weaknesses in our economy and our labor market that make it hard for them to get ahead. Instead, this farm bill largely ignores the complex challenges faced by lowwage workers, imposing harsh new sanctions and requirements that will take food away from families who are willing but unable to find consistent work. Hunger never helped anyone find a job. According to the CBO, the Chairman’s bill will move billions of dollars off the kitchen table, largely to finance state bureaucracies intended to assist recipients with employment. Food will remain critical fuel for the success of these families, yet this bill would effectively starve Peter to employ Paul. Losing SNAP will make it harder for these families to make ends meet. We fully expect our food banks to experience the brunt of this increased need. Across Texas, our food banks already struggle to meet the demand in their communities, and we will not be able to keep up. We are also very concerned that this bill will repeal state flexibility and put massive new responsibilities on states in pursuit of better employment outcomes for recipients. These ideas ignore the evidencebased policy making that the Chairman has espoused by selling a promise on work, but not delivering on the necessary funding or details. We urge every member of the committee to reject this proposal, and return to a bipartisan process that will help more hardworking Americans avoid hunger and achieve financial security. Sincerely, Celia Cole, CEO, Feeding Texas; Zack Wilson, Executive Director, High Plains Food Bank; Theresa Mangapora, Executive Director, Brazos Valley Food Bank; Bea Hanson, Executive Director, Coastal Bend Food Bank; Dennis Cullinane, CEO, East Texas Food Bank; Robin Cadle, President/CEO, Food Bank of the Golden Crescent; Jody Houston, CEO, Food Bank of West Central Texas; Brian Greene, President/ CEO Houston Food Bank. Trisha Cunningham, President/CEO, North Texas Food Bank; Dan Maher, Executive Director, Southeast Texas Food Bank; Alma Boubel, Executive Director, South Texas Food Bank; Libby Campbell, Executive Director, West Texas Food Bank; Derrick Chubbs, President/CEO, Central Texas Food Bank; Gregory Duke, Executive Director, Concho Valley Regional Food Bank. Susan Goodell, CEO, El Pasoans Fighting Hunger Food Bank; DeAnne Economedes, Interim CEO, Food Bank of the Rio Grande Valley; Richard Nye, Executive Director, Galveston County Food Bank; Allison Hulett, President/ CEO, Montgomery County Food Bank; Eric Cooper, President/CEO, San Antonio Food Bank; David Weaver, CEO, South Plains Food Bank; Bo Soderbergh, Executive Director, Tarrant Area Food Bank; Kara Nickens, Executive Director, Wichita Falls Area Food Bank. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I thought that this bill couldn’t get any worse, but I was wrong. This amendment is a sure sign that this underlying farm bill is a complete mess. This manager’s amendment is longer than most bills that we consider in this House. 
First, it puts a BandAid on the beating the majority took during the markup when they finally realized that disabled people would be hurt by their zeal to sever LIHEAP from SNAP. But to do that, to help disabled people, cost them money, so they had to find savings somewhere. And they landed on taking away more flexibility from States for waivers, the result of which is that 600,000 people—600,000 more ablebodied adults without dependents—will lose SNAP. Here is the best part of it: The 600,000 will be kicked off right away, at least a year before the mandatory work scheme—which is underfunded and will be a mass of bureaucracy—is in effect. So in spite of the rhetoric to provide onramps, offramps, trampolines, or whatever to help people get good jobs, they do not deliver—not for SNAP, and not for farmers. As I have said over and over and over again, a farm bill should be a bipartisan product. It should be reflective of bipartisan concerns. It should help farmers, and it should help those struggling in need to put food on the table. This bill doesn’t do enough to help farmers, and it certainly doesn’t do anything to help people struggling with hunger. In fact, this bill makes hunger worse in America, and that is shameful. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. CRAWFORD ), the subcommittee chairman. Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support H.R. 2 and the accompanying manager’s amendment. I appreciate the chairman’s leadership on this effort, not only in the underlying bill but the amendment to improve upon it. I thank the gentleman for including my food access liaison provision in the amendment. Just briefly: This individual will be tasked with coordinating USDA programs aimed at improving Americans’ access to quality food and providing technical assistance to community leaders who are working to improve the lives of those living in food deserts. This is a small measure of progress that we can all be proud of and continue our work to ensure folks have access to healthy and nutritious foods. However, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that access to healthy and nutritious food relies on the food security system, the strong food security system provided by this farm bill. And I thank the chairman for his leadership in that regard. As we will soon vote on amendments, I urge my colleagues to remember the importance of a strong food security system for all of our commodities, whether that be under the ARC program or the PLC program for crops such as rice, soybeans, and corn or the current sugar program. If we pick apart our commodity programs one by one, we will create giant holes in our Nation’s food security system. This compromises our national security and hinders our ability to provide healthy, nutritious food, not just to rural communities that produce the food but to urban areas and, in fact, the entire Nation and beyond. Mr. Chair, again, I want to thank the chairman for his diligence and leadership on this issue, and not only in regard to the commodity title but certainly the nutrition title, to our vice chairman and chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, G.T. Thompson, for his diligence as well. And I appreciate the work on the part of our Agriculture Committee. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 3
1⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER ). Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Chair, I have the honor of not only sitting on the Committee on Agriculture but also of sitting on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, so I know very well how important healthy, hungerfree children are to a good education system. On top of already harmful policies, the Conaway manager’s amendment compromises the current sciencebased nutrition standards in Federal schools meals programs. By politicizing and legislating nutrition standards, this amendment, if adopted, will further threaten the school meals programs upon which millions of children rely. The USDA updated the current standards based on rigorous, evidence based processes, as required by the last bipartisan Child Nutrition Reauthorization. These standards rely on expert, nonpartisan recommendations. Research shows that children are now eating 16 percent more vegetables and 23 percent more fruit at lunch. Further, according to a poll by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, 97 percent of Americans support the National School Nutrition Standards and 86 percent say the School Nutrition Standards should stay or be strengthened. There is simply no reason to depart from sciencebased and evidencebased standards. We should not compromise on what is best for our children. That is why the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, and others oppose rolling back the standards. I urge my colleagues to oppose these efforts that would further threaten the health of our Nation’s children and students. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how many more speakers the gentleman from Texas might have. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, I am ready to close. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 1
3⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, let me close by saying this manager’s amendment highlights how deeply flawed this bill is. I regret very much that a flawed bill is being brought to the House floor because of a flawed process. I am the ranking Democrat in the Nutrition Subcommittee. I didn’t see the nutrition title until it was made public to the press. We had 23 hearings in the Agriculture Committee. This nutrition title does not reflect those hearings. We should have had a hearing on this nutrition title to understand the impacts that it will have on some of the most vulnerable people in this country. We live in the richest country in the history of the world. We have millions of people who are food insecure or hungry. We have an obligation here in this House of Representatives to make sure that we don’t let them fall through the cracks. And yet, we have this bill that will make hunger worse in America. This manager’s amendment does nothing to fix it. In fact, in some cases it makes it worse. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject it but, more importantly, reject this bill. Send it back to committee. Let’s do it right. Let’s have a bipartisan bill, one that we can all be proud of. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, the gentlewoman just previously mentioned the increase in fruits and vegetables being eaten by children in school. I would point out that our bill includes $1.2 billion in incentives to help moms and dads out there who are on SNAP to buy fruits and vegetables and dairy to get a bigger bang for their buck and thereby hopefully increasing those commodities. Mr. Chair, we have a good bill here, the base bill. This simply makes it better. With that, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY ). The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, farm subsidies, essentially taking money from taxpayers to inflate the price of their own groceries, was never a good idea. They are the poster children of corporate welfare since the vast proportion of them go to large corporations, not to small family farms. And 60 percent of American farms get no subsidies at all, contradicting the claim that somehow American agriculture couldn’t exist without them. We spend about $20 billion a year subsidizing about 40 percent of our farms. That is $160 a year out of the direct taxes of an average family in America, and that doesn’t include the cost to consumers from higher prices. As we just heard, the sugar program alone costs taxpayers $3.7 billion a year in higher sugar prices. That adds about $30 more to their grocery bills. Subsidies hurt taxpayers, they hurt consumers, and they even hurt farmers in the long run. The decline in farm economy since the last farm bill ought to warn us we are doing something wrong. Prices are signals sent by consumers over what they want to buy and the amount that they are willing to pay. If left alone, they tell producers what consumers want more of and what they want less of. If consumers want less soybeans and sugar and more wheat and cabbage, prices for soybeans and sugar decline and prices for wheat and cabbage increase. Producers respond by planting less soybeans and sugarcane and more wheat and cabbage, unless— unless—the government distorts those price signals through subsidies. Producers end up planting more of what consumers don’t want and less of what they do. Thus, producers are artificially induced to perform below their potential productivity. Many of the subsidies today are in the form of crop insurance. Farmers get heavily subsidized insurance to guarantee them profits for their products. Who pays those subsidies? Taxpayers. What is insurance? It is the monetization of risk. It is the way markets assign a dollar value to the risk that one undertakes in any human enterprise. The higher the risk, the more expensive the insurance. By subsidizing crop insurance, we once again corrupt the price signals that farmers need to make rational decisions. If crop insurance for soybeans is expensive, the market is warning farmers not to rely on soybeans. If taxpayers subsidize the cost of that insurance to lower its price, we are encouraging very risky behavior by masking the cost of that risk. Once again, that produces bad outcomes for taxpayers, for consumers, and ultimately the farmers themselves because they have been led toward higher risk by distorted price signals. Nor is subsidized insurance necessary for farm loans. Bankers loan to other nonsubsidized parts of the farm economy without subsidized insurance. There are no good arguments for continuing these subsidies. Most farmers don’t get them right now. Those who do tend to be major corporations and not family farmers. b1600 Now, my amendment preserves subsidies for the next 2 years and then gradually phases them out over the next 10 years, assuring that producers who have grown dependent on these subsidies have plenty of time to adjust their operations. But at the end of this 12year process, we have a much more efficiently functioning agricultural market that is accurately responding to the needs of consumers rather than to the whims of government bureaucrats. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. SIMPSON ). The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETERS on). Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I oppose this amendment. I was here in 1996 when we tried something similar to this. It wasn’t as extreme, but it was supposed to save us a little bit of money. Does the gentleman remember? It ended up costing us five times more than what we saved because it didn’t work. This is a fantasy that is out there for some people. People have no clue how much it costs to farm nowadays, what kind of risks you take in farming. And if you want to make sure that we have a few people farm this whole country, this is the way to do it, because, without crop insurance, without these other backstops, young people and ordinary people will not be able to farm. The people who will farm are people with deep pockets, and that is not what we want in this country. I oppose this amendment. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. CRAWFORD ). Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chairman, where do I begin? I guess it was JFK who said the farmer is the only businessman who—I think he said it this way—who buys retail, sells wholesale, and pays freight both ways. So we are comparing apples and oranges here with a business that is, say, I don’t know, an accountant maybe—I don’t know, Mr. Chairman—and a farmer. Farming is inherently risky, so that is not even debatable. The issue we have here, though, is is it worth it to us as a nation to make an investment in our national security? Our ability to feed ourselves is absolutely crucial to our national security, number one. Number two, we support our farmers at a fraction of what the rest of the world does, and so we get much better value, much better return on investment. I think the disposable income of an average American is somewhere in the 12 percent range, what we spend on food; and if you think about and compare it to, say, in Europe where they are upwards of 20 percent and Japan in the 25 percent range of their disposable income, we get a much better return, much, much better value to the taxpayer. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS ), the former chairman of the committee. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Chairman, why do we invest in agriculture? Because the ability to eat, to feed ourselves is one of the most fundamentally important things that goes on in an economy. We make those investments so that we will always have a sufficient supply of the highest quality food and fiber at the most affordable prices. Empires, countries, republics, democracies have been destroyed throughout history when they lost their ability to feed themselves. I will tell you a strong farm bill, the investment we make is one of the key foundations to protecting the Constitution, just like our responsibilities to have a standing army to defend the coast, to defend the airspace, to defend our folks. Maybe you don’t want to make that investment, maybe you are willing to take a chance, but when we don’t have enough to eat, it will be too late to fix the problem. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I would remind the ranking member that the reason the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill ended up costing us more is because we ended up adding a whole new series of subsidies to it. Experience is important to heed. New Zealand has four times more dependency on agriculture than the United States—they are four times more dependent—and it once maintained an extensive subsidy program just like ours. In 1984, New Zealand ended those subsidies. Well, what happened? Farm productivity rose, farm earnings rose, farm output all rose. What did New Zealand farmers who opposed the ending of subsidies say once those subsidies were removed and the economy responded? The Federated Farmers of New Zealand says that it ‘‘thoroughly debunked the myth that the farming sector cannot prosper without government subsidies.’’ Mr. Chairman, it is long past time to debunk that same myth in our own country, restore to consumers the power to command what producers grow, and restore to producers the accurate price signals they need to maximize their productivity in a free and undistorted market. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, we have got a clearcut choice: you either want American producers to produce American food or you don’t. That is what this is simply about. When I think about the farm bill, you can love it or hate the safety net we have in place, but it works—as the chairman said, the lowest cost price food in the developed world. Here is why that is important. Half of America works paycheck to paycheck. Their food budget is where they flex. Their rent doesn’t change. Their house payment doesn’t change. Their car payment doesn’t change. But if something comes up in the middle of the month, it is coming out of that food budget. I don’t want to make that mom’s job any tougher than it already is by raising the cost of food arbitrarily, capriciously, by ignoring the vast amount of competition around this world that is fundamentally unfair. If we could go to that utopia that my friend from California would like to get us to, fantastic, but we can’t do that. They barely could do it in New Zealand, for goodness’ sake. We could not do that against the rest of the world. I would argue that U.S. production is a bit more complicated than whatever New Zealand might or might not be doing. We have got to compete in a world global market against foreign treasuries that are spending stunningly more money than we are. China spent $100 billion on three products in 1 year to subsidize their products. Now, did that send the wrong signal to those folks? Yes, it did. We farmers and our rice farmers and our other producers have to compete against the prices that are depressed like that. We can’t go against the rest of the world. If the rest of the world will go to a level playing field, I have got not one farmer out there who would say: No, no, no, we want to keep it in place. They want to compete in the cash market. That is where they want to make their money. This amendment would strip them of the ability to do that. We would go to foreignimported food coming at us with standards that are not remotely close to ours, labor that is not closely protected the way ours is. Let’s defeat this McClintock amendment, show the American farmer and rancher out there, who works as hard as anybody in this world, who thinks a 20hour workweek is something they do in their second or third job in order to keep the farm going, let’s show them that we support them. Let’s show them that we have got their back. A ‘‘yes’’ vote for McClintock says: Never mind, we don’t care about you. A ‘‘no’’ vote on McClintock says exactly the message we want to send, and I am hopeful this is a stunningly large vote so that American producers out there, who are some of the hardest working, best people on the face of the Earth, can understand that this Congress understands the unfair foreign competition that they are competing with. Vote ‘‘no’’ on McClintock. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . LAHOOD  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed House Report 115–679. Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle F of title I, insert the following new section: 
(a) O NETIME FILING .—Except as provided in subsection (b), during the first enrollment period announced by the Farm Service Agency after the date of the enactment of this Act, producers on a farm may file a onetime program contract with the Secretary to enroll in agricultural risk coverage or price loss coverage through crop year 2023. (b) UPDATED PROGRAM CONTRACT REQUIRED .—In the case of a change in a farming operation for which producers on a farm have filed a onetime program contract pursuant to subsection (a), such producers shall file an updated program contract with the Secretary not later than one year after such change in the farming operation occurs. (c) NOTICE OF OTHER ANNUAL REPORTING .— The Secretary shall provide to each producer that files a onetime program contract pursuant to subsection (a) a notice that includes the annual and other periodic reporting requirements applicable to such producer, as determined by the Secretary. (d) REGULATIONS REVISED .—The Secretary shall— (1) issue such regulations as are necessary to carry out this section; and (2) revise section 1412.41 of title 7, Code of Federal Regulations, in accordance with this section. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, the amendment I have introduced would streamline a burdensome regulatory requirement currently in place for two USDA programs. The first is the Agriculture Risk Coverage, or ARC, and the Price Loss Coverage, or PLC. My amendment changes the signup process from an annual signup process to a oneanddone process for the duration of the 5year farm bill. Our farmers work tirelessly to provide food for our families, our country, and to grow products that are shipped all over the world. From raising livestock to growing crops such as soybeans and corn, they contribute to the lifeblood of my State of Illinois and also our national economy. To fully support the agriculture community, we must maintain an efficient and effective program and programs that allow our farmers to be globally competitive. Given the tremendous impact of the agriculture industry on the U.S. economy, we must work to ensure that our farmers are able to operate without burdensome and timeconsuming regulatory requirements. My district in central and westcentral Illinois is the eighth largest district in terms of corn and soybean production in the country, and I hear from my farmers across my district and from my own agriculture advisory committee that the amount of time spent filling out paperwork for these programs, even when there is no change to their farming operation, takes up too much of their valuable time which could be used on their farms. Under the current rules, to file an annual contract, farmers need to collect signatures from landlords or other individuals with an interest in the land. Many landlords reside out of the State or out of the country, making this paperwork burdensome and very difficult in many cases. Under our amendment, farmers will be able to and be eligible for a onetime signup for ARC and PLC for the duration of the 5year farm bill so long as there are no changes to the current farming operation. If a farmer does make changes to their farming operation, they must reflect those changes in a new signup, as is the current process. This simple fix will help our farmers spend more time farming and less time filling out paperwork. I want to thank Chairman CONAWAY  and his staff for working with me on this amendment, and I appreciate all of his support for this commonsense reform that is so important to our farmers. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the amendment, although I don’t oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chair, this is common sense, and I support this amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD). The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, though I plan to withdraw this amendment, I seek to enter into a colloquy with my good friend, Chairman CONAWAY , regarding the Conservation Reserve Program and to express concern with the number of acres authorized in the CRP program in H.R. 2. Chairman CONAWAY has been a strong chairman and a leader for America’s farmers, and for that I would like to thank him. CRP is a wellintended program that has a place in protecting sensitive lands; however, the program should not be expanded beyond levels currently authorized in the Agriculture Act of 2014. The Agriculture Act of 2014 reduced the national CRP acreage cap from 32 million acres to 27.5 million acres in 2014 and to 24 million acres in 2018. H.R. 2 would then increase this cap by 1 million acres each year to a maximum enrollment of 29 million acres by 2023. USDA’s Farm Service Agency’s CRP enrollment data reveals that, for the 2016 fiscal year, 23.9 million acres were enrolled in CRP, representing approximately 7 percent of the U.S. cropland. Rental rates and leases offered by the Federal Government are often much more lucrative than farming would be. While congressional directives and a favorable farm economy in prior years led to lower CRP enrollment, nearly onequarter of all land enrolled in CRP has been enrolled for more than 20 years, including 2.7 million acres, or 12 percent, enrolled for more than three decades since the inception of the program. During the 2016 fiscal year, payments for CRP lands totaled $1.7 billion. As our Nation’s farmers and ranchers face the challenge of meeting the increasing demand for food and fiber in the U.S. and abroad, I ask the chairman: Should America’s producers be forced to continue competing with Federal programs for access to farmland? I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for bringing up this important issue. I agree with the gentleman from Alabama that our farmers and ranchers should not be competing with the Federal Government for viable cropland. H.R. 2 makes many changes to the CRP program, such as capping the rental rate payment to 80 percent of the county average and stepping this percentage down for subsequent reenrollments of the same tract. I understand, however, the gentleman’s concerns with the increase in enrolled acres, and I commit to working with the gentleman and his staff on this issue during the coming conference report, should we get there. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for his leadership and commitment. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alabama? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn. b1615 AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . FASO  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in House Report 115–679. Mr. FASO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows:

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentleman from New York (Mr. FASO) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. FASO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment which would provide the USDA the tools it needs to quantifiably measure conservation outcomes. These provisions are substantively the same as a bipartisan bill I introduced earlier this year with Representative MARCIA FUDGE . If included in the farm bill, my amendment would have the USDA measure, evaluate, and report on various conservation programs across the Nation. This information is necessary to help define, evaluate, and justify taxpayer return on conservation investment programs. Right now, the USDA can provide information on the impact of our conservation programs in terms of contracts and acres, but they lack the ability to provide the actual impact of these programs on important resource concerns. By ensuring that the USDA has all of the tools necessary to collect this information, we can better protect and preserve these programs into the future. The USDA’s voluntary conservation programs are consistently helping farmers in initiatives that protect natural resources while also increasing farm productivity. This amendment would ensure that the USDA can continue to improve existing conservation programs and practices while also supporting our Nation’s farmers. Mr. Chairman, we will also seek, in response to concerns that have been raised by the Farm Bureau, to, in conference, further refine the privacy provisions relating to the research activities that would take place under this bill to ensure that any personally identifiable information that would be contained within the analysis of conservation programs is further protected by the United States Department of Agriculture. Mr. CONAWAY. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. FASO. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, Mr. FASO has my commitment to work with him to address the Farm Bureau’s concerns to get them to the point that they are okay with this. I support the gentleman’s amendment under those terms. Mr. FASO. Mr. Chairman, I am encouraged by the support for my amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. FASO). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in House Report 115–679. 
AMENDMENT NO . 8 OFFERED BY MR . MCCLINTOCK  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 115–679. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Beginning on page 250, strike line 25 and all that follows through line 13 on page 253. Page 253, line 14, strike ‘‘(G) 15PERCENT ’’ and insert ‘‘(F) 5PERCENT ’’. Page 254, line 25, strike ‘‘15 percent’’ and insert ‘‘5 percent’’. 
Page 256, line 17, strike ‘‘and’’ at the end. Page 256, after line 17 insert the following: (ii) by striking ‘‘age six’’ and inserting ‘‘3 years of age’’, and Page 256, line 18, strike ‘‘(ii)’’ and insert ‘‘(iii)’’. Page 257, line 2, strike ‘‘or (G) a pregnant woman.’’ and insert ‘‘(G) a married individual who is responsible for a dependent individual and who resides in the household with a spouse who complies with the requirements of paragraph (1)(B); or (H) a pregnant woman.’’. Page 257, line 9, strike ‘‘(iii)’’ and insert ‘‘(iv)’’. Page 257 line 25, strike the close quotation marks, the comma, and ‘‘and’’. Page 257, after line 25, insert the following: ‘‘(iii) EVERIFY .—An employment and training program designed by the State agency may not be approved unless such program requires that each individual who participates in such program is permitted to engage in employment in the United States on the basis of the status of such individual as determined under the employment verification system in effect under section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a).’’, and Page 260, strike lines 24 and 25, and insert the following: (1) in subsection (e)— (A) in paragraph (5)— (i) in subparagraph (A) by striking ‘‘age 6’’ and inserting ‘‘age 3 or of an incapacitated person’’, and (ii) in subparagraph (B) by striking ‘‘of 5’’ and inserting ‘‘of 2’’, (B) in paragraph (7) by striking ‘‘or’’ at the end, (C) in paragraph (8) by striking the period at the end and inserting ‘‘; or’’, and (D) and by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(9) is a married individual who is responsible for a dependent individual and who resides in the household with a spouse who complies with the requirements of subsection (d)(1).’’, and 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, this amendment does two things: It increases from 20 percent to 70 percent the percentage of ablebodied adults in SNAP that would be required to comply with the work requirements in the bill, and it requires the use of the E Verify system to assure that work training is available only to legal residents in this country who are legally entitled to work. H.R. 2 provides for a requirement that workcapable, nonemployed adults look for work or train for work in order to receive SNAP benefits. That is important. When Maine implemented a work requirement for ablebodied welfare recipients, they found that 84 percent of this population left the welfare rolls and, within a year, had doubled their effective pay. Alabama saw the same results. Unfortunately, H.R. 2 would only engage about 20 percent of this population—20 percent. This amendment would boost the work participation rate to 70 percent of ablebodied adults in the program. It does so by implementing changes recommended by The Heritage Foundation. H.R. 2’s work requirement affects parents of children under age 6. This amendment reduces the exemption to those with children under age 3 but with an important difference: H.R. 2’s requirements extend the work requirements to both spouses of children under the age of 6. This, in effect, is a marriage penalty that treats married couples as if they were single. The amendment I offer applies to only one spouse in the family, allowing the parents to share domestic and work responsibilities between themselves in any manner they feel is appropriate. This recognizes, encourages, and rewards marriage as the stable and nurturing environment that it is. H.R. 2 allows States to waive the work requirement in geographic areas defined by them with higherthannormal unemployment rates above 6 percent. This amendment deletes the waiver for an important reason: Where there is high unemployment, there is also more reason to encourage job training and job searching in order to equip recipients to compete in tighter job markets. Sidelining these individuals is selfdefeating both for them and for the local economies. Also, the amendment removes the ability of States to define these geographic areas in a manner that would defeat the work requirement in the first place. H.R. 2 also allows States to exempt 15 percent of the ablebodied population from this work requirement. This amendment takes it to 5 percent. Finally, this amendment requires that SNAP recipients be screened by the EVerify system to assure that training is going only to those who are obeying our laws and are legally in this country. This requirement is essential to the enforcement of our immigration laws. Otherwise, we are spending taxpayer money to train illegal immigrants whom Federal law prohibits from being employed. This amendment transforms the work requirement in H.R. 2 from an empty and symbolic gesture covering just onefifth of the ablebodied population receiving food stamps to more than 70 percent. It rewards, rather than penalizes, married couples and recognizes that the shared responsibilities of marriage are one of the single greatest factors in reducing poverty. Children born into homes with single parents are five times more likely to live in poverty. It is time our policies reflected the importance of marriage in protecting our children. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment by my good friend and colleague from California. I do that respectfully. H.R. 2 includes a substantive, enforceable, and supportive work requirement for workcapable adults 18 to 59. That is 20 percent of the population, 6 million individuals. Waivers and exemptions were modified and even tightened to ensure that only the most vulnerable workcapable adults were waived from the requirement. Waivers take into consideration those areas with excessively high rates of unemployment, while exemptions assist those who need shortterm reprieve because of temporary hardship. Allowing for married couples to fulfill one requirement disengages recipients from the workforce. Work is more than just a paycheck. It provides dignity, social impact, opportunity, and creates the only path to selfsufficiency. One spouse fulfilling a 20hour perweek requirement does not lead to selfsufficiency. It does the exact opposite; it creates a lifetime dependency trap. H.R. 2 provides equitable treatment to all households when promoting work, including those that house cohabiting adults or married adults. Currently, 42 States choose not to use education and training funds to invest in childcare, which is an allowable investment. Reducing the age of the child from 6 to 3 is an undeniable barrier that disincentivizes employment more so than the current programming. Requiring education and training providers to use EVerify on all participants who depend on them for services is just plain cruel. SNAP has eligibility standards in place, and illegal immigrants are not eligible for benefits. This is simply a means to shut out the very organizations and entities that provide these necessary supports for individuals in need. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. FASO). Mr. FASO. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the impetus behind the gentleman from California’s amendment, but I think this amendment, if it were adopted, would threaten to destroy the carefully constructed efforts that we have endeavored to engage in in the committee to create something that was realistic and achievable. Lowering the age from 6 to 3 will make it much more difficult for many SNAP families to comply with the work requirements, and reducing the ability of a State to have a waiver of up to 15 percent of the population will also make it extremely difficult, by reducing that number down to 5 percent. So I think what the committee did was have a finely balanced effort to try 
to move more ablebodied people into work and into training. While the gentleman’s motivations are certainly fine in this regard and he is attempting to get at the right thing, we think that the amendment, if it were adopted, would actually destroy the carefully constructed effort that we have made to try to encourage work and responsibility. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER ). Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Chairman, 42, 23, 89, 200, and 3. These numbers stand out for me. Fortytwo million people will be impacted by the SNAP changes; 23 hearings; 89 witnesses, who didn’t recommend the proposals that we are seeing today; $200 million spent on 10 pilot programs, of which we won’t get the results in time; and 3 years old, the age that we are reducing down from 6 for parents to go to work. These numbers just don’t add up. And one of my concerns is that great proposals might be put on the floor right now, but we had a process, and the process has been flawed, and now we have a flawed product. So, again, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to come back together in the great tradition of the Agriculture Committee and work on a bipartisan piece of legislation that moves Americans into work—meaningful work. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has the right to close. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN ), my colleague on the House Budget Committee. Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank again the gentleman from California for bringing forth this amendment and the gentleman from Texas for all of the work that he did on the bill. I think sometimes, rather than have hearings, you find out a lot more about these Federal programs and particularly the SNAP program if you talk to the local clerks at the convenience stores and the grocery stores and the income maintenance workers in the counties or the people who manage the lowincome housing to find out what really is going on here. I will bring to light one in particular of the four provisions in the amendment: the idea that participants in training programs have to go through EVerify. It has been said that you have to be a citizen to get SNAP anyway. I would suggest talking to some of the income maintenance workers or some of the people who talk to some of the people who use the SNAP program, and I think they will tell you that, whatever the official Federal law is, SNAP is routinely used by people who are not here legally. I think by requiring EVerify for the training programs, we begin to go through the process of making sure that people who are in this country illegally are not taking advantage of taxpayerfunded programs. b1630 I really wish we had more information on this topic, but, again, it is my belief that the average clerk in an average convenience store knows a lot more about the SNAP program than most Ph.D.s in sociology. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I ask support in opposing this amendment from my friend and colleague from California. To my friends across the aisle who keep asking for bipartisan opportunity, you blew the first one. That was in subcommittee, where we could have amendments, and we are not seeing amendments from Members here. So there has been plenty of opportunity for bipartisan work. I do appreciate the recommendations that my Democratic friends made in writing to both the ranking member and the chairman. All of those points and all the titles, I believe, were—I know in the nutrition title they were all incorporated into the base bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. HOLDING ) having assumed the chair, Mr. SIMPSON , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2) to provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. PERMISSION TO CONSIDER AMENDMENT NO. 7 OUT OF SEQUENCE DURING FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2, AGRICULTURE AND NUTRITION ACT OF 2018 Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during further consideration of H.R. 2 in the Committee of the Whole pursuant to House Resolution 900, amendment No. 7 printed in House Report 115–679 may be considered out of sequence. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. f 
AGRICULTURE AND NUTRITION ACT OF 2018 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 900 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 2. Will the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON ) kindly resume the chair. b1632 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 2) to provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and for other purposes, with Mr. SIMPSON  (Acting Chair) in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The Acting CHAIR. When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, a request for a recorded vote on amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 115–679 offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) had been postponed.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTENBERRY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Chairman, first, let me thank my good friend Chairman CONAWAY for working with us on this very important amendment. Mr. Chair, I would like to share a story with you. I just got off the phone with Archie Devoor from Lincoln, Nebraska. Archie grew up as a dairy farmer. He started milking cows at 12 and, up at 12 a.m., got slapped in the face quite a lot with a wet tail. He put himself through college doing that and went on and earned a Ph.D. in dairy science. He did agricultural extension work for 20 years and became involved with a very important United States Government program called Farmerto Farmer. One of Archie’s experiences was in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has as many dairy cows as we do in the United States, and we have 12 times the production capacity as they do. Through Archie’s work, through the techniques that he has provided them, particularly nutrition guidance, he has helped solve one of those problems that exists around the world with structural poverty and not enough to eat. In fact, the Bangladeshis wanted to name him ‘‘Father of modern dairy.’’ He is a humble man, my constituent, and I am proud of his work. And, of course, he refuses that title. Nonetheless, Mr. Chairman, the amendment before us today addresses this very important program. This program has connected volunteer American farmers, agriculture extension experts, and others with deep knowledge of agriculture production with farmers abroad as well as agricultural experts from American universities to other countries around the globe. The sharing of America’s agricultural expertise dramatically enhances the capacity of people elsewhere to grow their own food. Really, Mr. Chairman, this initiative is about three things. It is about the richness of America’s farm experience. It is about an engine of economic regeneration in the fight against structural global poverty. And it also, I believe, will enhance our 21st century architecture of emerging diplomatic relations. This program was initially authorized in 1985, and it has been in subsequent farm bills and, again, has promoted sustainable economic growth, food security, and agricultural development worldwide. All 50 States have been represented in volunteer trips overseas to assist farmers, and specialists from a variety of agricultural disciplines have taught hostcountry farmers in over 100 nations through coordination with 12,000 different local host organizations. The growth of the program has fostered community ecosystems of sustainable agriculture. It has enhanced the ability to access new markets and conserved environmental and natural resources. The work of our American farmers has borne great fruit overseas, and, with some innovative rethinking, I think we can help fully realize this program’s potential. This amendment serves three critical objectives. First, it elevates the role of the United States Department of Agriculture in coordinating sequencing and prioritizing farmer visits to host countries. Second, it establishes geographically defined crop yield metrics, a system to assess whether improvements in crop yields in countries receiving our assistance are actually occurring. Third, the data generated through this new metric will be available publicly. It is important to note that the amendment enhances outreach to identify and prioritize new implementing partners, increases the diversity of program participants, and serves to expand recruitment of new volunteers from diverse agricultural knowledge and skill backgrounds. Mr. Chairman, I believe this amendment will also better support our work in global food security programs that already exist and have wide congressional backing. We have an important moment here to renew, innovate, and modernize a very good program. Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY ). Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman’s amendment. This actually is America at her best. It is taking American expertise, going peopletopeople across this world, and sharing the great techniques we are developing here. And while that might make those host countries a little more competitive with our production of agriculture here in America, it is the right thing to do. Mr. Chair, I support the amendment, and I appreciate Mr. FORTENBERRY ’s dedication not only to this specific issue but his broader work across the international arena that he has shown his expertise in. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for his comments, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTEN BERRY ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 9 OFFERED BY MR . MACARTHUR  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in House Report 115–679. Mr. MACARTHUR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 247, line 23, strike ‘‘(I)’’ and insert ‘‘(J)’’. Page 256, line 13, strike the close quotation marks and the comma at the end. Page 256, after line 13, insert the following: ‘‘(I) HOUSEHOLD INELIGIBILTY .—If an individual becomes ineligible to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance program as a household member due to failure to meet the requirements under subparagraph (B), the remaining household members (including children), shall not become ineligible to apply to participate in the supplemental nutrition assistance program due to such individual’s ineligibility.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. M ACARTHUR ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. MACARTHUR. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman of the Agriculture Committee for his help and support and for crafting a farm bill that I think will benefit a great many Americans. Mr. Chair, this bill benefits both farmers and consumers across the country. Even in a densely populated State like mine, New Jersey, the most densely populated State in the Nation, I have over 800 family farms that will benefit from this bill. I have cranberry and blueberry growers that will benefit from specialty crop grants. Our main State university, Rutgers, will benefit from research grants. There are crop insurance provisions, conservation measures, things that will benefit all of us. But let’s face it: the most controversial part of this bill, or at least one of the most controversial parts, has been the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP. Of the $867 billion of authorized spending over the next 10 years, $664 billion, or more than 75 percent, is for this one program. This has been bipartisan, up until now at least. It has always been that the Federal Government would partner with States to help the most vulnerable people in the Nation, and, at the same time, we would help those people towards selfsufficiency, help them prepare to enter the workforce so that they can have the dignity that comes with a job. I think every American deserves this. We have always balanced both compassion and individual responsibility, and I think this bill goes a long way to continuing in that tradition. My amendment is about children. It is imperative, as we continue this balance, that no child gets caught up, even unintentionally, in something harmful. No child can go to school on an empty stomach and learn, and no child should have to come home from school and wonder where their next meal is coming from. There is a lot in this bill already that protects children. I recognize that. I recognize that the committee has been very attentive to this. My amendment goes a little farther and makes it explicitly clear to those who administer the SNAP programs around the country that children cannot be harmed in any way. I will read the relevant part of the amendment. It says: ‘‘If an individual becomes ineligible to participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as a household member due to failure to meet the requirements under subparagraph (B), the remaining household members (including children), shall not become ineligible to apply to participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program due to such individual’s ineligibility.’’ In other words, kids are off limits. Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I do want to say a few words, and that is, I am trying to understand this amendment, because I really don’t understand the point of it. Under current law, children can still get SNAP even if their parents fail to comply with work requirements. That is the current law. H.R. 2, the farm bill, does nothing to change this, so I am unsure why this amendment has been offered. I think I would classify this amendment as a coveringyourrearend amendment, because the bottom line is that there is a lot in H.R. 2 that I think does harm to children, because when their parents are thrown off of SNAP, while they may not be thrown off of SNAP, the overall household allowance for food gets decreased, and so there is less food for the entire family. I would say that if the majority really cared about the impact H.R. 2 would have on children, then they would address the changes that have been made in broadbased categorical eligibility, which will throw working parents off of SNAP. According to CBO, the nonpartisan experts that we rely on to give us data, over 265,000 students will lose access to free school meals. So there is nothing to be opposed to, I guess, because this is already current law. But I would say to the gentleman that broadbased categorical eligibility, the changes in this bill, are going to adversely impact a number of individuals in New Jersey. With that alone, 35,000 individuals are going to lose their SNAP benefits. That is just on this one part of the bill. Many of them have kids, and the changes are going to affect these kids. So, if you really care about these kids, I would urge you to reject this bill. Send it back to the Agriculture Committee. Let’s work in a bipartisan way and construct a nutrition title which everybody understands, which is clear, which has been vetted, and which we can come to the floor and say with certainty that it will not adversely impact kids. Because this underlying bill, no matter how you want to slice and dice it, will have a negative impact on kids. b1645 And this amendment, you go home and maybe do a press release on it, but it doesn’t change the impact of this bill. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MACARTHUR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I regret my friend’s confusion over what it does, but, as he well knows, we pass sometimes this much law and those who implement that pass this much, in terms of how it actually gets played out. This amendment makes it explicitly clear to those who administer the SNAP program that children must be held harmless, they must be protected. On top of that, the underlying bill also stops family sanctioning. So you can call it a beltandsuspenders approach, but, when it comes to children, I think it is worth making it as crystalclear as possible that they cannot be harmed. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY  DAVIS). Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman’s amendment. Much to the chagrin of many who just oppose any changes to actually help us get children out of poverty and out of the cycle of poverty that perpetual SNAP benefits bring to families, I would argue that it is language like this that reasserts the fact that we need to, as this goes through the legislative process—we are in the second step of the legislative process. As this goes through the process, this clearly shows all of us here in the House and in the Senate and on a conference committee the opportunity that we want to make sure that we protect those who need that protection. That is exactly why I am glad Mr. MACARTHUR participated in this process. The gentleman wanted to make this bill better. The gentleman wanted to strengthen it to ensure that our children in the most vulnerable households had the opportunity to get the food that they need. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for doing that. I think this is a great addition to the farm bill, and I appreciate the gentleman yielding me this opportunity to say so. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I am at a loss. We have no opposition to this amendment, but let’s be honest with each other and let’s be honest with our constituents. H.R. 2 will hurt families, will hurt working families, will hurt kids. You know one thing that is also explicit, Mr. Chairman? According to CBO, 265,000 kids will be thrown off of the free breakfast and lunch program. That is according to CBO. The other thing that is clear is that there are working families—there are working families, Mr. Chairman, people who work, who now get SNAP benefits, who, because we are eliminating broadbased categorical eligibility, a number of them will lose their benefits. And they still work. Their family 
households, therefore, will have less of a food allowance. That will impact these kids. That is undeniable. So don’t sit here and say this shows that we are going to protect kids. The law is the law. If you want to restate the law, restate it. Restate it 100 times, ‘‘don’t hurt kids.’’ That doesn’t change the fact that this bill will hurt kids. That is why so many of us on this side of the aisle and, hopefully, a number of you on your side of the aisle are going to stand strong and oppose this. This is not right. There was a right way to do this farm bill, and there was a wrong way to do this farm bill. This was the wrong way. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MACARTHUR. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 30 seconds remaining. Mr. MACARTHUR. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ), my friend. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. Mr. Chairman, we have heard about broadbased categorical eligibility. If this was a SNAP brochure, Mr. Chairman, and I hand this to you, regardless of what your income is, if you accept this SNAP brochure, you are now eligible for SNAP. That is broadbased categorical eligibility. Mr. Chairman, if somebody offers you an 800 number to call regarding SNAP, which is a good thing, as is the brochure, and you use that number, under broadbased categorical eligibility, you are now eligible for SNAP, no matter what your income is. So, if it has been found that some families will come off, it is because it has been found that there are families who already exceed the income. Now, here is the thing. If they just go and fill out the application, they can be eligible for SNAP if they meet those financial and asset requirements. Mr. MACARTHUR. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have left. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 1 minute remaining. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, the CBO, the nonpartisan experts that we all rely on, says that over 400,000 households will lose their benefits because of the changes in H.R. 2 with regard to categorical eligibility. We estimate that to be a million people. That is undeniable. So you can sit here all you want and say this is going to hold everybody harmless and that kids won’t suffer. It is just not true. I mean, read the CBO score. Better yet, read the bill. Look, we have no objection to you passing a restatement of current law, because current law says that, even if parents don’t comply, their kids can’t be punished. But make no mistake about it, the overall food allowance in that household will decrease. That is a fact. That will impact those kids. So, if you truly want to help kids, if you truly care about kids, you will vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. You will vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 2. You will make sure that this bill goes back to committee, that we have a bipartisan process, and we have a bill that comes to the floor that helps our farmers and that helps those in need in this country. This is not it. This does not help kids. This amendment does nothing. This is a coveringyourrearend amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. MAC ARTHUR ). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting Chair. The Chair understands that amendment No. 10 will not be offered. 
AMENDMENT NO . 11 OFFERED BY MR . HOLDING  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in House Report 115–679. Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle A of title IV, insert the following: 
Section 6 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2015), as amended by section 4015, is amended in subsection (p)(1)— (1) in subparagraph (A) by striking ‘‘: and’’ at the end and inserting a period, and (2) by striking subparagraph (B). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HOLDING ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment, and I urge all colleagues to support its inclusion in the farm bill today. Mr. Chairman, the amendment is simple. It ends eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for convicted rapists, murderers, and those guilty of sexual exploitation. The 2014 farm bill contained a prohibition for these individuals from being eligible for SNAP, but the individual also has to be considered a fleeing felon. This means that, in order to lose eligibility, the person has to not only be a convicted murderer, rapist, et cetera, but they also must be in violation of the terms of their sentence. Mr. Chairman, I believe we should not have to wait before a criminal who has already been convicted of these acts violates the terms of their sentence before terminating the benefits. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would eliminate the fleeing felon provision from the underlying law and thereby prohibits convicted rapists, pedophiles, murderers, et cetera, from being eligible for SNAP. This is a commonsense proposal that says if you commit these atrocious crimes that you are ineligible for this government program. Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this commonsense amendment and include it in the farm bill that we have under consideration. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HOLDING). The amendment was agreed to. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in House Report 115–679. Miss GONZALEZCOLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment to H.R. 2 at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle A of title IV, insert the following: 
SEC. ll. DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF BLOCK GRANT PAYABLE TO PUERTO RICO. 
(a) S TUDY .—With funds appropriated to carry out this subsection, the Secretary of Agriculture shall conduct a study to determine the feasibility and impact of using a thrifty food plan developed exclusively to apply under section 19(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2028(a)(2)(A)) to calculate the amount of the block grant payable to Puerto Rico. (b) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS .— There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out subsection (a). (c) APPROPRIATION IN ADVANCE .—Only funds appropriated under subsection (b) in advance specifically to carry out subsection (a) shall be available to carry out such subsection. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZ COLO´N) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico. Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 2. Mr. Chairman, this amendment aims to take a deeper look into the Thrifty Food Plan and how it influences the amount of funds currently calculated for Nutrition Assistance Block Grants provided to Puerto Rico through the Nutrition Assistance Program, NAP. Puerto Rico is currently included in the Thrifty Food Plan of the 48 contiguous States. However, the island imports most food items that are sold in stores, which increases the cost families pay when purchasing foods included in their diet. 
Mr. Chairman, my amendment will require the Secretary of Agriculture to produce a report on the feasibility and impact of Puerto Rico having its own Thrifty Food Plan. This will allow the government of Puerto Rico and the Department of Family, which administers the program on the island, to make an educated decision on how to move forward in terms of acquiring benefits and addressing factors that reflect increases in the cost of food items found and purchased on the island. My second amendment will request the Secretary of Agriculture to produce an update on a 2010 report previously generated by the Food and Nutrition Service Agency at the USDA. That report will indicate the percentage of households that will receive nutritional assistance and what the average monthly benefit per household would be if Puerto Rico were treated equally under the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, SNAP. As approved by the 2014 farm bill, Puerto Rico’s cash portion of benefits obtained through NAP will gradually be reduced by 5 percent each year until 2021—right now, that measure is waived by this administration because of the hurricane—when all NAP benefits will be then available through the electronic benefit transfer system. In view of this and in preparation for this, we must start considering if a transition to SNAP is feasible or not and, if so, what it would mean for my constituency in terms of benefits and requirements. An updated study will allow us to have recent data to properly consider making this decision along with the government of Puerto Rico and the Federal Government. Mr. Chairman, my amendments essentially seek better facts and better data on the nutritional benefits my constituents receive and depend on. For many families on the island, this is the main source of nutritional assistance. As Puerto Rico’s sole Representative here in Congress, it is my responsibility to make sure that we have the tools and information we need at hand to collaborate with State officials and make those decisions that will continue to help families on the island maintain proper access to a quality diet and, therefore, a proper quality of life. Mr. Chairman, decisions that are this important and delicate should not be subjected to guesswork but based on updated facts, and my two amendments will do that. Mr. Chairman, I also want to share that these amendments, as drafted, do not increase mandatory spending. And, last, I would like to urge my colleagues to support these two amendments, and I want to thank the chairman of the Agriculture Committee for helping me out in drafting my amendments and helping the people of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 13 OFFERED BY MR . FASO  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in House Report 115–679. Mr. FASO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made in order by the rule. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle A of title IV, insert the following: 
Section 11(e)(6)(B) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(6)(B)) is amended to read as follows: ‘‘(B) personnel of the State agency or, at the option of the State agency and by contract with the State agency, personnel of an entity that has no direct or indirect financial interest in an approved retail food store, may undertake such certification or carry out any other function of the State agency under the supplemental nutrition assistance program and without restriction by the Secretary on the State agency’s use of nongovernmental employees to perform program eligibility or any other administrative function to carry out such program;’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentleman from New York (Mr. FASO) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. FASO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer my amendment, which would provide States additional flexibility to administer the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. If included in the farm bill, this amendment would provide States the option, not a mandate, to determine the appropriate mix of government staff and service provider staff for all administrative SNAP functions. It would build on existing SNAP administrator flexibility within employment and training programs as well as technology initiatives like electronic benefits transfer. This barrier, currently in the SNAP law dating from the 1970s, prevents the implementation of commonsense administrative solutions that include integrated call centers, leveraging investment to modernize programs, and incorporate best practices and the ability to address periodic peaks in enrollment activity that accompany times of economic distress. b1700 Mr. Chairman, I know that at least a dozen Governors sent a letter to the leadership of the House and Senate today saying that States across the country have been calling for administrative flexibility to implement various government programs, and it is time that we provide each State the choice to decide what is best for them in their overall effectiveness in running these programs. Mr. Chairman, I would also like to thank my partners in this amendment, Representatives HARTZLER , P OLIQUIN , MARSHALL , and G OODLATTE , who are supportive of this policy change. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this commonsense amendment and provide the States with added flexibility, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment. This proposal opens the door to sweeping changes in how States can operate SNAP. The amendment, which was never debated or discussed by the committee, could result in tens of thousands of American jobs being shipped overseas. I know Donald Trump wants to create more jobs in China, but I don’t think we do. This risks goodpaying civil service jobs and puts benefits and services to vulnerable households at risk. SNAP’s merit system ensures workers’ aim is to effectively implement program rules unhindered by private interests or profit motives. Some SNAP operational functions can be appropriately turned over to private contractors, such as computer systems, custodial services, or debit card issuance in order to leverage businesses’ competitive advantage. Some, however, like eligibility determination, must remain a government function. Some SNAP clients, including many elderly, have very complex cases that require trained professional civil service workers to dedicate significant time to appropriately screen and verify their information, and ensure they receive the correct benefit levels, which is important. Good local jobs likely could be exported out of the area or overseas. In many areas, including rural regions, civil service jobs offer some of the best paying, most stable employment for local workers. Privatizing core SNAP functions would mean many of these jobs would be moved to other locations, including overseas. Why do we want to do that? Privatization could also compromise the security of a participant’s data. SNAP collects detailed information about applicants and participants, including Social Security numbers, household composition and income, and employment information. Handing private data of millions of individuals over to private companies raises serious concerns about their ability to keep it secure, and their interest in using it for other purposes. I respect the gentleman’s intentions, I guess, but I think if we had spent some time in the committee actually discussing this, some of these concerns that I raise would be apparent. So this is a bad idea, a bad amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. FASO. Mr. Chairman, in response to the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts’ comments, I would simply suggest that what this amendment is trying to do is: number one, give the States the option to utilize modern management techniques in terms of the operation of the SNAP program. It is an option. It is not a mandate. Number two, I would point out that various programs such as TANF, and such as the Children’s Health Insurance Program also have the ability to do precisely what I am suggesting in this amendment. This is not unusual. This is not sending jobs overseas. That is an absurd notion, I believe. The fact of the matter is, we are trying to make it possible for States to seamlessly run these programs, whether it is TANF, whether it is housing assistance, whether it is the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or whether it is Medicaid. Those programs, States already have the option and already have the ability to use social service nonprofit organizations like Catholic Charities to assist them in eligibility determinations, to assist States in assisting recipients in getting into employment and training programs. So what this amendment is seeking to do is to eliminate the exclusion of that ability that is now only in the SNAP program. Mr. Chairman, it is only in the SNAP program that we exclude the opportunity for States to have these kind of abilities, to have these services performed by nonprofit organizations and by other providers that can efficiently and seamlessly coordinate the benefits and eligibility that exists for TANF, that exists for children’s health insurance, that exists for a whole panoply of social services programs. Mr. Chairman, I regret the gentleman from Massachusetts’ opposition to the amendment. I hope he would reconsider, given the fact that CHIP and all of these other programs—which the gentleman supports already—permit doing precisely what I am suggesting here, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 2
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I am not going to reconsider my opposition. I think this is a bad amendment, plain and simple. And I think the issues like determining eligibility for who can receive SNAP should not be contracted out to some private company. I do worry about creating more jobs overseas and losing very good jobs here at home. So if you are concerned about keeping good jobs—and these are good jobs, civil service jobs—here in the United States, then you have got to oppose this amendment. Shifting core SNAP functions to private workers could disrupt timely and accurate benefits. In H.R. 2, we are going after vulnerable populations in a very, very harsh way, and I think this would complicate things even worse. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding. Let me very quickly say that my first statement is my opposition to this bill. I can’t imagine the cut of $23 billion out of our food nutrition program, nor can I understand the breaching of the relationship between our support for farmers and our support for poor people. I appreciate my good friend, Mr. FASO, but I have to stand in strong opposition to his amendment which would authorize States to privatize and contract out program eligibility and other administrative functions. Mr. Chair, I come from Texas. We tried it. It was an enormous drain on the budget. It didn’t work. It was costly. People lost their benefits. It is a terrible idea because removing SNAP’s merit staffing requirement would prioritize profit, disrupt access to food assistance, and export good jobs. The SNAP merit system ensures that an employee’s core mission objective is to effectively implement program rules unhindered by private interests or profit motives. Many SNAP clients, including the elderly and disabled, have complex cases that require trained professional civil service workers to dedicate significant time. When these functions are turned over to forprofit companies, there is a different priority, Mr. Chairman. They focus on the bottom line rather than providing comprehensive support. Your constituents of this program are the elderly and children and disabled. In the early 2000s, Texas transferred most of the operational aspects of its eligibility determination system to a private contractor with disastrous results. Services deteriorated as backlogs and other inefficiencies increased. There were 127,000 children who were dropped from health insurance. I am opposed to this legislation. Let’s do what is right, Mr. Chairman, for the children. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to Amendment No. 13 offered by the gentleman from New York, Congressman FASO, which would authorize states to privatize and contract out program eligibility and other administrative functions. This is a terrible idea because removing SNAP’s merit staffing requirement would prioritize profit, disrupt access to food assistance, and export good jobs. SNAP’s merit system ensures that an employee’s core mission objective is to effectively implement program rules unhindered by private interests or profit motives. Many SNAP clients, including the elderly and disabled, have complex cases that require trained, professional civil service workers to dedicate significant time to appropriately screen and verify their information and ensure they receive the correct benefit levels. When these functions are turned over to for profit companies, they focus on the bottom line rather than providing comprehensive support to the needy. This is what we saw in Texas when the state experimented with privatization. In the early 2000’s Texas transferred most of the operational aspects of its eligibility determination system to a private contractor with disastrous results. Services deteriorated as backlogs and other inefficiencies increased. The contractor’s monthly abandoned call rate was four times higher than what was called for in the contract; more than 127,000 children were dropped from health insurance between December 2005 and April 2006; and thousands of experienced state employees were laid off or quit and replaced by poorly trained, lowpaid vendor employees. Former Texas Comptroller, Carole Keeton Strayhorn, after conducting an audit of the system, stated that the ‘‘project has failed the state and the citizens it was designed to serve’’ and called the privatization effort a ‘‘perfect story of wasted tax dollars, reduced access to services and profiteering at taxpayers’ expense.’’ Additionally, the Faso Amendment puts at risk good local jobs that likely could be exported out of the area or overseas. In many areas, including rural regions, civil service jobs offer some of the bestpaying, most stable employment for local workers. Privatizing core SNAP functions would mean many of these jobs would be moved to other locations, including overseas. Diminishing the pool of good jobs with steady hours and benefits could leave many out of work or with less stable options, hurting local economies. An added danger of privatization is that it could compromise the security of participants’ data. SNAP collects detailed information about applicants and participants, including social security numbers, household composition, and income and employment information. Handing private data of millions of individuals over to private companies raises serious concerns about their ability to keep it secure and their interests in using it for other purposes. Shifting core SNAP functions to private workers could disrupt timely and accurate provision of benefits. During the early 2000’s, Texas experimented with privatizing key pieces of the eligibility process, including accepting applications, advising clients on program requirements and eligibility, and verifying eligibility. The results were disastrous. Thousands were unable to apply or were given misinformation and many received incorrect benefit allotments. Individuals’ private information was released, compromising their security. And taxpayer dollars were wasted—none of the promises of improved performance or costsavings were realized. I urge all Members to join me in voting no to Amendment No. 13. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FASO. Mr. Chairman, to close on the amendment, let me reiterate. This amendment simply seeks to treat States’ flexibility for SNAP the same 
as it does, as current law does, for TANF, for a host of other social services programs, and for CHIP. I would also point out, in response to the gentleman from Massachusetts’ concern, the States that do this for CHIP and use nonprofit organizations to assist them in eligibility and other determinations, explicitly prohibit the outsourcing of these jobs to foreign countries, and many even prohibit the outsourcing of any job out of State. So the gentleman raises a red herring that is not appropriate in this context, and should not be considered. This simply gives the States the flexibility to seamlessly manage the SNAP program and coordinate the benefits as they might have for home heating assistance, or they might have for CHIP, or they might have for TANF. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. FASO). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 14 OFFERED BY MR . YOUNG OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14 printed in House Report 115–679. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle A of title IV, insert the following: 
SEC. ll. SERVICE OF TRADITIONAL FOODS IN PUBLIC FACILITIES. 
Section 4033 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (128 STAT. 818) is amended— (1) in subsection (c)— (A) by inserting ‘‘, a State, a country equivalent, or a local education agency,’’ after ‘‘programs’’ the 1st place it appears, (B) by striking ‘‘ and facilities operated by tribal organizations, that primarily serve Indians’’ and inserting ‘‘and federally funded child nutrition and senior meal programs,’’, and (2) in subsection (d)(1)— (A) by striking ‘‘and’’ the 1st place it appears, and (B) by inserting ‘‘, a State, a county or county equivalent, a local educational agency, and an entity or person authorized to facilitate the donation, storage, preparation, or serving of traditional food by the operator of a food service program’’ after ‘‘organization’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It is to make sure Alaska Natives and American Indian populations are able to access traditional foods in nutrition programs. Many American Indians and Alaska Natives incorporate traditional foods: fish, game, seafood, wild berries, and plants into their daily diets. These foods are locally sourced and culturally significant. The cultural significance of traditional foods is especially important in longterm care and hospital settings, where individuals are likely to be away from their homes for extended periods and are unable to easily carry on their traditions. It is likewise important for Native youth to have access to traditional foods for proper nutrition and cultural heritage. May I say, Mr. Chairman, when you are in a hospital you can recover faster if you have a traditional food. This amendment builds on a previous provision of mine in the 2014 farm bill that authorized donation and serving of traditional foods which meet the safety standards and in facilities that serve these indigenous populations. It applies to programs encompassing residential childcare, child nutrition programs, hospitals, longterm care facilities, and others. There have been no documented safety issues and the food handling and storage safety standards incorporated in my previous amendment are stringent. The standards were, in part, based on successful standards from Alaska which has long led the way for safety procedures for traditional foods. For years, this provision has led the way to safely offer traditional foods to the vulnerable populations that need it the most. My amendment maintains these standards. This amendment tonight, like the previous one, has no budgetary effects. That is for those who do not want to spend any more money. It simply works to ensure that Native American and Alaska Native youth and elders can participate in nutrition programs and access traditional foods, regardless of the facility in which the program is implemented. This is important, given that child nutrition and senior meal programs that serve a significant number of natives are sometimes housed in facilities that are not specifically designated as Tribal, and the legislation is truly focused on the importance of nutrition. This amendment should be heavily and heartily accepted and passed. I strongly urge adoption of this amendment. It is about nutrition, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, it is with great reluctance that I rise in opposition to the gentleman’s amendment. If it were limited to just to Alaska, then that might be one thing, but the underlying language is too broad. It would allow this to happen across the United States, and I have some concerns about food safety with respect to that. I understand what he is trying to get at, and I agree with the intent in making that, but I reluctantly disagree, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PETERSON ), the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I have been to Alaska with Mr. YOUNG a number of times and know the culture up there and what is going on. This is a good amendment. I think it makes a lot of sense for Alaska, and I support it. So I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman. Again, I understand why the chairman is against this, but we have no cases where there has been any food hazards, food abuses, or anything like that. And I have to describe one thing to my colleagues. I am 85 years old. I am an Alaska Native. I have lived in one of the villages up north. My diet has consisted of seal meat, seal oil, whale meat, whale oil, and berries. I am an older man. I am in a hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, or I am in a longterm care facility to take care of me, and they serve me, of all things, a chicken, or they will serve me some salty Spam. b1715 That is not too bad by the way. 
But things that will not make me well. And in my mind I desire and my body craves what I have eaten during the history of my life. And that keeps me weller. In fact, I might be able to go home and be able to harvest those things that I love. 
This is all I am trying to do in facilities. This is a good amendment. I know there has been opposition from some of the Federal agencies: Oh, this is a safety issue. Keep in mind, this is an issue that takes care of that person who is receiving that food. Mr. Chairman, I would urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this legislation. It should happen for those people, my Alaskan Natives. It is important. Mr. Chairman, I don’t have any other speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG ). The amendment was agreed to. 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 15 printed in House Report 115–679. Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle A of title IV, insert the following: 
SEC. ll. EXTENSION OF STUDY ON COMPARABLE ACCESS TO SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE FOR PUERTO RICO. 
(a) A MENDMENTS .—Section 4142 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–246; 122 STAT. 1881) is amended— (1) in subsection (b) by striking ‘‘this Act’’ and inserting ‘‘Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018’’, and (2) in subsection (d)(1) by striking ‘‘2008’’ and inserting ‘‘2018’’. (b) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS .— There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out section 4142 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–246; 122 STAT. 1881) as amended by subsection (a). (c) APPROPRIATION IN ADVANCE .—Only funds appropriated under subsection (b) in advance specifically to carry out section 4142 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–246; 122 STAT. 1881) as amended by subsection (a) shall be available to carry out such section as so amended. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZ COLO´N) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico. Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chairman, I spoke about the two amendments before, so I am going to be brief now in speaking about this amendment, not without thanking Chairman CONAWAY for helping us out to get this amendment through. Amendment No. 15 will just request an update on the survey in the request of data for the island. This second amendment requests the Secretary of Agriculture to produce an update on the 2010 report previously generated by the Food and Nutrition Service Agency at the USDA. That report will indicate the percentage of households that will receive nutritional assistance and what the average monthly benefit to their household will be if Puerto Rico were treated equally under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP. We don’t receive that. As approved in the 2014 farm bill, Puerto Rico’s cash portion of the benefit obtained through the NAP program will gradually be reduced by 5 percent each year through 2021. Of course, that situation, that 5 percent reduction has been waived since last year by the administration because of the hurricane situation, but all NAP benefits would then be available through the electronic benefit transfer system, the EBT. In view and in preparation for this, we are beginning to consider the transition to SNAP, if it is feasible or not, and I do think it is feasible. So we are looking forward to having a report that will allow us to know what kind of benefits my constituents will be receiving. An updated study will allow us to have recent data to properly consider making this decision, along with the Government of Puerto Rico. My amendment will essentially seek better facts and better data on the nutritional benefits my constituents, the people of Puerto Rico, receive and depend on. For many families on the island, as you may know, this is the main source of nutritional assistance. I am the only representative of the people of Puerto Rico here and in the Senate, and it is my responsibility to make sure we receive that kind of data. The last time was in 2010. We are in 2018 without an update of that report. So we look forward to having the tools and information we need at hand to collaborate with State officials and the Federal Government to enable those families to continue to receive those kinds of services and the island to maintain a proper access to a quality diet and, therefore, a proper quality of life. Those decisions need to be made by updated facts and not subjected to guesswork by some officials. I do believe that this amendment, as drafted, does not increase mandatory spending, so it will require just data. That is what we need. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 16 OFFERED BY MR . BIGGS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 16 printed in House Report 115–679. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Strike page 382, line 8, and all that follows through page 386, line 19, and insert the following: 
SEC. 6402. REPEAL OF DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE BIOENERGY SUBSIDY PROGRAMS AND OTHER RELATED SUBSIDY PROGRAMS. 
Title IX of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 8101 et seq.) is hereby repealed. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is straightforward. It merely eliminates the bioenergy subsidy programs that were established way back in title IX of the 2002 farm bill some 16 years ago. Those programs are the Biobased Markets Program; the Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical, and Biobased Product Manufacturing Assistance Program; the Repowering Assistance Program; the Biodiesel Fuel Education Program; the Rural Energy for America Program; the Biomass Research and Development Initiative; the Feedstock Flexibility Program for Bioenergy Producers; the Biomass Crop Assistance Program; and the Community Wood Energy Program. President Reagan said that there is nothing quite as everlasting as a Federal program, and I am hoping that we can end some of these programs today. Needless to say, subsidies have no place in a free market. If biofuels are to succeed, it should be based on their benefit to the Nation’s overall energy economy, not because they receive taxpayer funds. Mr. Chairman, I urge all my colleagues to end this Washington giveaway, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his amendment; however, I believe it is a little bit misguided. The programs that the amendment would eliminate are not energy subsidies. What these programs do is to create infrastructure and market opportunities for America’s farmers, ranchers, and rural communities. Furthermore, these programs often leverage private capital that actually works toward revitalizing our communities. Additionally, while I strongly support the RFS and biofuels production, these programs do not incentivize the production of corn ethanol, do not fund ethanol blender pumps, and are not part of the renewable fuels mandate. The Biggs amendment strikes infrastructurefocused initiatives that help farmers and ranchers improve energy efficiency in their operations and increase commercial opportunities for agricultural products. Mr. Chairman, I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Chairman, I respect my colleague’s reasoned opposition, although I disagree with him. I appreciate his passion on the issue, and I have no doubt that he and I will work together on many future projects. But with this, Mr. Chairman, I continue to hold my position and would urge the passage of my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. NOEM), who is my good friend and colleague. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the Biggs amendment as well. This amendment would repeal the bioenergy programs established in the 2002 farm bill. These programs encourage investment in small towns. Not only do they encourage renewable fuels—and to me, that is a national security issue—but they also 
create jobs and investments that bring these benefits to our rural communities, our States, and our country. Not only that, but they also create new demand for many agricultural products. H.R. 2 already makes reforms. It eliminates mandate funding and reauthorizes programs that reduce discretionary funding levels. This amendment is not necessary because, instead of improving successful programs, it repeals them, eliminating all their successes, while not saving any taxpayer money. Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to vote against this amendment. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague’s position, and I regrettably must disagree with that position and continue to urge passage of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague, Mr. BIGGS. It is great to have this opportunity to talk about what we believe the impact of this amendment will be to many of the constituents that I serve in rural America. I appreciate the opportunity to debate. That is what this House is about, and that is what this process is about. I would like to thank my colleague for offering this amendment, although I do disagree and urge my colleagues to vote against. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 115–679 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following order: Amendment No. 1 by Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Amendment No. 3 by Mr. MCCLINTOCK  of California. Amendment No. 8 by Mr. MCCLINTOCK  of California. Amendment No. 13 by Mr. FASO of New York. Amendment No. 16 by Mr. BIGGS of Arizona.

The Acting CHAIR (Mr. G ALLAGHER ). It is now in order to consider amendment No. 17 printed in House Report 115–679. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 386, line 23, insert ‘‘(a) I NGENERAL .— ’’ before ‘‘Section’’. Page 387, after line 5, insert the following: (b) EXCLUSION OF ALCOHOL PRODUCTS FROM DEFINITION .—Section 231(a)(5) of such Act (7 U.S.C. 1632a(a)(5)) is amended by adding below subparagraph (B) the following: ‘‘The term ‘valueadded agricultural product’ does not include beer, wine, distilled spirits, hard cider, or other alcohol product.’’. (c) RESCISSION .—Of the funds made available under section 231(b)(7)(A) of the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 (as in effect before the date of the enactment of this section) to the Secretary of Agriculture to make valueadded agricultural product market development grants and unobligated as of such date of enactment, $8,000,000 is hereby rescinded. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Chairman, this amendment addresses but redirects; it does not eliminate any funds from the Value Added Producer Grants. These $18 million worth of grants are designed to generate new products, expand market opportunities, and assist beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, family farms, and even veterans entering farming. Unfortunately, millions of these funds go to fund alcohol products. While there is nothing inherently wrong with alcohol products, of the government funds that are used for promotion of these products through the program, we also note that the alcohol industry spends $7.6 million a year in lobbying costs. Not only do these tax dollars used to fund the promotion of alcohol take away from nonalcoholbased farmers and ranchers, they also compete with the Government itself. Every year, we spend millions of dollars to curtail the use and abuse of alcohol. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the impacts and loss of alcohol abuse results in $249 billion a year in economic, workplace absence, healthcare loss, criminal justice expenses, and vehicle crash costs. Mr. Chairman, it makes no sense that the Government should spend money to both promote and curtail an industry. This amendment preserves the Value Added Grants for farmers that have no $8millionayear industry to lobby for them, and it ends the duplicitous practice of the Government being both for and against something that costs the Nation nearly $250 billion in annual economic loss. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the Russell amendment, which, if enacted, would have a detrimental impact on producers across our Nation, including many of my wine, grape, and hops producers, as well as the beer and wine industry, not only in my State, but around the country. This amendment proposes to eliminate wine, distilled spirits, beer, and other alcohol products from the Value Added Producer Grant program administered by the USDA. These industries, in my State and, quite frankly, across the Nation, are a growing segment of our farm economy, providing thousands of jobs. It is also important to point out the growing significance of wine and hops exports to their industries. Last year, my State exported $28 million of wine, representing about 5 percent of our total production. In my home valley of the Yakima Valley in the State of Washington, we account for 75 percent of the U.S. production of hops. With the continued boom of microbreweries and the demand for hops, we must ensure we have available markets. Our wine grape growers and the wine industry continue to face challenges in export markets, such as the recent tariffs placed on our products by China. We are in an environment with potential changes in international trade, and farmers are looking for more export markets. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose any efforts to limit our farmers’ ability to find markets for their products. Mr. Chair, I include these letters of support in the RECORD : one from the Wine Institute, Wine America, Distilled Spirits Council, and the Brewers Association; and one from the Specialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance. 
MAY17, 2018. Re Oppose Russell Amendment to the Farm Bill. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : We write on behalf of the nearly 9,000 small, family owned wineries, 6,200 small and independent breweries and approximately 1,700 distilleries spread across rural America to urge you to vote against the Russell Amendment to the Farm Bill. This amendment would unfairly target a vibrant and growing segment of U.S. agriculture by seeking to block small wineries, breweries and distilleries from participating in USDA’s valueadded agriculture marketing grants. Combined, the American 
wine, brewing and spirits industries have a direct economic impact of $287 billion on the United States economy and support more than 5 million jobs nationwide. Wineries, distilleries and breweries in America represent the very epitome of valueadded agriculture, bringing quality jobs and generating much needed tourism to farming communities across the country. This amendment would make it harder for these communities to benefit fully from this opportunity. We urge you to support these small businesses and their communities buy opposing the Russell Amendment. Sincerely, ROBERT P. K OCH, President & CEO, Wine Institute. JAMES TREZISE , President, WineAmerica. ROBERT D. P EASE , President & CEO, Brewers Association. MARKGORMAN , SVP Government Relations, Distilled Spirits Council. 
SCFBA, Washington, DC, May 16, 2018. DEAR MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES : The Specialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance representing over 120 specialty crop organizations across the United States appreciate Chairman Conaway’s efforts on H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act that initiates the formal 2018 Farm Bill process and for his diligent efforts to complete Committee action on the measure and get it to the floor of the House. After a thorough review of the H.R. 2, the Alliance is also pleased to see that the Committee has retained many of the specialty crop provisions that were included in the 2014 Farm Bill. Included in the House version are provisions funding key specialty crop priorities such as: Specialty Crop Block Grants ($85 million/ year); Specialty Crop Research Initiative ($80 million/year); Trade Programs including MAP ($200 million/year) and TASC ($9 Million/year); Pest and Disease Programs ($75 million/ year) and National Clean Plant Network ($5 million/year); Food Insecurity and Nutrition Incentive Program (FINI) (Increased to $285 million over five years). These funding commitments demonstrate that the House recognizes the value of these programs and their tremendous importance to the specialty crop industry and the Alliance is grateful for their inclusion in the House legislation. With debate over the next several days on a series of amendments to H.R. 2, we would like to draw your attention to several amendments we interested in. In particular the Specialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance opposes the following amendments: Amendment 50 by Rep. Russell prohibits USDA valueadded grants for wine and other products; Amendment 71 by Reps. Brat, Blumenauer, and Titus on Checkoff Programs; Amendment 93 by Rep McClintock on Crop Insurance; Amendment 97 by Rep. Faso on Plant Pests; Amendment 100 by Rep. Rogers on multivitamin purchases through SNAP. Finally, we look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Conaway and Members of the House Agriculture Committee on further policy objectives that we believe will strengthen this bill and assist the specialty crop industry to compete in a domestic and global market place. These priorities are consistent with our requests since last year and in previous Farm Bills which include enhancing nutrition programs, continuing to support Specialty Crop Block Grant programs, combatting invasive pest and diseases, support trade programs, and research funding. We look forward to the Farm Bill being considered on the House floor this week and that you will strongly consider our views on the amendments mentioned above.

Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, we should not be singling out key agricultural industries under programs like this. We should not be picking winners and losers among our farmers. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to strongly oppose the Russell amendment. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PINGREE ). Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague from Washington State for yielding me the time and for speaking against this amendment. Mr. Chair, I am sorry to say to my colleague from the other side of the aisle, we oppose this amendment, 
which would remove money from the highly successful Value Added Producer Grant program. The base text of this farm bill already removes all mandatory funding from VAPG. Now this amendment would make a bad situation worse by rescinding $8 million from VAPG. The Value Added Producer Grant is one of the only grant programs that goes directly to farmers. At a time when the farm economy is hurting, we should be helping farmers find new markets, not taking away opportunities to do so. USDA’s Economic Research Service released a new report earlier this month. Businesses that receive VAPG support are less likely to fail than nonrecipient businesses, and businesses that receive VAPG support also employ more workers than nonrecipient businesses. This amendment would also exclude beer, wine, distilled spirits, and hard cider projects from being eligible for VAPG. It is completely arbitrary and foolish to restrict these products. In my State of Maine, there has been an explosion of craft breweries, distilleries, and cideries that are contributing to the local economy. Two years ago, Ricker Hill Orchards in Maine received VAPG money to increase production of hard cider and fruit wine. This provided the farmers with an opportunity to diversify revenue and reach new markets. This may be a very small program, but it can make a big impact on farmers and rural communities in States like mine and across the country. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Chairman, ‘‘a bad situation worse’’? You want to see a bad situation? How about this: Just in the District of Columbia, $3.5 billion in 2010 in direct economic costs; $179 billion of the total cost of alcohol consumption comes from a loss in workplace productivity. Mr. Chairman, I don’t have anything for or against, or want to promote prohibition or anything of the like. The matter is that these crops can stand on their own. They receive $8 million a year nearly, $7.67 million from the alcohol industry in lobbying costs. They already have their promoters. These crops can stand on their own. However, of the $18 million in this Value Added fund, $8 million of that goes to the alcohol industry. So when we are talking about picking winners and losers, I think we have already seen who is being picked here, and it is the fleecing of the American people. What about those that are new farmers, family farms, even veterans that are trying to enter the farming industry but they don’t want to grow hops? Maybe they want to grow something that we eat that doesn’t have a detrimental $250 billion a year of an impact. So, Mr. Chairman, I would argue that I would probably have to be drunk to think that the Government should both promote and curtail something at the same time. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, I believe I have the right to close, so I would reserve the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oklahoma has the right to close. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Chair, it is my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, I have one speaker. I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS ). Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Chairman, how much time does the gentleman have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Washington State for the opportunity to yield to me to discuss this important issue. Mr. Chair, this amendment, some in the room might think perhaps will target the Market Access Program, but, in fact, it is the Value Added Producer Grant program. This is a program that supports and helps producers add value to the products that they raise. I would tell you my chief concern at this point in time in the way this amendment has been offered is that about $8 million of the rescissions of this program would come out of current programs that farmers have already applied for. USDA has already scored the applications, it has compiled proposals to make a decision and announcement on grant awards; thus, the amendment wouldn’t just adversely affect the small producerowned wineries, but producers across the board, including those from Oklahoma who have and expect to receive grants. That is not fair. If you played by the rules, if you have gone through the grant process, if you have qualified, suddenly to have $8 million taken out to punish a particular industry means that even though you might not be a part of that industry, you lose your opportunity to add value. Maybe this is an issue that needs to be discussed on a different day in a different way, but I ask my colleagues to reject this amendment. Mr. Chair, I have the greatest of respect for my fellow Oklahoman, but on this occasion, let’s turn this amendment back. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have left? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Chairman, I certainly have the deepest respect for my colleague from Oklahoma, and he and I see eye to eye on most issues, but on this one, it makes no sense that we spend nearly 40 percent of the Value Added program—which, by the way, I never addressed Market Access Program, that was never even mentioned— but the Value Added program is not adding value when $250 billion of economic cost hits the United States; $27 billion comes from healthcare expenses; $25 billion to criminal justice; $12.5 billion to vehicle crashes. We all pay for this. b1845 But why should we both promote and curtail it? We spend millions of dollars in the Federal Government to control and contain abuse and also rehabilitation programs, which are good. So we need to choose, Mr. Chairman. Are we for something, or are we against something? We may be one, we may be the other, but we cannot be both. Mr. Chairman, I know these are contentious issues, but it is interesting to watch in the course of our politics over time. This is not a partisan issue; this is an American issue. I say it is not partisan because if we were holding this debate 30 years ago you would have had a flipflop, but as we have seen shift in parties in States and regions of the country, we might politically have parties go one direction or the other, but it seems like the special interests remain in the middle. And if we are really talking about promoting valueadded crops and entering new farmers in the workplace, then we don’t need to give 40 percent to the alcohol industry when we already see nearly $8 million given to them by lobbyists. Mr. Chairman, I ask people to support this amendment. It saves the taxpayer dollars. These crops can stand on their own, and they can do it without the taxpayer subsidization and then our further spending to try to curtail it. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. RUSSELL ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 18 OFFERED BY MR . TURNER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 18 printed in House Report 115–679. Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
SEC. 7113. RESEARCH AND EXTENSION FUNDING EQUITY FOR RECENTLY DESIGNATED 1890 INSTITUTIONS. 
(a) E XTENSION .—Section 1444(b) of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 3221(b)) is amended, in the matter following paragraph (2)(B), by adding at the end the following: ‘‘Beginning with fiscal year 2019, in making the calculation under paragraph (1), any recently designated 1890 Institution shall be deemed to have been designated as an eligible institution on or before September 30, 1978. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a ‘recently designated 1890 Institution’ means an 1890 Institution designated as such on or after September 30, 1999.’’. (b) RESEARCH .—Section 1445 of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 3222) is amended— by adding at the end the following new paragraph: ‘‘(3) Beginning with fiscal year 2019, in making the calculation under paragraph (2)(A), any recently designated 1890 Institution (as defined in section 1444(b)) shall be deemed to have been designated as an eligible institution on or before September 30, 1978.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in favor of my amendment to the farm bill. Mr. Chairman, I had a great conversation today with Secretary of Agriculture Perdue in which he spoke very highly of the students, faculty, and the president of Central State University during his visit to the university. Central State University is in my congressional district, and I want to thank Secretary Perdue for his leadership. I am committed to working with the Secretary’s office and all of the Historically Black Colleges to find a solution during the appropriations process to stop the disparate funding treatment currently in place. All 1890 land grant institutions should be treated equally. My commonsense and revenueneutral amendment evens the playing field of Federal funding qualifications for all 1890 landgrant Historically Black Colleges, as it is currently written now. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman for his support for my work on this amendment. I specifically want to thank JOYCE BEATTY , who supports the amendment and who is the only alumnus from Central State University. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 19 OFFERED BY MS . STEFANIK  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 19 printed in House Report 115–679. Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Subtitle A of title VIII is amended by adding at the end the following: 
SEC. 8109. INCLUSION OF INVASIVE VEGETATION IN DESIGNATED TREATMENT AREAS. 
Section 602 of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended— (1) in subsection (a)— (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting ‘‘, invasive vegetation,’’ after ‘‘insect’’; and (B) in paragraph (2), by inserting ‘‘, invasive vegetation,’’ after ‘‘insects’’; and (2) in subsection (b)(2), by inserting ‘‘, invasive vegetation,’’ after ‘‘insect’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York. Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, our national forests are among our greatest natural resources. Unfortunately, these forests are under constant threat from invasive species and disease. You do not have to search far to find a forest battling invasive pests, disease, or invasive vegetation. The Healthy Forest Restoration Act was created as a way to help respond to these persistent threats. My amendment before the House would simply add invasive vegetation to the Healthy Forest Restoration Act for the purposes of the designated treatment areas. Invasive vegetation chokes out our native trees by competing for moisture, sunlight, nutrients, and space. Species like kudzu climb our trees and infrastructure and threaten the health and safety of the areas where it uncontrollably spreads. When native trees are threatened, it is not just the ecosystem that is damaged. Local economies and sportsmen and those that use our land for other forms of recreation all suffer from degraded forestland. Adding this designation increases the effectiveness of the Healthy Forest Restoration Act by taking a more encompassing view of the threats facing our forestland. Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 20 OFFERED BY MS . CHENEY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 20 printed in House Report 115–679. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of part III of subtitle C of title VIII, add the following new section: 
SEC. 8334. VACANT GRAZING ALLOTMENTS MADE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN GRAZING PERMIT HOLDERS. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Secretary concerned shall, to the maximum extent practicable, make vacant grazing allotments available to a holder of a grazing permit or lease issued by such Secretary if the lands covered by the permit or lease are unusable because of a natural disaster (including a drought or wildfire), courtissued injunction, or conflict with wildlife, as determined by the Secretary concerned. (b) TERMS AND CONDITIONS .—The terms and conditions contained in a permit or lease for a vacant grazing allotment made available pursuant to this subsection (a) shall be the terms and conditions of the most recent permit or lease that was applicable to such allotment. (c) COURT ISSUED INJUNCTIONS .—A court may not issue any order enjoining the use of any allotment for which a permit or lease has been issued by the Secretary concerned and continues in effect unless the Secretary concerned can make a vacant grazing allotment available to the holder of such permit or lease. (d) ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT UNDER  
THENATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT.— Activities carried out by the Secretary concerned pursuant to subsection (a) are a category of actions hereby designated as being categorically excluded from the preparation of an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement under section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wyoming. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, livestock producers in Wyoming and across the West have been battling for years against a Federal Government that has attempted systematically to reduce grazing allotments on public lands. My amendment would simply make vacant grazing allotments available for our producers should their existing allotments become unavailable due to unforeseen circumstances such as wildfire, drought, other natural disasters, or litigation. Today, some of our ranch families are facing extreme hardship. They are at risk of losing their livelihood because of factors beyond their control. Frivolous lawsuits have often resulted in a complete loss of grazing rights for some of our producers who have been grazing on public lands for generations. Mr. Chairman, these circumstances can lead to situations where our ranchers face two options. They either force their livestock to graze in confined conditions that are unsuitable and can’t support the stock, or they have to sell their livestock at firesale prices. We have seen family ranches go out of business and others that are now facing the prospect that their allotments will be lost within the next 
year—this, all despite the fact, Mr. Chairman, that the Forest Service has vacant allotments available nearby. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would provide relief and justice for these family ranch operations. It would ensure that Federal agencies honor the terms of these allotments. Best management practices would be maintained, Mr. Chairman, by ensuring that the terms and the conditions of the original allotments are honored on the new ones. Allowing our ranchers to move their livestock to vacant allotments is plain common sense, and it is the right thing to do, Mr. Chairman, for our livestock industry. Our hardworking ranch families shouldn’t face the potential of economic ruin because of natural disaster or frivolous lawsuits. My amendment will help protect them while we keep them on landscapes they have grazed on for generations. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to provide stability and peace of mind for our ranchers across the West. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ). Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for yielding me time. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of amendment No. 20 offered by my friend Ms. CHENEY , and I am a proud cosponsor, as well, of this amendment. This amendment would provide resources for ranchers that are facing unforeseeable events, like natural disasters. In my district, particularly in the northern counties of northcentral Washington, where catastrophic wildfires are becoming far too common an occurrence, ranchers can be forced off of their allotments due to wildfires causing their land to be unsuitable for grazing. When these ranchers are forced off of these allotments due to these external factors, they have nowhere to take their livestock. This amendment will provide a solution to this problem by allowing these ranchers to take their livestock to vacant allotments in the event they face one of these unfortunate but all too common occurrences. Mr. Chairman, I would like to urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 20, and I thank my colleague Ms. CHENEY for her leadership on this issue. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my cosponsor, Mr. NEWHOUSE , and I would also like to thank Chairman CONAWAY for his work on this important bill overall. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that will just provide justice for our ranch families. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ). The amendment was agreed to. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. GARRETT ) having assumed the chair, Mr. GALLAGHER , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2) to provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
AGREEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND ICELAND— MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115–127) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Ways and Means and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: Pursuant to section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95–216, 42 U.S.C. 433(e)(1)), I transmit herewith a social security totalization agreement with Iceland, titled ‘‘Agreement on Social Security between the United States of America and Iceland’’ and the accompanying legally binding administrative arrangement, titled ‘‘Administrative Arrangement between the Competent Authorities of the United States of America and Iceland for the Implementation of the Agreement on Social Security between the United States of America and Iceland’’ (collectively the ‘‘Agreements’’). The Agreements were signed at Reykjavik, Iceland, on September 27, 2016. The Agreements are similar in objective and content to the social security totalization agreements already in force with other leading economic partners in Europe and elsewhere, including Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Norway, the Republic of Korea, and Switzerland. Such bilateral agreements provide for limited coordination between the United States and foreign social security systems to eliminate dual social security coverage and taxation and to help prevent the loss of benefit protection that can occur when workers divide their careers between two countries. The Agreements contain all provisions mandated by section 233 of the Social Security Act and, pursuant to section 233(c)(4), other provisions which I deem appropriate to carry out the purposes of section 233. I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report required by section 233(e)(1) of the Social Security Act on the estimated number of individuals who will be affected by the Agreements and the Agreements’ estimated cost effect. Also included are a summary of the main provisions of the Agreements and an annotated version of the Agreements with descriptions of each article. The Department of State and the Social Security Administration concluded that these Agreements are in the national interest of the United States. I commend to the Congress the Agreement on Social Security between the United States of America and Iceland and the Administrative Arrangement between the Competent Authorities of the United States of America and Iceland for the Implementation of the Agreement on Social Security between the United States of America and Iceland. DONALD J. T RUMP .THEWHITE HOUSE , May 17, 2018. 
b1900 HONORING INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LIONS CLUB, MULTIPLE DISTRICT 14 (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the International Association of Lions Club, Multiple District 14, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Lions Multiple District 14 will host its 95th annual convention at the Penn Stater Conference Center today through Sunday. They will proudly welcome the Lions Club International president, Dr. Naresh Aggarwal, of Batala, Punjab, India. Mr. Speaker, this group is near and dear to my heart, as I am a member of my local Lions Club, having served also as a Scoutmaster of that Lions Scout troop. The Lions are the world’s largest service club, with more than 18,900 Lions in Pennsylvania and nearly 1.45 million Lions worldwide. The Lions focus on five areas of service: diabetes; environment; hunger relief; pediatric cancer; and probably the most wellknown area of service, vision. Thanks to the 692 Lions Clubs in Pennsylvania, residents benefit from services like chartering units of the Boy Scouts of America, operating a yearround camp for people with vision challenges, supporting a camp for children with health challenges, and offering scholarships for students. Mr. Speaker, the Lions do so much for so many in need. I wish them the best of luck as they host their 95th convention and live out their motto: We serve. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I recognize National Police Week; however, every day I am aware that officers protect and serve, put their lives on the line each day they serve, and some give their lives for that service. I also recognize what officers realize, that their sacrifice and service is for everybody: people they know and don’t know, and people who love them and people who hate them. That is a big part of why our officers should be recognized, because no matter who it is, no matter what the danger is, police are trained to and police do what we naturally don’t do as civilians: they run towards the danger, not away from it. As a former prosecutor, I worked with many law enforcement officers that I will never forget. More importantly, there are victims and victims’ family members who will never forget the service of police, including the family of Azahel Cruz, a 6yearold that was killed in a driveby shooting. The case went unsolved for 5 years; however, due to the dogged determination of Officer Tom Larkin and DA Investigator Peter Austin, witnesses were found, evidence was presented, I proved the case at trial, and a murderer was convicted and removed from the streets for good. Police work will never replace the life of Azahel, but that service and the service and sacrifice of our officers is exactly why we recognize our police officers this week. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MELISSA RAMIREZ (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Melissa Ramirez. Melissa attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1. Melissa loved her family more than anything in the world. She always made sure to take trips home over the weekends while she was studying at California State University to get her bachelor’s degree in business administration. After she graduated from college in 2014, Melissa began working as a member specialist for an auto insurer, where she continued to work until her life tragically ended at the Route 91 festival. Melissa loved country music, but loved the Philadelphia Eagles more. She enjoyed watching sporting events and supporting each of her favorite teams. Melissa was known for being a hard worker, deeply loving her family, and making sure to always enjoy life. Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my condolences to Melissa Ramirez’ family and friends. Please note that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. THREAT ASSESSMENT AND PROTECTIVE INTELLIGENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, imagine if someone came up and introduced himself to you and said: ‘‘Hi, I am Nick. I am a school shooter.’’ According to those who knew him, Nikolas Cruz, the deranged Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School murderer, was known to do just that. He attacked a neighbor’s car. He shot their animals. He was known to vandalize and steal property. He made alarming social media posts and was expelled from school. There were multiple reports to local police and the FBI, and many other egregious red flags waving long before 17 innocent lives were taken and another 17 wounded on February 14, 2018. In the 7 years leading up to the shooting, police visited Cruz’ home 39 times—incredibly. Mr. Speaker, the Parkland shooting should have never happened. Every warning sign was there. They were not missed. Officials just failed to connect the dots. I wish that I could say that this failure is unique to Parkland, but, sadly, it is not. Nearly 20 years ago, high school junior Brooks Brown came across a website where a fellow classmate threatened to kill him and his family. Brown’s parents alerted the local police, who were already aware of concerning behaviors from that website’s author and another involved student. Within only a few months, these same students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, would murder 13 and wound 24 Columbine High School students in what has been called the first modern mass shooting. Again, the red flags were detected, but the appropriate steps were not taken. This is not a new phenomenon. In 1966, Charles Whitman sought help from a psychiatrist at the University of Texas for ‘‘overwhelming periods of hostility,’’ including wanting to, ‘‘go up in the tower . . . and start shooting people.’’ Six months later, he would carry out his sick fantasy exactly as he described: 16 dead and 31 wounded. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, this list goes on and on: the Pulse nightclub, the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, the Boston Marathon, the Washington Navy Yard, the attack on Congresswoman Gabby Giffords in Tucson, Sandy Hook Elementary School, the Aurora theater, Virginia Tech, the Norwegian summer camp, West Nickel Mines Amish school, the Charleston church massacre, the attack on Republican Members of Congress at baseball practice, and even the YouTube and Tennessee Waffle House shooting just a few weeks ago. Mr. Speaker, all of these horrifying events on this nonexhaustive list have something in common: every single one of these attacks was carried out after someone close to the killer observed and reported concerning behavior to the authorities. The good news is there is something that we can do to fix this. These killers were under law enforcement’s watch, but a proactive threat management structure, in large part, does not exist in the culture and fabric of contemporary law enforcement today. For starters, our local law enforcement is simply undertrained, understaffed, underequipped, and have no integrated system in place to effectively identify and address these types of threats. The lack of informationsharing capabilities between the local, State, and Federal law enforcement, school officials, mental health professionals, social services, and other communitybased organizations prevent these key players from implementing an effective intervention strategy directed at those who are on the pathway to violence. For decades, there has been an effective system in place, pioneered by the Secret Service, that has successfully worked to protect our Presidents and other public figures. I believe that it is time to take a page out of the Secret Service’s playbook and address this critical national security issue by implementing their established and proven threat management process for identifying, investigating, evaluating, and mitigating threats as a critical means to protecting our communities. Currently, threat assessment and protective intelligence is used as a method for gathering and evaluating information about a person who may have the motive, intention, and capability to mount an attack against public figures. The Secret Service will gauge a potential threat, assess the vulnerability of the targeted individuals, and guide an intervention when necessary. This proactive process leaves no stone unturned. This approach is entirely different from what the FBI and local law enforcement currently use because it compiles information from a variety of comprehensive sources to build out a threat assessment, and it works. Since the 1981 attempted assassination of President Reagan, nobody has even come close. If this system works to protect the life of the President, elected officials, foreign dignitaries, and even celebrities, why couldn’t this also work to protect our children and local communities? Whether it is a shooting, a stabbing, a weaponized vehicle, or a bombing, mass casualty events are occurring more and more frequently at home and abroad. It is more important now than ever that we act. Incorporating threat assessment and protective intelligence into all facets of law enforcement will save lives. If we can properly recognize the warnings and act, we can prevent targeted violence. It is time that we put an end to 
the politicized gungrabbing rhetoric and start tackling the real root of this issue. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE ). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening in support of National Police Week, an important celebration of the men and women who serve our communities as members of law enforcement. This week, we also observed Peace Officers Memorial Day and remembered all of those members of the thin blue line who have lost their lives so the rest of us can be safe. Throughout my life, I have had the opportunity to work with so many brave Rhode Island police officers, and I am particularly proud that when I was mayor of the city of Providence, as a result of a citywide community policing model, we saw the lowest crime rate in the city in 40 years. That was because of the wonderful trust that had been developed between the community and the police department, and the police department being willing to fully engage in the life of the community. Police officers served on housing boards and community center boards and became part of the community, and, of course, that work continues today. There are many, many stories about the extraordinary heroism and dedication and hard work of our men and women in uniform, but very often their really heroic work is in these untold stories. One of those stories I would like to talk about tonight is a story that really exemplifies the important work that police do in our communities that makes a real difference in the lives of those they serve. Earlier this year, the Pawtucket Police Department went above and beyond the call of duty to help a family in the city of Pawtucket. Hilary Bilbraut and her family were getting ready to celebrate their daughter, Destiny’s, ninth birthday. Destiny, who suffers from a rare blood disorder that causes high fevers, had been eagerly waiting for her birthday trip to Legoland in Florida, where she could take pictures with her beloved camera. Instead, Destiny and her family came home to an apartment ransacked by thieves. They took everything they could get their hands on. They took the family television. They took Destiny’s camera. They took her tickets to Legoland. They even took her birthday cake. In describing the aftermath to police, Hilary said the thieves stole more than just that: they stole Destiny’s peace of mind. Since the breakin, she had been haunted by nightmares and constantly crying. Pawtucket Police Officer Brian Beech was the first to respond to the breakin. Officer Beech was heartbroken by Destiny’s story. He immediately began reaching out to his fellow officers for donations to help replace the stolen items. Working together with Sergeant Kenneth Dolan, officers of the Pawtucket Police Department raised $400 to replace the television. One of the officers donated his camera. They contacted Queen B’s Cakery in Johnston, who donated a birthday cake. They even reached out to Legoland, who put together a trip to replace Destiny’s stolen tickets, complete with a limousine ride to the airport. Destiny was ecstatic. She was already talking about returning the gesture. When asked why they went above and beyond, Sergeant Dolan said: We wanted to show her that there are more good people in the world than bad. Mr. Speaker, this is just one example showing exactly why police officers do what they do. The men and women of our Nation’s law enforcement deserve our utmost respect and our deepest gratitude. I look forward to working with my colleagues here in Congress, members of the Rhode Island State and local law enforcement agencies, and local community leaders on the ways we can continue to support our great men and women in uniform. I want to thank Congressman KNIGHT  for organizing this Special Order hour this evening. Our last evening had to get postponed, but I really appreciate, Mr. Speaker, the opportunity to offer a few thoughts this evening during National Police Week to say thank you again to the men and women who serve in our community to keep us safe, who do incredibly dangerous work and without whom we would not have safe communities. Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
