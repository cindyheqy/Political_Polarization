Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the long career and accomplishments of a dear friend of mine, Professor Ved Nanda, who will be celebrating his 50th year teaching international law at the University of Denver. As a professor at the Sturm College of Law, Professor Ved Nanda has been a pioneer in the international law community since his arrival at the University of Denver in 1965. Professor Nanda created the school’s renowned international legal studies program and established the Denver Journal of International Law and Policy in 1972. His work has inspired a countless number of students to become a part of the conversation on human rights and international issues. In addition to his achievements as an educator, Professor Nanda has contributed significantly to the international law community. He has served as the United States delegate to the World Federation of United Nations Associations where he worked to promote world peace, human rights, and the spread of democracy throughout the world. The culmination of his work has led to his receipt of countless awards, including the ‘‘World Legal Scholar’’ award in 1990 and the ‘‘United Nations Association Human Rights Award’’ in 1997. I want to congratulate Professor Ved Nanda once more on his long career and many achievements. Professor Nanda’s greatest passion was educating his students about the importance of international law and human rights. It is an honor to have a living legend in our community. f 
RECOGNIZING LENAPE VALLEY FOUNDATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, for over a half century, the Lenape Valley Foundation has provided assistance, compassion, and hope to thousands of children, adults, and families within my district. They offer services related to mental health, substance abuse, intellectual disability, and early intervention. I was pleased to meet with community leaders and volunteers during the groundbreaking ceremony at The Lodge at Lenape Valley Foundation, a new construction on the campus of Lower Bucks Hospital. The new facility will provide more outpatient mental health services, including individual group and family therapy, an improved crisis call center, an improved crisis walkin center, peer support, and Bucks County’s only Crisis Residential Program. I am thankful for the leadership of the Lenape Valley executive team: Alan Hartl, Walter Wolaniuk, Sharon Curran, Philip Braun, JoAnne Davis, Mary Dubyk, Mary Jane Fletcher, Traci Gorman, Angela Jacobsen, Marjorie Morgan, and Mary Ann Venezia, as well as board president, Robert Rogala; vice president, Lisa Bodine; secretary, Helene Cevasco Mathern; treasurer, Mark Strasburg; and all the board of directors. I am proud to work with an organization which recognizes that everyone can grow and progress toward personal fulfillment, and we are proud to stand by their side. HONORING UNITED WAY OF BUCKS COUNTY  
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, the United Way of Bucks County is dedicated to improving the lives through the caring power of communities. We all have a stake in making our communities healthy and prosperous. The United Way of Bucks County is committed to working together, advancing the common good, and creating a better life for all. The United Way works in close collaboration with diverse partners in Bucks County. From schools, government agencies, community corporations, neighborhood associations, the faith community, and volunteers, the United Way brings together passion, resources, and expertise to get things done in Bucks County. Although there are about 1,300 United Way chapters nationally, each chapter shapes its own identity, holding firm 
that everyone deserves a good life through quality education, stable employment, supportive income, and good health. I am very proud to work with Bucks County’s team at the United Way: Marissa Christie, Faith Parkinson, Patricia Winslow Gallagher, Matt Uhler, Danielle Bush, Tim Philpot, Candi Guerrero, Katie Matarazzo, Dan Warvolis, and Pat Miller. Mr. Speaker, these problemsolvers are making an impact on improving lives and making Bucks County a more prosperous community, and for that, they are deserving of all of our thanks and support.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
RECOGNIZING STEWART ADAIR (Mr. HURD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HURD. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the extraordinary contributions Mr. Stewart Adair has made on my hometown of Helotes, Texas. Since first becoming the Walmart store manager in 2013, Mr. Adair has dedicated his professional and personal life to helping the people of Helotes. Stewart and his family have become pillars of the community. As the store manager, Mr. Adair was responsible for leading hundreds of employees, where he quickly grew to become a role model and mentor to many. In addition to his commitments to his job and his family, Stewart has spent much of his personal time supporting our Nation’s troops. Stewart is well known in Helotes for organizing the annual Turkey for Troops program, which he has helped grow into a thriving charity event. As many in the community of Helotes know, Stewart was recently diagnosed with cancer. This past Saturday, I was honored to volunteer my time for a man who has 
done so much to help his community. Mr. Adair is a perfect example of a Good Samaritan, and I am proud to recognize all that he has done for our community in Helotes. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S ‘‘ART OF THE DEAL’’ BOOK (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, those who are fairminded and want to understand President Trump better should read his bestselling book from 30 years ago, which is as timely today as it was then. It is called ‘‘The Art of the Deal’’ and reveals these characteristics. Donald Trump usually makes decisions quickly based on knowledge, experience, and intuition, rather than waiting for consultants’ studies. He is a tough but practical negotiator willing to compromise to achieve a goal. He gets a deal done sooner or later, even if it sometimes takes years. He is a counterpuncher who doesn’t like to start a fight but will give more than he receives. He is loyal to friends who are loyal to him. Most of the President’s actions should be of no surprise to anyone who has read his book. In fact, those who are objective are likely to appreciate him more. 
RECOGNIZING GRAND VIEW HEALTH HOSPITAL (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, for more than 100 years, residents of Bucks and Montgomery Counties have trusted Grand View Health hospital with the wellbeing of their families. They are dedicated toward leading our community to a healthier future. Following their Community Health Needs Assessment, Grand View Health has identified and prioritized a community health improvement program, which, over the next 3 years, will address health challenges present in their service area. I am proud of the positive impact that Grand View Health has made in our community. I commend their board of trustees for their outstanding leadership and service to our community. Many thanks to Jeffrey Landis, Mary Anne Poatsy, Mark Schlosser, William Aichele, Jean Keeler, Michael Corrado, Marc Freeman, Nicholas Lindberg, Robert Pritchard, Gregory Shelly, and all the doctors, nurses, staff, and volunteers who make this a success. Madam Speaker, Grand View Health’s commitment to the people it serves reminds us that we are all in this together, and it is never too late to start living a healthy lifestyle. ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, you are going to hear today and we have a series of bills, many of them historic in nature, many of them—all of them—worked in a bipartisan manner. There has been a lot of talk lately of the one place in Congress that is really functioning well, and that is in the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and I would echo that. It is because of the commitment, the dedication, and the end state that all of us agree on is the best possible care for those warriors willing to put their lives in harm’s way, their families, and the care that was pledged to them. Also, with that being said, democracy is hard. It requires us to do the work here, with the stakeholders, and there is no issue that has a more committed group of stakeholders than the veterans’ community. Some of the names you are going to hear of veterans service organizations are a hallmark and a bedrock of not just veterans’ issues, but of our communities. We work with them hand in hand to make sure that this Congress understands exactly what they need. And democracy is hard. It is that old sausagemaking adage sometimes. It is a disappointment to me that we are on the floor because I think we are just a little bit early; I think we are about a day. Like we have before, we stood on this floor when we had a very important accountability bill forward, and I said at that time we were going to have to work with the Senate to make sure we got something passed. We did that, it passed, and I am proud that we were able to do that. It happened with the GI Bill that is coming up. The first run we went at it did not work because we had not built that collaboration, and I am disappointed today that I believe S. 114 has fallen into that. This is a very fastmoving problem, because I want to be clear. What this does is it extends veterans’ access to care in the community through the Veterans Choice Program without providing additional resources for the Department of Veterans Affairs to enhance its internal capacity. I agree with my colleague who was very clear about the capacity of the VA, what Choice does, and I would absolutely echo not funding this program before we leave for the August recess is unacceptable. But not getting a bill that the Senate can agree on, not getting a bill that the President can sign, and not getting a bill that actually does what we are supposed to do is also not acceptable. The gentleman is also right: we have quadrupled the VA budget, and I am proud of that. I also think it is probably not lost on anyone that that started in 2001 at the same time that we fought America’s longest war and are still engaged around the world, with an aging population of Vietnam, Korean, and World War II veterans. As it became apparent that the Veterans Choice Program was facing a funding shortfall earlier this summer, nine veterans service organizations— Disabled American Veterans, the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of America, AMVETS, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Military Officers Association of America, Military Order of the Purple Heart, and Vietnam Veterans of America—issued a letter which provided very clear guidance to House and Senate leadership and House and Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committees in terms of a solution, and I include in the RECORD the letter from these organizations. 
JUNE28, 2017. Hon. JOHNNY ISAKSON , Chairman, Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. JONTESTER , Ranking Member, Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. PHILROE, M.D., Chairman, House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. TIMWALZ, Ranking Member, House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMEN ISAKSON AND ROE, RANKING  MEMBERS TESTER AND WALZ: As leaders of the nation’s largest veterans service organizations, and on behalf of our combined five million members and auxiliaries, we write to urge you to expeditiously reach agreement on and advance legislation to ensure continuous access to health care for millions veterans enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system, including care provided through the Choice program. Specifically, we call on you to reach agreement on an emergency appropriation and authorization bill that would address urgent resource shortfalls endangering VA’s medical care programs—including Choice, community care and medical services. Further, in order to prevent these problems from recurring in the future, we call on you to equally invest in modernizing and expanding VA’s capacity to meet rising demand for care, as well as finally address the glaring inequity in law that prevents thousands of family caregivers from getting the support they need to care for their veterans severely disabled before September 11, 2001. In recent weeks, VA Secretary David Shulkin has repeatedly made clear in his public statements and congressional testimony that current funding is no longer projected to be adequate to meet the needs of an increasing number of veterans seeking medical treatment directly through the VA system as well as through community care programs, particularly the Choice program. Secretary Shulkin has made clear that rising demand for care by veterans has consumed more VA resources than previously anticipated, threatening the ability of VA to meet all of its obligations to ill and injured veterans both this year and next. Although Public Law 115–26 extended the Choice program beyond its prior sunset date of August 7, 2017, VA now projects it will likely run out of funding prior to the end of fiscal year (FY) 2017 unless additional funding is made available. Further, based on recent utilization trends, VA projects a higher demand for both community care and Choice next year (FY 2018), and anticipates additional funding requirements above the budget request made just weeks earlier. In order to ensure continuation of the Choice program—and absent an infusion of new funding—VA has stated its intention to take extraordinary budget 
actions, including pulling back unobligated funding from VA medical facilities and utilizing funding in FY 2017 that had been designated as carryover funding for its FY 2018 budget request, thereby further reducing available medical care resources for next year. Messrs. Chairmen and Ranking Members, our nation has a sacred obligation to ensure the men and women who served and sacrificed to defend our way of life receive timely, highquality health care through a fully funded VA health care system, which includes community care or Choice options whenever and wherever necessary. With the Choice program rapidly running out of funds and its successor community care program still many months away, it is imperative that Congress not allow veterans to go without needed care before this transition is completed. We note that VA’s FY 2018 budget submission included a request for $3.5 billion in mandatory funds to continue the Choice program. In order to meet Congressional PAYGO requirements, VA also included two legislative proposals we vehemently oppose which would cut billions of dollars from veterans disability compensation through changes to Individual Unemployabilty eligibility and rounding down costofliving adjustment (COLA) increases to ‘‘pay’’ for the new Choice funding. We find it absolutely unconscionable to cut benefits for disabled veterans to ‘‘pay’’ for their medical care. Congress imposed these PAYGO rules on itself and Congress has the authority to waive them by designating new funding for the existing Choice program as emergency spending, just as it did when the Choice program was created in 2014 through Public Law 113–146, the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act (VACAA). It is our understanding that the actual need to continue the Choice program for the balance of this year and through the end of FY 2018 is approximately $4.3 billion. We remind you that the primary reason the Choice program was created was to address gaps in access due to the lack of clinicians and clinical space necessary to provide timely access to health care for all enrolled veterans. As such, VACAA not only included emergency funding to allow additional access to community care outside VA, it also contained funding to rebuild and expand capacity inside VA. Therefore, we call on you to continue this commitment to strengthen and modernize the VA by providing equal emergency funding to address VA’s infrastructure and personnel gaps. There are at least 27 VA health care facility leases awaiting funding in order to be activated. In addition, there are dozens of minor and major construction projects that require billions of dollars in funding to sustain and expand VA’s capacity to provide timely care to enrolled veterans. Furthermore, VA has tens of thousands of vacant positions which will require not just funding, but innovative new programs to recruit and retain hardtofill clinical positions in many areas of the country. Therefore, we call on you to include an equivalent level of funding—$4.3 billion—to support VA’s internal capacity to deliver care. Finally, since enactment of the Public Law 111–163 in 2010, which created the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC), eligibility has been restricted to caregivers of severely disabled veterans injured or made ill on or after September 11, 2001. The clear intention of the law was to initiate this program rapidly for post9/11 veterans to address their urgent needs, thereafter working to expand the program to meet the critical needs of family caregivers of seriously disabled veterans of all generations as soon as feasible. However seven years later, Congress has yet to begin addressing the blatant unfairness facing caregivers of severely disabled veterans injured prior to September 11, 2001. As Secretary Shulkin and other experts agree, supporting caregivers who allow veterans to remain in their homes will save VA money that would otherwise need to be spent for long term institutional care. Therefore, we call on you to include both authorization and funding to eliminate this indefensible inequity based on existing bipartisan legislation in the Senate (S. 591) and the House (H.R. 1472, H.R. 1802). While the current funding crisis must be addressed in the short term through emergency funding and authorization, we remain focused on moving beyond the flawed Choice program as soon as practicable. We continue to urge you to work with us, Secretary Shulkin and other critical stakeholders to design and implement a new paradigm for veterans health care built around an integrated network, with a modernized VA serving as the coordinator and primary provider of care, and community providers addressing remaining gaps in access and services. We further urge you to consolidate all community care programs through a single unified discretionary funding source that includes the necessary flexibility and accountability to ensure that VA can deliver the highest quality of care in the most appropriate clinical settings within the network. Messrs. Chairmen and Ranking Members, we recognize the continuing attention and commitment you have all shown to providing timely and accessible care to our nation’s injured and ill veterans, and we hope you will work with us and Secretary Shulkin to address this urgent funding shortfall. America’s veterans have earned the right to highquality, timely and accessible health care. We believe that the comprehensive plan outlined above will ensure our nation continues to meet that sacred obligation and call on you to support it. Respectfully, Garry J. Augustine, Executive Director, Washington Headquarters, DAV (Disabled American Veterans); Robert E. Wallace, Adjutant General, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States; Joseph Chenelly, National Executive Director, AMVETS; Dana T. Atkins, Lieutenant General, U.S. Air Force (Ret.), President, Military Officers Association of America; Rick Weidman, Executive Director for Policy and Government Affairs, Vietnam Veterans of America; Verna L. Jones, Executive Director, The American Legion; Sherman Gillums, Jr., Executive Director, Paralyzed Veterans of America; Paul Rieckhoff, Founder and CEO, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA); Hershel Gober, National Commander, Military Order of the Purple Heart. 
Mr. WALZ. In their letter from June 28, they wrote: ‘‘Specifically, we call on you to reach an agreement on an emergency appropriation and authorization bill that would address urgent resource shortfalls endangering VA’s medical care programs—including Choice, community care and medical services. Further, in order to prevent these problems from recurring in the future, we call on you to equally invest in modernizing and expanding VA’s capacity to meet rising demand for care. . . .’’ Choice means choosing to go to the VA hospital and choice means choosing to use community care. Both are equal opportunities for our veterans to get the care they need. The current bill before us does not meet the requirements asked for by our veterans service organizations. In fact, in order to keep the Veterans Choice Program going, House leadership and the Budget Committee have refused to see this as an emergency and are requiring $2 billion in offsets to pay for the bill. While the actual offsets being offered are noncontroversial and are the ones the committee has used in the past, the fact that the leadership is requiring offsets from VA programs to pay for private care is wrong—all of this to appease a small vocal minority who simply sees any spending as unnecessary. On Friday, a number of the same VSOs listed above issued a joint statement, which noted: ‘‘Veterans healthcare benefits have already been ‘paid for’ through the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wore our Nation’s uniform, millions whom suffered injuries, illnesses and lifelong disabilities.’’ I agree with them. Without emergency funding, robbing Peter to pay Paul, an analogy used by the Paralyzed Veterans of America, is not a viable path. It is actually robbing future Peter to pay current Paul. Had it been apparent VA would be facing this shortfall, Congress maybe would have never extended the Veterans Choice Program beyond its sunset of August 7 and would have, instead, begun working on legislation that would have consolidated VA’s multiple community care programs into one easytounderstand and use program. I reiterate: Choice is not a permanent VA program. Now, it may end up being that. It may be someone’s wish, but it is not. It was a shortterm fix that was testified we need to extend the program. Several weeks later, leadership of the VA came back and told us they are 4pointwhatever billion dollars short and asked us to fix it. That is not the chairman’s fault; that is not the Members of this House’s fault; but it is our responsibility. Now, the question is: How do we ensure that the care is continuous? How do we make sure care is not interrupted? How do we make sure a veteran who is getting chemotherapy in the private setting right now is not told to not come back because we are not going to pay it? The sense of urgency is with all of us. What I ask is that we try and come back, take a look at what we can do. And I will say this: the chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee in the House has made as good faith an effort to do this as anyone could possibly ask. I understand the challenges coming from a broader caucus and asking for this. This, where we are at today, is significantly changed from where we started, but it is apparent, in the Senate, that it will not pass. We will not have money for the Veterans Choice Program, so we need to 
decide: Do we stand and make a statement of ideological, fiscal, whatever they want to call it, or do we come together, unanimously agree on something we can move forward, build capacity into the VA to assure that Choice is there, everything from the research into the VA to the care in the communities, and come together to find that? Moreover, these shortages are further reinforced in Choice when you take into account veterans’ reliance on VA’s system for care has steadily increased. While enrollment has been flat in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, the total number of veterans utilizing VA healthcare has grown by 3 percent. The total appointments in VA increased by more than 5 percent during this period. In order to address that need, since the Veterans Choice Program was implemented, the total number of community care appointments has increased by 61 percent, and more than 25 million appointments were completed in fiscal year 2016. Over onefifth of this care was completed in the Veterans Choice Program. No disagreement. Community care has always been there, and community care is an absolute staple of the VA. What is also not debatable is capacity inside the VA must remain there. Any shortfall in capacity is going to distort where people are getting their care. While we are not here to oppose the premise of veterans having access to care, members of my Caucus, as this stands right now, cannot go forward until we figure out how we are going to come to a compromise that gets the capacity as it should be in the VA and also allows us and everyone—we should never have this discussion in this House. If we can’t find compromise that gets something across the finish line that actually does something for veterans, everything else is just messaging for politics. Madam Speaker, I look forward to the chairman’s words, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I think the one way that we don’t have the Veterans Choice Program work for veterans is not vote for S. 114. Just to clarify a couple of things, this $2 billion is emergency spending that our Budget Committee agreed to. I want to just for a minute kind of go over how we got to this position where we are right now. The Veterans Choice Program, in April, we were told, would last until next January or February. So we passed the CHOICE Act, and the President signed it into law. We found out a short 60 days later that the funds would run out in mid August—the 7th to the 15th of August is when the Secretary told us—so that kind of caught us off guard, and we had to get moving rather quickly. The June 28 letter that my good friend, Mr. WALZ, referred to sort of got us started with this process. I want to go through it because the process is important about how we are here today. The Members need to understand that my efforts to work with the committee’s ranking member and, indeed, all members of the committee on a path forward which addresses the concerns of all of the organizations, I have done that. Let me begin by saying I fundamentally disagree that we have neglected the needs of our internal VA healthcare system. We just passed a MILCON–VA bill last week. I stated the reasons for that in my earlier remarks. I think the Secretary’s oped this morning in USA Today clearly makes the point. Madam Speaker, I include in the RECORD that article. 
[From USA Today, July 24, 2017] VETERANS AFFAIRS SECRETARY : VA H EALTH  CARE WILLNOTBEPRIVATIZED ON OUR WATCH  (By David Shulkin) As a physician, my professional assessment is that the Department of Veterans Affairs has made significant progress over the past six months—but it still requires intensive care. In order to restore the VA’s health, we must strengthen its ability to provide timely and high quality medical care while improving experiences and outcomes for veterans. I believe the best way to achieve this goal is to build an integrated system that allows veterans to get the best health care possible, whether it comes from the VA or the private sector. This is not a novel idea. No health care provider delivers every treatment under the sun. Referral programs for patients to get care through outside providers (known as Choice or Community Care at the VA) are as essential to the medical profession as stethoscopes and tongue depressors. But VA attempts to offer veterans these options have frequently stirred controversy. Some critics complain that letting veterans choose where they get certain health care services will lead to the privatization of VA. Nothing could be further from the truth. VA has had a community care program for years. Congress significantly expanded these efforts in 2014 in response to the wait time crisis. As a result, since the beginning of this year, VA has authorized over 18 million community care appointments—3.8 million more than last year, or a 26% increase, according to the VA claims system. But as VA’s community care efforts have grown, so has our capacity to deliver care in house. The VA budget is nearly four times what it was in 2001. Since then, the department’s workforce has grown from some 224,000 employees in 2001 to more than 370,000 today, according to the Office of Personnel Management. And we’re delivering 3 million more appointments at VA facilities per year than we were in 2014. In other words, community care or private capacity and VA’s internal capacity are not mutually exclusive. We are ramping up both simultaneously in order to meet the health care needs of the veterans we are charged with serving. Our fiscal 2018 budget continues this trend. It will spend $2.7 billion more for inhouse VA care, compared to a $965 million increase for community care. This means that the total dollar increase for medical care within VA is three times that of the increase for community care. Overall, when all funding sources are taken into account, we expect to spend $50 billion on health care services within VA and $12.6 billion on VA community care in fiscal 2018. Even though these numbers make it abundantly clear VA is not at all headed toward privatization, I understand the underlying concerns of some critics. They don’t want to lose all that VA has to offer. I don’t either— and we won’t. Many of VA’s services cannot be replicated in the private sector. In addition to providing some of the best quality overall health care in the country, VA delivers world class services in polytrauma, spinal cord injury and rehabilitation, prosthetics and orthotics, traumatic brain injury, post traumatic stress treatments and other behavioral health programs. The department plays a critical role in preparing our nation’s doctors and nurses—70% of whom train at VA facilities. And we lead the nation in innovation, with VA research having contributed to the first liver transplant, development of the cardiac pacemaker, advancements in treatments for PTSD, cuttingedge prosthetics, and many other medical breakthroughs. All of these factors underscore that fears of privatization are simply unfounded. President Trump is dedicated to maintaining a strong VA, and we will not allow VA to be privatized on our watch. What we do want is a VA system that is even stronger and better than it is today. To achieve that goal, VA needs a strong and robust community care program. Veterans deserve the best. If a VA facility isn’t meeting the community standard for care, doesn’t offer a specific service, or doesn’t have an appointment available when it’s needed, veterans should have access to care in their community. This is precisely what they have earned and deserve. It’s what the VA is working with Congress and Veterans Service Organizations to deliver. And it’s what the system needs to remain a valuable resource for our country’s great veterans, now and in the future. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I respect the veterans service organizations and their point of view, and I am a member of most of them. I, therefore, reached an agreement with the ranking member on a plan to fund the Veterans Choice Program for 1 year, fund the life safety maintenance issues at VA facilities, approve 28 VA clinic leases, provide the Secretary with the tools to be more competitive in attracting and retaining VA physicians, and conduct a longoverdue asset review of VA’s aging facilities. When the ranking member and I briefed the VSOs on this plan and then committee members—two separate meetings—it was clear that we needed to take some time to work out the differences. There was some concern there. And I have said that is fine. I think we can take a twophased approach. Phase one was the one we are talking about today, and we agreed on that. It is necessary to fund the Veterans Choice Program for 6 months to ensure that the veterans get needed healthcare without long drives and waits. That is exactly what we were dealing with 3 years ago. The second phase, which we would consider 6 months from now, would 
consider the remaining items I have talked about between the ranking member and me. During the interim, the committee would conduct open, transparent hearings on asset review and anything else—the leases or anything else—that was in that agreement. There was full transparency about this plan among committee members, which is why I found it a little disheartening now what I am hearing. The reality is, right now, we don’t have an agreement from the Senate or a bill to act on, so it is time for us to act because time is growing short. There are veterans out there, Madam Speaker, that are getting chemotherapy as we speak. There are pregnant veterans who need to know if they can have their baby and have it paid for by the VA. I could go on and on. That is why we need to remove this right now. Then we would have time to work these other issues out. And just a couple of VA staffing issues. You hear the concern that VA is going to be privatized and so forth. I hear that all of the time. Well, this is what the VA has done, as far as their facilities are concerned, since 2010. I arrived here in 2009. Since then, the VA has added 3,600 physicians, almost 13,000 nurses—and they are one of the largest employers of nurses in the country—almost 4,000 LPNs, and over 3,200 nonphysician healthcare providers. I could go on and on. The increase in medical services has been over $10 billion since then. So there have been huge increases. And just a couple of things from the VA Secretary’s editorial in USA Today: ‘‘But as VA’s community care efforts have grown, so has our capacity to deliver care inhouse. The VA budget is nearly four times what it was in 2001. Since then, the Department’s workforce has grown from some 224,000 employees in 2001 to more than 370,000 today, according to the Office of Personnel Management.’’ That doesn’t sound like an organization that is being privatized. It has grown in that capacity. ‘‘And we’re’’—the VA—‘‘delivering 3 million more appointments at VA facilities per year than we were in 2014.’’ They have grown that capacity internally. In our fiscal 2018 budget, the trend continues. We are going to spend $2.7 billion more on inhouse VA care compared to a $965 million increase in community care. So there is a $3 billion increase in inhouse VA care versus out ofVA care, or outside care. I think these are all good things. I think the fact that more veterans are getting care, more appointments are being made, whether they are in or out of the VA, is a good thing. But to make the argument that this is privatization is clearly not there. I would like to say that we can work these out. We need to make sure we take that anxiety away. The Secretary has clearly stated that he has to have this passed. I would simply pass it. It gives us 6 months, Madam Speaker, to work on these issues, and I am more than happy to do it. I have stated so to every organization out there. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would just like to respond to the chairman. I, too, have not made the argument on privatization. I do not believe that is the goal here. I do not believe that is what we talked about. If there are those that have that, that is not the intention of this committee, the chairman, his staff, or anyone involved with this. And when we did talk—and I think this could be an interesting way for this House to listen to how we do this. There was transparency in these negotiations, and we sat in front of people and did them. And one of the issues in there was we had to build the capacity amongst the VSOs. We need to stop for a minute. There may be times we need to take those hard votes against it, but I ask all of the Members to think about this, Madam Speaker. All of the veterans service organizations have lined up in opposition to this. b1430 Now, that doesn’t mean that they are totally right, and it doesn’t mean that there isn’t something here we can talk and debate about. The question is trying to get their goodwill. I think when we talked the last time, we had some leases, and I am not calling them token, but in the budget of the big VA, which I do think in many cases is adequately funded, trying to get some of that to show the sense of goodwill. If I were counting on the decision being made strictly by the VA Committee, I would encourage people to know this would get done, but I am deeply concerned we are going to see a Frankenstein monster of appropriation process this week that in no way resembles regular order. That has nothing to do with this committee. Again I would say, if it were left to us, bifurcating this issue and coming back and fixing it, I have faith in that. In this House of Representatives and the leadership now, I do not have that, nor do the veterans service organizations. So the question here is not questioning the motive, the question here is not a false canard of privatization versus insidetheVA care, it is not even the discussion we are having right now of the adequacy overall of the whole budget; it is a case of the VA leadership running a program, running out of money way before they had, and coming to the House and telling us that. And this is not and cannot be made that the idea is you are going to go home without funding the VA. No one will say that about you, and no one should say that about us. Everybody in this House will get this thing done and get it funded. So it is not the case. I do understand this: we are against the wall, we are under the gun, because they just handed us this. So it is our job to figure out how to build everybody into this. So the things that are being asked to do with the Choice Program, I support that. The offsets and payfor, I disagree with. To make that work, our side was willing to say: Can we show some good faith and fund some of these leases and get some payments for these folks in terms of an emergency spending? But I understand the difficulty is if a spending bill comes, there is going to be a vocal group of folks who are going to make the case, as we have seen, that makes it very difficult to move legislation. Madam Speaker, you have witnessed it with healthcare, you have witnessed it with other things, that we are going to have to compromise. If we get into our corners, it is not going to work. So I want to be very clear. The motives of the chairman to care for our veterans is unquestioned, Choice being funded is unquestioned. Making sure there is capacity and goodwill and the funding needs in these leases and some of the things we are asking for is a necessity to make sure the Senate can pass this, and that it shows them that we are moving in the right direction. So I would ask, give us a day, have us come back at this. Don’t put this thing on the board to fail and then let everyone else take the message. Everyone here knows we are going to end up here and pass something that can be signed into law, and that will happen. The questions are: Do we do damage amongst ourselves; do we keep the goodwill and the collaboration; or do we decide we need to make a message first, then come back and then blame someone because they are not funding the veterans? No one in here wants that to happen. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I do agree with my good friend, the gentleman from Minnesota, TIMWALZ. We are not going to leave here until we pass this, because there are veterans out there who are ill, who have served this country honorably, who need care. I am a physician. I have worked in a VA hospital, I have worked in a medical unit in Southeast Asia many years ago, I have seen the results and injuries of war, and I have seen the results and injuries of current wars. And we are going to do this. I know when I sat down and we put this compromise package together, and as openly as I could, I brought in the VSOs, I brought in both the Republican and Democrat sides, which we typically just check all that at the door in this committee, which I am thankful for, 
and work just for veterans, and there were some issues that were brought up. And I recognized that, and I said: Well, the smart thing to do is we know that Choice runs out of money in 2 to 3 weeks. We have to fund the veterans’ healthcare now, and we will take these other issues up as a package and have time to debate them and discuss them. That is all this is about. It is about emergency spending. We recognize that, and that is okay with our side. I say the easiest way to do this is put this $2 billion bill on President Trump’s desk, he will sign it, and veterans will have access to this Choice Program for the next 6 months. That is what the Secretary wants. He wrote a very eloquent editorial in USA Today about this entire issue. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have left. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Minnesota has 8 minutes remaining. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ), the vice ranking member of the full Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose S. 114. A strong and sustainable Veterans Health Administration is critical to providing America’s veterans with the care they deserve. By funding the Choice exception without investing in the VA itself, this legislation explicitly prioritizes the private sector at the VA’s expense. This is not an acceptable way forward. Care in the community has always been and will always be important in ensuring veterans have access to care, the care that they have earned, but it would be a profound mistake to funnel billions of dollars into private care while neglecting the VA and the millions of veterans it serves every year, and that is exactly what this bill does. Veterans service organizations are speaking out, because they know what is at stake. They understand the bigger policy implications of today’s vote. This legislation is a referendum on the mistaken belief that the private sector is better equipped to care for our Nation’s veterans than specialized VA doctors. I have a statement from eight VSOs that echo these concerns, and I include it in the RECORD . 
LEADING VETERANS ORGANIZATIONS CALL ON  MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TODEFEAT UNACCEPTABLE CHOICE FUNDING LEGISLATION  
URGE HOUSE TO WORK WITH SENATE TO REACH A  
BIPARTISAN , BICAMERAL AGREEMENT  (Joint Statement from AMVETS, DAV (Disabled American Veterans), Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association (IAVA), Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), Military Order of the Purple Heart (MOPH), Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA), and Wounded Warrior Project (WWP)) As organizations who represent and support the interests of America’s 21 million veterans, and in fulfillment of our mandate to ensure that the men and women who served are able to receive the health care and benefits they need and deserve, we are calling on Members of Congress to defeat the House vote on unacceptable choice funding legislation (S. 114, with amendments) scheduled for Monday, July 24, and instead work with the Senate to reach a bipartisan, bicameral agreement. As we have repeatedly told House leaders in person this week, and in a jointlysigned letter on June 28, we oppose legislation that includes funding only for the ‘‘choice’’ program which provides additional community care options, but makes no investment in VA and uses ‘‘savings’’ from other veterans benefits or services to ‘‘pay’’ for the ‘‘choice’’ program. Veterans health care benefits have already been ‘‘paid for’’ through the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wore our nation’s uniform, millions of whom suffered injuries, illnesses and lifelong disabilities. In order to ensure that veterans can receive necessary care without interruption, we call on House leaders to take the time necessary to work together with Senate leaders to develop acceptable ‘‘choice’’ funding legislation that not only fills the current funding gap, but also addresses urgent VA infrastructure and resource needs that led to creation of the ‘‘choice’’ program in the first place. All of our organizations are committed to building a future veterans health care system that modernizes VA and integrates community care whenever needed so that enrolled veterans have seamless access to timely, quality care. However, if new funding is directed only or primarily to private sector ‘‘choice’’ care without any adequate investment to modernize VA, the viability of the entire system will soon be in danger. We call on leaders in both the House and Senate to work together in good faith, and we remain committed to supporting such efforts, in order to quickly reach an agreement that ensures veterans health care is not interrupted in the short term, nor threatened in the long term. Mr. TAKANO. The organizations signing the statement are AMVETS; the Disabled American Veterans; Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association, IAVA; Military Officers Association of America, MOAA; Military Order of the Purple Heart; Veterans of Foreign Wars; Vietnam Veterans of America; and Wounded Warrior Project. I would like to quote from a few of the paragraphs: ‘‘In order to ensure that veterans can receive necessary care without interruption, we call on House leaders to take the time necessary to work together with Senate leaders to develop acceptable Choice funding legislation that not only fills the current funding gap, but also addresses urgent VA infrastructure and resource needs that led to creation of the Choice Program in the first place. ‘‘All of our organizations are committed to building a future veterans healthcare system that modernizes VA and integrates community care whenever needed so that enrolled veterans have seamless access to timely, quality care. However, if new funding is directed only or primarily to private sector Choice care without any adequate investment to modernize VA, the viability of the entire system will soon be in danger.’’ I also have letters opposing S. 114 from the Paralyzed Veterans of America and the VFW. I include these letters in opposition in the RECORD . 
WASHINGTON , July 22, 2017.—Paralyzed Veterans of America (Paralyzed Veterans) today weighed in on options being considered to fund the veteran ‘‘choice’’ program, as the House of Representatives considers a vote on a draft bill, S. 114 as amended, on Monday, July 24. Priorities for the organization include open discussion on the best way to build up specialized veterancentric services offered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), while expanding access to non specialized healthcare for veterans without cutting critical nonhealthcare VA benefits. ‘‘The notion of streamlining VA is a necessary discussion that must continue. The devil is in the details, though,’’ said Sherman Gillums Jr., executive director of Paralyzed Veterans of America. ‘‘We do support the responsible ‘right sizing’ of VA, starting with the elimination of redundancies and ultimately using cost savings to increase reinvestment in VA’s foundational services, such as spinal cord injury care. Offsets, at least in part, may be necessary in order to achieve that.’’ Offsets, or program and benefit tradeoffs used for budgeting purposes, are not new to VA. Past offsets include fees and collections related to housing loans and extensions in the reduction of certain pensions used to pay for other benefits. However, this is the first time Congress is requiring VA to include deficit reduction as a component of the agency’s plan to maintain and expand the VA Choice Program. Moreover, some veteran advocates have expressed staunch opposition to offsets because they require VA to employ a ‘‘rob Peter to pay Paul’’ approach to funding programs. ‘‘Paralyzed Veterans’ main concern is that using these offsets to pay for VA healthcare comes at the expense of expanding non healthcare benefits, such as disability compensation,’’ explained Gillums. ‘‘However, we are not prepared to simply oppose offsets because we believe VA is open to strengthening healthcare for our most catastrophically disabled veterans, which matters above all else. Paralyzed Veterans leads as an expert voice on the most complex healthcare challenges these veterans face, and we intend to use that voice to promote new ideas and progress.’’ ‘‘The bottom line is the discussion must continue with open minds on all sides,’’ concluded Gillums. 
ABOUT PARALYZED VETERANS  Paralyzed Veterans of America is the only congressionally chartered veterans service organization dedicated solely for the benefit and representation of veterans with spinal cord injury or disease. For 70 years, we have ensured that veterans have received the benefits earned through their service to our nation; monitored their care in VA spinal cord injury units; and funded research and education in the search for a cure and improved care for individuals with paralysis. As a partner for life, Paralyzed Veterans also develops training and career services, works to ensure accessibility in public buildings and spaces, provides health and rehabilitation opportunities through sports and recreation and advocates for veterans and all people with disabilities.

VFW U RGES OPPOSITION TO S. 114 From: Carlos Fuentes, VFW Legislative Director. Sent: Monday, July 24, 2017. Subject: VFW Urges Opposition to S. 114. On behalf of the nearly 1.7 million members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and its Auxiliary, we urge all members of Congress to vote NO on S. 114, which would gradually privatize the VA health care system. At the VFW’s 118th National Convention, VFW National Commander Brian Duffy asked our members what they thought of this bill. Respectfully, CARLOS FUENTES , Director, National Legislative Service, The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, after more than 2 years and more than $10 billion, the VA Choice Program has failed to deliver on its promise of shorter wait times for veterans. It is time for us to recognize that private care is not the panacea for the complex challenge of caring for our Nation’s veterans and that the VA’s role must remain foundational to veterans’ care. This bill does not reflect that reality. I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation while we continue to work toward a bipartisan, bicameral solution. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time left on our side. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 9 minutes remaining. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to clarify a couple of things that have been said here today. Madam Speaker, we did work out an agreement. When I met with all of the interested parties, which I thought was our job, both the ranking member and myself did this, as we always do, we found out some issues that were there. The primary thing we have to do right now is to provide healthcare, or we will be right back to where we were in 2014, when there were waiting lists around the country and veterans dying waiting on care. Maybe not in urban America, but in rural America where I live, many of these hospitals and veterans absolutely rely on this for their health and welfare. The further they live away from a VA facility, the more they rely on Choice. Let me go over this again so that it is clear. I got into Congress in 2009. I was elected then and sworn in then. The VA was spending $93.7 billion on all VA care; that is the disability claims, healthcare, and cemeteries. In this fiscal year, that budget is going to be $186 billion, where basically the discretionary budget in this Congress has been flat, so that money has come from other places, education, environment, other places that we have invested in our veterans, which is, and I believe to this day, a good thing to be doing. We have gone, in 2001, from 224,000 people, that is not a small organization, to 370,000 people who work for the VA today. They are providing that money. I guess what I was hearing from the other side of the aisle was if we didn’t have the Choice Program, the wait times would have gotten shorter. I mean, that is the reason we have the Choice Program, was the VA wasn’t doing it. The fact is, they have hired people. I mentioned here just a moment ago, since 2010, when I first got here, they have hired 13,000 more nurses, 3,600 more doctors, 3,200 more physician extenders, nurse practitioners and PAs. So the VA has increased its capacity, and they have seen millions of more visits. This week, we are going to take up the VA appropriations bill. I misspoke a minute ago; I said last week. This week, we are taking up the MILCON VA appropriations bill where we talk about those things, about the money that we are going to spend in the VA. That is going to be debated this week. This is a separate issue. This is about providing healthcare for veterans after August 15, that is 2 to 3 weeks from now, when that program will be shut off and veterans in the middle of care will not be able to get care. It is a simple vote. We can work these other things out in the next few months after this very easily. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance of my time. Madam Speaker, to be clear, we are very aligned on the goals here. I am not implying that wait times went down if we didn’t have Choice. I was on the conference committee that created Choice as part of it. There is community care that has been there. There is also a $12 billion shortfall in facilities rated D and F. We had sewer lines breaking and running feces back into hospitals, those types of things. I am not saying that maybe the money is not already there or they are not using it correctly. The fact of the matter is this was a program that was created out of the crisis of Phoenix. It did not stand up as quickly as it could have; it was plagued with tons of problems that many of us heard about. We kept committed to it. I would argue that they are getting their legs under them and providing care in a timely manner. It grossly overspent where it was at. We have had no audit. And I think we need to keep this in mind, that on this side of the aisle, I will be the first to talk to anyone who grandstands this and makes this as a case that this is a failure at the VA or the administration. I don’t know that yet. What I would say is we are all in this together, so we want to get it done. I am simply making the case today that in light of opposition that is rarely seen from the VSOs in such opposition to this, that even though the outcome is there, and nothing the chairman said was incorrect, it is the spirit of what it takes to legislate that is missing around here. You can go to the White House after passing a bill in the House, and if the Senate doesn’t do anything, it is not a law. So we have other people to deal with: constituents, veterans, veterans service organizations, Democrats in the Senate, Republicans in the Senate, Democrats on this side. So what I am asking is, just give a little on the side of what it takes to build the coalition, get the thing passed, and then let’s go back and fund VA care and end this ridiculous argument of privatization versus nonprivatization. Wherever a veteran can get the care and access it as quickly, timely, and quality as possible is what we are trying to shoot for. In many cases, that is in the VA; in other cases, it is in the community. So this is not a dropdead. My hope on this is, is that a debate, when it comes to emergency spending of money and depending on the Senate, is not going to split the goodwill, the good work, and, I would argue, the fair democracy and execution of how the House of Representatives is supposed to work. So my final statements on this would be, I am in virtual total agreement with the chairman on what needs to be done here. Our differences lie in, he is right, when I went back and talked to people, I could not sell to the VSOs the plan as it is, and they have every right to speak out on that. And we could not sell the Senate at this point. So what I would ask the gentleman again is, don’t make us oppose this piece of legislation simply to make a statement for a few members. Bring it back when we can have the Senate, the VSOs, and everyone in and accomplish our goal. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1445 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Obviously, this has been a robust debate about a very important issue, which is providing timely healthcare for veterans who have been waiting. The ranking member and I negotiated in good faith and put an agreement together, which fell apart this weekend. We had met basically with both the VSOs and the committee members and had an agreement to go forward. I then backed up on that agreement because I realized it wasn’t a consensus, and just divided it into two. The most pressing need, Madam Speaker, is to provide healthcare, whether it is chemotherapy or obstetrical care, surgery that a veteran may need, timely visits to the doctor. In 2 to 3 weeks we are up that close, and one of the reasons is, as has been stated multiple times, the VA gave us some 
really bad information 2 months ago. We thought this was going to last for 6 more—8 more months before we ran out of money in this vital program for veterans. This is going to get passed. For all veterans or people out there, citizens of this country watching this, we are going to provide this for our veterans. And I might add that not all VSOs do oppose this. Many were mentioned, but many others do not oppose this legislation. I think it is critical that we get this done, Madam Speaker, get this off the table this week, signed into law, work the other part of the agreement that we had agreed to out in the next coming weeks. I will be willing to work as expeditiously as possible to get this done. Once again, I encourage all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 114, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
REPORT ON H.R. 3358, DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 Mr. COLE, from the Committee on Appropriations, submitted a privileged report (Rept. No. 115–244) on the bill (H.R. 3358) making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, which was referred to the Union Calendar and ordered to be printed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 1, rule XXI, all points of order are reserved on the bill. 
HARRY W. COLMERY VETERANS EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2017 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3218) to amend title 38, United States Code, to make certain improvements in the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3218 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. 
Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or other provision of title 38, United States Code. 
Section 3692 is amended by striking ‘‘December 31, 2017’’ and inserting ‘‘December 31, 2022’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 3218, as amended, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, which I introduced with Ranking Member WALZand every member of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs 2 weeks ago. This bill and how it got to this point today is a shining example of how well Congress can and should work together. It is the result of tireless work of many veterans service organizations and the bipartisan efforts of committee members. I am proud that the improvements and enhancements to the GI Bill that this Chamber will advance today will empower servicemembers, veterans, survivors, and dependents for generations to come. This is the first major improvement to the GI Bill since 2011, and it encompasses 17 bills introduced by our colleagues, many who serve on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and also others who share our committee’s commitment to the men and women who have raised their right hand side to serve. This package includes over 30 provisions and brings forward many enhancements that veterans’ groups have requested for years. I have said it before and I will say it again, this isn’t a package that comes along every day. Madam Speaker, H.R. 3218, as amended, is aptly named after Mr. Harry W. Colmery, who is credited with actually writing by hand the first draft of the World War IIera GI Bill. It is only appropriate that we honor him today for his work on the first GI Bill decades ago. This package would do a number of things, and I want to focus on just a few key improvements. First, it would eliminate the 15year time limit to use the GI Bill benefits for future eligible beneficiaries and anyone who left active service on or after January 1, 2013. Madam Speaker, the GI Bill, when I used it for 2 years after I got out of the military, was, at 10 years, you could no longer use it. This is a lifetime commitment to the American people, to our veterans, if they can exercise their GI Bill benefit at any time. Let me repeat that. For the first time in the history of our GI Bill, future beneficiaries and some veterans will be able to carry these benefits with them throughout their life. Secondly, the bill would provide significant increases in GI Bill funding for 
reservists and guardsmen, including those who are currently serving on orders but do not accrue GI Bill eligibility, as well as dependents, surviving spouses, and surviving dependents. It would also provide 100 percent GI eligibility for post9/11 Purple Heart recipients. Finally, it would increase opportunities for veterans to complete a science, technology, engineering, math degree, or other high technology program. That particular issue is one that I know Leader MCCARTHY has advocated for. It is a privilege to have him as an original cosponsor of the bill, and we thank him for his leadership in getting the bill to the House floor promptly. The provisions I just mentioned only scratch the surface of the benefits that our veterans and survivors will receive under this bill. The amendment to this bill before the House today provides technical and conforming changes to ensure the bill is budgetneutral over the 10year budget window, clarifies that students impacted by the closure of ITT Tech would be able to have their GI Bill eligibility restored if they are unable to transfer their credits, and, starting in fiscal year 2022, would provide eligibility for a Yellow Ribbon Program to Active Duty servicemembers. Madam Speaker, we owe a debt of gratitude to all the VSOs who pushed for this package. And I would be remiss if I didn’t single out and give my sincere thanks to the Student Veterans of America, the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Vietnam Veterans of America, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, and Got Your Six for working tirelessly across the Hill over several months to help us make this happen. I commend and thank them because, without a doubt, we would not be in this Chamber today on the verge of this historic moment without their efforts. Finally, I thank Ranking Member WALZfor his strong leadership and support in making this package come together. I also express my appreciation to Senators ISAKSON and T ESTER for their efforts in negotiating a strong package we can all agree on. I know they are planning to hold a markup on this companion bill to H.R. 3218, as amended, this week, and I would expect that they can pick up and pass this bill and get it to President Trump’s desk before the August District Work Period. Madam Speaker, this is a strong bill that would help thousands of student veterans for the rest of their lives. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, July 20, 2017. Hon. DAVID P. R OE, M.D., Chairman, Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARMR. CHAIRMAN : I am writing to you concerning H.R. 3218, the ‘‘Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017.’’ There are certain provisions in the bill which fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Armed Services. In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed expeditiously to floor consideration of this important legislation, I am willing to waive this committee’s further consideration of H.R. 3218. I do so with the understanding that by waiving consideration of the bill, the Committee on Armed Services does not waive any fixture jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the legislation which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the committee report on H.R. 3218 and into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. The committee also reserves the right to seek appointment to any HouseSenate conference on this legislation and requests your support if such a request is made. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this matter and others between our respective committees. Sincerely, WILLIAM M. ‘‘M AC’’ THORNBERRY , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON VETERANS ’ AFFAIRS , Washington, DC, July 21, 2017. Hon. WILLIAM M. ‘‘M AC’’ THORNBERRY , Chairman, House Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN THORNBERRY : In reference to your letter on July 20, 2017, I write to confirm our mutual understanding regarding H.R. 3218, as amended, the ‘‘Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017.’’ I appreciate the House Committee on Armed Services’ waiver of consideration of provisions under its jurisdiction and its subject matter as specified in your letter. I acknowledge that the waiver was granted only to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 3218, as amended, and does not in any way waive or diminish the Committee on Armed Services’ jurisdictional interests over this legislation or similar legislation. I will support your committee’s request for appointment to any HouseSenate conference on H.R. 3218, as amended. Finally, I will also support your request to include a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter in the committee report on H.R. 3218, as amended, and in the Congressional Record during floor consideration. Again, thank you for your assistance and cooperation with these matters. Sincerely, DAVID P. R OE, M.D., Chairman. 
Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in unwavering support of H.R. 3218. It is interesting, we may prove a couple of things. One is that the universe needs to be balanced, or God has an incredible sense of irony, or our democracy is resilient and strong because, after our debate over the last piece of legislation, I can tell you that, in the time I have had the privilege of representing the people of southern Minnesota, I am not sure there is a day that I feel more of that sense of pride and honor than to be here today. Much of that thanks goes to a humble man who won’t say so himself. The Colmery GI Bill, in any years past, and maybe with a different chairman, would have been the Roe GI Bill, as the Sonny Montgomery GI Bill; but the chairman is a man of humbleness and passing on thanks to others, and it shows in giving the credit to so many Members who wrote and were part of this legislation. This is a real historic piece of work. It is hard to get big pieces of legislation like this done. I saw somebody had written up recently and said: Well, the VA Committee is moving a lot of things because it is easy. I think, after that last little debate and how this one has gone, there is nothing easy about it because it is not supposed to be easy. It is supposed to be a challenge building the coalitions necessary. It is supposed to be thoughtful because we are impacting generations going forward. There are so many people to thank, and the chairman started hitting on them; but I want to again as someone who, if not for the GI Bill, would not have received my education, and our lives and the trajectory of our lives are changed dramatically for that. Somebody stood in these chairs years ago and thought about putting a GI Bill in place that ended up benefiting me; and the idea of being able to pay it forward from one veteran to another, or from this House to another, is something that seems like it is lacking too much around here. When we get together, there is much we can do for this country. The improvements in the bill are wideranging. I just want to mention a couple because I think they need to be said and I think veterans are paying attention, Madam Speaker, and maybe some of the folks watching this. I am happy to say we are able to remove the 15year expiration date. The idea of a lifetime GI Bill just goes to the reality of modernday warriors; many of them serving at different times, serving later in life, not going right away when they get out, or even changing professions; and having that benefit there and holding it and enhancing their education is not only benefiting their lives, it benefits our economy. We know that when these wars started we had very high veteran unemployment rates. We are trying to figure out different ways. And as the chairman pointed out, using the GI Bill for STEM research and other ways to get a skill set is just smart legislation. I want to thank a few folks on the other side about understanding that we have one force now. We do not have an active Army and a Guard and Reserve that are two separate things. These warriors fight side by side, and their call up, when they get called up, means the same thing. Because of the way regulation was written, there were things in here that created an inequality among them. And we were happy to have a general with us in General BERGMAN , Representatives O’ROURKE , B ANKS , and RADEWAGEN , along with someone who 
is not a member of this committee but is a cochair on the Guard and Reserve Caucus. Mr. PALAZZO worked to make sure that we offset those things to make sure our Guard and reservists receive those same benefits from when they were deployed. So this is a rare opportunity, Madam Speaker, to pass a significant piece of legislation that is fully paid for, compromised to in a bipartisan manner. The Senate is going to pick this up, I think. And I look forward to that day when President Trump, hopefully here towards the end of summer or early fall, picks that pen up and signs this and makes a difference in veterans’ lives today and going forward. So my thanks once again to the chairman and his leadership for bringing together and building this coalition that made something that many of us thought about for many years; we would like to have seen got done. It is going to get done today. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1500 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I think one of the greatest things in here is the lifetime benefit. When I was in my early twenties, I wouldn’t have put a big bet on being 40 years old. So I know you don’t ever think you are going to get there, but you do. With the changing workforce today, it is a huge benefit that I think that veterans going forward are going to appreciate and the country will benefit from. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ), my good friend. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership on this bill. Since 1944, the GI Bill has provided veterans the opportunity to invest in themselves and their future through access to education benefits. My father attended college on the GI Bill following his service to our country, launching his life and putting our family on the path to success. While the world has changed since 1944, the dedication and service of our men and women in uniform remains constant. These volunteer warriors stand ready to defend our Nation in theaters around the globe. While we can never fully thank them for their commitment, we must endeavor to assist them and their families wherever possible. The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act improves and extends the benefits granted to veterans and their surviving dependents through the GI Bill, helping to ease the transition from Active Duty to civilian life by paving the way with new career opportunities and technical education. This bipartisan legislation is a crucial step to investing in the success of our veterans and advancing the common cause of serving those who have served us so honorably. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member and the entire committee for their leadership. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. ESTY), my good friend and a stalwart supporter of veterans, the ranking member of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee. Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I rise in enthusiastic support of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act, or the new GI Bill. I thank Chairman ROEand Ranking Member WALZfor leading the charge so that we can bring this important legislation to the House floor today. I have the great honor of serving on the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, a committee on which Democrats and Republicans work together and work closely with our partners, the veterans service organizations. The GI Bill we bring forward today is no exception. This strong bipartisan legislation represents the biggest expansion of veterans’ educational benefits in a decade. It is a huge win for our Nation’s veterans. The men and women of our military deserve the security of knowing that, upon completion of their service to our country, they will be able to embark on a fulfilling career and continue providing for their families. I want to highlight several of the veterans who represent why we need this bill today. The first is a young man from my hometown of Cheshire. He was a classmate of my middle son in high school, and who, at age 19, lost his left leg and seriously injured his right leg when his unit was hit by an IED in Afghanistan. He had been in the country 3 months. It was the third IED. He has been awarded a Purple Heart, but this young man and many others would not, under the current GI Bill, be entitled to receive educational benefits. That seems crazy, and it is. But this bill will correct that injustice and ensure that all our Purple Heart heroes, our American heroes are entitled to use those benefits because, regardless of those months, they have served this country. The second one I think of is a 90plus yearold, who doesn’t like to disclose his age, a Navy veteran from New Britain, Connecticut. He has just earned his second master’s degree. That is the point of the lifelong benefits. We need educational benefits for life. Again, this bill corrects the injustice for Guard and reservists, lifelong benefits. It is a win for America. The military is changing. The GI Bill needs to change with it. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ), my distinguished colleague, a senior member and vice chair of the committee. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman. I think he outdid himself on this one. This is outstanding stuff. There is no other word. It is huge. It really is. He is helping our true American heroes with this, and I am so proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. The challenges our Nation’s heroes face do not end on the battlefield. Education and career training programs offer veterans the opportunity to enter a new chapter of their lives when they return home from their service. I recently visited AmSkills, a manufacturing apprenticeship center in New Port Richey, Florida, to learn more about the good work they are doing locally to help veterans transition to civilian careers. The Forever GI Bill helps ensure that veterans nationwide have the resources to access career education programs such as AmSkills, of course, going to a university maybe, a community college, vocational training, whatever they want to do. Importantly, this bill allows future eligible GI Bill recipients to use their benefits at any point in their lives. That is incredible. It is long overdue, as opposed to the current 15year time limit, which is so unfair. It also includes my provision, the VETERAN Act, which authorizes $30 million to help the VA invest in modernizing their information technology systems for claims processing. Congress and the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee would have oversight of the VA’s proposed changes and monitor its progress. The provision would be a major step in helping veterans receive their benefits in a more timely and efficient manner. Overall, the legislation before us today will improve, expand, and modernize the GI Bill program for veterans and their surviving spouses and dependents. That is so very important. Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this great bill. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ), the vice ranking member of the full Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3218, which secures and strengthens the GI Bill for future generations of veterans. It does so without cutting benefits from anyone who is currently serving. There are several provisions in this legislation worth celebrating. Removing time restrictions for future student veterans and making this a lifetime benefit, and increasing support for reservists, guardsmen, and their families are among the long overdue improvements to the GI Bill that are included in this legislation. But the restoration of GI Bill benefits for students defrauded by ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges is particularly noteworthy for veterans in my district and across the country. When those two schools abruptly shut their doors, thousands of student veterans were left with nontransferable credits, depleted 
benefits, and none of the job opportunities they were promised. By restoring their tuition and housing benefits, we are restoring a measure of justice for these veterans, and we are restoring their opportunity to get the education they deserve. I hope this is just the start of our efforts to crack down on forprofit colleges that exploit veterans. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman ROEand Ranking Member W ALZ for their leadership, as well as the other members of the committee and the veterans service organizations who contributed to the strength of this legislation. Madam Speaker, passing H.R. 3218 is an important step toward ensuring that every person who serves this Nation has the opportunity to live a rewarding and purposeful and prosperous civilian life. I encourage all Members to support this bill. Madam Speaker, before closing, let me just add my praise to the chairman for his generosity and humbleness. I recognize, too, that this bill does not bear his name but the name of a predecessor. That was an incredible gesture, Madam Speaker. I salute the chairman’s leadership. Mr. ROE from Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. COFFMAN ), my good friend, a Marine and Army veteran, and senior member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. COFFMAN. Madam Speaker, today the House will vote on H.R. 3218, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act, the largest expansion of educational benefits for our veterans in over a decade. This legislation provides a lifetime benefit of the GI Bill, an additional 9 months of GI Bill eligibility for veterans pursuing a STEM degree, protection of GI Bill benefits for veterans impacted by a school’s closure, and makes it easier for veterans to use their GI Bill for credentialing and licensure tests. Madam Speaker, H.R. 3218 also includes provisions from my bill, the GI Bill Processing Improvement Act, H.R. 2549, which ensures that veterans studying under the GI Bill for their military service receive their benefits in a timely manner. Madam Speaker, as a United States Army veteran who attended the University of Colorado under the GI Bill, and my late father, a retired United States Army Master Sergeant, Harold Coffman, who learned heating and air conditioning repair under the GI Bill, I rise today in strong support of this legislation. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. SABLAN ), my good friend, a member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and the voice of our Pacific Island veterans. Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, a bipartisan measure of which I am an original cosponsor. Among the bill’s many benefits that preceding speakers have stated, there are three that address issues specifically brought to me by veterans in my district, the Northern Mariana Islands. The first affects veterans who were enrolled in colleges that closed and who, as a result, lost their educational benefit. The bill today restores that benefit so those veterans can continue their education. The second problem my veterans brought to me has to do with post9/11 reservists, like those in Company E, 100th Battalion, 442nd Infantry Regiment, part of the Go for Broke Unit; and the 302nd Quartermaster Company in the Marianas; and national guardsmen, like the 368th Military Police Company, who were under Active Duty and who did not accrue education benefits. Those veterans will now have their Active Duty count towards the GI Bill. Third, the minimum GI Bill benefit for veterans with less than 36 months of qualifying active service increases to 50 percent of the maximum amount payable. Madam Speaker, I thank House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman ROEand Ranking Member W ALZ for their leadership and commitment to working together for the benefit of our veterans, a truly bipartisan product of work. I also commend the veteran service organizations we worked with for their determination to ensure our country honors the promise made to those who served and sacrificed on our behalf and in service to our Nation. Madam Speaker, I ask for support for this legislation. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHER FORD ), an active member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise today also in strong support of H.R. 3218, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017. When our brave men and women put on the uniform to protect our Nation, we have a sacred responsibility to provide them and their families with certain opportunities in repayment for their services and sacrifice. As a new generation of servicemembers are returning from the battlefield, we as a nation have needed to reevaluate how we better help our veterans succeed back home. This important legislation is an example of how that success for veterans can be achieved. As a result of the hard work of many veteran service organizations, the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and countless veteran advocates, H.R. 3218 makes many important reforms to the GI Bill to improve veterans’ access to education. One reform that I would like to highlight is a provision that I introduced as a standalone piece of legislation earlier this year called the Julian Woods Yellow Ribbon Program Expansion Act. Madam Speaker, under current law, dependents and surviving spouses of those killed in action who attend college on the Fry Scholarship are not eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Program. The Yellow Ribbon Program helps to cover the cost of schools with tuition above the level of what the GI Bill covers. b1515 Since the dependents and spouses of those killed in action are not currently eligible for this program, they are, in fact, limited in their educational opportunities. I thank the committee, Chairman ROE, and Ranking Member W ALZfor including my bill in this legislation, and it is just one of many reforms that this package makes. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues’ support. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. KHANNA ), a true supporter of veterans and new Member of the House who came with a passion for veterans. Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member WALZ. I want to commend Ranking Member WALZ and Chairman R OEfor this extraordinary piece of legislation that invests in the education of our veterans. I also am pleased that you included Majority Leader MCCARTHY ’s legislation of which I was a proud original cosponsor, the VET TEC Act. That will allow veterans, for the first time, to take technology courses and learn some of the skills that are going to be needed for the 21st century economy. It is no surprise that I read that the majority leader got this idea from his son, who spent a lot of time out in Silicon Valley and is well regarded. It is really heartening to see this House come together with the chairman’s and ranking member’s leadership on the jobs of the 21st century and making sure our veterans have opportunities for them. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. MESSER ), my good friend. We have served on the Education and the Workforce Committee together since he has been here, and he is in his fourth term. Mr. MESSER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the chairman and his extraordinary leadership on this important topic. I rise today to urge support for this broad, bipartisan reform package which expands and modernizes the GI Bill to better serve our military families. The bill includes a bipartisan proposal that I have worked on with Congressman MARK TAKANO of California to help veteran students impacted by school closures, like ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges, based in our home States. 
H.R. 3218 corrects previous inequities faced by our nation’s brave veterans, and protects their future. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3218. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3218, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
MILITARY RESIDENCY CHOICE ACT Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 282) to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to authorize spouses of servicemembers to elect to use the same residences as the servicemembers. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 282 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Military Residency Choice Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 282, the Military Residency Choice Act. The Military Residency Choice Act would change the way military spouses claim State residency by allowing a spouse to claim the same State of residence as their servicemember spouse, even if they have never physically lived in that State. I want to commend Representatives STEFANIK and W ITTMAN for their work on this bill, and I will allow them to describe it in greater detail in a moment. Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 282, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 282. This is a commonsense bill. It has received bipartisan support as it moved through the committee. It simplifies the process for a spouse of a servicemember to choose and change their State of residency for tax and voting purposes. The bill is about removing additional headaches from servicemembers’ lives and doing right by them. There are enough issues being a member of the military and for spouses and family. We don’t need to add more to it. This is a smart piece of legislation. It does exactly what it says it is going to do, and I support and encourage all Members to join me in support. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK ), coauthor of the bill and my colleague on the Education and the Workforce Committee. Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, my legislation gives military spouses the choice to establish the same State of residency as the servicemember, giving them the benefit of retaining the same State of residency for voting and tax purposes. As the proud Representative of Fort Drum and the Navy site at Kesselring, which I visited just this past Friday, I have heard firsthand about the challenges that military families face, and I have the highest respect for the sacrifices these families make to help protect our Nation and safeguard our freedom. Military families must relocate every few years due to their spouse’s responsibility to meet the requirements within the military. They sacrifice a great deal during these relocations, uprooting their lives and disrupting their families, all while serving as the critical support system for their loved ones. This is often a difficult and challenging time, with the heaviest burden falling upon military spouses. Current law allows ActiveDuty servicemembers to maintain one State of legal residence for tax and voting purposes, even when servicemembers receive military orders requiring them to relocate, but this does not apply to the servicemember’s spouse. Essentially, this loophole requires spouses to establish residency every time the servicemember receives a new assignment, adding undue stress and anxiety to military families already under the pressure of managing their relocation. This legislation fixes this inconsistency. Military spouses serve, too, and this bill eliminates the daunting task of documenting multiple tax jurisdictions and helps reduce instances of military spousal unemployment. Traveling across the north country in New York, I have listened to the sacrifices our military families make to keep our Nation safe. We have a duty to reduce these burdens they face. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill on a bipartisan basis. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I again urge Members to support this smart piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1530 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support this commonsense legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WALKER ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 282. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
VA PROVIDER EQUITY ACT Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1058) to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the role of podiatrists in the Department of Veterans Affairs, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1058 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘VA Provider Equity Act’’. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1058, as amended, the VA Provider Equity Act. This legislation would recognize the professional contribution of hardworking podiatrists within the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system. The VA standard for compensating podiatrists has not been updated in 41 years. In that time, education and training for podiatrists has been revolutionized. As a result of the VA’s failure to recognize and respond to advancements in podiatry practice, it has created significant disparities in pay and advancement opportunities for podiatrists practicing at the VA in comparison to their peers in the private sector. Consequently, the VA struggles to recruit and retain experienced, qualified podiatrists—those we want caring for our veterans—at a time when veteran need for podiatry care is increasing. This legislation would solve that problem by allowing VA podiatrists the opportunity to seek leadership opportunities at VA medical facilities and making podiatry pay equal to physician and dentist pay within the VA healthcare system. I am grateful to my good friend, fellow veteran, and committee member, Dr. BRAD WENSTRUP , the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, for his leadership in recognizing what an important issue this is and being thoughtful and tenacious in pursuit of a solution to it. I am proud to join Dr. WENSTRUP in fully supporting this legislation and urge all of my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 1058, as amended. The VA Provider Equity Act is a commonsense solution to a really important problem that is plaguing the VHA—a shortage of healthcare providers. This legislation would allow VHA to attract the talented and experienced podiatrists it needs to better treat conditions caused by lower extremity injuries. By allowing podiatrists the opportunity to advance within the VHA while earning pay comparable to what private sector podiatrists earn, VHA can better attract and retain these providers. I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio, Dr. WENSTRUP ’s, work highlighting this, educating all of us on the committee, and making sure that the treatments of podiatrists between VHA and the private sector industry is aligned. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this good piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP ). Colonel Wenstrup is a member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1058, the VA Provider Equity Act, as amended, which would strengthen access to the comprehensive firstclass healthcare that veterans deserve. Podiatric care is one of the top needs at VA medical centers across the country. Veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan report high rate of musculoskeletal ailments resulting from lower extremity injuries inflicted by improvised explosive devices. Veterans of previous wars also experience higher instances of foot and ankle ailments caused by aging, diabetes, and serviceconnected disabilities. All of this leads to increased demand for podiatric care at the VHA. However, VA struggles to recruit and retain podiatrists due to a disparity in pay and leadership opportunities in comparison to both podiatrists in the private sector and to other physicians employed by the VA. This is because VA first established standards for podiatrists in 1976, and podiatric education, training, and practice have changed considerably since that time. Nonetheless, VA’s outdated standards have remained unchanged. This has translated into increased wait times. As of 2015, 93 percent of new podiatry patients wait more than 15 days for an appointment, and podiatry is the fourth most referredout surgical service to community care. My bill, H.R. 1058, the VA Provider Equity Act, would make VA’s doctors of podiatric medicine equal to doctors of osteopathy and medical doctors within VA in terms of pay and ensure that VA podiatrists are eligible for the same promotions and leadership opportunities as other VA physicians, which is consistent with the private sector. This bill will make it easier for VA to recruit and retain the specialists our veterans so desperately need. In turn, this will result in better care for veterans and savings to the taxpayer, as a recent study from the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research found that podiatry services provided to diabetic patients could have saved between $29 million and $97 million in 2014, in the State of California alone. 
Mr. Speaker, as the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee and the rest of our colleagues in Congress continue to work together to help our veterans receive the care they need, I urge the passage of this bill. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, again, this is a smart piece of legislation. I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his work on this. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1058, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1058, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS BONUS TRANSPARENCY ACT Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1690) to amend title 38, United States Code, to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit an annual report regarding performance awards and bonuses awarded to certain highlevel employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1690 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Department of Veterans Affairs Bonus Transparency Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1690, as amended, the Department of Veterans Affairs Bonus Transparency Act. This bill would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to submit an annual report to specified congressional committees on the performance awards and bonuses presented to Senior Executive Service employees, SES employees. I believe that, if you do excellent work, you should receive a bonus. I also believe such a bonus should be justified and that there should be some level of transparency regarding those who receive a bonus. Mr. Speaker, I support Congresswoman TENNEY ’s bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2006, the VA Procurement Efficiency and Transparency Act. This legislation will require VA to record any costs or savings it incurs as a result of using competitive procedures. The reporting requirement is limited to contracts reported in the Federal procurement data system and will ensure increased transparency in the VA. It also requires VA to use standardized contracting templates throughout the entire VA. This will create an efficient system for VA contracting officers so they are not wasting manhours developing multiple documents to award VA contracts. Anyone who has been a Member of Congress and has dealt with VA contracts knows how difficult, confusing, and just, quite honestly, frustrating this is. So having standardized forms will improve oversight of these contracts so that all VA employees and contractors follow the same requirements for the same type of contract. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this smart legislation, efficiency in government, and help provide care in a more timely manner. Mr. Speaker, I urge its support, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ) who is the author of the bill. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Chairman ROEand Ranking Member WALZfor prioritizing bipartisanship and putting our veterans ahead of politics. This committee’s work is a testament to what we can achieve here in Congress when we put aside politics and focus on results. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Veterans Affairs Bonus Transparency Act requires the VA to submit a report to Congress at the end of each fiscal year listing the bonuses that were awarded to seniorlevel executives within the department. In 2015, VA employees received more than $177 million in bonuses, which was 24 percent more than they had received in 2014. The average bonus for a senior executive was $10,000. I have no doubt that the men and women of the VA serve our veterans admirably each day. In fact, I know that they do. In my own district, I have spoken with veterans who are grateful for the compassionate care they receive from the VA hospital in Syracuse as well as local VA clinics in Binghamton and Rome. VA employees should be fairly compensated for their work and awarded for their achievements in service to our Nation’s veterans. It is also clear to me that there is more work to be done. Just recently, an audit of several VA facilities in 
North Carolina and Virginia revealed that wait times continue to be misrepresented and that nearly 14,000 veterans were denied access to timely care. The audit also found that veterans were waiting an average of 26 days to see mental health specialists, while the VA falsely reported average wait times of 6 days. In light of such news, the American people are right to wonder who at the VA may be receiving a bonus this year. They are also right to be concerned about the nature and conditions of such bonuses. H.R. 1690 would add a simple reporting requirement to existing law that will streamline the oversight of bonuses at the VA. It requires the agency to proactively provide information to Congress that details the amount of each bonus awarded to senior executives as well as the job titles of the individuals and the location of their employment. Because of the patterns of mismanagement at the VA, veterans must know how bonuses are being awarded at the agency, and Congress deserves to receive this information in as timely a manner as possible without having to request it each year. This bill increases transparency over the bonus process without placing an undue burden on the agency. It is an honor to represent a district that is home to more than 55,000 veterans. I owe it to each of them every day to make sure that the VA is accountable and transparent. Our Nation’s veterans deserve the very best healthcare for their service and sacrifice to our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROE and Ranking Member WALZ for their support, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1690. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, sometimes we sing from the same song sheet, and sometimes we don’t sing from the same song sheet. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Yes, Mr. Speaker, I was in the Lutheran hymnal and not the Baptist. I apologize to the gentlewoman, and the next time I ask my 10yearold to not be on his phone, I will be duly chastised. Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support of H.R. 1690. The gentlewoman is right. It is smart. The public demands transparency. Make sure that there is an accountability in this, and make sure that we are tracking. So I thank the gentlewoman for her tolerance of us getting ahead of ourselves. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this piece of legislation also, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1690, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL SCRIBE PILOT ACT OF 2017 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1848) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot program on the use of medical scribes in Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1848 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans Affairs Medical Scribe Pilot Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1848, as amended, the Veterans Affairs Medical Scribe Pilot Act of 2017, which I am proud to sponsor. One of my priorities as chairman of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs is to increase access to care for veteran patients. One way to do that is help hardworking Department of Veterans Affairs clinicians to be more efficient in the practice of highquality care. The Veterans Affairs Medical Scribe Pilot Act of 2017 would do just that by creating a 2year pilot program to test the use of scribes in VA medical centers. b1545 Scribes are increasingly used in the private sector to help doctors navigate and document a patient’s electronic health record. That allows doctors to place their focus not on a computer screen, but squarely on the patient. I jokingly say, Mr. Speaker, that it was electronic health records that made me a Congressman. Basically, it ran me out of the medical office. That is a slight exaggeration, but it is not too far off. Like many doctors I hear from today, I found the increasing amount of time that I was spending attending to electronic health record requirements, necessary as they may be, detracted from the quality of my patients’ interactions and significantly slowed down how smoothly my clinic day would operate. I believe the same is true at VA. Many doctors now, Mr. Speaker, are spending over half their time entering information, just basically being data entry people. Onsite visits to VA medical facilities across the country, my staff and I always ask VA employees how we can help them provide safer, better care and see more patients. By far, one of the most common responses that we hear is a plea to ‘‘give us scribes; give us some help.’’ That is exactly what passage of H.R. 1848, as amended, will do. This bill also includes provisions of H.R. 1662, a bill sponsored by Dr. BRAD WENSTRUP , the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, which would bring VA medical centers in line with every other major healthcare system by prohibiting smoking on VA medical facility properties. I thank Dr. WENSTRUP for his leadership on this issue, and I am grateful to be working with him to make VA medical facilities healthy, smokefree places for VA employees to serve veterans and for veterans to seek care. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support me in supporting H.R. 1448, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 1848, as amended, the Veterans Affairs Medical Scribe Pilot Act of 2017, offered by Chairman ROE. No one knows more about this, and I appreciate the chairman’s education that goes into learning about the practice of medicine. Having a physician as the chairman is invaluable. This issue of scribes and how it interfaces with the doctor providing the care and the electronic medical record has been invaluable for me to understand. I know that the chairman and many physicians have said they feel they are spending too much time entering the data and not enough time on patients. Chairman ROE’s legislation would allow for the use of scribes within the VA during a 2year pilot program. It has been proven to assist physicians and alleviate administrative burdens. This is smart stuff, again. I appreciate the insight brought to us and making more efficiencies in the system. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1848, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. f 
VA PROCUREMENT EFFICIENCY AND TRANSPARENCY ACT Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2006) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the procurement practices of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2006 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘VA Procurement Efficiency and Transparency Act’’. 
To the extent practicable, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall make available and use on a Departmentwide basis the standardized procurement templates used by the Central Office of the Department, the Veterans Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration. In carrying out this section, the Secretary may customize such templates to address particular procurement situations. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2005, the VA Procurement Efficiency and Transparency Act. H.R. 2006 is commonsense contracting, transparency, and efficiency legislation sponsored by my friend, Representative MIKECOFFMAN , an esteemed member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. This bill will make clear how much money the VA is saving by competing contracts and direct the VA to organize its contracting documents. Procurement difficulties seem to happen year after year, and I thank Representative COFFMAN and other Members with reform bills under consideration today for their work on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 2006, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I feel so strongly about this, I am going to support it again today. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2006, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. COFFMAN ), a senior member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, a veteran of both the Marine Corps and the U.S. Army, and a great friend. Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, one of the VA’s top procurement goals is to achieve savings through competition. However, there is no uniformity in how the savings are calculated or if they are recorded at all. This is why I introduced H.R. 2006, the VA Procurement Efficiency and Transparency Act. My bill will create a consistent method for the VA to measure and record the cost savings generated by competing contracts from its $20 billion procurement budget. H.R. 2006 also directs the VA to organize its document templates, which are the building blocks for every contract, and make them accessible in a central place. Mr. Speaker, too often, the VA reports flawed or incomplete data to Congress and to the public. While the VA’s current leadership is working to correct years of transparency problems, the legislation gives that effort a muchneeded push in the right direction. Mr. Speaker, the VA’s contracting will benefit by adopting these best practices, and I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense measure. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2006. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
PROTECTING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR VETERANS ACT OF 2017 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2749) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the oversight of contracts awarded by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2749 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting Business Opportunities for Veterans Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman 
from Minnesota (Mr. W ALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2749, as amended, the Protecting Business Opportunities for Veterans Act of 2017. H.R. 2749, as amended, is contracting reform legislation sponsored by my friends, General BERGMAN and Representative KUSTER , the chairman and ranking member of our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. This bill will help stop companies that exploit the existing contracting laws and regulations to take work away from legitimate servicedisabled veteranowned small businesses and veteranowned small businesses. It is crucial that Federal procurement be fair and that veteran entrepreneurs actually receive the business opportunities that the law creates for them. This bill is a smart fix for a difficult problem, and I appreciate my colleagues’ work on it. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 2749, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2749, as amended, the Protecting Business Opportunities for Veterans Act. I thank General BERGMAN and Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire for introducing this. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations has worked hard to ensure that our service disabled veteranowned small businesses are provided the protections and support they need from the VA to remain competitive in the Federal contracting process. Congress granted Federal Government contracting preferences to small businesses owned by veterans and servicedisabled veterans because we want our veteran entrepreneurs to thrive. This bill, introduced by Representatives BERGMAN and K USTER , closes a loophole utilized by some that pass through contracts to nonveteran owned businesses. This practice is unfair to the thousands of smallbusiness owners who are actually serving and owned by servicedisabled veterans who play by the rules. The bill ensures that only our veteran entrepreneurs get this preference by closing the loophole. It is smart, it is the right thing to do, and I urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ), a new member of our committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak today on behalf of H.R. 2749, the Protecting Business Opportunities for Veterans Act of 2017. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their support for Ranking Member KUSTER and myself. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2749 aims to provide the VA with the tools it needs to correct the persistent problem in contracting. The problem is improper pass throughs. An improper passthrough is when a small business obtains a contract under a setaside, but gives all or substantially all of the work to a large company and, nonetheless, collects profit. Sometimes multiple companies pass through the work while adding price markups. This has long been prohibited by law and wastes taxpayer dollars; but, in practice, agencies have little ability to stop it. In the VA, veteranowned and servicedisabled veteranowned small businesses have special preference to receive contracts, but bad actors are taking contracts away from lawabiding veteran businessowners who truly want to perform their work. The committee gets complaints about this situation nearly every week. This bill will make every bidder for a VA contract certify that it will perform the percentage of work the law already requires. The bill also directs the VA to work with the Office of Inspector General in a more effective way to find, stop, and, where appropriate, punish the improper passthroughs. H.R. 2749 relies on existing law and fills in gaps in implementation, but does not create any new bureaucracy. The solution is long overdue. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this good piece of legislation that is doing the right thing, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 2749, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. RICE of South Carolina). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2749, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. f 
ENSURING VETERAN ENTERPRISE PARTICIPATION IN STRATEGIC SOURCING ACT Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2781) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to certify the sufficient participation of small business concerns owned and controlled and owned by veterans and small business concerns owned by veterans with serviceconnected disabilities in contracts under the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2781 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ensuring Veteran Enterprise Participation in Strategic Sourcing Act’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. 
Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. b1600 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2781, as amended, the Ensuring Veteran Enterprise Participation in Strategic Sourcing Act. H.R. 2781 is another piece of thoughtful contracting legislation sponsored by a hardworking member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Dr. NEAL DUNN. This bill will make sure that all small businesses owned by veterans and servicedisabled veterans are never excluded from a particular group of contracts run by the General Services Administration, or GSA. Despite Congress’ efforts to give our veterans maximum opportunity in VA contracting, the system does not always work as it should. This bill fixes a loophole that has cropped up recently and makes sure veteran businesses are not inadvertently ignored when VA uses these GSA contracts. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2781, as amended. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2781. As said, the bill would require the VA Secretary and the General Services Administration to increase the number of veteranowned small businesses and servicedisabled veteranowned small businesses on the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative. The Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative increases cost savings, value, and socioeconomic participation for the sourcing of government contracts and ensures that our government has a community of businesses to strategically source from. Ensuring more veteranowned small business and servicedisabled veteran owned small businesses are on the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative means that taxpayer dollars are spent on contracts that add value to the U.S. Government, at the same time supporting veteranowned businesses— smart legislation, again, the right thing to do. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DUNN), a veteran and the author of the bill. Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2781 is a commonsense solution to a complicated problem. I am proud to sponsor it with my good friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. PANETTA ). Over the last 10 years, Congress gave veteran and veteran servicedisabled veteranowned small businesses the highest preference to compete for VA contracts. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled in the Kingdomware case that this preference applies in all situations, even when VA uses contracts awarded by other agencies. A loophole has emerged in a group of contracts called the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative run by the General Services Administration. Currently, the VA uses the GSA to connect them with suppliers of certain goods and services that they need to purchase. All too often, the GSA is not connecting the VA with enough small businesses that are owned by veterans and servicedisabled veterans. The law requires that the VA look for these companies and buy from them when it can, if they are competitive; but when the veteran businesses are not on the GSA list, the VA can’t find them or use them. Because of the loophole, wellqualified veteranowned companies are being passed over. In some cases, VA disregards the GSA contracts and finds veteranowned companies elsewhere on their own, but this wastes resources by creating contracts similar to what the GSA already has in place. This bill simply directs the VA Secretary to determine whether veteran owned and servicedisabled veteran owned small businesses are sufficiently represented on the contracts for VA to follow the law. If not, the VA must consult with the GSA to increase the representation on all the contracts and their subcategories. Should this not be possible on a particular contract or subcategory, the VA must stop using it. I am honored that this bill has earned the support of the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the National Veteran Small Business Coalition. We need to hold the VA accountable to the veterans it serves, including our veteran and servicedisabled small business owners. It is the right thing to do, and I urge all Members to support it. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. PANETTA ), one of the coauthors of this bill and a veteran himself and a champion of veterans since he has been in Congress. Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2781, the Ensuring Veteran Enterprise Participation in Strategic Sourcing Act. It is a bill that the kind gentleman from Florida and I have sponsored so that it is easier for the Department of Veterans Affairs to contract with the very veterans whom they serve. As a veteran and someone who has worked with veterans, I understand the challenges our servicemembers can face when they transition from military to civilian life. That is why we in Congress are working to serve those who served us by opening every opportunity for our veterans to thrive and contribute not just to our communities, but to our country. Throughout the United States, there are many quality veteran and service disabled veteranowned small businesses that sell office and janitorial supplies or provide building maintenance services. Those businesses and the government would mutually benefit if the businesses seeking Federal contracts were given a fair chance to compete. But as it stands now, veteran and servicedisabled veteranowned small businesses are losing out on such opportunities because of an unintentional loophole when the VA contracts with the General Services Administration, the GSA, for office and janitorial services, equipment, and supplies. Now, that loophole opened up last year when the VA implemented the Kingdomware Supreme Court ruling. Normally, when it comes to its contracts, the VA ensures that veteran owned small businesses are considered in the bidding process. But the Kingdomware ruling required that the VA set aside contracts for veteran owned small businesses when there are two or more companies that are interested, capable, and can perform at a fair and reasonable price. So when the VA contracts with the GSA for janitorial or office supplies, the GSA is not giving veteranowned businesses the proper consideration for those types of contracts; thus, the requirement to consider veteranowned businesses is not being implemented. Fortunately, this bill, our bill, Democrats’ and Republicans’ bill, would close that loophole. It would require the VA Secretary to work with the GSA to increase the number of service disabled veteran and veteranowned small businesses represented in that contracting process. The bill would eliminate that barrier that limited our veterans and their businesses from contracting with the government. It is a solution that is fair to veteran entrepreneurs. It is a bill that has strong bipartisan support. It is a bill that moved through the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee with unanimous consent, and it is a bill that all of us are proud of, Democrats and Republicans, and that is why I am proud to sponsor this bill. I am proud to present it to you with the gentleman from Florida because it will do 
what is smart for our country’s veterans, and that is why I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST), the subcommittee chair on the committee and a marine veteran. Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2781, the Ensuring Veteran Enterprise Participation in Strategic Sourcing Act. This important legislation clarifies that veteranowned small businesses should be given proper consideration for contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs. It will help to ensure that our contracting is efficient and fair to our Nation’s veterans. The VA has a special responsibility to maximize business opportunities for our heroes when they come home from serving abroad. Helping veteranowned small businesses succeed is a bipartisan effort, as you have heard already here today. I am happy to see so many of my colleagues support it. I want to thank my colleague, Dr. DUNN, for offering the commonsense fix to contracting at the VA, and I look forward to voting in favor of it. I urge Members to support H.R. 2781. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. Again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2781. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ), the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee chair and a marine who served with distinction. Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join Dr. DUNN and Mr. P ANETTA in supporting H.R. 2781, the Ensuring Veteran Enterprise Participation in Strategic Sourcing Act. This bill and my bill are complementary legislation. In addition to the vital healthcare and benefits VA provides to our veterans, it also awards billions of dollars of contracts annually to their small businesses. The impact of these contracts to support livelihoods and create jobs all over our country cannot be overstated. Just as veteran businessowners must abide by the rules, VA must abide by the rules and make available to them the contracting opportunities they have earned. Federal procurement is a very complicated system that sometimes produces strange outcomes. We must continue to work on that procurement and make sure that it functions properly. I strongly urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 2781. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, I would certainly urge everyone to support this actionable piece of legislation. During the last 6
1⁄2months, the Veterans’ Affairs Committee has been a very active committee. When we realized that our Choice Program was running short of funds, the committee, in a bipartisan way, voted to extend that. We have also realized that there are 470,000 veterans whose claims are in appeals and have not been adjudicated. We realize that program is not functioning as it should. The House acted quickly, was bipartisan. That legislation has now been passed out of the Senate VA Committee and is awaiting action by the floor. We hope to have it passed and signed into law soon. We knew that the Secretary of the VA said he had problems, that he couldn’t—most VA employees are terrific. Some of my best friends work at the VA. But there are some not good employees out of the 370,000 there, and the Secretary said, to do his job, to reform the VA, he needed a bill where he could terminate poorperforming employees, and this House and Senate gave him that. The President has signed that into law. The Secretary has also moved in speeding up the electronic health record transformation into a modern offtheshelf system. We debated on this floor, today, the Post9/11 GI Bill update, which is a tremendous benefit for veterans, and decades from now we will look back on this debate we had on the floor, I think, with some admiration as I do. It has been a true privilege and pleasure to be on this committee and to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take care of these important issues this committee has produced. It will make this promise to our veterans of this country; it will continue to produce results for them. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2017 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2333) to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to increase the amount of leverage made available to small business investment companies, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2333 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Small Business Investment Opportunity Act of 2017’’.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the House Small Business Committee, a day does not go by without me hearing from our Nation’s job creators. From inspiring accounts that are driven by their work ethic to stories of sacrifice all in the name of growing their company, the Nation’s small businesses are the true lifeblood of the American economy. b1615 With over 29 million small businesses operating in the United States, they are responsible for two out of every three new jobs created in this country. However, their full potential is being held back by heavyhanded regulations and uncertainty. Unfortunately, their inability to access capital continues to prevent job creation and expansion. As a way to increase access to capital, the Small Business Administration jumpstarts and enhances the flow of venture and private equity capital through the Small Business Investment Company program, also known as the SBIC program. Created in the 1958 Small Business Investment Act, the program utilizes a privately owned and SBA licensed model to increase access to capital. With over 300 SBICs operating in the country and more than $24 billion of capital under management, the program in fiscal year 2015 invested more than $5.4 billion in approximately 1,000 small businesses. In 2015, I introduced a SBIC bill that focused on increasing the family of funds limit. Similar to my 2015 legislation that was signed into law, the bill we have before us today concentrates on the individual leverage limit. Currently set at $150 million, the individual limit determines how much capital can be deployed by a SBIC that has only one fund under management. To better utilize this program and allow an increase in capital to small businesses, H.R. 2333—the bill that we are considering here this afternoon—increases the individual leverage limit to $175 million. I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. KNIGHT ), the chairman of our Subcommittee on Contracting 
MICROLOAN MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2056) to amend the Small Business Act to provide for expanded participation in the microloan program, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
H.R. 2056 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

lack access to traditional lending. Unable to borrow money from banks and credit unions, they often turn to friends, family, or credit cards to finance their businesses. The SBA Microloan program provides access to capital through nonprofit intermediaries that will loan up to $50,000 for their upstart companies. These intermediaries also offer technical assistance and counseling to facilitate their business’ success. H.R. 2056 will improve the SBA Microloan program by expanding the lending volume to microloan intermediaries, by giving them greater flexibility with their SBA technical assistance grants, to provide more preloan comprehensive assistance to businesses in their infancy, and by requiring the SBA to study and report to Congress on the utilization of the program. This bill provides meaningful reforms to modernize the SBA Microloan program, and I am a proud cosponsor. This is a needed bill to support the engine of our economy: our small businesses. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY ). Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2056, my bipartisan bill to improve the Small Business Administration’s Microloan program. Small businesses are the backbone of our Nation’s economy. In my home State of Florida, there are 2.4 million small businesses, which is 99.8 percent of all employers in the State. These businesses employ 3.2 million workers. In my central Florida district, we have a vibrant community of entrepreneurs, and they tell me the number one challenge they face is access to capital. As someone who counseled entrepreneurs and businesses in the private sector before I came to Congress, I know how difficult it can be to obtain the capital you need to start and grow a small business. That is why this bill to improve SBA’s Microloan program is so important. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman CHABOT and Ranking Member VELA´ZQUEZ for helping to advance this bill through the Small Business Committee, where the bill received unanimous support. I also thank the Administrator of the SBA, Linda McMahon, and her senior staff for working with my office to make modest changes to the bill after it was introduced. These changes should better position the bill to move through Congress and then to be signed into law by the President. The Microloan program is one of several lending programs administered by the SBA. Its goal is to help smalldollar borrowers who want to start or grow their business. Under this program, the SBA makes loans to nonprofit organizations known as intermediaries. These intermediaries, in turn, make shortterm loans up to $50,000 to small businesses and nonprofit childcare centers. Recipients of microloans use these funds to finance their operations and to acquire supplies and equipment. The Microloan program seeks, in particular, to assist small business owners with little or no credit history, women and minority businessowners, and aspiring and existing entrepreneurs who may not qualify for traditional bank loans or even for the larger loan guarantee programs that the SBA administers. In fiscal year 2016, intermediaries provided over $60 million in loans to small firms around the country, creating or retaining nearly 18,000 jobs in the process. While the loans may not be large, they can mean the difference between a small business starting up and succeeding or struggling and shuttering. Despite the relative success of the Microloan program, it must be modernized. My bill would improve the program in two respects. First, the bill would increase the total amount an intermediary can borrow from the SBA from $5 million to $6 million. This will allow intermediaries to make more smalldollar loans to more small businesses and entrepreneurs. Second, the bill would enable intermediaries to use a larger percentage of the technical assistance grants they receive from the SBA in order to help small business owners and entrepreneurs navigate the microloan applications process. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill, which will assist and empower more small businesses. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Mr. Speaker, SBA’s Microloan program fulfills a critical need in the capital markets. It is a key resource for startup, newly established, and growing small businesses, many of which come from traditionally underserved markets, where personal and commercial credit are hard to come by. The Microloan Modernization Act of 2017 makes targeted reforms to assist more of these small businesses, by raising the amount that the SBA may commit to an intermediary and raising the cap on the amount of grant funding for technical assistance. These changes would further assist very small businesses to obtain loans and, in turn, provide them greater opportunity to create and retain the jobs that they need. With no significant effect on the Federal budget, I can think of no better time to make longsought changes to improve the program. As such, I once again would urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would note again that we have bipartisan work on this committee. I thank Mrs. MURPHY and Mr. B ACON for working together and pushing this bill, which I think will benefit small businesses all across the country. I we appreciate that. Mrs. MURPHY , of course, is from Florida, and Mr. BACON is from Nebraska. I think the Microloan program really is an important tool in the SBA’s capital access toolbox, but it is in need of modernizing, and H.R. 2056 does that. These are the reforms, I think, that the Nation’s job creators need. Small businesses, startups, and entrepreneurs have the ideas to create the next great American company. We just need to provide the correct environment for that growth to take place, and I think this is something that will contribute towards that possibility and, therefore, be able to create more jobs for more Americans all across the country. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2056, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2056, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
INVESTING IN MAIN STREET ACT OF 2017 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2364) to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to increase the amount that certain banks and savings associations may invest in small business investment companies, subject to the approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2364 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Investing in Main Street Act of 2017’’. 
DEFINED .—For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘appropriate Federal banking agency’ has the meaning given that term under section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDYCHU) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As members of the Small Business Committee, we hear day in and day out how access to capital continues to challenge job creation and job growth. We must continue to work in a bipartisan fashion to create an environment for small businesses to flourish and grow. One resource available to small employers is the Small Business Investment Company program, or the SBIC program, which currently runs on a zero cost subsidy to the American taxpayer. The program enhances access to capital for small business throughout the Nation by utilizing a private sector owned and SBAlicensed formula to increase equity capital. Within the SBIC program, banks and Federal savings associations are limited to the amount of capital or surplus they can invest in an SBIC. Under current statute, the limit prevents no more than a 5 percent investment. The legislation we have before us today, H.R. 2364, the Investing in Main Street Act of 2017, increases this investment threshold to 15 percent and requires any investment above the 5 percent mark to be subject to approval by the bank’s regulator. This new 15 percent marker brings parity to the program with rules by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. As the Nation’s small businesses continue to experience difficulties accessing capital, assistance like the SBIC program delivers, and has a track record to prove it. Some of the Nation’s most prominent companies have received SBIC financing in the past. The update provided in H.R. 2364 will continue and build upon the success of the program. This bill has broad bipartisan support and was favorably passed out of committee unanimously. I would urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 2364. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 2364, the Investing in Main Street Act of 2017. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, accounting for two out of every three new jobs. So as part of our commitment to creating opportunities and growing our economy, it is our responsibility to help more small businesses succeed. The SBA’s Small Business Investment Company, or SBIC, program is an effective tool that facilitates private investment into early stage startup small businesses across the country, and all at no Federal cost. Tesla, FedEx, Apple, Intel, and Costco are just a few examples of the thousands of small businesses that have successfully used the Small Business Investment Company program during their early stages of growth. One of the SBIC program’s greatest strengths is its handsoff approach, giving fund managers the autonomy to invest in almost any business sector they choose, from apparel to cuttingedge technology. This freedom, coupled with sound investment strategies, has led to its success. In fact, in 2016, the SBIC program provided $6 billion in financing to 1,200 small businesses and helped to sustain over 120,000 jobs. It has afforded America’s small businesses an invaluable opportunity to grow their innovative ideas. b1645 However, the SBIC program is currently restricted from taking more than 5 percent of capital investments from banks due to an outdated provision in the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. At the same time, current banking regulations established by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency allow these banks to invest up to 15 percent of their capital and surplus into SBICs. The Investing in Main Street Act will correct this discrepancy by allowing banks and Federal savings associations to invest up to 15 percent of their holdings to these funds to match current banking regulations. This change will strengthen and grow the SBIC program, unleashing more capital to small businesses, and all at no cost to the taxpayer. That means more entrepreneurs will be able to access the capital they need to grow their businesses and hire more workers. This legislation makes a sensible change to address the number one need of small firms: accessing capital. I would like to thank our cosponsors, Representative KNIGHT and Representative MENG, for their support, and I ask my fellow Members to support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS ), the ranking member of the committee. Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding. Mr. Speaker, small businesses are the backbone of our economy. This is particularly true in my home State of North Carolina. According to a recent report, North Carolina is the number one State in the country for starting a small business. As such, I will support programs that allow them to flourish. Today, as vice ranking member of the Small Business Committee, I rise to express my full support for H.R. 2364, the Investing in Main Street Act. The number one concern raised by small businesses is the lack of access to capital; and because of this access problem, small businesses tend to rely more on personal credit cards, often with higher interest rates, than on more affordable small business loans. The Investing in Main Street Act helps free up affordable capital, and this bill increases access to capital for small businesses by raising the percentage capital banks and savings associations may invest in small businesses up to 15 percent. With increased opportunity, entrepreneurs will be able to grow and expand their businesses as well as hire more employees, allowing them to reach their full potential. The Investing in Main Street Act is good for business, it is good for small business, and it is good for our economy. I want to thank Chairman CHABOT  and Ranking Member VELA´ZQUEZ and all of my colleagues for supporting this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill as we may continue to give small businesses opportunities to thrive and employ American workers. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, access to capital is the lifeblood of every small business. The SBIC program fills the gap between the availability of venture capital and the needs of small businesses in startup and growth situations. The SBIC program has long been an important way of channeling capital to leadingedge, highgrowth companies. In fact, some of the Nation’s most successful corporations received early stage financing from SBICs. Without it, they may not be the companies that they are today. The key to the program’s success is leveraging Federal funds to increase the amount of private capital invested in such promising startup companies. By dramatically increasing the amount of capital in the SBIC program, the changes made by H.R. 2364 will result in significant small business investment. As such, I once again urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDY CHU) and the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS ) for their leadership in introducing this and pushing this important legislation forward. Once again, it is a bipartisan piece of legislation, and we have worked together. Republicans and Democrats working together, isn’t that something? So we appreciate their hard work on this. With small businesses being the cornerstones of nearly every community in the Nation, we must continue to work together to create an environment for growth and job creation. The 29 million small businesses all across the Nation are depending on us actually working together on things like this. I know the ranking member of the committee likes to say, ‘‘There aren’t Republican small businesses; there aren’t Democratic small businesses; they are just small businesses,’’ and she is absolutely right. So I really do appreciate their working on this legislation. H.R. 2364 is commonsense legislation that enjoys bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2364, which authorizes financial institutions to invest more of their capital in small business investment funds. As it stands, federally insured banks and savings associations are limited to investing a maximum of 5 percent of their capital and surplus in Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC). Small Business Investment Companies (SBIC) are private funds, licensed and regulated by the Small Business Administration, that make investments in small businesses using their own capital or loans borrowed with an SBA guarantee. Under H.R. 2364, financial institutions would be able to invest as much as 15 percent of their capital and surplus in SBICs. There are over 8 million small businesses in America, which account for 54 percent of all U.S. sales. Small businesses also provide 55 percent of all jobs and 66 percent of all net new jobs since the 1970s. With more than half of Americans either owning or working for a small business, it is clear these companies are a vital part of our nation economy. As the representative for Houston, one of the leading cities for entrepreneurs and small businesses, I remain mindful of the significance of, and have strongly advocated for policies that will preserve and create jobs and keep our nation’s small business sector strong. When small firms are able to grow and thrive, we all benefit from their innovations, jobcreating power, and ability to make the U.S. more competitive globally. That is why I urge all members to join me in supporting H.R. 2364. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2364. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
WOUNDED OFFICERS RECOVERY ACT OF 2017 Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3298) to authorize the Capitol Police Board to make payments from the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund to employees of the United States Capitol Police who have sustained serious lineofduty injuries, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3298 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Wounded Officers Recovery Act of 2017’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRADY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. HARPER ), chairman of the House Administration Committee, whom I want to thank for allowing me the opportunity to manage this very important bill today. I couldn’t ask for a nicer, more respectful chairman. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3298, which allows United States Capitol Police officers who have sustained serious injuries in the line of duty to receive payments from the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund. The bill is just one of the ways that we, as an institution, can recognize the swift and heroic actions taken by the Capitol Police officers who put their lives on the line each and every day to protect the United States Capitol not just for the Members of Congress, but for all of the staff and all of the many visitors from across our country and around the world. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured during the June 14 shooting, including Officers David Bailey and Crystal Griner, and we wish them a speedy recovery. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, first of all and foremost, thoughts, again, and prayers are out for Representative STEVE SCALISE . I can’t wait and hope to see him walk through these doors. I wish him well and his family well. An inside joke: I hope he has his beans in his pocket. Both being from Italian ancestry, we carry our beans with us, and I hope that he has them with him now for a speedy recovery. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3298 and applaud my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ) for helping to introduce this measure. 
Officer Bailey and Officer Griner are American heroes. It has been widely reported that their swift action saved dozens of lives. Every Member of Congress owes them an enormous debt. Every day, thousands of our Capitol Police officers protect Members, staff, and visitors in this building. You see some at the doors, others working with canine dogs, but there are also many officers you do not see. These officers are analyzing intelligence, working with law enforcement, and performing many other tasks that keep this place safe. Should any of these officers be seriously injured performing their duties, this bill would provide some measure of relief and peace of mind for their families. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I do want to thank my good friend, Mr. BRADY , for being here today, managing this bill on the other side, and I also want to thank the coach of the Democrats, who won this year. I certainly liked it better when we had the trophy. But to be able to know that the thoughts and the prayers are with so many of our Capitol Police officers every single day and also, especially, the heroic actions of Agent Bailey and Agent Griner, what you and our next speaker did with this legislation makes all of us who were a part of this time very humble and thankful. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BARTON ), our manager, the sponsor of this piece of legislation today. (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, today is the 19th anniversary, if you can call it an anniversary, of a shooting in the United States Capitol in which two Capitol Police officers, Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, were killed. They were defending the Capitol, and a gunman got in and was heading towards the majority leader at the time, Tom DeLay’s office. And they, in defending that office, were shot and killed. The Speaker at the time and the Congress at the time established a Wounded Officers Fund, but they made it specific to those two fallen officers. As we all know, on June 14, we had another shooting, although it was at a baseball practice for the charity baseball game where the Republican Members were practicing out in Alexandria, Virginia. Two officers, Officers Bailey and Griner, were both seriously injured in defending the 20someodd Republican Members that were at practice that morning. What this bill does, Mr. Speaker, is simply take an existing fund that was established for two officers that were killed in the line of duty and open it up, now and in the future, for Capitol Police officers who were seriously injured in the line of duty defending the Capitol and defending the Members. I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ), the Democratic manager, for being an original sponsor with me. I want to thank every member of the Republican and Democratic baseball teams who have signed on as original sponsors. I want to thank PAUL RYAN and KEVIN MCCARTHY , STENY HOYER and NANCY PELOSI , leadership on both sides of the aisle, for making it possible to bring this bill to the floor. We introduced it last Thursday, and we are voting on it tonight; and wonder of wonders, the Senate is probably going to vote on it tomorrow, and there is a chance the President will sign it this week. b1700 We are showing the American people that we can work together for a noble cause. As has already been pointed out, Officers Bailey and Griner both, at risk to their own lives, defended the Members, staff, and volunteers at that baseball practice on June 14. I watched Officer Bailey run past me directly at the shooter, risking his life, and two other Alexandria Police officers who had arrived on the scene assisted him. Officer Griner was wounded but was providing covering fire, and that is when they brought down the shooter. They are heroes. They have sustained injuries. They deserve some assistance. The American people have donated probably $600,000 or $700,000 to provide some assistance, and this technical change in the existing fund would allow that to happen. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. DAVIS. I hope everybody can support this. Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. D OYLE ), my friend. Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friends BOBBRADY and R ODNEY DAVIS and J OEBARTON —not only good friends, but people that have been associated with the Congressional Baseball Game for a long time. Mr. Speaker, every day, thousands of people, including Members of Congress and their staffs, rely upon the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police to protect us. Over the years, the Capitol Police have been called upon to respond to a number of violent attacks, selflessly risking life and limb to protect us and the people who visit this Capitol. As was mentioned, this is the anniversary where Officers Gibson and Chestnut made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the thenleader of the House. I know that all of us here are very grateful to the U.S. Capitol Police for their efforts every day to keep our Capitol safe. Everyone pretty much knows what happened. Members of the Republican baseball team were attacked a little over a month ago. Each day we would get up at about 6 in the morning to go to baseball practice. It is a wonderful tradition that has been going on for over 100 years here in the House of Representatives, one game each year, Democrats against the Republicans, with the proceeds going to three charities: the Boys and Girls Club of Washington, D.C.; the Washington Literacy Council; and the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation. It is not a softball game; it is a hardball game. We play hardball in Washington. We get to play at the Washington Nationals’ stadium, and we get to wear our home team uniforms and relive our youth. Most of us were just amateur baseball players in Little League and PONY League. We have a few guys that played at the college level. We go out there and we practice every day and give it our all. It is great comradery. We build great friendships over the years. Every year we would get about 9,000 or 10,000 people that actually come to the Washington Nationals’ stadium and would raise about half a million dollars for the charities. Well, this year, something happened that none of us ever dreamed when we got up every morning and went to the practice, and that was a shooter showed up that day at this park in Northern Virginia and started firing on the Republican baseball team. Our team was practicing at the same time at a different location, and the first text I got on my phone during our batting practice was from one of my staff that asked me if I was okay. I couldn’t understand why he was asking me that question, but about a second later news came on our telephones that there had been a shooter at the congressional baseball practice. It wasn’t at first said which one it was. I knew it wasn’t ours, so I knew it had to be the Republican practice. When we called our players off the field, my thoughts immediately went to JOEBARTON ’s son Jack, someone whom I have become good friends with over the years. Jack is, what, JOE, 11 years old? I think I have known him since he was much younger than that. Jack will come here on the floor during the baseball week, and he will come over and he will say hello to me, and I will try to see if I can get any secrets from Jack about his dad’s strategy against the Democratic team. Jack would always say: ‘‘I can’t give you any information on that.’’ I thought about him right away as we knew that the shots were being fired and that people were down. We called our team into the dugout, and about the only thing we could think to do, JOE, was to sit down and to say a prayer that you were safe. I prayed that Jack was safe and that nobody was seriously hurt that day. As we all know, our colleague and good friend STEVE SCALISE was seriously wounded and, to this day, is still 
in the hospital. We want to send our prayers and best wishes to STEVE that he recovers fully, and that he and his family can get back to a normal course of life. But what a lot of people don’t realize, had STEVE SCALISE not been there that day, his protective detail, Officers Bailey and Griner, wouldn’t have been there that day either. Our friends on the Republican baseball team would have been pretty much defenseless against this guy with an assault rifle and an automatic pistol. But to their credit, Officers Bailey and Griner—this gentleman started over at the third baseline, and our friends were seeking cover in the first base dugout, which was recessed, to get some protection. But as the shooter started to move towards home plate, these officers realized that he was going to have an angle into that dugout, and there could have been a lot of people killed. They came out from their cover and literally charged at this shooter, and both of them were hit. They continued to fire on this gunman even after they had been hit, and with the help of some Alexandria Police officers, too, brought this shooter down. Thank God no one on the baseball team or staff—all the people on that field—lost their life that day. The shooter did, but no one else did. When you sit down and think about what it takes to make that decision to put your life at risk for someone else, Officers Griner and Bailey knew that when they came out in the open like that and started shooting at this guy that they very well could lose their life trying to make sure nobody else did. But they did their job, and they did what they were trained to do. Both of them got hurt and both are recovering from these bullet wounds, and they have outofpocket costs. Their healthcare doesn’t cover all of their expenses. They are on administrative leave. They are not making the same pay they would make as a protective detail officer. There was no means for us to help them because of the way this fund was structured, only to make payments if an officer lost their life in the line of duty. I think JOEwas correct when he said it was almost created specifically for the two officers that lost their lives. We both came to realize that there needed to be a change in the law if we were going to be able to help Officers Bailey and Griner and, in the future, if an officer was seriously wounded in the line of duty, for payments to be made out of this fund. That is the purpose of this piece of legislation that we have over 100 cosponsors for. I believe every member of the Democratic and Republican baseball teams has signed on as cosponsors. I know a lot of other Members who weren’t on the teams have also put their names to this because we want to make sure that Crystal and David know that we care about them. I can tell you, the night of the baseball game, David Bailey was at our game, and if you would have seen the Members come up and hug him and express their appreciation for what he did, it was a very emotional moment. I know Crystal threw out the first pitch at the women’s softball game. Those are two heroic people. Those are two people that put their lives secondary to the lives of the people they are sworn to protect, and I think it is only fitting and proper that this body pass this piece of legislation that will allow us the opportunity to help make them whole again and to let the rest of our Capitol Police force know that they have our backs and that we are going to make sure that we have their backs, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my good friend JOEBARTON and the entire Republican and Democratic baseball teams in supporting this piece of legislation. I hope the Senate moves swiftly on it and we can get this passed. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, the reason why we are here can’t be stated much better than what my colleague Mr. DOYLE just so eloquently delivered today. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ), one of our pitchers, one of our newest members of our congressional baseball team, and a good friend. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, the morning of June 14, 2017, I elected to not attend the Republican team’s congressional baseball practice. Had I been there, I would have been in the bullpen right where the shooting began. I thank God every day I was not there that morning. For my colleagues who were there, we have no doubt their lives were saved by the heroic response of Crystal Griner and David Bailey of the Capitol Police. In the shooting’s aftermath, we should do everything we can to ensure they have the full support of the U.S. Government and are allowed the support of groups like the USCP Memorial Fund. Mr. Speaker, in gratitude for their bravery and sacrifice for running to the battle, I encourage my colleagues to support the Wounded Officers Recovery Act. I thank them again for their heroism. Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. WALKER ), our starting pitcher. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here today. Thank you for your leadership on this, Congressman DAVIS. Currently, the United States Capitol Police are not allowed to transfer donations from the USCP Memorial Fund to officers injured in the line of duty but only to families of deceased officers. The great thing about this legislation is that it would allow the U.S. Capitol Police to transfer those donations to injured officers as well as families of deceased officers to help defray and cover some of the medical costs. As a former pastor, I can tell you that one of the biggest stressors on families is when there has been an illness or injury to these families that causes additional financial strain. This is common sense. It is certainly bipartisan, acrosstheaisle of doing the right thing. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation. Again, I thank Representative DAVIS for his leadership, as well as Representative BRADY , and I am proud to support this piece of legislation. Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK ), my good friend who was there with us that morning, somebody whom I watched act heroically and his watchful eye on the entire process, somebody who can give us his personal anecdotes. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I give a special thanks to my good friend from Illinois for his thoughtfulness in this bill. Mr. Speaker, there are times in our lifetime that leave an impact on our lives and we never forget that place or time when we experienced the event or we heard of the event. For my father, it was the attack on Pearl Harbor. He always remembered that moment and the place and the feelings he had when he heard of the attack, which motivated him to join the United States Army. For my children, it was the attacks on America on September 11, 2001. For me, Mr. Speaker, it is Flag Day, June 14, 2017, at a baseball practice. Not only will I remember that event, but I specifically remember where I was because I was there. Not only was I there, I was within proximity of 10 to 15 feet from the officers who acted so heroically. And still, Mr. Speaker, those images of that day are vivid in my mind. There isn’t a day that goes by—and I am sure it is the same thing for the other players—that I don’t relive a portion of that moment. b1715 But although those images are vivid, time heals all wounds, and at some point the details will be obscured by the fog of war and other events in our lives. But I will never forget the heroic actions of those two officers that day. Even at the moment when Agent Griner took a bullet—which I believe was destined for me, or definitely in my direction—which took her down and out of the fight, Agent Bailey came to check on his partner, and immediately put himself even more in the line of fire to draw the fire away from us. I can’t express how heroic these officers acted. Some may say, well, that is 
their duty, but what I experienced, Mr. Speaker, was above and beyond any call of duty, setting aside their own safety, their own persons, and putting themselves in a situation where death may have been imminent. They were in a gunfight with someone with a more powerful, more accurate rifle, and all they had was a handgun. But they never let that dissuade them from protecting the lives of those of us. I would not be here today if it wasn’t for those two agents. This is the least that we could do, as has been expressed by many other speakers. The cost upon the families is tremendous when someone is injured in the line of duty. I believe that this is all fitting, and it is an expression of our appreciation for what they do for us day in and day out. I hope and I pray that we never have an incident like that again, but as history tells us, something like this will happen again. And I just hope that we have agents like Agents Griner and Bailey on duty when that happens again. There were many miracles on the field that day, and one of those miracles was having the two right agents there doing their job, just like all of our Capitol Police do every day. I support this bill. I support the intent behind it, and I hope that we move forward with this in an expeditious manner and that we have a unanimous vote on this. Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My dad was a police officer, and I know what it is like when you get that phone call in the middle of the night, when he would call our house, and we would jump out of bed, even though he was just calling to find out whether I was home or not. But I know the hardship it can put on families. On 9/11, when we were in our office buildings, and we were told to run and get out of our office buildings, our police officers were running in. Two days later, on this same floor, when there was a bomb scare and everybody cleared out, we were getting briefed, and we were clearing out running down those steps, our police officers—men and women—and first responders and firefighters were running in. We need to let them know every day, not just today. This is a great thing we are doing here today for them. We need to let them know every day just how much we appreciate what they do. When we come to work here, we are protected. We have dogs sniff our cars, and we go through metal detectors. Everybody goes through metal detectors. The Capitol Police come to work and leave their house every day with a vest, after they give their loved ones a kiss goodbye, the loved ones not knowing whether they are going to see them again. So make no mistake about it, we need to let them know every single day how much we appreciate them and tell them please to stay safe. Officer Bailey and Officer Griner saved many injuries and possibly many lives. We need to thank Officer Griner and Officer Bailey, and may God bless both of them. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my colleagues, Mr. BRADY  and Mr. DOYLE , for the opportunity to come here today on this floor and show America the bipartisanship that we see and we witness on this floor every single day—not just because of a baseball game—to do what is right. Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank my colleague, JOEBARTON , for leading this effort—not only leading us as a manager of our baseball team, leading us as somebody who brings their son, their 11yearold son to practice to have fun playing with a bunch of old guys who really shouldn’t be playing baseball as much as we enjoy doing it, but to be able to do it, to raise money for local D.C. charities. JOE, Jack, Barry, I, and the rest of us who were there that morning, none of us ever thought that, at approximately 7:09, we would hear the words: Run, he has got a gun. And it was mentioned by Mr. DOYLE about those of us who dove in that dugout. Let me tell you something, Mr. Speaker. I think I could have beaten Usain Bolt from home plate where I was standing to that dugout that day. I dove in that dugout not knowing where the shooter was, what the shooter’s motives were, and what was next. As I was working my way outside of that dugout, I saw Agent Bailey come onto that field in the line of fire to protect every single one of us who were there that day, and it wasn’t just Members of Congress. It wasn’t just people who this shooter may have politically disagreed with that morning that were there that day. It was an 11yearold boy like Jack Barton. There were innocent people walking in that park, walking their dogs, in the line of fire that morning because this person may have disagreed with what we do on this floor. For those people who are watching today, understand, again, what we are doing here, which is what is right to help those heroes, Agent Bailey and Agent Griner, get access to the funds that all of America put forth on their behalf in less than 24 hours after that tragic shooting. Let us all remind them that we do get along; we do work together. It is not just when tragic moments like this happen. It is a lot more often than what you see. In less than 24 hours after that shooting, the American people stepped up, and they did what Americans do in the wake of tragedies every single time we witness them. We had already raised a record amount of money for local D.C. charities with this year’s game, $600,000, $100,000 more than what was normal. And they sold, again, 10,000 seats. In less than 24 hours, the American people from all over this great Nation raised another $900,000 to go to local D.C. charities and to the Capitol Police Memorial Fund, which was added the last day. They also sold 25,000 tickets. I think that game that night, we outsold like three major league games in attendance. We obviously didn’t play as well as they did, but we outsold them. And that shows you what America is all about. It shows you what Republicans and Democrats are all about. It shows you that in the wake of a senseless tragedy, where we watched our friend lay on that field, not knowing what the outcome was going to be for STEVE SCALISE and his family, Matt Mika, Zack Barth, Agent Griner, and Agent Bailey, that those two saved the lives of everyone on that field that day. Charging at gunfire is not something I ever thought I would do, and I didn’t do that day. But thank God they were there, and they did. And those Alexandria police officers, the police officers I never saw arrive at that scene, thank God they were there. Because it is the heroic actions of all of those officers, especially those two who I joked with when I walked onto this House floor when I would see them here, not knowing that we would have ever been a part of something that will bind us all together, a tragedy that happens one morning in Alexandria, Virginia, while a bunch of old guys are playing baseball. We will forever be bound by what we saw and what we witnessed that day. There is not an hour in the day that goes by in my life that I don’t think about what happened on that field that morning. The smells, the sounds, the fear that all of us experienced that day could have been, as every speaker said before, much worse without the heroes who ran toward gunfire, sacrificing themselves for every one of us, and every innocent person in that park, in that field that day. This is why we have got to make this technical change, Mr. Speaker. We are here. We are lawmakers. We write the laws. We can change the laws. And when this fund was set up, because of the tragedy that many still in D.C. witnessed that day with Officer Gibson and Officer Chestnut who were gunned down protecting innocent Americans in this building, this fund was set up to honor them, not knowing that years later—and today is the anniversary of that shooting—we would need to modify this bill to help two more of our heroes who were lucky and blessed enough to survive. Today we are going to do that because of the leadership of Mr. BARTON  and Mr. DOYLE . Let me go back to that day in 1998. I was actually a new staffer for a new Member of Congress named JOHNSHIMKUS . I was sitting in the district office in Springfield, Illinois, 
when I heard the news that shootings were happening in the U.S. Capitol— the fear as a staffer that went through me, wondering where my friend and my boss were. But I got to see it from out there. I never thought years later I would get to witness it as a Member of Congress. And witness it, we all did, but also we learned from it, and we learned what America was all about. And today is our day in the U.S. Congress to stand up for those heroes who protected us that day and say: We are going to help you. I, and my family, my kids, my wife, every family member who I was able to reach out to that morning, and all of those who I wasn’t able to talk to, we cannot say thank you enough to Agent Griner, Agent Bailey, and the Alexandria Police Department for making sure we have the ability to make this fix. I urge every one of my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. Let’s send a message back to America that we thank them for what they did for our officers, and we thank them for allowing all of us the privilege to serve in this great institution. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LANCE ). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3298, as amended The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3180) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for intelligence and intelligencerelated activities of the United States Government, the Community Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3180 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
There is authorized to be appropriated for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund for fiscal year 2018 the sum of $514,000,000. 
The authorization of appropriations by this Act shall not be deemed to constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity which is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or the laws of the United States. 
Appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for Federal employees may be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law. 
TITLE IV—MATTERS RELATING TO ELEMENTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY Subtitle A—Office of the Director of National Intelligence 
Section 5313 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security.’’. Subtitle B—Other Elements 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. NUNES ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. SCHIFF ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. NUNES ). 
Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 3180. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. b1730 Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, passing an annual intelligence authorization bill is the most important tool Congress has to conduct effective oversight of the intelligence activities of the U.S. Government. The Intelligence Committee has brought a bill to the floor every year since fiscal year 2010. Once again, the bill is a bipartisan product that reflects contributions from all committee members. It was reported out of committee by a unanimous voice vote. Because most of the intelligence budget involves highly classified programs, the bulk of the Committee’s schedule of authorizations and direction are found in the classified annex to the bill. This classified annex has been made available to Members since markup in the House Intelligence Committee spaces. At the unclassified level, I can report that the overall funding authorized by this bill is slightly below the President’s budget request. Furthermore, the bill funds the Military Intelligence Program in line with the levels of the Housepassed National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. The bill implements the first stage of a committee initiative to streamline and optimize defense intelligence beginning with the Defense Intelligence Agency; provides guidelines to guarantee that intelligence community contractors can meet with Congress unhindered; and enhances oversight of intelligence activities by mandating intelligence community reports on threats to Federal elections, leaks of classified information, security clearance processing, and other vital activities. Mr. Speaker, America faces an international threat matrix more complicated than anything we have endured in the past. The recent, impressive progress made by the U.S. military and its allies against ISIS in Iraq and Syria has not ended the ISIS terror threat. In fact, based on the group’s ability to inspire terror attacks through social media and other means, ISIS could remain a significant threat to the West even after it loses all the territory it controls. Additionally, al Qaida remains active in Afghanistan and has retained its close links to the resurgent Taliban. Meanwhile, other threats from belligerent regimes like Iran and North Korea continue to intensify, while instability in failed states like Libya presents pressing security challenges to the U.S. and our European allies, including through the facilitation of waves of mass migration that provide cover for the movement of jihadists to the West. This bill will ensure that the dedicated men and women of our intelligence community have the funding, authorities, and support they need to carry out their mission and to keep us safe, while providing Congress with the tools it needs to provide robust oversight over their actions. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY , Washington, DC, July 24, 2017. Hon. DEVIN NUNES , Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN NUNES : I am writing to you concerning the jurisdictional interest of the Committee on Homeland Security in H.R. 3180, the ‘‘Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.’’ The bill includes provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security. I recognize and appreciate the desire to bring this legislation before the House of Representatives in an expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on Homeland Security will forego seeking a sequential referral on this bill. However, this is conditional based on our mutual understanding that foregoing action on H.R. 3180 at this time does not prejudice this Committee with respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation. This waiver is also given with the understanding that the Committee on Homeland Security expressly reserves its authority to seek conferees on any provision within its jurisdiction during any HouseSenate conference that may be convened on this or any similar legislation, and requests your support for such a request. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 3180, and ask that a copy of this letter and your response be included in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. Sincerely, MICHAEL T. M CCAUL, Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE , Washington, DC, July 24, 2017. Hon. MICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN MCCAUL: I received your letter regarding H.R. 3180, the ‘‘Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.’’ You have asserted that Section 502 of the Act falls within your jurisdiction because it requests that the Director of National Intelligence coordinate with the National Intelligence Program (NIP) funded Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis (DHS I&A) to produce a publicly available advisory report on foreign counterintelligence and cyber threats. Consistent with our January 11, 2017 exchange of letters, HPSCI has exclusive jurisdiction over NIP funded DHS I&A intelligence activities. However, I acknowledge that your letter in no way diminishes or alters the jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security with respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matter contained in the bill or any similar legislation. I will include a copy of your letter and this response in the Congressional Record during consideration of the legislation on the House Floor. Thank you for your assistance with this matter. Sincerely, DEVIN NUNES , Chairman. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to taking up the Intelligence Authorization Act on suspension at a time when issues concerning the intelligence community have taken on an even greater significance and urgency, and taking up the bill this way will deprive Members of the opportunity to offer important amendments. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 is a good and bipartisan bill, but even a good bill can be made better. And although we have taken up the IAA on suspension on occasion in the past, it has only been on the basis of mutual agreement, which is not the case this year. On its merits, I believe the IAA should and will become law, and I look 
forward to its ultimate approval by both the House and Senate, and enactment. Nevertheless, I share Leader PELOSI  and Whip HOYER ’s view that tonight’s suspension vote should be opposed. This IAA should go through regular order so that Members may offer amendments. I will vote ‘‘no’’ today because I disagree with the expedited procedure used to bring this to the floor. The Intelligence Committee has a unique role in this House and a special obligation to the American people. It is our job to oversee the activities of the 17 agencies that comprise the intelligence community, ensuring that we strike an appropriate balance between protecting our country’s national security and the civil liberties of everyone who calls America home. On behalf of the House—by and through our oversight tools, including the IAA—our committee helps ensure that the activities of the U.S. intelligence community do the following: that they adhere to the Constitution and to the law; that they advance the national security interests of the United States; that they wisely expend taxpayer dollars; and that they steadfastly protect Americans’ civil liberties and privacy rights. The legislation before us today, like its predecessors, continues to fund, equip, and give policy direction to the intelligence community and military intelligence elements of the Department of Defense. It provides funding levels slightly below the President’s 2018 budget request and sustains intelligence priorities provided for in previous authorizations. In addition to the unclassified legislative text and accompanying House report, the IAA includes a classified annex, which directs the resources and spending for the IC’s activities and programs. This includes a correlating schedule of authorizations that lays out funding for the IC and the DOD. This year’s IAA, once again, incorporates a number of Democratic Member oversight priorities: it improves our efforts to stamp out waste, fraud, and abuse by requiring an Inspector Generallevel review of existing whistleblower procedures and by permitting IC contractors to come directly to Congress without requiring permission from the IC elements that employ them. A provision accompanying the report mandates that the ODNI notify and provide justification to Congress if the executive branch alters the existing Presidential Policy Guidance, or PPG, relating to U.S. counterterrorism actions located outside of designated areas of active hostilities. The PPG, first promulgated under the previous administration, is an important element of U.S. policymaking that seeks to ensure direct action against lawful terrorist targets is undertaken only when necessary and consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. This is the result of rigorous legal and policy deliberation and coordination within the U.S. Government. Reporting to Congress on any changes to it ensures proper oversight. The bill also furthers our committee’s belief that the future of the IC workforce depends on diversity; as such, this year’s IAA enhances the ODNI’s Centers of Academic Excellence program. Finally, this bill reflects a cleareyed assessment of the threat we face from a resurgent Russia determined to undermine our democratic institutions and our faith in the American political process. As the intelligence community has determined, Moscow initiated as early as mid2015 an active measures campaign to assault our 2016 election. The Kremlin’s influence campaign consisted of cyber espionage, hacking and weaponizing stolen documents, and a propaganda machine that was used to great effect to amplify every element of their appalling campaign, and perhaps more. This year’s IAA acts on that unanimous IC judgment by directing assessments on Moscow’s influence campaigns against foreign elections and the threat posed by Russian finance activities globally. It also requires ODNI to publish a report on the foreign cybersecurity and counterintelligence threats to future U.S. Federal election campaigns. As with any product of a goodfaith attempt at compromise, I do not pretend this bill is perfect. There are provisions I wish were modified, and some provisions that I would have liked to have seen included. Many of my colleagues feel the same way, and they should have been permitted to offer amendments, something I hope they will be permitted to do by voting ‘‘no’’ on this bill under suspension. For example, we wish this bill had done more to codify in law some of the previous administration’s counterterrorism reforms, including giving the status of law to an executive order requiring the Director of National Intelligence to continue the practice of releasing publicly available data on the total number of combatants and noncombatants killed or injured due to counterterrorism action. I look forward to the fiscal year ’18 Intelligence Authorization Act being enacted into law—not through the vehicle of the suspension calendar, but through consideration under regular order. For that reason, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote here so that all Members will have a chance to be heard. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL ), who is one of our superb members of the committee and also one of our ranking members. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak on the passage of the fiscal year 2018 Intelligence Authorization Act under suspension of the rules. Unfortunately, I strongly oppose its passage today, not because it is a bad bill. On the contrary, I voted for it out of committee. But today I disagree on how this bill is presented on the floor. The Intelligence Authorization Act should be on regular order and rule and not on suspension. This critically important piece of legislation is the most substantial oversight mechanism that Congress has over the intelligence community, and it deserves full consideration and robust debate. The American public and our intelligence community deserve nothing less. Before authorizing tens of billions of dollars for the United States intelligence community, our lawmakers should carefully consider and debate the issues our intelligence community faces, many of which directly impact our national security. Instead, today’s consideration of the IAA has been fast tracked, and debate has been cut short. Most of the work of the intelligence community and our committee happens behind closed doors, which means that debate on the House floor over the Intelligence Authorization Act is one of the few times the public can engage with the issues facing our intelligence community. By limiting debate on this bill, we cut public engagement off as well. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the bipartisan way in which our committee worked to craft this year’s Intelligence Authorization Act. I am excited that this year’s IAA includes a provision that I drafted that provides our lawmakers, election officials, campaigns, and the public with additional information and resources to defend our democracy against emerging cyber threats. Additionally, we will continue to be able to provide a summer internship program to students from the existing Centers of Academic Excellence in intelligence. This year’s IAA will also hold the IC accountable for creating a more diverse and inclusive working environment. Nevertheless, I will oppose today’s bill not because I don’t support the underlying bill, but because I believe that national security issues raised by this legislation are too important to be fasttracked. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose today’s vote under suspension of the rules and to stand with us in demanding full debate and consideration under regular order. Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time to close. Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. The Intelligence Authorization Act is a critical oversight tool, one component of the legal architecture that governs the authorities and boundaries of our civilian and military intelligence professionals. The bipartisan legislation before us today is sound, and I endorse its substance on the merits. But I agree with our leadership that the suspension process is not the appropriate venue for its adoption. 
For this reason, I will vote ‘‘no’’ on the measure tonight, but I remain optimistic about this legislation’s ultimate passage into law after we complete its consideration under regular order. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, first, I thank Mr. Phil Tubesing, who has been a congressional fellow with our committee for the last 2 years. This will be his last bill. He will be leaving us at the end of the month, so I wanted to recognize him for all his fine work on the bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. This is typically how the bill has come to the floor from the Intelligence Committee. As nearly all the Members know, for the last several years that is how it has occurred. Unfortunately, we are beginning to deteriorate into political theater at the Intelligence Committee. As long as I am chairman, I am going to continue to try to stop that from happening. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I am proud of the bipartisanship that allowed us to put this bill together. Our committee, which normally operates quietly, has gotten more attention than normal this year as we conduct the critical business of investigating Russian intervention in our elections. But we still do our day job—overseeing intelligence programs and providing support to the men and women of our intelligence community who fight to keep our country safe. This bill is the culmination of this cooperation. Our country is facing a wide array of pervasive and complex threats. Our nearpeer adversaries, Russia and China, are rapidly growing their military capabilities and regularly, unashamedly violating international law. A nuclear weapons stockpile and functioning ICBM program now sit in the hands of an unpredictable North Korean dictator. And the socalled caliphate started by ISIS is losing ground, only to increase homegrown attacks against the United States and its allies. My constituents, like all Americans, are rightly concerned. But they can feel confident that we are working with the intelligence community on ways to address them. As the Ranking Member of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee, I am particularly interested in supporting our intelligence professionals who assess and prevent terrorist threats to our homeland—while protecting the civil rights and liberties of innocent Americans. I’m working to ensure they use their expertise, as well as that in the private sector, to find and remove online propaganda used to recruit wouldbe attackers. I’m also proud to include language that will enable the IC and private sector to temporarily exchange IT talent in order to better tackle some of the toughest cybersecurity challenges. Mr. Speaker, Chairman N UNES and Ranking Member SCHIFF have led this process with bipartisan professionalism. This bill is stronger because it reflects the input of all of our members. The full House should have this same opportunity—not be forced to vote up or down under suspension. Republican leadership owes it to our members to return to regular order so our bill can benefit from the input of the full House. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee and vigilant defender of our national security, I rise in support of H.R. 3180, the ‘‘Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018,’’ which will provide the Intelligence Community (IC) with the necessary resources and authorities to ensure they remain capable of protecting and defending the United States. This bill authorizes appropriations for Fiscal Year 2018 for vital intelligence activities of the U.S. government, the Community Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes. H.R. 3180 comes at a critical time in the status of our national security and the IC’s ability to protect it. As we continue to face a diverse and growing array of threats from terrorist groups, hostile nation states, and questionable or incompetent figures in the Trump administration, it is crucial that the IC receive all the resources it needs to do its job while Congress has the necessary tools to carry out rigorous oversight of its work. This bill seeks to meet these challenges by supporting critical national security programs, particularly those focused on countering terrorism and cyberattacks. Under H.R. 3180, the Director of National Intelligence will be required to electronically publish an unclassified advisory report on foreign counterintelligence and cybersecurity threats to federal elections. It also bolsters intelligence oversight by ensuring that IC contractors can meet freely with Congress. Lastly, this bill improves IC accountability to Congress by requiring the IC to provide reports on: Investigations of leaks of classified information; Security clearance processing timelines; The process for reviewing information about computer vulnerabilities for retention or potential release; And Russian influence campaigns directed at foreign elections and threat finance activities. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3180 is a necessary response to the overwhelming evidence pointing to a carefully planned and executed infiltration of our 2016 Presidential Election by the Russian government and its operatives. The issue of cybersecurity, particularly with regards to our federal election computer system infrastructure, has been of great concern to me and the American public as more and more reports of Russian hacking efforts have come to light. In addition, the provision requiring reports on security clearance processing timelines should shed light on the highly dubious and inscrutable security clearances of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Donald Trump’s blatant and irresponsible nepotism towards his daughter and soninlaw have made us all vulnerable to Russian and other foreign influence at the highest levels of our federal government. H.R. 3180 will give the American people what they crave and deserve: clarity and transparency to pierce through the haze of coverups and distractions surrounding the Trump Administration. This bill also takes significant, muchneeded steps to improve benefits for members of the IC, such as increasing employee compensation and authorizing $514 million in appropriations for the CIA’s Retirement and Disability System. Congress must do its part to adequately recompense the patriotic Americans who serve our nation through their work in the IC, especially employees with disabilities, who make up 9 percent of the intelligence workforce. At the same lime, we must continue to ensure that Congress can exercise oversight over and maintain transparency for the 17 agencies that comprise the IC. I am heartened that my Republican colleagues in the Intelligence Committee are starting to see the light in recognizing the sinister threat of Russian infiltration and White House collusion, both of which endanger our nation’s ability to practice and protect its core democratic values. I look forward to working with all Members of Congress to strengthen our IC, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. NUNES ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3180, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
b1830 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. CARTER of Georgia) at 6 o’clock and 30 minutes p.m.

REQUESTING THE SENATE TO RETURN TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 76 Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 469 Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives request the Senate to return to the House the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 76) entitled ‘‘Granting the consent and approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to a enter into a compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission.’’ 
The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the 27th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which was signed into law on July 26, 1990. This landmark, bipartisan civil rights legislation enables people with disabilities, including me, to experience more inclusive and fulfilling lives. The prohibition of discrimination on the basis of a disability has helped to promote equal opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic selfsufficiency. Mr. Speaker, it is true that we have made incredible progress since 1990, but we still have work ahead. Too many people with disabilities still lack access to affordable housing, public transportation, education, healthcare, and employment. Full access and inclusion remains a fundamental aspiration, but it is not yet a reality. Mr. Speaker, we must remain vigilant in defending the intent of the ADA so that future generations can live in an inclusive, accessible world, where the unique talents and abilities of individuals with disabilities are innately recognized. f 
REMEMBERING KATE FRONEK (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Kate Fronek, an extraordinary 13yearold from Eden Prairie who just passed away this last week. Kate was an active girl who played hockey, lacrosse, and soccer throughout our Eden Prairie community. She attended Central Middle School, and people often noted her love for music. This past February, Kate was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. In the following months, she underwent multiple rounds of chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant. Amid these challenges, Kate was brave and spirited, and friends and family remember her positively and, above all, her warm smile. But over the weekend, in memory of Kate, neighbors and friends began putting orange balloons outside their homes, on the streets, and the bridges as a part of a tribute. Driving around Eden Prairie and seeing the streets lined with these balloons to honor her memory shows that she clearly touched very many lives. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to extend my thoughts and prayers to the Fronek family. She will be missed, but her spirit will not be forgotten. 
PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, last week, The Washington Post reported that President Trump was considering pardoning his aides, his relatives, and even himself. Any of these actions would disrupt the investigation of Special Counsel Mueller. Beyond simply pardoning those convicted of crimes, the President has the power to grant a pardon before charges are even brought, as President Ford’s pardon of President Nixon demonstrated. There is no requirement that Presidential pardons be publicly announced, meaning that President Trump could grant pardons in secret to prevent his associates from cooperating with the special counsel. That is why I am introducing the ‘‘Presidential Pardon 
Transparency Act.’’ The President may have the power to pardon, but the American people have a right to know how and when he does it. This bill requires the White House to publicly disclose every pardon the President grants. Our Founders established the Presidential power to pardon to protect the American people from their government, not for the President to protect himself. This bill upholds that principle. 
REMEMBERING ROY HERRINGTON (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, recently, the Appling County community mourned the loss of lifelong resident Roy Herrington. He was a loving husband to his wife of 59 years, Georgia, and a dedicated father to his three children: Tami, Jeff, and Julie. Roy was an active member of the community. He was a member and a deacon at the Baxley First Baptist Church; a past director of Appling County Chamber of Commerce; and a recipient of the Chamber Award of Excellence in Agriculture. Roy was awarded the Appling County Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year award in 1981. During my time traveling the 12th District of Georgia, Roy was one of those people who I would always make sure to visit to gain insight on serving the great folks of the 12th District. Mr. Speaker, we are losing our greatest generation, but as Members of Congress and as Americans, we must not forget the lessons they have taught us. Every village, every community, has a man of peace and influence. In Appling County, that man was Roy Herrington. Baxley, Georgia, is a better place because of Roy Herrington. He will be remembered often. 
SUPPORTING NATIONAL HOUSING WEEK OF ACTION (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor today in support of National Housing Week of Action and to stand up for a better deal for hardworking Americans. Access to affordable housing directly impacts the ability of Americans to have a better job, better wages, and a better future. However, far too many families are struggling to keep a roof over their heads as the cost of rent is rising, mortgages are harder to get, and wages remain stagnant. Due to cuts in Federal rental assistance, only one in four people eligible for it actually are receiving it. Our constituents deserve a better deal. I join Democrats in standing up to create millions of goodpaying jobs, full time jobs by investing in our crumbling infrastructure, and offering apprenticeship programs to new workers. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to fight for affordable housing programs so all Americans can have the ability to achieve the American Dream. f 
REMEMBERING HEROES JACOB CHESTNUT AND JOHN GIBSON (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, every day on Capitol Hill, we have heroes among us, our Capitol Police. Five weeks ago, three of these heroes saved lives. They killed a deranged man who opened fire on the Republican baseball team. Two heroes were wounded, Crystal Griner and David Bailey. Our brave Capitol Police prevented a massacre. Another massacre was prevented by the Capitol Police on June 24 of 1998, 19 years ago today. My hometown of Sugar Land, Texas, still hurts over a hero we knew well, Detective John Gibson. He was killed a few feet from where I am standing. Like Crystal and David, Detective Gibson was assigned to protect a member of House leadership, my neighbor, and my predecessor, Majority Leader Tom DeLay. Gibson heard Officer Jacob Chestnut being killed by an intruder. He shot the attacker, despite being mortally wounded. Our Capitol Police are true heroes. May we always remember two special heroes, Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson. 
NO APPROPRIATIONS FOR BORDER WALL (Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the House appropriations package that will provide $1.6 billion for the construction of President Trump’s border wall. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have heard from many military leaders who all agree, a wall won’t make our borders more secure or our Nation safer. There are more effective ways and technology that would be a better investment of our limited resources. Moreover, the President has failed to provide a cost for this wall, and it would be irresponsible for Congress to write him a blank check, especially after he promised over and over that the American taxpayers would not foot the bill. This wall only serves as a symbol of xenophobia and hate, while doing nothing to address our broken immigration system. Immigrants strengthen the fabric of our Nation, they serve in our military, they teach in our schools, and some, like myself, are fortunate enough to serve as Members of Congress. b1930 SNAP UPDATE AFTER PATHWAYS HEARING (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last week the Nutrition Subcommittee hosted a hearing on how eligible SNAP participants can improve their education and labor force involvement as they aim for independence. Over the past 21⁄2years, the House Agriculture Committee has done a comprehensive review of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. We have looked at how it is administered and how it can be improved. We have also looked at how we can help Americans climb the ladder of opportunity and get out of poverty. The subcommittee hearing looked at ways to sync employers with workcapable SNAP participants whose education, skill set, and backgrounds match their needs. This comprehensive approach brings together resources, funding, data, policies, partnerships, and, perhaps most importantly, shared performance measures that continue to allow the development, scaling, and sustainability of these pathway programs. Stable employment that provides a living wage is essential to helping individuals and families rise out of poverty. As chairman of the subcommittee, I am committed to exploring ways to couple services with employment and education to empower workcapable recipients and help them achieve selfreliance. 
FIRST, DO NO HARM (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, over this weekend, I heard nonstop from people—people from all walks of life—who are living each day in fear that this Congress is going to strip them of the healthcare insurance they so desperately need, causing them to lose access to affordable care. These good, decent, and hardworking people have told me again and again, in no uncertain terms, that they or someone whom they love dearly will suffer or die if our Republican colleagues carry out their catastrophically ill conceived plan to repeal and replace or repeal and delay. They scoff at the oft repeated Republican plan that they would merely be choosing not to have coverage, for they know the bitter truth. To strip these people of the very coverage that keeps them, their children, and their parents alive would be as immoral an act as was ever perpetrated under the guise of governance. When it comes to setting healthcare policy, this Congress, like every decent 
doctor since the days of Hippocrates, should be guided by that eternal principle: First, do no harm. 
RECOGNIZING F.X. MATT BREWING COMPANY OF UTICA, NEW YORK (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize F.X. Matt Brewing Company, located in Utica, New York. Founded in 1888, Matt’s Brewery is the fourth oldest familyowned brewery in the United States. An awardwinning brewery, F.X. Matt Brewing Company is famous for their pale ale lager, Utica Club, the first beer licensed for sale after Prohibition, in addition to international taste test winner Saranac beer and soda lines. F.X. Matt Brewing Company is currently among the 15 largest beer producers in the Nation, and the Matt family continues to develop new recipes each year. Matt’s Brewery has played an important role in our local community by hosting Saranac Thursdays, a weekly summer concert series, where a portion of the proceeds are donated to the United Way of Utica. Matt’s Brewery also hosts the postrace celebration for the world famous Utica Boilermaker 15K road race. I am grateful to Fred Matt, Nick Matt, and everyone at the brewery for their hard work, ingenuity, and dedication to our community as they continue this historic family business. I encourage my colleagues to stop by my office to try some of their great products. On a personal note, as a lifelong friend of the Matt family, I will always be grateful to Lillian ‘‘Duffy’’ Matt, affectionately known as Duff, who taught me how to ride a bicycle. 
SUPPORTING THE FULBRIGHT PROGRAM (Mr. RASKIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Fulbright Program, which more than 370,000 people from the United States and over 180 countries have participated in since its founding in 1946. For 70 years, the Fulbright Program has promoted strong relationships between Americans and other people and stimulated international education and progress. Some 57 Fulbright Fellows have received Nobel Prizes; 82 have received the Pulitzer Prize; 33 have gone on to serve as head of state; and 10 have been elected to the U.S. Congress. All over the world, more than 370,000 Fulbright alumni are making waves in science, medicine, public service, art, business, philanthropy, and education. Mr. Speaker, President Trump now proposes a staggering 55 percent cut to the Fulbright Scholar Program. This would devastate a successful and flourishing project. Our country benefits enormously from Fulbright Fellows past, present, and future, and I urge all of my colleagues to continue supporting this excellent program on a full basis. f 
SECRETARY PRUITT WELCOMED TO SOUTH CAROLINA (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this morning at Cameron, South Carolina, I was grateful to join EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM , Attorney General Alan Wilson, and Commissioner of Agriculture Hugh Weathers to discuss the waters of the United States rule published by the prior administration. This harmful rule geometrically expanded intrusion of the Federal Government, imposing greater Federal overreach, dictating the definition of waterways, and destroying jobs of original conservationists who promote a clean environment. I appreciate Administrator Scott Pruitt who facilitated the roundtable to learn directly from local agricultural community leaders about the harmful consequences of the rule. The men and women of the roundtable, hosted by Jim and Karen Roquemore, clearly explained the real impact overreaching regulations have on environmentally positive development for jobs. I am grateful that President Donald Trump and Administrator Pruitt have committed to review the rule and, most importantly, considered the input from grassroots organizations about the negative impact. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. I appreciate Rusty Shannon of Sandy Run, South Carolina, for alerting me to the destructive consequences of the rule. 
MEDICAID (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, within hours, the Senate will begin a sinister unraveling of the safety net for millions of Americans—$774 billion cut from Medicaid—and they will throw on the ground some $200 billion that is just a bait to be able to bring votes in. It was sad to see the administration speak today about having people lose their lives because, without healthcare, they will. I ask the Senate to vote ‘‘no.’’ Kill this bill. It would be important if the President would also have an agenda—6 months and he has no jobs bill, no insurance, and no infrastructure bill. I hope also to restore constitutional integrity, and I expect to introduce legislation dealing with preventing the President from firing the special counsel and from abusing the pardon power to pardon people who are under investigation. I ask that we work together, and that is to save lives. Vote ‘‘no’’ on that Senate bill. f 
HONORING EUGENE WING OF FAIRFIELD, MAINE (Mr. POLIQUIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, throughout America’s 241year history, millions of brave men and women have fought for our freedom, and we are grateful for their service. Sometimes, Mr. Speaker, we find an American hero who worked behind the scenes to keep us free. Eugene Wing of Fairfield, Maine, in central Maine, is one of these heroes. Gene was a gifted student who graduated from Bowdoin College in 1905 and then studied economics at Oxford University in England. He was then hired, Mr. Speaker, by The International Banking Corporation and sent to the Philippines, where he became an expert on the trade of natural resources in the Far East. At the start, Mr. Speaker, of World War I and, later, World War II, the Army Intelligence Service asked Gene to help defeat the enemy and save the world. Mr. Wing took extraordinary risks to locate and help control the flow of coal, oil, gold, silver, and iron ore which were desperately needed by the enemy’s war machine. His daring spirit and extraordinary knowledge of these raw materials gave America and our Allies the upper hand to win both World Wars. Mr. Wing’s unusual skill made him a target of our enemies, and he was eventually captured and put to death. Mr. Speaker, Eugene Wing from Fairfield, Maine, is a true American hero. Millions of people around the world who live in freedom today are the beneficiaries of his sacrifice, his bravery, and his patriotism. We are grateful for Mr. Wing, and we will never forget. 
REMEMBERING JIM VANCE (Ms. NORTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, Jim Vance, our local NBC news anchor in this region, who died Saturday at 75, probably set a record, local or national, as news anchor. For 45 years, while being only himself, Vance presented the news to a region that challenged D.C. TV news with vast changes racially and ethnically, economically and politically. Jim Vance took the dare and told our everchanging story straight. 
He made us see ourselves, from a city with too much crime to today’s D.C. with low crime and a big surplus. Only a combination of consummate professionalism and enduring affability could have covered so much quickmoving news without ever missing a beat. Jim Vance brilliantly told our story throughout our first era of home rule. These years also encapsulated Jim Vance’s service and now join his legacy with the District’s own history. 
SUPPORTING CARE CORPS (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support the Care Corps Demonstration Act. As a caregiver myself, I know how tough a job it is and how critical it is that we support family caregivers and the paid direct care workforce. But as our population continues to age, our country faces a critical shortage of caregivers. In 2010, there were seven potential caregivers for every person over the age of 80; by 2030, that ratio is projected to drop by almost half, to about 4 to 1. At the same time, our economy continues to feel the effect of the Great Recession, and many young people are unemployed or underemployed. That is why I am introducing this bipartisan bill which creates a grant program that would place Care Corps volunteers in communities across the country to provide services that help seniors and individuals with disabilities remain independent. The program would help meet the need for more caregivers and provide opportunity in a growing career field by offering benefits and educational assistance to the volunteers. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to quickly pass this important bill. 
NO BORDER WALL (Mr. O’ROURKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand against a proposal that we will vote on later this week to spend more than $1.6 billion to build a wall that we don’t need at our border with Mexico. We have never had lower apprehensions coming from Mexico in my lifetime. We had 105 apprehensions per Border Patrol agent 10 years ago; last year, it was 25. The border has never been safer. We have never spent more money—$19.5 billion a year—and instead of putting this $1.6 billion toward jobs or healthcare or reducing student loan debt, we are trying to solve a problem that we don’t have in this country. We need to instead look to the example of El Paso, Texas, one of the safest cities in the United States. It is the safest not in spite of its connection with Mexico, not in spite of the fact that so many people whom I represent in that community were born in another country—most of them Mexico— but because of those things. When we treat each other with respect, dignity, and compassion, we also create security, safety, and success. Mr. Speaker, that is the example that we should be following, not a $1.6 billion investment in a wall that we don’t need. f 
b1945 FAILURE TO GOVERN: THE FIRST 6 MONTHS UNDER REPUBLICAN CONTROL The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands? There was no objection. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to anchor the CBC Special Order hour. For the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the American people on issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus, Congress, the constituents we represent, and all Americans. Led by our chair, CEDRIC RICHMOND  from Louisiana, it is our duty, we feel, as the conscience of the Congress, to speak to all people in this hour on the issues that we deem are important and that our constituents have told us are important. For this Special Order hour, we will spend this time to talk about Failure to Govern: The First 6 Months Under Republican Control. President Trump’s first 6 months have been defined by his often angry and personal tweets, his efforts to denigrate and undercut the multiple investigations into Russian influence in the 2016 election, and most importantly, the stalemated legislative battle to repeal and replace ObamaCare. President Trump has signed dozens of executive actions and Presidential proclamations. Some have fared better than others. His travel ban plan, for instance, first caused chaos and was effectively shut down by a series of legal challenges. But the second effort, which also faced a flurry of lawsuits, was ultimately allowed to take effect on a limited basis by the Supreme Court. In all, our President has signed 42 bills into law. But when it comes to big ticket items, like infrastructure, tax reform, and a repeal and/or replacement of ObamaCare, President Trump is sitting on zero. With healthcare seemingly on ice, tax reform is expected to be the big challenge next on our agenda. Budgets are about priorities, and this President’s priorities are clear. His budget hollows out our economy, endangers working families all across this country, in my district of the Virgin Islands, and the other districts that we all represent. The $2.5 trillion in cuts to entitlement programs, which include $192 billion to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as SNAP, and the $800 billion to Medicaid, will devastate localities like the Virgin Islands and elsewhere, where one in five children are covered under Medicaid and onefifth of our population receives SNAP benefits. The President has a budget with massive cuts that would shred social safety nets and cripple longstanding governmental functions. This administration has created uncertainty in the Nation’s healthcare system by sending inconsistent administrative signals and supporting legislation that could deprive millions of people of health insurance coverage, undermine Medicaid health support for lowincome Americans, and give wealthy taxpayers a massive tax cut. He has mismanaged the Federal Government by failing to fill top spots. He has expanded the policy of deporting dangerous and illegal aliens by including many people with minimal records, stable jobs, and American families. Most recently, we saw this with the Secretary of Homeland Security ordering the 50,000plus Haitians here under protective status, due to the devastating natural disasters in Haiti, to leave. These are decent, hardworking people who are sending money back home, supporting an economy which is faltering under collapse. We have seen a reversal of decades of bipartisan cooperation in extending environmental preservation of national landmarks. He has hired foxes to watch the chicken coops by filling his administration with archconservatives, many with records opposing the very agencies with which they work, and curbing civil rights and environmental enforcement. All of these things we have seen in these first 6 months, and we will hear more. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ), to speak on behalf of what we have seen in these last 6 months. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, who has demonstrated great leadership in leading these CBC Special Order hours. It is not an easy task, but she has done remarkable work in terms of finding topics that are important to our communities and our Nation. 
As the gentlewoman stated, Mr. Speaker, this month we marked 6 months of the Trump Presidency and 6 months of congressional Republican inaction. Republicans made promise after promise to the American people. The President called himself the ultimate dealmaker. I wonder if we are witnessing the first Manchurian President. Instead of the promise of jobs, infrastructure, and a new and improved healthcare plan, we get chaos and seemingly neverending controversies. Where is the Republican agenda? Where are their accomplishments? Where are all those wins? Let’s take a look at the numbers. President Trump has a job approval rating of 36 percent, the lowest of any President ever at this point in their Presidency. Republicans can point to zero legislative accomplishments. The President has no plan to lower healthcare costs, no jobs bills, no infrastructure bills, no tax reform, and no clean budget. These simply are the facts. Instead of doing what is right for the American people, it appears that Republicans are more occupied with taking away healthcare from millions of our constituents to give tax cuts to the wealthy, or defending the administration’s most recent controversy. This week, we will vote on a dishonest security spending package that will force American taxpayers to pay for the President’s border wall. Who is going to pay for it? It looks like the American people. During his campaign and the rhetoric that we heard up until this point, Mexico was going to pay for the wall. Now, here we are, with our Republican colleagues supporting an effort that says that the American people will pay for the wall. Well, we will get the money from Mexico later. Yeah, all right. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am alarmed by President Trump’s and the congressional Republicans’ determination to further break down our alliances and ignorance of matters related to the security of this Nation. Instead of funding the border wall, we should focus on building strong transportation and infrastructure systems that will create goodpaying jobs and lay a foundation for a strong economy. Instead, we are weakening America. Let’s build America with a strong infrastructure bill and adequate training and apprenticeship programs that will benefit our constituents. Make it in America is something I heard last week, which sounds magnificent, if we could do it. But if you are going to be the leader of this country and make such pronouncements, you have to live by what you are talking about. Make it in America is to strive to make sure that we do everything in America. We hear of two buildings Trump erected in Chicago that used Chinese steel or steel from outside the United States. If you look at his ties, his shirts, his suits, the soap in his hotels, nothing is made in America. Who are we trying to kid with this? There is nothing. Maybe his daughter. Well, no, her shoes aren’t made in America. Her dresses are not made in America. Who are we kidding? Who are we fooling? The American people have to open their eyes and see the sham that is going on. How this President says one thing and does absolutely the opposite is an atrocity. Make it in America? He stood up there in front of the American people and said that, with the suit, shirt, and tie that he had on? Absolutely unconscionable. Where are the jobs? I am going to be the best job creator you have ever seen. When? You are going to win so much, you are going to get tired of winning. When? The American people deserve better. The American people deserve better than a Congress that cares more about pushing an agenda that puts wealthcare in front of healthcare. The American people deserve better than a Congress that will pass legislation that will harm our environment, contaminate our air, and pollute our waterways. The American people deserve better than a Congress that continues to ignore important issues that disproportionately affect AfricanAmerican communities, such as criminal justice reform, gun violence prevention, and voting rights. While this administration and congressional Republicans turn their backs on the American workers, we will continue to demand real action to create jobs, raise wages, and create a brighter future for American families. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, when the gentleman was talking about what has happened in these last 6 months, it reminded me of when the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, CEDRIC RICHMOND , on March 22 went with the executive members to visit with the President to speak with him specifically about those things that African Americans and the people who we represent—the 17 million African Americans and the 20plus million Americans that members of the Congressional Black Caucus represent—to outline for him in a very succinct and systematic manner those issues that are important to us. You mentioned criminal justice reform. You talked about expansion of voting rights, jobs creation, support to small businesses, infrastructure. These are the things that the President said he was interested in. These are the things that the Congressional Black Caucus said: We are willing to work with you. We have an agenda. We have specific language, specific legislation that we would like to have a discussion with you. And not a photo op, but really to sit down around a table and discuss actual legislation and how we can be supportive of an agenda that supports the people we represent. And what have we gotten out of that? Zero to date, 6 months in. Mr. PAYNE. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. PLASKETT. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, to the gentlewoman’s point, I believe there was a document that was created to give to the President on those issues, and we are still waiting to hear back from the administration in reference to anything that was in that document. We don’t need photo ops. We don’t need to go to the White House and be trucked up there and lollygag and use us for whatever they deem proper for them. We need help for the American people. We need an administration that is going to look at these issues, be serious about them, and continue to move this country forward, as it was in the previous 8 years. b2000 Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS ), the freshman who is not a freshman, who represents Philadelphia, who has been a legislator for many years and comes here. He is so thoughtful. He is very quiet just like yourself, Mr. PAYNE , and he sits back and is really more observant but is ready to do the work. He is about policy, is discussing—on a regular basis I hear him talking about middle communities, middle America, those communities that are on the edge. There are places in Newark, New Jersey, and other places that you represent, in neighborhoods in my own district in the Virgin Islands where working class, hard working class people are there but they are on the edge of losing those homes, losing their health insurance, neighborhoods which they have worked so hard over 20, 30 years to create to be vibrant areas in this country that may be lost under this administration and the lack of action. So I yield to Congressman EVANS this evening to discuss what he has seen happen in these last 6 months of this administration and how it speaks to those individuals that we represent. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the Virgin Islands for her leadership in terms of being provided this opportunity that she has demonstrated clearly that she has been leading these efforts for the Congressional Black Caucus. So I want to again compliment her for all that she has done not just through words, but through action. And then my neighboring legislator from New Jersey, he and I worked very close together and I have known him an awful long time. So I thank both of you. I have always said there is a big difference between campaigning and governing. I will say that again. There is a big difference between campaigning and governing. President Trump, it is time to govern. 
When I talk to people in my district, they are scared about what President Trump and the Republicans are doing when it comes to their healthcare. They know that the Republicans want to take away their healthcare, and they do not know where to turn. We know that the Republican healthcare bill does not protect our family members and friends from preexisting conditions. Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you the story of a small businessowner in my district named Andrea. Andrea owns a small pet store, Spot’s—The Place for Paws, in Narberth, Pennsylvania. Andrea left her Philadelphia law practice to pursue her dream of owning a small business. Andrea has type 1 diabetes, and without the ACA, she would not be able to get the wellpriced coverage that covers her health expenses and medication and allows her to keep her shop open. We are talking about passing a bill that will make life harder for those trying to get ahead. That is wrong, and that is a risk we cannot take. Even though the President has yet to deliver on a single promise in 6 months, Pennsylvanians are still anxious and fearful of his plans for the future. President Trump has been in office for 6 months, and we have had 6 months of court cases, stalling, and tweets. Let me repeat that. We have had 6 months of court cases, stalling, and tweets. The Trump administration is still clearly not ready for prime time. From healthcare to the Russians, to the budget, the Republican party has left the American people with nothing but broken promises. Philadelphia and Montgomery County residents in my district deserve better. The American people deserve better. For 8 years, the ‘‘Party of No’’ constantly criticized President Obama. Yet, even with control of the House, the Senate, and the White House, they have yet to deliver on a jobs plan, healthcare, tax reform, and the list goes on. Our Federal workers who help secure our Nation’s borders, protect and monitor our food supply, and support businesses through agencies like the SBA should not have to wait for Republicans to continue to make decisions that are not in the best interest of the country. Our neighborhoods have a lot to lose if we don’t stand united and fight for what is right. It is time to roll up our sleeves and work across party lines to fight for sound economic policies that give our schools and students and our small businessowners and entrepreneurs, our seniors, and our veterans the resources they need to prosper and build stronger neighborhoods block by block, It is time for a better deal. We deserve a better deal and a better opportunity. It is clear to me that we need to build on that opportunity for the future, and the only way we can do it is we have to stop campaigning, Mr. President, and we have to begin to govern. The over 300 million Americans deserve all of us functioning together, and the Congressional Black Caucus, the conscience of this body, is prepared to lead. My colleague, who has been leading this effort, she has been demonstrating over and over again a message of hope and optimism. She, too, knows that we can have a better deal, and that better deal is an optimism of people working together. So I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your leadership and what you have demonstrated. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. EVANS so much for talking about the optimism of the American people. There is a better deal that is out there, and there is a better way that we all, as Members of Congress, need to demonstrate. I was looking at a fact Street Sheet that was put together talking about the 200 days of the 115th Congress by the numbers. This is a Congress that is controlled by the Republicans in the House, the Republicans in the Senate, and the Republican administration. You would think that so much legislation could get done, and we are a stalled body at this time. That is not what the American people brought us to Washington to do. We all represent people who are looking for a better deal, looking for an expansion of the American Dream, a realization of the American Dream in their own lives, and having security for their own children and their grandchildren to be able to realize that dream. When I looked at these numbers, I was aghast at what has not been done in this Congress and flabbergasted at the things that have been done by this Congress. Zero number of bills to create jobs have been brought to the House floor by House Republican leadership. Zero number of bills that have been considered under an open rule so far this Congress. The same open rule that, Mr. Speaker, you said that you would exact when you were a young gun coming to Washington, you said that you would use the open rule, but we have not seen that done in this 115th Congress. Three times, House Republicans blocked a vote on H.R. 685, Bring Jobs Home Act, which ends tax breaks for corporations sending jobs overseas and creates new incentives to create good paying jobs here in the United States. There have been zero times that Speaker PAULRYANhas spoken out in opposition to President Trump’s dangerous and unconstitutional Muslim and refugee ban. Zero votes on the expansion and correction to the Voting Rights Act. 234 Republicans blocked a vote on H.R. 2933, a critical bill that promotes effective apprenticeships that gives students and workers the skills they need to find goodpaying jobs. Twice, House Republicans voted against Made in America amendment requiring that specific infrastructure and construction projects use materials and equipment made in the USA. Mr. Speaker, 229 Republicans voted for a GOP antiworker, baitandswitch bill that undermines the existing right to hardearned overtime pay, giving employers the flexibility to substitute overtime pay with comp time while giving employees no guarantee that they can use their comp time when they need it. Mr. Speaker, 217 Republicans voted for the disastrous TrumpCare bill, which would result in 23 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage, raises outofpocket healthcare costs for millions of American families, imposes a crushing age tax on those 50 to 64, shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund, and guts the protections for people with preexisting conditions. Mr. Speaker, 233 Republicans voted to gut the DoddFrank Act, Wall Street reforms, rolling back key consumer protections, and take us back to pre 2008 era of unchecked risky financial market abuses that resulted in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. There have been zero amount of funding in President Trump’s budget for Social Services Block Grants, which provide States with funding for services such as childcare and adult care programs. And there are 1.6 million schoolage children that would lose afterschool and summer programs as a result of the President’s budget. When we talk about the President’s budget, we need to discuss exactly what those numbers mean and how it is going to affect the American people— people, Mr. Speaker, that we say we represent, but that we are not standing up for against this administration. The budget would cut SNAP funding by over 190 billion—with a ‘‘B’’—over the next 10 years, jeopardizing benefits for an estimated 44 million Americans and reduce nutritional foods for women, infants, and children, the WIC program. The budget also includes SNAP policy changes that would charge food stores using USDA approval to accept food stamps, which could drive smaller food retailers out of the program. Why is this important? Because many people in urban areas that are using food stamps are doing so in virtual food deserts. They do not have transportation to go to the large suppliers, the large grocery stores. They go to these smaller grocery stores. They go to these small places to use the food stamps to be able to provide food for their families. These changes would cap benefits, require localities to pay 25 percent of benefits, and limit local waivers for Federal work requirements that many communities are not appropriate because there are no jobs, because we also are not supplying individuals with the job skills, the work skills to be able to find employment in some of these areas. 
The budget would reduce Education Department investments by $9 billion, including through the elimination of preschool and afterschool programs, literacy grants, and funding to improve teacher and principal quality. It also proposes cuts to higher education programs, including elimination of grants for lower income students, lowinterest Perkins loans, and cutting by half a program that helps students work to pay off their loans. The budget also calls for the elimination of NASA Space Grant education programs that prepare students, such as in my district at the University of the Virgin Islands, for careers in science and technology industries. The budget would reduce USDA Rural Development funding by $9.2 million, approximately 30 percent. This is vital in areas like my district in the Virgin Islands with the elimination of rural business cooperative services and rural water and wastewater disposal programs. The budget would zero out important rural housing assistance, such as singlefamily housing direct loans; would slash funding for rural broadband, distance learning, telemedicine, and needed community facilities improvement. Mr. Speaker, these are in rural areas that President Trump won in the election. You would think that he would want to support these rural communities in areas of housing, the most American of American ideals, home ownership. In the Labor Department, the budget would reduce Labor Department investments by $2.4 billion, including large cuts to Job Corps. Job Corps, a place that would allow young people to have training for jobs, activities meant to prepare disadvantaged youth, the same youth that we say we are concerned about being on the streets in these urban areas that are so dangerous, those are the individuals going to Job Corps, looking to be prepared for the workplace, and we are going to reduce that by $2.4 billion? That doesn’t make any sense. The budget request for the Department of Energy would slash research funding and move away from investments in renewables, including a 70 percent cut to the Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and zeroing out its weatherization assistance in State energy programs that aid lowincome families with reducing energy costs. b2015 The Department’s Office of Science would be cut by 17 percent. That budget slashing to NOAA coastal science programs includes eliminating NOAA’s Sea Grants program, coastal research at our university, and the coastal zone management grants that aid with climate change mitigation—climate change mitigation—which is needed in areas that I live in, like the Virgin Islands, Florida, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and in coastal areas that are seeing a tremendous loss of economy and loss of homes because our environment is, in fact, changing. The Environmental Protection Agency would be cut by approximately 30 percent, partly through elimination of all EPA climate change programs, lead control programs, the Energy Star program that encourages energyefficient consumer products, and the environmental justice office that investigates the concentration of pollution in low income communities. Now we want people to be in communities where pollution is greatest, those inner cities that our President has said he wants to fight so strongly for. We are going to keep them in polluted areas because we are cutting out EPA funding in some of those places. In transportation and housing, the budget would eliminate $500 million per year in TIGER grants, Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery, which has been important to ports and transshipment projects around this country, in the Virgin Islands, and the Community Development Block Grant program that provides grant funding to localities for economic development activities. The Department of Housing would be cut nearly 20 percent, including elimination of several housing assistance grant programs and slashing its core rental housing program, Section 8 housing choice vouchers, which assists private rental housing, which is a win win program. You allow individuals who have private homes, who are renting those out, to receive a voucher to support individuals who are looking to be placed in those homes. An estimated 250,000 housing vouchers would be taken away over the next fiscal year, vouchers which primarily benefit seniors and individuals with disabilities. Support for local public housing authorities would also see cuts. The budget would eliminate Commerce Department subdivisions that support businesses and entrepreneurship, such as the Economic Development Administration, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, and the Minority Business Development Agency. Healthcare, of course we could go on for forever, but the budget calls for phasing out enhanced Federal matching funds for expanded Medicaid populations by 2020 for people living in territories and in other areas that are heavily relying on Medicaid. It would be far more expensive for those localities to cover individuals, and our hospitals would be faced with even more uncompensated care costs. The budget also proposes cuts of $1.3 billion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, and more than $7 billion from the National Institutes of Health, NIH. In the alternative, stronger budgets for NIH and CDC would benefit in preparation for public health threats and pandemics. These are the things that we, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus, are seeing that are happening in these first 6 months. We are concerned. We are not here just to bash the President. That is not the objective with bringing these issues out. The objective is to make the American people aware, to call on our colleagues here in this House, in the House next door to us in the Senate, to be better stewards of what the American people have given us: the ability, the right, the job of legislating, the job of being a check and balance to an administration which has been caught in a morass of ineffectiveness and inaction to support the American people of this great country. We are asking, Mr. Speaker, that we would wake up to what is happening, see with clear eyes, not with fake news, not with our own vision of what we would like things to be, but what things are and where this is taking us now, the people who are going to be left behind, that a better deal needs to be made for the American people who have sent us here to Washington to do what is right, to do what is good for them, to represent all the people, not the wealthy. Listen, I was raised in New York, and I don’t have anything against New Yorkers, of course, but we can’t just be looking out for those people who are living on the Upper West Side, the Upper East Side, in Tribeca and SoHo, the fat cats of Wall Street. We need to be for all Americans. I know that each one of us is here sent by the people who have sent us not just for ourselves and not just for our constituents, but for all Americans: those who can’t vote, those who rely on us to be the stewards of this great legacy—the Constitution and all that America represents, the land of opportunity. People will be losing that opportunity based on what we have seen in these last 6 months. We, the Congressional Black Caucus, as the conscience of Congress, are relying and awakening the conscience of this Congress to wake up and see what is happening, to stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves, and to do the right thing, to make a better deal with the American people—not with Pennsylvania Avenue, not among ourselves, not in our private little meetings, not with what can be done for us and for our small group, but for all Americans, those Americans that are going to be left behind by those billions and trillions in tax cuts that are coming to the social safety net of this country. It cannot be relied on by many of the States. Many of the States do not have the wherewithal to pick up that slack. And there will be even greater—greater—demise to this country if we continue to allow it to work this way. We have got to take up the call of those people who cannot speak for themselves and do what is right and tell our President that these 6 months cannot continue for another 3 years. We cannot have it. We will not tolerate 
it. You must awaken to what is the best deal for all Americans, not just those within your inner circle. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague Congresswoman PLASKETT for hosting this special order for members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) to speak about the first 6 months of Republicans’ failure to govern in the White House and in Congress. Today marks 185 days since the inauguration of Donald Trump, and 203 days since the start of this Republican Congress. Despite the countless promises Trump made to the American people, the Trump presidency has been defined by chaos and incompetence from Day 1. In addition to being mired in controversy, Trump lacks an agenda and has no major accomplishments to tout after six months in office. Following in the footsteps of their leader, Republicans in both chambers of Congress have utterly failed to produce legislation that actually improves the lives of everyday Americans in any meaningful or measurable way. Of the 43 bills that have been signed into law, 58 percent of these were noncontroversial suspensions and 33 percent were partisan GOP specialinterest bills that strip vital protections away from the American people. The Republican leadership has demonstrated a remarkable incapacity to actually lead their respective majorities in the House and Senate; instead their ‘‘leadership’’ has been marred by empty legislation, regressive policies, and damage control to rein in each new scandal spiraling out from the White House. On January 20, 2017, Trump restated his trademark campaign promise to the American people: ‘‘Together we will make America great again.’’ Six months later, and that slogan rings hollower with each passing day. Six months later, he has forged virtually no deals; he has not achieved his goal of ‘‘insurance for everybody,’’ nor has he put forward a single jobs or infrastructure bill, nor has he achieved tax reform, nor has he negotiated a single trade agreement. Donald Trump promised that his extensive business experience would lead to better deals for the American people, and that he would be the ‘‘greatest president for jobs that God ever created.’’ Six months later, he has taken no action to support job creation or grow the economy. Instead, the Trump budget includes draconian cuts to education, research, infrastructure, and other key areas that support job creation and the American economy. Before he entered office, Trump showed off his infamous ‘‘dealmaking skills’’ when he promised to make Carrier Corp. keep their furnace factory jobs on American soil. On the 6month anniversary of his inauguration, Carrier announced plans to cut 632 workers from the very Indianapolis factory Trump visited last December. These manufacturing jobs will move to Monterrey, Mexico, where minimum wage is $3.90; the White House has not addressed this failure of Trump’s strongman, isolationist economic policy. During his campaign, Trump claimed that he would save the coal industry—a sector that only employs 0.03 percent of the economy— and in June, 2017, Scott Pruitt of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared that the U.S. had miraculously created 50,000 coal jobs since 2016. This staggering figure turned out to be a staggering lie; according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the coal sector has added about 1,000 jobs since October, 2016; it appears as though Mr. Pruitt ‘‘miscalculated’’ his estimate by 5,000 percent. Not only have Trump’s predictions for unparalleled job creation and economic growth proved to be pipe dreams or outright lies—the White House’s budget proposal cruelly imposes drastic cuts to food stamps, student loans, and disability payments among a host of critical programs. Trump promised that there would be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid— that everybody was going to be taken care ‘‘much better than they’re taken care of now.’’ Six months later, the Republicans do not have a plan that would ensure all Americans have access to affordable, quality healthcare. Six months later, the existing Trumpcare plan, which has completely stalled in the Senate, would make 23 million Americans lose their health coverage and increase costs for millions more. Trumpcare cuts Medicare and Medicaid, and his budget proposal cuts Social Security. Trumpcare would allow discrimination against Americans with preexisting conditions and imposes an age tax on older Americans. Thousands of Americans—both Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, old and young, healthy and sick—have cried out to their Congressmembers to keep the Affordable Care Act and to prevent Trumpcare from ever seeing the light of day. Americans oppose Trumpcare by a threeto one margin, but this overwhelming majority sentiment seems to have fallen on deaf ears for Donald Trump and the Republican leadership. Trump also promised clean air and water in America. Six months later, the Trump Administration and G.O.P. Congressmembers are rolling back vital environmental protections. In a move that drew universal ire from the international community and concerned Americans, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement. He has signed executive orders rolling back the Clean Power Plan and Clean Water Rule, and 37 Congressional Review Act bills, several of which roll back environmental protections. His budget proposal would seek to inflict a 31 percent cut to the EPA and eliminates clean water programs for the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay. On the campaign trail, Trump made repeated declarations about restoring national security and being ‘‘tough on Russia.’’ Six months later, Trump has failed to put forward a plan to defeat ISIS or strategies to address the situations in Syria, Iraq, Somalia, or Yemen. Every week, a new report indicating collusion between the Trump Administration and the Russian government seems to come to light. American citizens and lawmakers alike have responded to this growing list of scandals with growing anxiety, animosity, and exasperation. In this and a few other respects, Trump has excelled. For instance, he racked up 991 tweets since his inauguration; even more impressive, he has made 836 false or misleading claims according to the Washington Post’s Fact Checker team. He has spent a record 40 days at his own golf properties. His approval rating is without equal at 36 percent—the worst of any president ever at the 6month mark. To recap, Trump’s legislative accomplishments total at exactly zero: No plan to lower healthcare costs; No jobs bill; No infrastructure bill; No tax reform; No plan to avoid defaulting on our debt; And no budget. By stark contrast, former President Obama had made great strides at this point in his presidency. By the 6month mark, Obama had: Signed the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act into law to improve protections for the American worker; Outlined an extensive new energy policy; Published an oped piece in 30 global newspapers simultaneously to discuss the growing economic crisis; Passed an historic climate change bill through Congress; Set out a new approach to Afghanistan and Pakistan; Announced a new auto emission policy aimed at getting greener cars on the road; Launched his successful campaign to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system; And much more. Americans want a President who can inspire them; they want a President who can lead effectively, with all the dignity and tact befitting the most powerful office in the world. To our collective dismay and frustration, Trump and the Republicans have been their own worst enemy in preventing major, commonsense legislation from being voted on or signed into law. I commend my colleague, Congresswoman 
PLASKETT , for hosting this special order examining the disastrous results that have resulted from 6 months of Republican control over our federal government. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, as Congress draws closer to the August recess, we are no closer to considering comprehensive legislation to shore up our nation’s crumbling infrastructure remains than we were when Republicans took control of Congress. Republicans in Congress have had control over both chambers since January, yet the American people are still left waiting more for a plan to repair our roads and bridges, bolster funding for the Highway Trust Fund, and provide stable funding to local communities for transportation projects. The costs of Congress’ inability to act are staggering. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) estimates that every American household will lose $3,400 each year between 2016 and 2025, due to infrastructure deficiencies. Our failure to act will cost the U.S. economy nearly $4 trillion in GDP by 2025 through diminished productivity, lost jobs, and the increased cost of goods. The longer we wait, the more expensive it will be to repair our roads, electricity grid, and water and wastewater infrastructure. 
The Republican House has been in session for 110 days. I am deeply disappointed that the Republican leadership has chosen to ignore important bills that I have supported, such as H.R. 1664—the Investing in America: A Penny for Progress Act. H.R. 1664 would shore up the Highway Trust Fund through new Invest in America bonds and a modest increase in the fuel excise tax. Another bill, H.R. 1265—the Rebuilding America’s Airport Infrastructure Act, would eliminate the cap on passenger facility charges, allowing local airports the ability to raise additional funds in order to build up more airport infrastructure such as new terminals and runways. H.R. 2510—the Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2017 would help bolster financing for new water and wastewater infrastructure projects all across the United States. These are real bills already introduced in Congress that we could consider today. Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to wait. There are a number of solutions already before us that this chamber could consider. It will take a display of political will by the Republican Party to consider these practical solutions to our nation’s infrastructure woes. The American people are demanding that we act swiftly on these policies so that we can focus on what is most important—the efficient movement of the people, goods, and services which drive our economy forward. The time to act is now. I strongly urge my colleagues to support a comprehensive plan to shore up our nation’s infrastructure. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DUNN). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
PARALYSIS RESOURCE CENTER The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ) for 30 minutes. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the important work of the Paralysis Resource Center at the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. Christopher Reeve put a face on spinal cord injury and had an unrelenting drive to pursue the best research in the world. It was his vision, it was his passion, and it was his brilliance that attracted young scientists to take on the cause and advance the field of spinal cord research. And while his wife, Dana, was universally known as the model for caregiving, her real legacy is the creation of the foundation’s Paralysis Resource Center that has reached so many of those living with paralysis and their families with lifechanging resources. The President’s budget eliminates all funding for the Paralysis Resource Center and suggests that the program is duplicative. Fortunately, my colleagues in the House appreciate the unique nature of the work that the PRC does. The PRC consists of a variety of services, communities, and programs, including: Information specialists trained to help anyone, from newly paralyzed individuals and their family members to persons who have lived with disabilities for quite some time, by providing individualized support and information; The Peer and Family Support Program, which builds peertopeer connections to help individuals find support and resources among the communities that best understand the dayto day realities and longterm challenges of individuals living with paralysis; The Quality of Life Grants Program, which has awarded over 2,900 grants, totaling more than $22 million, to broaden the impact of nonprofits across the country that foster community engagement and involvement while promoting health and wellness for individuals living with paralysis; and The Military and Veterans Program, the MVP, which supports the unique needs of current servicemembers and veterans regardless of when they served or how their injury was obtained. I urge my colleagues to reach out to the Paralysis Resource Center to learn of the important work that they are doing for vulnerable constituents in their districts. If you do, you can see that the PRC is so much more than a line item in a budget. It is more than dollars and cents. It is more than just another program. The value of these programs can only be appreciated when you learn the stories of the thousands of Americans that the PRC has helped with their services. Tonight, I would like to tell some of those stories. It is through these stories that we can see the amazing work of the Paralysis Resource Center, the lasting legacy of Christopher and Dana Reeve, and the bright future of so many who have been served through the PRC’s programs. You will notice that, throughout these stories, you hear the same names pop up again and again. That is because the PRC builds community and it builds connections. When a spinal cord injury leaves Americans with no place else to turn, the PRC steps in to help guide the way; and, in return, many of those who have benefited from PRC turn back and look to help others with spinal cord injuries, to support their journey of recovery and rehabilitation. Mr. Speaker, in order to move forward and to tell these stories, I would like to start by yielding to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN ), my friend, who will share some thoughts with us now. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH ), my colleague, for yielding. It is an honor to join him this evening to discuss the cause and mission that is very close to my heart. As many of my colleagues know, I was injured back in 1980, as a young police cadet, when I was accidentally shot and paralyzed in the police locker room when a police officer’s gun accidentally discharged. So, the cause of finding a cure and better treatments for spinal cord injuries and supporting family members as caregivers of people with spinal cord injuries has, again, been a passion of mine and mission for many years. In late 2001, it was my privilege to join Christopher and Dana Reeve, two very dear friends of mine whom I got to know very well over the years, in announcing the creation of the Paralysis Resource Center, or the PRC, which was officially established in 2002 as part of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. These were two remarkable individuals, as I said, I got to know and who became friends of mine over the years. I can remember back when Christopher Reeve was paralyzed in his horse riding accident and how, instead of being quiet and introverted and just dealing with his recovery, he made it his mission to call attention to the cause of spinal cord injuries and the need for further research to be done and support services to be provided. He was an amazing inspiration to me because he gave voice and was a face of spinal cord injuries and the work that needed to be done to find a cure. Because of his work and that of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, we are getting closer and closer every day to finding a cure for spinal cord injuries; and we are getting closer and closer every day to providing support for better quality of life for people with disabilities and paralysis and further support for the families of those who care for people with disabilities, especially those with spinal cord injuries. In 2009, I was so proud to support the enactment of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, which formally authorized some of the programs that have led to the success of the PRC. This center has grown to include a network of information specialists, a number of veterans programs, a Peer and Family Support Program, a substantial Quality of Life Grants Program, and a neurorecovery rehabilitation network. It really is an inclusive center. It conveys the message that people dealing with spinal cord injuries or nerve related conditions are not alone, that there are people and organizations around them who care and are willing to give the advice and counsel support that they need. So whether you are living with paralysis or you are the caregiver of a loved one who is paralyzed, the PRC provides resources and information to help serve the specific needs of those affected by spinal cord injuries. We know there are more than 43 million caregivers in the U.S. providing support to loved ones with chronic disabling conditions on a variety of disabilities, whether it is a sick child or a 
sick parent or, in particular, those living with spinal cord injuries and paralysis. Reports estimate that the annual economic value, if we had to put a price tag on this uncompensated care of family caregivers, to be somewhere approximately at the level of $470 billion annually—$470 billion annually, if we had to put a dollar figure on this uncompensated care. That is more than the total Medicaid spending was in 2013. That is when this study was done and those statistics were made public. The benefits of family caregiving, of course, are plentiful and it is what families do for one another. If you have a sick child or a sick parent or a loved one, families so often step up to the plate and they provide that uncompensated care. Again, it is what families do. But, at the same time, it can also take an emotional, mental, and physical toll. b2030 As a result, respite is the most frequently requested support service among family caregivers. Respite is that little bit of assistance where you have someone coming in to give the caregiver a break during the course of a week. Maybe it is an hour or two a day or a few hours during the course of a week that can make all the difference in allowing the caregiver themselves to go to the doctor or go do their grocery shopping, the things that are important to the rest of the family, or bringing a child to a baseball game or soccer practice; again, just those little everyday things that maybe we often take for granted that a family caregiver may not be able to do but for the fact that they have respite coming in. As a result, respite is, again, the most frequently requested support services among family caregivers. Supported by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, the Lifespan Respite Care Program, which I helped to create back in 1996 with thenCongressman Mike Ferguson, a Republican from Pennsylvania, it was a bipartisan effort in creating this program, which operates now in 35 States and the District of Columbia, complements the PRC’s efforts to help paralyzed individuals achieve a high quality of life by ensuring that caregivers who help them also receive relief and care, again, and support themselves. Access to respite services has been shown to promote caregiver health and wellbeing, promote family stability, reduce the likelihood of abuse and neglect, and delay or even avoid the need for admission to costlier, longterm institutional settings, resulting in significant savings for the healthcare system and ultimately taxpayers, but ultimately helping the loved one who needs the care receive better care, because the loved one providing the care gets the support and the break that they need. So beyond supporting access to respite for caregivers, we know the PRC’s services and programs have touched the lives of people across the country, including those residing in the Ocean State, where I am from in Rhode Island. For instance, Sarah Galli of Rhode Island spoke about her brother, Jeff, who was injured in 1998, and I would like to share her impactful words on the importance of the PRC now. She wrote: ‘‘July 4, 1998, was the day that my family changed forever. My healthy, strong, athletic 17yearold brother dove into the shallow end of a swimming pool and was rendered a high level quadriplegic. ‘‘Each Independence Day that followed has been a reminder of how quickly and irrevocably Jeff had his physical independence taken from him. It is also a reminder of how grateful I am for the support that has enveloped my family with care. ‘‘I can’t speak for my brother’s experiences as a quad. That is his story to tell. But here is mine. In the years following his accident, I have counted on the Paralysis Resource Center and the Reeve Foundation for support. I have referred friends and strangers to them who require information and advocacy. ‘‘And as a theater major in college, I started a student cabaret, Born for Broadway, that expanded an annual gala in the years since, raising awareness and funds for paralysis organizations, including Reeve. And I have also picked up the phone on several occasions to call the PRC and cry. Sometimes you just need to know that you are not alone. ‘‘A friend of mine, Reeve supporter Jeff Ruben, wrote a song about a pal who lives with paralysis, using the lyrics, ‘I believe in miracles.’ ‘‘I don’t believe in miracles, but I do believe in Jeff. And I believe in Reeve. Do you?’’ Mr. Speaker, we know the PRC’s network of support remains strong to this day. When another Rhode Islander, 21 yearold Jack Calbi, was injured in a mountain bike accident this past April and left paralyzed from the chest down, the PRC immediately reached out to Jack’s family to discuss the array of resources available. Nearly 6 million Americans live with paralysis, depend on robust services and supports, respite for caregivers that love them, and a continued investment in the science and innovation that will lead to the treatments and cures of tomorrow. The PRC has become a beacon of hope for so many. And as my dear friend Christopher Reeve said, ‘‘Once you choose hope, anything is possible.’’ Christopher and Dana Reeve were friends of mine. I miss them dearly. They truly did provide hope to me and millions of others, whether affected by paralysis or some other nerve disorder or disabilities in general, or the families that are affected by this condition as well. They made a difference, as has the PRC. I am grateful for their work and I am grateful for all the efforts to keep the PRC going strong so that they can continue to help those living with paralysis, their families, and for those who may be affected in the future. And together I know that one day, because of all the efforts that are going on through amazing research right now, as we get closer step by step every day to finding a cure for spinal cord injuries, that families will know that they are not alone, that we are in this together, and that PRC and the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation are helping us to one day get one step closer to finding the cures and those treatments that we so desperately look for. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida for raising attention to this issue and for yielding to me. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Rhode Island, Representative LANGEVIN . I thank him for his leadership here in the House on these important issues. But just as you spoke about your friends Christopher and Dana Reeve and talked specifically about how Christopher Reeve was not quiet and introverted, that he was an inspiration to you, I think it is fair to say, and I am comfortable actually speaking in this one instance on behalf of my colleagues here in the House in saying that just as Christopher Reeve was an incredible leader and an inspiration to you, so, too, Representative LANGEVIN , are you an inspiration to all of us in the House. I thank you for participating tonight. There are so many other stories to tell. Representative LANGEVIN shared some. I would like to share just a few others. One is the story of Eric LeGrand. On October 16, 2010, Rutgers University football star Eric LeGrand sustained a spinal cord injury at his C3 and C4 vertebrae. After a kickoff in the fourth quarter against Army, Eric sprinted down the field and he made the tackle, but after the collision, he stayed down on the field at MetLife Stadium. Eric was paralyzed from the neck down, and doctors gave him a zero to 5 percent chance of regaining neurologic function. From the moment he was injured, the Paralysis Resource Center was by Eric’s side with a wealth of services and support. To conquer the immediate challenges of paralysis, his mother, Karen LeGrand, spoke regularly with the PRC’s information specialists, who provided a roadmap of the resources that helped Eric transition to the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation in West Orange, New Jersey. At that point, Eric was already exceeding expectations for his recovery and was weaned off of his ventilator and his feeding tube. To help his family understand the longterm realities of a spinal cord injury, Eric and Karen were put in touch with Alan Brown, a dear friend of mine I will speak more about in a bit. Alan is a certified peer mentor and staff 
member of the Reeve Foundation, and he offered advice from his own personal experience living with quadriplegia for over 25 years. Eric was also enrolled in the Reeve Foundation’s NeuroRecovery Network, the NRN. The NRN is a growing network of rehabilitation centers that develop and provide cuttingedge therapies, like Locomotor Training. Thanks to the NRN therapies and Eric’s determination, he recovered the ability to move his neck and his shoulders. He has also improved trunk, cardiovascular, and pulmonary control. His quality of life, wellbeing, and health have dramatically improved through the efforts of the PRC. To pay forward his gratitude and help others, Eric founded Team LeGrand of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation to speed the development of treatments for spinal cord injury. Since its inception in September 2013, Team LeGrand has raised close to $1 million. Karen LeGrand was also inspired by her experience with the PRC, and became a certified peer mentor to offer guidance and support to parents who have children living with paralysis. Elizabeth Forst is someone else whose story we should focus on. An avid traveler and diver, Elizabeth ‘‘E.B.’’ Forst’s life changed in 2014 when a dive into a swimming pool resulted in a C4–C5 spinal cord injury. In the aftermath of her injury, Elizabeth’s family struggled with how to move forward and to ensure that Elizabeth could still live life to the fullest. Her older brother, Tracy, reached out to the Reeve Foundation to tap into the constellation of programs and resources offered by the Paralysis Resource Center. He spoke with information specialists to get a better understanding of his sister’s condition and how his family could help her adapt physically, emotionally, and socially to living with a spinal cord injury. Tracy also regularly referred to the Reeve Foundation’s website to educate himself on life after paralysis from both Elizabeth’s perspective and his role as her family member and caregiver. Thankful for the support she received from the Paralysis Resource Center, Elizabeth became a trained and certified peer mentor to help fellow paralysis community members find beauty and joy after a lifechanging injury. She has also resumed her passion for diving and traveling, as well as blogging for the Reeve Foundation to share her tips for traveling with a disability. E.B. has said she still has a lot of travel destinations on her list, and the PRC is surrounding her with support to make sure she can continue to travel the world. Denna Laing is someone else we should think about tonight. On December 31, 2015, Denna Laing, a standout hockey player for the NWHL Boston Pride, was playing in the Women’s Winter Classic at Gillette Stadium when she crashed headfirst into the boards and sustained a spinal cord injury at her C5 vertebra. While she was in the hospital, the Reeve Foundation mobilized a network of support through the Paralysis Resource Center to help her family understand the shortterm and the longterm challenges of living with paralysis. They spoke with information specialists who provided tailored assistance on transitioning Denna from the hospital to acute care, and then adjusting to life back in her community. Denna and her family connected with certified peer mentors like Alan Brown, who offered support and guidance based on their own personal experiences. She is currently building up her strength and working to improve her health by participating in a comprehensive therapy regime at Journey Forward in Canton, Massachusetts, which is part of the Reeve Foundation’s NeuroRecovery Network. b2045 Denna recently tackled the Boston Marathon with help from former NHL player Bobby Carpenter, who pushed her racing wheelchair to the finish line. Known for her vibrant personality, she credits the support she received from the Reeve Foundation and paralysis community as the reason that she keeps smiling. In her words: ‘‘I know the best of my life has yet to come.’’ J.D. Bruning and Kelly Lamb are from Arkansas. After graduating from the University of Arkansas, J.D. was enjoying the warm weather with his friends when they decided to take a float trip on a local river. Near the end of the float trip, J.D. dove into what he thought was deep water, but it was too shallow, and he sustained a highlevel spinal cord injury. Since that lifechanging moment over 4 years ago, J.D. and his family have tapped into the wealth of resources provided by the Reeve Foundation Paralysis Resource Center to help J.D. live a full and active life in his community. Given the scarcity of resources for the paralysis community in Arkansas, the PRC was critical in establishing the best possible care for J.D. and helping to navigate the path forward for his family. His girlfriend, Kelly Lamb, was so inspired by the Reeve Foundation’s programs and mission that she ran both the Chicago and New York City Marathons in 2016, under the Team Reeve banner, and raised over $20,000 to accelerate innovative research. Kelly has cited the Paralysis Resource Center as a lifeline for thousands of families impacted by paralysis in the State of Arkansas and across the Nation. Sabrina Cohen is from Florida. Born and raised in Miami Beach, Sabrina sustained a C3–5 spinal cord injury in 1992, when a teenager driver, who promised to give Sabrina a ride to a party, started drag racing and, unfortunately, slammed into a tree. She was 14 years old, and her life was changed forever. When Sabrina was first injured, there was no centralized resource to learn how to live with paralysis or connect with fellow community members. When the Reeve Foundation Paralysis Resource Center was founded in 2002, it became and since remains a lifesaving resource for 5.4 million Americans living with paralysis from spinal cord injury, ALS, MS, spina bifida, stroke, and cerebral palsy. However, physical barriers still existed in Sabrina’s community as there was no beach in the Miami Beach area that was accessible to wheelchair users. Through the Sabrina Cohen Foundation, she applied for a Reeve Foundation Quality of Life Grant to fund her dream of a fully accessible beach and playground for the disabled, including seniors, veterans, and children with special needs. The Quality of Life Grants Program is funded through the Paralysis Resource Center and awards financial support to nonprofits that foster greater health, quality of life, community involvement, and independence for individuals living with paralysis and their caregivers. She made the most of a Quality of Life Grant to establish Miami Beach’s firstever dedicated public beach with improved wheelchair access and outdoor adaptive fitness and watersport activities. Finally, I would like to talk about two other people, both also from Florida, and both good friends of mine. Alan Brown, I mentioned earlier. He is a resident of Aventura, Florida, who was injured in 1988, at the age of 20, when his neck was crushed by an ocean wave while on vacation in the Caribbean. The accident caused a C5–6 spinal cord injury and left Alan a quadriplegic with no movement below his chest. For nearly 30 years since the accident, Alan and his family have, through the Alan T. Brown Foundation to Cure Paralysis, provided support, education, and advocacy for the paralysis community. Initially, the focus for the foundation was on finding a cure for paralysis, a magic bullet that would help everyone living with paralysis to walk again. But after years in a wheelchair, and the difficult challenges to overall health and emotional wellbeing that paralysis presents, he and his family decided to overhaul the mission of the foundation. Today, they focus on improving the lives of people living with paralysis through peer mentoring, outreach, and fundraising to help others with basic needs like wheelchairs and ongoing medical care. And now, Alan and his foundation have partnered with the Reeve Foundation to extend the reach and impact of his message to the paralysis community. 
Alan travels the country on behalf of the Reeve Foundation to advocate, to increase awareness, and to make an impact on the quality of life of other people living with paralysis and their families. He currently serves as manager of public impact at the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, and in this role, he focuses on extending the reach of the foundation’s impact on the greater public, creating new opportunities for partnership with peer organizations, increasing the visibility of PRC and other Reeve Foundation programs, bolstering fundraising efforts, and developing the national Peer & Family Support Program. I have been with Alan and been inspired by him on a regular basis, close up, and the work that he does in the paralysis community and for those who are experiencing paralysis firsthand. The work that he does at those early moments is extraordinary. Finally, Shawn Friedkin, who is from my community in south Florida. In March of 1992, Shawn was injured in a motor vehicle accident 2 weeks before his 27th birthday. He was married with one child, and he spent much of the early years following his injury working to increase medical research funding for spinal cord injuries. For his efforts, he was invited to the White House to meet with Hillary Clinton, thenFirst Lady, as part of her healthcare initiative. Shawn testified before Congress on the need for an increase in research funding. And based on his desire to help others in the community, Shawn left his career in finance, where he worked as a hedge fund manager, to create Stand Among Friends in 1997. Stand Among Friends, based in Boca Raton, Florida, is a crossdisability advocacy organization. It is focused on helping people with disabilities find employment through vocational training and adaptive technology. It has provided services to more than 4,000 people and helped over 1,000 people find employment. Shawn has grown the services and mission to become one of the top disability service providers in the State of Florida. And each year, Shawn and the Stand Among Friends organization hosts the ‘‘emb(race).’’ The emb(race) is a day of diversity awareness that includes a half marathon, a 5K, and a family fun walk; and it is, indeed, a way for all of us to embrace one another. Shawn, as I said, is a dear friend and an inspiration in his community and to all who know him. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank all of those who make the Paralysis Resource Center at the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation what it is today. As you can see from these stories, the PRC comes in at a family’s most vulnerable moment. These are the most serious injuries and illnesses one can imagine. They are lifechanging, and they come in with an immediate response to help guide families who are hurting to help them create a positive vision of a new life and build a community of support for Americans living with paralysis. I would like to leave with the words of Christopher Reeve. He said: ‘‘I think a hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles.’’ Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Paralysis Resource Center in their work to help empower more American heroes in the fight against spinal cord injuries. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Mr. POEof Texas (at the request of Mr. MCCARTHY ) for today on account of personal reasons. Mr. CUMMINGS (at the request of Ms. PELOSI ) for today and the balance of the week.
