Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, like many people, I have noticed renewed interest in the 25th Amendment, as we have seen erratic behavior out of the White House, an inability of Donald Trump to even tell whether it rained on him during his inaugural speech, and repeating false statements that are demonstrably wrong. Last Friday, the mechanism to deal with Presidential incapacity, the 25th Amendment, celebrated its 50th anniversary. I became intrigued with its history and application because it is clear, whether with Donald Trump or a future President, this mechanism is very important. Accidents can happen: President Reagan suffered from early onset Alzheimer’s that concerned his staff. President Wilson was incapacitated by a stroke, and his wife, Edith, effectively governed the United States for months. It is only a matter of time before we face these challenges again. As I examined the amendment, it became clear that, in the case of mental or emotional incapacity, there is a glaring flaw. For a mentally unstable, paranoid, or delusional President, the 25th Amendment has no guarantee of its application. In fact, it is likely that it would fail. As written, the 25th Amendment requires the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to concur that the President is no longer capable of exercising authority. There are other safeguards. It would take time to process. Ultimately, twothirds of both Houses of Congress must agree. But look at the current Cabinet. Even if one thinks that a group with no meaningful government experience, all approved in a heightened partisan context, most of whom don’t even know the President personally, could objectively exercise the power should the President become mentally incapacitated, the larger question is whether they would ever be allowed to do so. A President who is paranoid or delusional is very unlikely to tolerate dissent within the ranks. He or she could simply fire any Cabinet member who would stand up to them. That is why we need to exercise the other part of the 25th Amendment that allows Congress to designate another body, instead of the Cabinet. Who could exercise that authority with the confidence of the American public and with the knowledge of what it takes to understand the personal and political stresses of the Presidency? I submit that the best failsafe to a President who is emotionally unstable would be to impanel our previous Presidents and Vice Presidents to make that determination. Think about how it would work. Currently, there are 10 bipartisan former distinguished Americans who, in most cases, enjoy even greater public support than when they left office. Most importantly, there is no group of people better suited to evaluate the evidence and the dynamics at work for the good of the country and the President who needs help. Now, we have made real progress with mental illness. We have made it easier to get care. We are taking away the stigma for the one in five Americans who suffer from mental health issues. We find people to be more open and candid and accepting of themselves and others. We are making real strides in terms of treatment and acceptance. But all of this requires access to help; and this drama should not play out with somebody whose fingers are on the nuclear buttons and whose every pronouncement can unsettle diplomatic conditions, affect war and peace, and the global economy. Having Congress establish this panel of former Presidents and Vice Presidents from both parties as a guardian and failsafe mechanism is important, and it needs to happen as soon as possible. We never know when catastrophe might strike. There is no good time to fix this problem. In today’s world of alternative facts and fake news, in a sea of bitter partisan controversy, we need to have a mechanism that can be reliable, command public confidence, and be above politics. It is hard to think of a group that would collectively have more support and credibility than the distinguished 
Americans who have been in that position and, regardless of partisan differences, whose allegiance to America is unquestioned. We need to start now to protect the integrity of the most powerful position on the planet. 
BLACK LUNG BENEFITS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. JENKINS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, my home State of West Virginia has almost 20,000 coal miners. Tens of thousands more worked in the mines and are now enjoying a welldeserved retirement. They proudly mined the coal that powers our Nation, and it puts food on their table. These miners worked hard each and every day, and we owe them a debt of gratitude. Our Nation made them a promise to take care of them if they developed black lung disease. And for decades now, the Federal Government has guaranteed black lung benefits, and the so called Byrd amendment 7 years ago reiterated that commitment to our miners. As we draft healthcare reform here in Congress, I urge my colleagues to maintain these essential black lung benefits for our miners and their families. I have introduced legislation to affirm our commitment to protecting the Byrd amendment and these critical black lung benefits. I introduced it last Congress, too, and I am committed to continuing to fight for it because we cannot let our miners down. While mine safety continues to improve, we must guarantee that our miners have the benefits they need in case they are diagnosed with black lung disease. These benefits provide critical support for our retired miners and their families. For some disabled miners, it may be the only income they have. In West Virginia, almost 5,000 families rely on these benefits. This is a promise we made to them, and it is a promise that we must keep. Just as we have relied on our miners to mine the coal that built the skyscrapers and won world wars, our miners should be able to rely on us. I urge my colleagues to support the protection of black lung benefits and to honor the hard work of our miners. 
A GLACIER OF RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, we are in a constitutional crisis. Make no mistake about it. Yes, the National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned. Yes, he should have resigned, but he is just the tip of the iceberg. A glacier of Russian interference is plaguing our country right now. In his resignation letter, General Flynn wrote: ‘‘I have always performed my duties with the utmost of integrity and honesty to those I have served, to include the President of the United States.’’ I believe General Flynn. I believe he did precisely what the President of the United States asked him to do. General Flynn is a military man. He is accustomed to the chain of command. He did not do anything that he was not asked to do. He was not a rogue agent, but had the complete knowledge and cooperation of his Commander in Chief. We have all heard Donald Trump boast of how smart he is and how he calls his own shots. Why then should we believe that, when it comes to national security, he prefers to be kept in the dark? A President can’t be both in charge and out of the loop. The only way we can ever hope to know what happened is if there is a thorough investigation. I believe it should be an independent investigation, an independent commission. But if we are going to go down the route of having it be a congressional investigation, then it needs to be a comprehensive investigation and one that has the resources to do the job. I am calling on Chairman NUNES of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to schedule hearings immediately. We heard 14 hours of testimony from Secretary Clinton about her emails. I think we can agree that foreign infiltration of our government at the highest level is at least as important as using a private email server, especially, I might add, when President Trump and his team used unencrypted cell phones during their North Korea strategy session at MaraLago in a dining room with many other guests. Today, an Active Duty, fourstar general said publicly that ‘‘our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil’’ and that he hopes ‘‘they sort it out soon, because we’re a nation at war.’’ He continues: ‘‘As a commander, I’m concerned our government be as stable as possible.’’ It is critical that Congress takes heed of this unprecedented public warning and act. I am well aware this is a partisan institution. I also know that there have been times in our proud history in the United States Congress when Members have pushed partisanship aside in search of the truth. The Warren Commission, following the assassination of President Kennedy, is one example. The 9/11 Commission after the terrorist attacks in 2001 is another. In the Senate, at least three Republicans have directly called for investigations into this matter and several more have acknowledged that these questions must be answered. I wonder, will one House Republican Member come forward and say we must investigate? Colleagues, I urge you to think this through. Vladimir Putin ordered agents to meddle in our election. Did he do it out of love for Mr. Trump? I doubt it. More likely, he did it so he could do to a democracy what we and our allies did to communism, send it to the ash heap of history. If America’s elections can be hacked, what chance is there for budding democracies to make it? Don’t believe me? Look at what Putin has done in just 3 weeks of this new administration. He had government agents poisoned. He sent a political rival to prison. He sent $12 million to JeanMarie Le Pen, the farright candidate for the President of France. His latest move was to launch a cruise missile that is in direct defiance of treaties. Putin’s Russia is playing chicken with President Trump, and what is our President’s response? A tweet complaining about leaks within his administration and, according to the latest reports, pressuring the Prime Minister of Japan to forge closer relations with Russia. b1015 President Trump’s ‘‘bromance’’ is dangerous. It undermines our democracy, and it is destabilizing the globe. What does Putin have on President Trump? What does President Trump owe Putin? We will not know until we exercise U.S. Code section 6103. A vote yesterday in Ways and Means was a totally partisan vote. We deserve to know what his tax return shows us. We deserve the truth. 
CALIFORNIA’S MARCH TO THE EXTREME LEFT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, one of the most troubling aspects of California’s lurch to the left are the rise of two doctrines unknown in this country since the last gasp of the Southern Confederacy. The first is the doctrine of nullification, the notion that States may defy Federal laws that their leaders simply don’t like. The most outspoken advocate of this doctrine was John C. Calhoun, who, in referencing our Nation’s mostrevered document, the Declaration of Independence, observed that our Nation had been founded on—his words—‘‘selfevident lies.’’ The doctrine of nullification has been revived in the sanctuary cities movement, and has now reared its head as State legislation. Our Constitution clearly gives Congress the sole prerogative to make immigration law, and it commands the President to faithfully execute these laws. Our President is now doing so. Yet, California’s legislature is actively considering a bill that would assert an independent power to defy them. And this is not just happening in California. 
Mr. Speaker, States ought to be jealous guardians of their organic powers and the prerogatives against unwanted encroachments by the Federal Government. But the Supremacy Clause binds the States to our Federal laws. This is the very essence of Constitutional Federalism in Article VI: ‘‘This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and of all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.’’ If a State, in rightfully guarding its powers, believes that a Federal law unconstitutionally infringes on those powers, the Constitution provides that the courts shall resolve such disputes. But asserting the power to nullify a Federal law, a law that is clearly within the enumerated powers of the Congress and clearly under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, that crosses a very bright line that no State has breached since the first State seceded in 1861. Which brings us to the second, even more disturbing development in California’s march to the extreme left. There is no single act which more ultimately and categorically rejects our Constitution, our country, and all that they stand for, than a proposal to secede from the Union that has preserved our liberties for nearly two and a half centuries. It is logically impossible to support secession and, yet, maintain loyalty to the Union from which you propose to secede. Secession is the ultimate act of disloyalty today, no less than during the days of Confederacy. Yet, in California, a formal secession movement is now circulating petitions for signature to place exactly such a proposal on the ballot. It should come as no surprise that one of its leading proponents is an American expatriate now living in Russia who declared he ‘‘could no longer live under an American flag.’’ It should not even come as a surprise that the movement is cheered on by California’s increasingly radical left. But what came as a stunning surprise is that 32 percent of Californians support this measure, according to a recent poll. Let me repeat that. One in three Californians, according to this poll, want to repudiate our Federal Union and its Constitution. We can only hope that the polling is wrong, or that the disaffected Californians who answered the poll in this fashion did so with reckless abandon that calm reflection will cure. But it is impossible to avoid the implication that so many people in my afflicted State hold so little loyalty to our country that they would support a measure that willfully rends it asunder. These movements, nullification and secession, cross from lawful dissent into lawless rebellion. In these turbulent times, our greatest strengths are our rule of law, our constitutional institutions, and the loyalty of Americans to their priceless legacy of freedom and justice and the Union that preserves them. Every person who takes the oath of office under our Constitution swears an oath to support and defend the Constitution. These modern resurrections of the longburied doctrines of nullification and secession strike at the heart of our Constitution. These movements of the left would undermine the very foundation of our American civilization. They ought to be condemned in the strongest possible terms and opposed by every American of goodwill who remains loyal to our free government. 
RUSSIA’S AGGRESSIVE INTENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, as we are sitting here in this Chamber, right now off the coast of Groton, Connecticut, 30 miles from the Groton Navy Sub Base, which is the oldest submarine base in America, there is a Russian spy ship, the Viktor Leonov, that is loitering—as was reported this morning from the Navy and news sources— off the coast, again, within the bare minimum of international waters. I can attest to the fact that—having just flown down from Connecticut a few days ago—anyone who would loiter off the coast of Connecticut is not doing it because of the great climate and weather. It is freezing weather out there. They are doing it, obviously, with aggressive intent, to say the least. Mr. Speaker, this is part of a pattern that is going on right now not just off the East Coast of the U.S., but also overseas. The USS Porter, which is a Navy missile ship, was buzzed by military aircraft from Russia on February 10. They came within 200 yards of the ship. Again, because we have such incredibly competent and professional leadership that captain those vessels, an incident was avoided. However, the danger of jet aircraft moving within 200 yards of a U.S. naval ship obviously is just common sense to anyone how high risk that is in terms of creating an incident that could have huge ramifications. In addition to that, the news reported again just the last couple of days or so that the Russian military is now deploying intermediate medium range nuclear warheads in different places throughout Western Russia, near Eastern Europe. Again, this is clearly in violation of treaties that go back decades. As General Breedlove, who was the commander of NATO and the European Command who just stepped down, said that this new effort really just cannot go unanswered. It completely destabilizes the balance of power in that theater of the world. Again, the folks in Connecticut woke up this morning with that news about the spy ship off the coast. As you can imagine, it has created a lot of consternation and questions. Once again, I would reiterate that I have total confidence in our Navy leadership both at the Groton Navy base and here in Washington that they will react to this with total vigilance and professional competence to make sure that, again, our security is protected. But I think it is time now for all of us in Washington, D.C., to understand that Vladimir Putin, during the 5 years that he has been in power, again, has taken a posture that is completely destabilizing any sort of global system of peace and security. This new administration, which clearly has an infatuation with Putin— and this goes back during the campaign with President Trump talking on the campaign trail about his high regard for Putin’s leadership—needs to basically move on and recognize that this is an emerging threat and that we have to take all necessary steps to respond to it both in the shortterm and, obviously, as we take up defense policy and defense budgets, which is that the resurgence of the Russian Navy is a gamechanger in terms of the demands on our fleet. That is something that, again, on the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, which I am the ranking member, we are working hard in terms of implementing the Obama administration’s boost to Navy shipbuilding and increasing the fleet size. Again, we need to really, as I said, just disavow ourselves of any naive assumptions that somehow the Putin government is somehow something that we can trust, and shows any regard for international norms or international law. Again, to the folks back home, I want you to know that we are monitoring this situation with our Navy team down here in Washington and I have total confidence that we are on top of this situation. It is a reminder that the Russian Government and the investment that they have put into their Navy fleet is not a friendly gesture in terms of creating a system of global peace and security; and this administration needs to wake up and recognize that and move on to a bipartisan effort to respond to this threat. They can do that by, again, disclosing all the background regarding General Flynn’s interaction with the Russian Government because it is part and parcel of all those incidents which I listed in terms of aggressive actions that are happening in real time as we are here in Washington, D.C., today. 
TITLE X GRANT ALLOCATIONS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Tennessee (Mrs. B LACKBURN ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this morning to talk about a piece of legislation that is going to be before us this week, and we are bringing it forward through the Congressional Review Act. In our office, we have had so many people ask: What is a Congressional Review Act, and how is it that you can recall these rules? This allows Congress to exercise their authority over the agencies and the administration and the executive branch interaction where they make rules. Many times they do these rules, as this previous administration did, at the last minute, as they are heading out the door, trying to put their thumb and their imprint on actions and prohibit Congress or prohibit the States from taking an action. So as we meet in this Chamber this week, we are going to take up H.J. Res. 43. H.J. Res. 43 is a resolution which will disapprove of one of these last minute rule changes that President Obama made as he was exiting his office. This one deals with title X funds and the grant allocations that come through title X funds. Now, title X funds were put in place to serve women and their healthcare needs, underserved women in underserved areas, and to make certain that there were provisions so that they could access women’s health and have access to preventive screenings, to annual immunizations, those checkups that they need to have each year. Many times these funds have been used by individuals who will say: We do women’s health and we also do abortion services. Now, what the rule would have done was to block the States and to take away their ability to go in and ask: Who is going to have access to these funds, and are we going to disallow them to go to entities that provide abortion services? So H.J. Res. 43 repeals the previous administration’s rule and it restores and gives back to the States the flexibility that they want and desire to have to distribute these title X grants under the parameters for which this program was designed. States should be able to offer family planning funds to providers that offer a full and complete range of healthcare services for women, but do not participate in elective abortions. Title X funds, outside of the Affordable Care Act, were intended to help keep patients healthy and to help them on the road to a better quality of life and better health outcomes, not to take away life. H.J. Res. 43 also redirects title X grant funds to other clinics comprised of local health departments, hospitals, and federally qualified health centers that seek to protect life and offer healthcare services to women. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 43, which repeals the previous administrative efforts which undermine State laws and restores to the States the title X grant program for its original purpose. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 30 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day. As You make available to Your people the grace and knowledge to meet the needs of the day, we pray that Your spirit will be upon the Members of this people’s House, giving them the richness of Your wisdom. May the power of Your truth and our faith in Your providence give them all the confidence they must have to do the work required for service to our Nation. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Ms. KELLY of Illinois led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, it is a bitter reality that universal human rights are under daily assault around the world. I rise today joining in celebration and in mourning with Chinese democracy activist Zhu Yufu. This past week, he turned 64, but he marked the occasion in prison. Zhu Yufu has devoted his life to promoting democracy and human rights, to the ire of Chinese authorities. In 2012, he was condemned to 7 years imprisonment on unjust charges. Since then, his health has deteriorated, made worse by denial of medical care and inhumane treatment. His family fears for his life. The poem that led to Yufu’s imprisonment is called ‘‘It’s Time.’’ I completely agree. It is time. It is time for the Chinese government to provide Zhu Yufu with proper medical treatment and humane care. More than that, it is time for the Chinese Government to release Zhu Yufu and political prisoners like him who are unjustly detained. It is time for the Chinese Government to recognize and support freedom of speech, assembly, thought, and belief. f 
PUT AMERICA FIRST INSTEAD OF THE KREMLIN (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, for the sake of our country, I was relieved that General Michael Flynn resigned from his post as National Security Adviser. Not only did he mislead the Vice President and the public on his secret conversations with the Russian government, he may have also violated Federal law. But what is just as concerning is that the Trump administration was aware of General Flynn’s misconduct weeks ago and did nothing about it. The American people deserve to know what President Trump knew, and when he knew it. And let me be clear: General Flynn’s resignation is not the end of the Trump administration’s shady ties to Russia. We still don’t know President Trump’s financial interests in Russia because he refuses to release his tax returns. We still don’t know the extent of Russia’s disturbing interference in our election because our calls for an investigation have been stonewalled. And we just learned that the Trump campaign was in regular conversation with Russian intelligence officials. President Trump’s coziness with Vladimir Putin is an urgent matter of national security. It is time that the Trump administration truly put America first, rather than the Kremlin. AMERICAN HEART MONTH (Mr. ROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize American Heart Month and the need to encourage and support one another to be proactive in preventative heart care. I would like to thank President Trump for honoring the tradition of dedicating February as American Heart Month so that we may continue our fight against heart disease and heart defects as a nation. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Every year, one in four deaths is caused by heart disease, and approximately 40,000 babies are born in the U.S. with a congenital heart defect, including myself. The good news is that heart disease can often be detected earlier and even prevented when we are proactive, make healthy choices, manage our health conditions, and keep up with our annual physicals. Communities, health professionals, and families can work together to create opportunities for people to make healthier life choices and to lessen the stigma and fear of simply going to the doctor. As this is American Heart Month, I encourage all Americans to use this month to raise awareness about heart disease and heart defects, and how we can prevent, treat, and cope with them, both at home and throughout our communities. Through the support of my family and friends, the guidance of my doctors, and the grace of God, I am blessed to be standing here to support those across our Nation who are affected in some way by heart disease and heart defects. My prayers and thoughts go out to every one of you. I ask my colleagues to join me in promoting American Heart Month so that we can all help save precious lives. 
WE OWE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s resignation is no substitute for answers to the serious questions that remain over President Trump’s questionable connections to Russia, to Vladimir Putin. Federal investigators believe that Flynn, who held secret communications with Russia’s Ambassador, could have been compromised, or even the subject of blackmail. The Justice Department disclosed this danger to the White House weeks ago, yet the President allowed Mr. Flynn to continue in his position as National Security Adviser, after having that information disclosed to them. This conduct could only be the tip of the iceberg. There are serious, unanswered questions that remain, and our 
national security is at stake. Americans deserve answers. Did the President or others know or direct Flynn’s secret communications with Russia? Why did the White House sit on its hands for weeks, even after being told its National Security Adviser could have been compromised? Were Trump campaign officials colluding with Russians? These are questions that the American people deserve answers to. We need a bipartisan, independent commission to examine these questions. The credibility of our government is at stake. Congress must act. 
VOTERS TRUST TRUMP, NOT THE MEDIA (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, despite the saturation of negative media coverage of President Trump, the people have spoken. A recent poll found that President Trump is thought more trustworthy than the news media. The administration is considered truthful by 49 percent of registered voters, but the media is less trusted than the administration, with only 39 percent finding it honest. So President Trump is more credible than the liberal national media. That is no surprise. If the media wants to increase their credibility, they should report the news fairly, objectively, and without malice. 
INHUMANE HUNTING TECHNIQUES ON WILDLIFE REFUGES IN ALASKA (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, so far, in 2017, Donald Trump and the Republicans have targeted women, immigrants, and health care. Now they are setting their sights on bear cubs, wolves, and coyotes. Republicans, in cahoots with the gun lobby and with trophy hunters, want to eliminate a rule that currently prohibits hunters from using brutal means to kill our majestic animals in Alaska’s 16 wildlife refuges. This rule prevents snaring and trapping bears, including cubs, hunting wolves in their dens, and shooting bears from helicopters, among other methods. Now, those opposed to the rule say that it hurts Alaska’s economy, but there is no evidence of that. In fact, big game hunting represents only 2 percent of wildliferelated recreation on our national wildlife refuges. Meanwhile, the National Park Service has estimated that wildlife watchers, those who go to see wildlife, not to shoot them, contribute $1 billion to the State’s economy. I ask you: Is a trophy on the wall really worth it? So please vote ‘‘no’’ on H.J. Res. 69 introduced by our colleague, Mr. YOUNG . 
b1215 GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN’S RESIGNATION (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for a nonpartisan, independent commission to immediately and thoroughly examine the influence in the 2016 election and at the Trump White House of the Russian Government. This House should have begun this critical oversight work immediately and served as a check on the White House to protect the American people, but it has failed to do so. The resignation of General Michael Flynn has raised far more questions than it answered, and it is not acceptable to simply sit on our hands or to say that somehow the only problem is the leaks that exposed this misconduct and not the misconduct itself. That won’t cut it. The American people deserve to know the full picture of Russia’s involvement in the election, of General Flynn’s communication with Russian officials, and why President Trump took no action for weeks after learning of General Flynn’s misconduct. Unfortunately, this administration’s idea of transparency is conducting sensitive national security discussions in the middle of a crowded MaraLago dining room in full view of his wealthy patrons. The American people deserve better. They deserve an independent, nonpartisan commission, and it is time for this House to do its job. 
POTENTIAL CRIMES AND COVERUPS (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump poses the greatest Presidential threat to our democracy since Richard Nixon. It is about the potential crimes and the potential coverup. Seventeen different intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russians interfered with the election in order to help Donald Trump. Top Trump cronies like Carter Page, Paul Manafort, and Michael Flynn all had regular communications with highlevel Russian intelligence agents at the same time they were engaging in hacking. The National Security Adviser resigned in disgrace because of illegal communication with the Russian Ambassador. The President refuses to denounce Vladimir Putin and continues to try to make Russia great again. Connect the dots. It is time for House Republicans to do their job and put country ahead of party. Join us in a bipartisan investigation of the White House. What did the President know, and when did he know it? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. SIMPSON ). The Chair would remind Members to avoid improper references to the President. 
TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the many veterans and the work that Congress is doing to support and represent them on the House floor this week. These are the heroes who keep us safe and secure each and every day. This week, this body passed a few important bills to streamline access to care for veterans as well as provide new and better opportunities for veteran owned businesses and veterans seeking employment. Last month, the unemployment rate for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans increased to 6.3 percent, marking the fourth time in the last 7 months that group’s percentage has been higher than the overall veteran unemployment rate. That means that about 211,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are still looking for work. That is 211,000 too many. That is why one of the bills we passed this week establishes a Federal program recognizing private businesses that employ veterans and engage in community service to help our veterans. Mr. Speaker, helping our Nation’s veterans who have sacrificed so much for us is a critical priority and remains one of the most important objectives of this Congress. I will continue to use my time and effort to fight for every opportunity to support them when they return home to give them the hero’s welcome they deserve. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, February 15, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER : Pursuant to the permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Clerk received the following message from the Secretary of the Senate on February 15, 2017, at 9:19 a.m.: That the Senate passed without amendment H.R. 255. That the Senate passed without amendment H.R. 321. With best wishes, I am Sincerely, KAREN L. H AAS. 
CONGRESS NEEDS TO SCRUTINIZE THE NEW ADMINISTRATION’S EXECUTIVE ORDERS (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the growing number of executive orders issued by President Trump and the silence from our House majority. President Trump has signed 12 executive orders in the first 5 weeks in office. Many, like the border wall, the Muslim ban, and the ACA sabotage order, are highly misguided and exceed the intent of the law. Congress has a constitutional duty to oversee and investigate the actions of the Executive. To date the House majority has said little and taken no action to oversee the Trump administration’s abuse of power through executive orders. When President Obama sat in the White House, the House majority called his administration every name under the sun. Agencies were closely scrutinized. Federal officials were regularly subject to hostile questioning. Where is the oversight, Mr. Speaker? Where is the criticism? What happened to limiting executive power? I hope my colleagues in the majority will uphold Congress’ constitutional duties and vigorously scrutinize President Trump’s actions and mounting abuse of power.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. SLAUGHTER ), the ranking member of the Rules Committee, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 123 provides for a rule to consider two Congressional Review Act resolutions which will undo burdensome and harmful regulations put into place by the Obama administration during the final hours of his Presidency. The rule brings before the House these resolutions so that Congress may remove, through the proper legislative process, rules promulgated by bureaucrats who remain unaccountable to the American people. This process allows those who are accountable—the elected Representatives in the Congress—to fight for their constituents’ rights and liberties. House Resolution 123 provides for a closed rule for each of the Congressional Review Act resolutions, both H.J. Res. 43 and H.J. Res. 69, the standard procedure for such resolutions, since the sole purpose of each is to remove a harmful regulation from the Federal Register. The rule allows for 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the majority and the minority leader or their designees, for H.J. Res. 43, and 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the Chair and the ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources, for H.J. Res. 69. On each resolution contained in the rule, the minority is afforded the customary motion to recommit. H.J. Res. 43 is a joint resolution which would repeal the Obama administration’s midnight rule that takes away States’ ability to direct funding within their own borders to certain healthcare providers that conform to the States’ values. In her final days in office, Secretary Mathews Burwell pushed forward a rule that would require States to fund, with public dollars, facilities that perform abortions, potentially against the will of the people of that given State. This flies in the face of the 10th Amendment which grants to States the authority to make such decisions within their borders and to prioritize which healthcare providers should receive funding based on the greatest need in their own communities. Those of us who care about the carefully crafted Federal system which our Founding Fathers set up, which allows different States to operate differently based upon their own values and priorities, recognize the Obama rule for what it is: a power grab by the Federal Government. This is why the House will take up this resolution today—to continue to fight for states’ rights— and will repeal this burdensome regulation that ties the hands of every State legislature and ties the hands of every Governor in the Nation. H.J. Res. 69 is a Congressional Review Act resolution to repeal an overreaching regulation by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service which usurps Alaska’s ability to manage its own lands within its own borders. Federal law has long recognized that Alaska—that Alaska—and her elected officials are in the best position to make the decisions on what actions to permit on the public lands in that State, whether those lands are Federal, State, or private. Despite this long precedent, codified by Congress in the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act, the Obama administration moved forward in its waning days with a rule that imposes Federal restrictions on lands that have been, up until the end of the Obama administration, successfully regulated by the State of Alaska. Like H.J. Res. 43, this resolution recognizes the important 10th Amendment protections put in place by the Founding Fathers in our Constitution which protects states’ rights to govern within their own borders. 
The Congressional Review Act is an important tool in maintaining accountability at the Federal level. Its necessity has never been more apparent than over the past few weeks where this Congress has needed to step in and remove burdensome and unbalanced regulations put in place by President Obama and his team just as they were walking out the door. House Republicans today will stand up for the rights of our constituents against an outofcontrol Federal bureaucracy. I urge my colleagues to support today’s rule and the two underlying Congressional Review Act resolutions. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank my colleague from the Rules Committee for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Before I start, I include in the RECORD a letter from over 20 healthcare provider organizations regarding the danger of cutting certain providers off from title X funding because they also provide abortion with private funds. 
FEBRUARY 3, 2017. Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL , Senate Majority Leader, Washington, DC. Hon. CHARLES SCHUMER , Senate Minority Leader, Washington, DC. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. NANCY PELOSI , Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARLEADER MCCONNELL , SPEAKER RYAN, LEADER SCHUMER AND LEADER PELOSI : As or ganizations representing health care and public health professionals and the people they serve across the country, we strongly oppose any effort to prevent Planned Parenthood health centers from participating in federal health programs, including Medicaid and the Title X family planning program. Any proposal to exclude Planned Parenthood from public health programs will severely curtail women’s access to essential health care services, including family planning, wellwoman exams, breast and cervical cancers screenings, and HIV testing and counseling. At a time when there is much uncertainty about the future of affordable health care in our country, it is dangerous to cut off access to the lifesaving preventive care that Planned Parenthood provides to some of our nation’s most vulnerable patients. Planned Parenthood health centers play a crucial role in improving the health and lives of people across the country. In fact, 2.5 million women, men and young people rely on Planned Parenthood for health care every year. For many women, Planned Parenthood is their only source of care—offering basic preventive services that are fundamental to women’s health and wellbeing. More than 50% of Planned Parenthood health centers are in areas with health professional shortages, rural or medically underserved areas. In 2014 alone, Planned Parenthood health centers provided nearly 400,000 cervical cancer screenings and more than 360,000 breast exams. Additionally, Planned Parenthood provides contraceptive services for over 2 million patients and more than 4 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. These services improve women’s health, prevent an estimated 579,000 unintended pregnancies, and decrease infant mortality. Policies that would exclude Planned Parenthood from public health funding would hurt millions of patients and undermine health care access in communities across the country. Limiting access to Planned Parenthood’s approximately 650 health care centers across the country would prevent patients from having timely access to basic preventive health care services. Approximately 60 percent of Planned Parenthood patients access care through Medicaid and Title X, in addition to those who rely on other essential programs, including maternal and child health programs and Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) breast and cervical cancer screening programs. In some states, Planned Parenthood is the only provider participating in Title X, and more than 50 percent of Planned Parenthood health centers are located in a medically underserved or health professional shortage area. Because federal law already requires health care providers to demonstrate that no federal funds are used for abortion, prohibitions on funding for preventive care at Planned Parenthood health centers will only devastate access to these lifesaving services. In addition to limiting patients access to health care, defunding Planned Parenthood is not cost effective. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that approximately 390,000 women would lose access and up to 650,000 patients could face reduced access to preventive health care within a year should Congress act to block all Medicaid patients from receiving care at Planned Parenthood health centers. The CBO also projects that excluding Planned Parenthood health centers from receiving reimbursement through the Medicaid program would result in a net cost to taxpayers of $130 million over 10 years because of the increase in unintended pregnancies without the contraceptive care provided by Planned Parenthood. Other publicly funded health centers would not be able to compensate for the loss of affordable family planning and reproductive health care services provided by Planned Parenthood. Every day, we see the harmful impact that unequal access to health care has on women and communities across the country, and we therefore strongly support policies that improve access to affordable, quality health care. Policies that would deny Planned Parenthood public health funds only serve to cut millions off from critical preventive care, and we strongly oppose any effort to do so. We also recognize this as part of a broader effort to undermine access to safe, legal abortion and curtail access to other reproductive health care by limiting the ability of abortion providers to participate in public health programs.

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from myself and 161 other Members to Speaker RYAN opposing the Republican majority’s efforts to undermine title X family planning programs and women’s access to health care. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , Washington, DC, February 14, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House of Representatives, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARSPEAKER RYAN: We write to express our grave concern for efforts to undermine Title X family planning. Despite promises to focus on jobs and the economy, Republicans have started the 115th Congress with a total assault on women’s choices, access to care, and economic security by: Charging ahead to sabotage and dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA) while making no promises to preserve vital protections for women; Providing little to no details on their plans to replace ACA, while making a point to announce that their ACA repeal package will block access to Planned Parenthood, a high quality, longtrusted provider of reproductive health services; Rushing to impose and dramatically expand the global gag rule, harming women around the world; and Advancing the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act (H.R. 7) through the House, effectively banning private insurance companies from covering comprehensive reproductive health services. Now, with their most recent effort to weaken the Title X national family planning program through the Congressional Review Act, Republicans have demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to limit women’s access to vital health care. Sadly, this includes contraception and family planning services that all women need. For more than 40 years, Title X has served as a cornerstone of safetynet care. As the only dedicated source of federal funding for family planning, Title X allows a diverse network of providers to deliver highquality care to lowincome, uninsured, or underinsured individuals and to those seeking confidential care. In 2014 alone, Title Xfunded clinics helped prevent approximately 904,000 unintended pregnancies, 326,000 abortions, and 439,000 unplanned births. In addition to direct clinical care, Title X also supports critical infrastructure needs for health centers, including new medical equipment and staff training that are not reimbursable under Medicaid and commercial insurance. This infrastructure is vital to ensuring safe, quality care at health centers which serve and provide basic health services to high need populations. Throughout both Democratic and Republican administrations, Title X has been interpreted to prohibit state actions that block providers or classes of providers from participating in a Title X project based on factors unrelated to a provider’s qualifications to perform the required services. The networks include providers ranging from state, county, and local health departments as well as hospitals, family planning councils, Planned Parenthood affiliates, federally qualified health centers and other private nonprofit organizations. In fact, in instances when states have passed laws to 
limit provider participation in Title X, federal courts have consistently held that those state laws are contrary to, and preempted by, federal law. In response to a growing number of states targeting family planning providers for exclusion from key federal health programs, including Title X, the previous Administration proposed the regulation ‘‘Compliance with Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting Subrecipients.’’ The regulation, which was finalized in December 2016, helps ensure patient access to family planning services and supplies through qualified providers by reiterating that ‘‘no recipient making subawards for the provision of services as part of its Title X project may prohibit an entity from participating for reasons other than its ability to provide Title X services. During the rulemaking process, the Department of Health and Human Services received more than 145,000 comments, the vast majority of which supported the rule. Women across the United States, and the men who support them, have had enough. It is unconscionable that this common sense clarification has become a political football for members of Congress who want to limit women’s access to comprehensive reproductive health care. We urge you to stand in support of women and oppose this assault on contraceptive access and care.

b1230 Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, the majority is in the midst of an unprecedented and relentless assault on women’s health—and many other regulations while we are at it—that are being overturned every day here. Although it pledged to govern by prioritizing jobs and the economy, the majority is, instead, escalating its war on women with H.J. Res. 43, a dangerous continuation of its neverending crusade against access to health care for women. The majority started the 115th Congress by moving quickly to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act, a law that finally barred insurance companies from treating women as being a preexisting condition. Without this law, women once again would pay a higher rate for coverage than men. Think about that for a moment. If everybody doesn’t know it, before this law, single women paid from 10 to 57 percent more than men for their health insurance in States that allowed gender rating. A lot of people don’t understand this, but it costs American women nearly a billion dollars every year. But Republicans are rushing to repeal the Affordable Care Act without anything to take its place. The majority has also advanced H.R. 7, a sweeping bill that would go beyond even the Hyde amendment, a 40year provision that has been around for four decades too long. This legislation wouldn’t just make this amendment permanent; it would also place unprecedented limits on women’s access to reproductive health services even if they wanted to pay out of their own pockets to access constitutionally protected abortion services. These moves by the majority, along with the President signing a dramatic expansion of the global gag rule immediately after taking office, have brought millions of people pouring into the streets in protest. During the National Women’s March, millions of people marched all across the country and even around the globe to defend women’s rights. These marches were likely the largest day of protests in American history. More than half a million people took to the streets right here in the Nation’s Capital. They were peaceful, without a single arrest reported anywhere in the country. Far from respecting those rights, the majority is today considering a measure that marks an entirely new front in their war against women’s rights. This is the most serious threat facing women so far in this Congress, and it is only February. Programs supported by title X help provide lifesaving preventative healthcare services like contraception, cancer screening, and STD testing to the men and women who need them most. It is outrageous that the majority today is trying to allow conservative State legislatures to pick and choose who can provide this essential care with Federal money. That is one of the worst things in the world. The luck of the draw of where you live will determine whether or not you have access that is entitled to all people from the Federal money. This would threaten health centers from coast to coast. Mr. Speaker, we are facing the same problem today we faced for a very long time: men in blue suits and red ties determining what women can and should do when it comes to their own health. They believe the majority of persons— women—in the United States are incapable of making their own decisions. Do you think that about your own mother or your wife? Because Washington, D.C., is controlled by this Republican majority, the stakes for women are higher today than they have been in generations, as we turn over laws passed by the elected government of the District of Columbia. Mr. Speaker, Republican leaders in Congress turn a deaf ear to the majority of Americans who oppose this dramatic government intervention into women’s health care. They, unfortunately, have the votes to pass it, but they will have to reckon with the overwhelming majority of the public who understands it is time for the government to get out of the business of taking away women’s healthcare rights. Mr. Speaker, let me take a personal moment to speak about the departure of a longtime member of my staff on the Rules Committee. I have always believed that this committee is like family and that we have one of the most respected staffs on Capitol Hill. Adam Berg, the deputy staff director and counsel on the Democratic staff personifies this. After a decade of working for the Rules Committee, Adam is beginning a new chapter on a different committee in the House of Representatives. His knowledge and guidance these last years have been immeasurable. During his time here, he has married his wife, Erika, who is beautiful and talented, and became a father to his daughter, Ariel, who was singing songs with her mother at the age of 3 months. That is a precocious child. Adam has played a key role as this committee brought landmark legislation to the floor of the House, including DoddFrank, the Affordable Care Act, and legislation to raise the Federal minimum wage. 
The committee wouldn’t have been as effective without Adam’s counsel, and he will be greatly missed. I wish him nothing but the best in his new endeavor. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ). Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule, which would enable States to discriminate against healthcare providers and deny women access to critical healthcare services. This rule would put the only Federal program exclusively dedicated to family planning and reproductive health services in jeopardy. It reverses the Health and Human Services title X rule prohibiting discrimination against title X healthcare providers. It would have devastating healthcare consequences. In 2015, 88 percent of patients at title X clinics received subsidized or no charge care, and many of these clinics provide primary health care in addition to family planning services. This could upend public health networks in communities across the country. Supporters of this amendment claim that other health providers can absorb the clients who would lose access to their title X clinics. This is false. Community healthcare centers have said that they do not have the capacity, and they are often not located near these patients. We need to protect these healthcare providers. We need to uphold our responsibility to the American people to provide critical services to those who need them. I cannot and will not support this rule or this resolution. It is detrimental to women’s health in this country. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I do want to point out that H.J. Res. 43 would repeal the Obama administration’s rule and allow States to enjoy the freedom and flexibility to distribute title X grant money in a way that serves the needs of their constituents. Just in the way of background, December 16, 2016, the Obama administration finalized a rule that prevents States from eliminating abortion providers from title X grant distributions. Title X is a family planning program authorized in 1970, and was intended to provide family planning services to lowincome women. The Obama rule was widely perceived as an attempt by the Obama administration to require States to fund Planned Parenthood, the Nation’s largest abortion business. Prior to the Obama administration’s rule, States were free to direct their title X funds to healthcare providers that did not participate in abortion. When States had this freedom, they were able to choose to invest in women’s health care instead of investing in Big Abortion. States should be able to choose to prioritize family planning funds to health clinics that offer a full range of healthcare services, including family planning, but do not participate in abortion. States can fully support family planning and other health services without funding abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood only comprises 13 percent of approximately 4,100 title X service sites. Redirecting funds away from abortion providers does not reduce funds for the title X program. When States set criteria that eliminates abortion providers from title X distributions, those funds are then directed to other clinics. Eightyseven percent of current title X service sites are comprised of local health departments, local hospitals, and Federally qualified health centers. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1
1⁄2minutes. Mr. Speaker, I think I need to make this point one more time. I really believe that everybody in this House understands that not a dime of Federal money is used for abortions. It never has been, never will. There is meticulous care taken by Planned Parenthood to separate those funds. They have never been questioned in any way by the IRS as to how those funds are being used. I am sick and tired of everybody saying you can’t give anything to Planned Parenthood. The money that goes to Planned Parenthood from this Federal Government goes to reimburse for services rendered for the things I had talked about before: cervical cancer tests, cancer tests of all sorts, and health care that they cannot get anywhere else, such as screening for STDs. That is totally separate. Yet, that fable that Federal money is used for abortions if you fund Planned Parenthood is totally false. I think it is time that grownups that can read in the House of Representatives do away with that notion. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CA´RDENAS ). Mr. CA´RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against this rule and H.J. Res. 69, which we will be debating tomorrow. Last year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service updated its regulations for national wildlife refuges in Alaska to prohibit the cruelest killing methods of wolves, grizzly bears, and other native mammals in Alaska. The rule FWS put forward makes sense. It even makes clear that it does not apply to subsistence hunting or restrict the taking of wildlife for public safety purposes or in defense of property. Yet, here we are, just 6 months later, and Republicans are pushing through this resolution to overturn the rule and make egregious and cruel hunting methods common practice in Alaska. They are inhumane methods, such as denning of wolves and their pups, using airplanes to scout and shoot grizzly bears, and trapping grizzly bears with steeljawed traps. These cruel methods should never be allowed anywhere. This resolution is irresponsible and inhumane. As with other Congressional Review Act resolutions, H.J. Res. 69 will have a chilling effect. This and future administrations would be prohibited from ever issuing a similar rule, making inhumane and reprehensible hunting methods the law of the land. This resolution handcuffs our Federal wildlife managers from protecting our refuges, our national resources, and our wildlife. We must ensure that our children and grandchildren will someday enjoy the majestic national beauty of the native mammals in Alaska and across our great Nation. I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and also vote ‘‘no’’ on H.J. Res. 69. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I reference a letter that was sent to Speaker PAUL RYAN and Majority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY by a number of sportsrelated organizations. They say: ‘‘We write representing organizations that collectively include millions of wildlife conservationists . . . wildlife enthusiasts, and wildlife scientists, in strong support of H.J. Res. 49 from Cong. YOUNG of Alaska. . . . Our community exhausted all Executive Branch appeals and remedies urging the FWS to slow down the Proposed Rule, and revise it to reflect a proposal mutually agreed to by the State of Alaska and the FWS; all to no end. It is time for Congress to nullify this final rule.’’ They go on to say: ‘‘This final rule boldly preempts the authority of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to manage wildlife for both recreational and subsistence hunting on NWRs, which authority of the state is affirmed by Congress in the Alaska Statehood Act, the Alaska National Interests Land Conservation Act, and the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act. The FWS final rule was premised on a meeting as a priority the FWS policy on Biological Integrity, Diversity and Environmental Health. . . . Many members of our organizations enjoy Alaska’s bounty of fish and wildlife resources and their habitats for unrivaled hunting, fishing and outdoor experiences. The sustainable management of these natural resources needs to be led by the State working in cooperation with the FWS. We urge that you favorably consider H.J. Res. 49 which will restore the jurisdictional statefederal relationship as Congress has previously directed.’’ Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1245 Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. PANETTA ). 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against restricting the family planning services that are provided by title X. Just prior to signing title X into law, back in 1970, President Richard Nixon recognized how essential family planning was to public health. He actually sent a message to Congress telling them, ‘‘no American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition.’’ Last year, Mr. Speaker, President Obama reaffirmed that sentiment by making family planning services a part of basic health care, regardless of where one lives. Although Presidents Nixon and Obama couldn’t be more divided in their politics, even they were united behind title X. I believe this is understandable, considering how title X ensures basic preventive health care and family planning services for 4 million lowincome people every year. In my district, title X family planning services saves an average of $7 on Medicaidrelated costs for every dollar of Federal investment. That means that clinics in my district, like Mar Monte, are able to help more women and men receive a full range of healthcare services. Rather than restricting family planning clinics, we should be promoting, we should be protecting, and we should be preserving access to those vital services, especially for those families that value and need it most. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter written to the Honorable Sylvia Mathews Burwell signed by 110 Members of the House and Senate to express strong opposition to the Department of Health and Human Services’ September 7, 2016, notice of proposed rulemaking titled ‘‘Compliance with Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting Subrecipients.’’ 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , Washington, DC, September 23, 2016. Hon. SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL , Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC. DEARSECRETARY BURWELL , We write to express our strong opposition to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) September 7, 2016, notice of proposed rulemaking titled ‘‘Compliance with Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting Subrecipients.’’ Although we appreciate the Department’s intent to follow proper regulatory procedure pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, HHS’s purpose for engaging in the rulemaking appears on its face to be an attempt to subvert the will of elected representatives. Moreover, apart from the Department’s impetus for the notice of proposed rulemaking, we also question whether the Department’s stated rationale adequately supports its conclusion that providers with a reproductive health focus are more ‘‘effective’’ than other health providers that offer comprehensive care for women and men. Nowhere in the proposed notice of rulemaking does HHS clearly define what it means to provide Title X services in an ‘‘effective’’ manner. It does appear to assert that a number of factors—such as the range of contraceptive methods onsite, the number of clients in need of publicly funded family planning services served, and the availability of preconception care—distinguish providers with a reproductive health focus as more ‘‘effective’’ and ‘‘high quality’’ than other types of providers. However, that list of factors falls far short of all of the attributes and recommendations included in the Centers for Disease Control and Office of Population Affairs report entitled ‘‘Providing Quality Family Planning Services: Recommendations of CDC and the US Office of Population Affairs.’’ To further complicate the argument about quality and effectiveness, the data cited in the notice of proposed rulemaking is not adequate for determining patient outcomes. The Department relies heavily on utilization and demographic statistics, but appears to lack hard data regarding actual patient outcomes and need, as the Department does not require grantees to track patients or verify their income. As you know, the issue of inadequate data has previously been raised by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), after the HHS Office of Family Planning in 2007 asked IOM to provide a critical review of the Title X Family Planning Program. In addition to finding ‘‘no clear, evidencebased process for establishing or revising program priorities and guidelines,’’ IOM stated the following in its May 2009 Report Brief: ‘‘The committee concludes that the program does not collect all the data needed to monitor and evaluate its impact. Therefore, the committee proposes a comprehensive framework to evaluate the program and assess how well clinics meet the family planning needs of the program’s clients. The committee concludes that additional data will be needed in the areas of client needs, structure, process, and outcomes in order to assess the program’s overall progress.’’ We welcome evidence that this recommendation has been fully adopted, but are unaware of any clear evidence confirming that to be the case. If HHS cannot clearly define an ‘‘effective’’ or ‘‘high quality’’ provider, it is unclear to us how state and local project grantees are supposed to do so in order to comply with this proposed rule. It is also therefore unclear how HHS will be able to accurately determine in every case whether state or local project recipients—who are generally closer to and more familiar with subrecipients and the patient base in their geographical region—have considered inappropriate criteria in evaluating subrecipients. Rarely do the American people benefit when the federal government attempts to substitute its judgment for that of state or local governments—particularly when the criteria used to inform that judgment are unclear, and that judgment is not supported by coherent and impartial facts. Finally, if HHS is going to assert the authority to adapt its rules in order to address changing circumstances, we implore HHS to consider the recent general shift in health care policy toward comprehensive care. As HHS states on its website, in addition to assisting individuals and couples in planning and spacing births, part of the mission of Title X is to contribute to ‘‘improved health for women and infants.’’ HHS’s suggestion that subrecipients like federally qualified health centers—which provide greater preventive and primary health care services than providers with a reproductive health focus—are per se less ‘‘effective’’ than providers with a reproductive health focus does not comport with that stated mission. We urge HHS to reconsider this overreaching and illsupported rule. We will continue to closely monitor this proposed rulemaking, and intend to submit this letter as a formal comment. We look forward to a detailed response from your Department. Sincerely, JONIK. E RNST , United States Senator. DIANE BLACK , United States Congressman.

Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SLAUGHTER. I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Mr. Speaker, we are deeply concerned by reports from our intelligence community regarding the foreign interference in our most recent election. The fears have only been compounded by the troubling revelations published in The New York Times last night that members of the Trump campaign had been in frequent contact with Russian intelligence officials during that campaign. Mr. Speaker, the future of our democracy is at stake. We are seeing the 
same kinds of things that have happened all over Europe, as governments have been changing away from democracies. It is at stake here, and it is time this Republicancontrolled Congress does its job and gets to the bottom of this. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative SWALWELL ’s and Representative CUMMINGS ’ bill which would create a bipartisan commission to investigate foreign interference in our 2016 election. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I recently had the privilege of meeting hundreds of constituents who traveled from Rochester, New York, to Washington, D.C., for the Women’s March on Washington. Some of them came with three generations, and it was most impressive, but it is troubling to me that we are fighting many of the same battles that were fought and won generations ago. The unprecedented marches and rallies that have been happening are necessary because of efforts like this to continually chip away at women’s healthcare rights. The sad reality is that politicians have always worked to put up new roadblocks between women and their health care. It has always been my personal belief that when faced with a decision that needs to be made about a pregnancy, a woman should consult whomever she chooses— certainly her husband, her spiritual adviser, her medical adviser, but no one wants to wait in the room until a Congressperson gets there to make the final decision. We are going way beyond our depth to try to make that decision for persons. The government should not be in the business of doing that. The majority has made attacking women’s constitutional rights the first order of business this year, working alongside our new President, and it is shameful. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, the other measure before us today would repeal the Alaska predator rule which protects the interests of all Americans in national wildlife refuges while banning some of the most inhumane tactics for killing, like killing black bears from an airplane and killing coyote pups in their dens. We should be listening to scientists who study and understand these species, not an ideological minority that sees every animal with teeth as a threat to civilization and a potential addition to their trophy hunting collection. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX). Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, in a time when so many Americans are looking for ideas and policies we can unite around, one point of agreement stands out. There is strong consensus among Americans that they do not want their taxpayer dollars being used to fund abortions. A Marist poll released in January revealed that 61 percent of Americans feel this way. States have always had the freedom to direct funds away from abortion providers, such as the Nation’s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, and there are many reasons States may wish to do so. The most important reason, one that we should all carefully consider, is that abortion is not health care. Abortion takes the lives of unborn children and hurts women. Many States have recognized this tragic reality and, as a result, have chosen to award funds to health clinics and organizations that do not provide abortions. But in December, the Obama administration issued a regulation that forces many States to drastically alter their previous course of action. The regulation requires States to include abortion providers as recipients of title X grant distributions. Not only does this regulation ignore the American people’s wish that their tax dollars be directed away from abortion providers, it also denies States the flexibility to choose to allocate title X funds in a way that meets the needs of their citizens. H.J. Res. 43 disapproves of this unacceptable regulation, allowing States to return to the status quo under which they were operating prior to the rule’s issuance. If States wish to disburse title X funds away from abortion providers, that wish should be respected. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this rule and H.J. Res. 43. Mr. BURGESS. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today’s rule provides for the consideration of two critical Congressional Review Act resolutions to repeal burdensome Federal regulations dropped on the doorstep of the American people in the waning hours of the Obama administration. The rules the House will be voting to repeal today would infringe upon states’ rights to govern themselves within their own borders and would impose new Federal requirements and oversight in contravention of the 10th Amendment. This is why removing these regulations is critical. It is critical to maintaining the proper State Federal balance that our Founding Fathers so carefully crafted in our Constitution. I thank Representative DIANE BLACK  and Representative DONYOUNG for their work on these pieces of legislation to protect states’ rights. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the rule and ‘‘yes’’ on the two underlying resolutions. The material previously referred to by Ms. SLAUGHTER is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 123 O FFERED BY  MS. SLAUGHTER  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign Interference in the 2016 Election. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 356. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the 
Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 127 Resolved, That the following named Members be and are hereby elected to the following standing committees of the House of Representatives: (1) COMMITTEE ON ETHICS .—Mr. Cohen. (2) COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERN MENT REFORM .—Mr. Sarbanes. (3) COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS .—Mr. Schneider. 
The resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO DRUG TESTING OF UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION APPLICANTS Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 99, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 42) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to drug testing of unemployment compensation applicants, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 99, the joint resolution is considered read. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: 
H.J. R ES. 42 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to ‘‘FederalState Unemployment Compensation Program; Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 Provision on Establishing Appropriate Occupations for Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants’’ (published at 81 Fed. Reg. 50298 (August 1, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force or effect. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 42, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Next Wednesday, February 22, will mark 5 years since the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act was signed into law. This 2012 law has made important reforms in the unemployment insurance system, improvements that were specifically designed to help more outofwork Americans successfully return to the workforce. b1330 This included a key provision which overturned a 1960sera ban by the Department of Labor on drug screening and testing of unemployment insurance applicants. Unemployment insurance serves those that have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. It seeks to promote swift reemployment through several key requirements. Namely, to be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits, applicants must be able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work. So if a worker loses his or her job due to drug use, that worker is not truly able to work. In addition, if a worker cannot take a new job because they can’t pass a mandatory drug test from their employer, this worker is not truly available to work either. In recognition of this issue, the 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act allowed but did not require States to drug screen and test certain unemployment applicants, specifically those seeking a job or an occupation that regularly required new employees to pass a drug test. I was proud to lead this effort in 2012 because I knew it would have a meaningful impact on the lives of many Americans struggling with drug use. The goal is simple: get the incentives right in unemployment insurance so that Americans can confront and overcome these challenges. With a growing number of employers now requiring drug tests for new workers, we wanted to empower these out 
ofwork Americans to be ready to pass that drug test, take that new job, and get back on the path to earning their own success. My home State of Texas was one of the first to step up when this provision was established by the 2012 law. They even changed their own laws to get ready. But before this provision could be implemented by States, the law required the Department of Labor to issue a regulation defining those occupations that regularly conduct drug testing. The intent was to match real world expectations from employers. In a 2012 hearing of the Committee on Ways and Means’ Human Resources Subcommittee, an official from the Department of Labor assured us the rule could be drafted quickly and according to congressional intent. Well, despite those assurances, months went by with no action from the Obama administration. During that time, the Ways and Means Committee held another hearing on this issue and even sent a letter to the Department of Labor in anticipation of the regulation. We urged them to craft the rule broadly, which was consistent with what we were hearing from businesses. In October of 2014, more than 2 years after the law was passed, the Department issued its proposed rule. Counter to our recommendations, the draft rule was incredibly narrow. So narrow, in fact, that States like Texas would be severely limited in their ability to successfully implement an unemployment insurance drug testing program. Again, the Ways and Means Committee made our concerns known to the Obama administration by submitting a public comment on the draft rule, calling for significant revisions. We made clear that the proposed rule did not faithfully adhere to the intent of Congress, and these same concerns were also echoed in other public comments from prominent stakeholders. Two more years went by. Meanwhile, Congress continued to press the administration to revise the rule so it followed the intent of the bipartisan law. That brings us to August of last year, when, at long last, the Department of Labor published its final rule. And just like the proposed rule 2 years earlier, it ignored the intent of Congress. It disregarded most of the comments and the concerns of stakeholders. Above all, the final rule directly undermined the ability of States to implement this important bipartisan reform that would help unemployed workers in their quest to find a goodpaying new job. So on his way out of office, former President Obama flat out refused to implement the law he signed in 2012. Instead, he directed the Department of Labor to issue a regulation that effectively blocks States from taking action. Mr. Speaker, the American people are sick of Washington not keeping its promises. They are sick of unaccountable Federal bureaucrats abusing their authority to undercut the will of Congress and the American people. And this eleventhhour regulation by the Obama Department of Labor is a prime example of just that. The debate we are having today is not about the merits of drug testing unemployment insurance applicants. That is now for the States to decide because, in 2012, Congress passed a law providing them—not the Federal Government—with the ability to do so. This debate is about placing a check and balance on blatant executive overreach that all but prohibits States from moving forward with this reform. More importantly, it is about ensuring that the will and the intent of this body is upheld. In closing, I thank the House for its consideration of H.J. Res. 42. I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH) be permitted to control the remainder of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 42, a measure disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor regarding drug testing unemployment compensation applicants. This legislation would overturn a Department of Labor regulation which, as directed by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, defines the occupations in which States may require unemployed workers to take drug tests as a condition of collecting earned unemployment benefits. Consistent with the Fourth Amendment, which protects us against searches without reasonable cause, the regulation limits drug testing to occupations where drug testing is required, like pipeline safety, some transportation operators, and jobs that require carrying a gun. Many communities are facing a rising rate of drug use, including my hometown of Springfield. Congress could and should do more to help people struggling with addiction, but the legislation that we are debating today has nothing to do with fighting drug abuse. It is about allowing States to put one more timeconsuming, humiliating obstacle in the way of Americans who work hard and were laid off from their jobs and need unemployment insurance to pay the bills while they look for new jobs. As a reminder, in the aftermath of the recession, the unemployment rate in America went to 10 percent. There is no evidence that unemployed workers have higher rates of drug abuse than the general population. In fact, logic suggests that rates of serious drug abuse are lower. To be eligible to collect unemployment, a worker must have substantial, recent work experience. He or she must not have been fired for cause. And workers can only collect unemployment insurance if they demonstrate they are actively searching for work. Instead, it appears that some States may be trying to limit the number of workers who collect unemployment insurance when they are laid off as a way to reduce pressure on underfunded unemployment trust funds. More than half of the State unemployment trust funds are still insolvent, years after the Great Recession. Dozens of States have changed their eligibility criteria for unemployment benefits, imposed administrative hurdles to filing for unemployment, or cut the number of weeks benefits can be received while individuals search for a job. Partly because of those changes, only about one in four unemployed workers in the United States receive unemployment benefits, even though the vast majority of them worked for employers who paid unemployment payroll taxes on their wages. That is the lowest level of benefit receipt among laidoff workers since the FederalState unemployment insurance program began. Instead, we should be here crafting bipartisan policies to strengthen unemployment insurance protections to help workers who genuinely want to work to pay their bills while they are looking for new jobs. I remind our colleagues to look at the worker participation rate, not encouraging States to create more obstacles. I hope that both sides of the aisle will vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. D AVIS) control the remainder of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 42 disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to drug testing of unemployment compensation applicants. The goal of the 2012 bipartisan law signed by President Obama in February 2012 is to reassure employers who fund the unemployment compensation system that unemployment compensation claimants reentering the workforce are truly able and available for work. When I speak with employers in Nebraska’s Third District, they express a strong desire to hire individuals in a way that is beneficial for both the employer and the employee. According to UWC, the national association representing businesses in the areas of unemployment compensation 
and workers’ compensation: ‘‘The regulations adopted in final form not only severely limited the circumstances under which a state may conduct a drug test, but also unduly limited the types of tests that a state would be permitted to conduct. . . .’’ States, which are responsible for administration of the unemployment compensation program, are also concerned. Back in 2014, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker wrote to the Secretary of Labor saying: ‘‘Providing States more flexibility in defining occupations that regularly conduct drug testing not only better serves the public interest, but recognizes the unique labor force and diversity in industry in each State.’’ In recognition of the support we have received from employers who fund the system and States which administer it, I include in the RECORD their letters of support. 
FEBRUARY 10, 2017. Hon. KEVIN BRADY , Chairman, House Ways and Means Committee, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN BRADY : We write to you today in support of H.J. Res. 42, your legislation that would disapprove of the United States Department of Labor’s recent regulation regarding states’ ability to drug test individuals who apply for unemployment insurance (UI). Congress authorized the Labor Department to craft a rule that would provide states the option to drug test unemployment insurance applicants. Unfortunately, the Obama Administration drafted the rule too narrowly, undermining the intent of Congress and permitting drug testing in too few instances. Drug testing UI applicants can help individuals suffering from substance abuse to access necessary care and treatment so they may reenter the workforce as healthy and productive members of society. We believe this rule should be replaced with a new rule that allows increased flexibility for states to implement UI drug testing that best fits the needs of each state. Thank you for introducing this important legislation and we look forward to working with Congress on this issue going forward. Sincerely, SCOTT WALKER , Governor of Wisconsin. GARYR. H ERBERT , Governor of Utah. GREGABBOTT , Governor of Texas. PHILBRYANT , Governor of Mississippi. 
STATE OF NEBRASKA , OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR , Lincoln, NE, February 14, 2017. Re H.J. Res. 42—Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Recipients. Hon. ADRIAN SMITH, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCONGRESSMAN SMITH: Thank you for being a cointroducer of House Joint Resolution 42. The regulations which H.J. Res. 42 seeks to disapprove greatly exceed the authority granted to the U.S. Department of Labor under Section 2105 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112–96). The U.S. Department of Labor regulations effectively limit the application of P.L. 112– 96 authorized drug testing to the point that a state is, for all practical purposes, prevented from adopting a meaningful drug testing program for unemployment compensation claimants. These regulations are an exhibit of executive overreach where the U.S. Department of Labor effectively seeks to block the implementation of an Act of Congress. I thank you for your efforts to restore to the states their right to enact drug testing requirements for unemployment compensation claimants. Sincerely, PETERICKETTS , Governor. 
UWC, Washington, DC, February 7, 2017. Hon. KEVIN BRADY , Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. RICHARD NEAL, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN BRADY AND RANKING MEMBERNEAL: I am writing on behalf of UWC— Strategic Services on Unemployment and Workers’ Compensation (UWC) in support of Resolution H.J. Res 42 that would disallow the final regulations posted by the United States Department of Labor on August 5, 2016. UWC is a national association representing business, specifically in the areas of Unemployment Compensation and Workers’ Compensation. UWC members include many Fortune 500 companies as well as business associations and small businesses impacted by unemployment law and policy. The regulations as posted in final form are inconsistent with the intent of Congress in enacting the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 and unduly restrict state agencies choosing to test applicants for the use of controlled substances. Drug testing is a critical requirement of employment in many industries and generally in determining whether a prospective employee will be able to perform the responsibilities of work for which the individual has applied. The results of drug tests are also indications of whether an individual is able to work and available to work so as to be eligible to be paid unemployment compensation. It is a federal statutory requirement of administrative grants to states that as a condition of being paid unemployment compensation for a week or weeks an individual must be able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work. The additional authority provided in Section 2105 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 permitted states to test for controlled substances consistent with the able to work and available to work requirements that were also included in the act. The regulations adopted by the U.S. Department of Labor were so narrowly drawn as to severely limit states from electing to provide for drug testing of applicants. By limiting the time within which a test may be conducted to the period between the date of application and the date at which the applicant began to claim a week of unemployment compensation, such a test would be less likely to connect a positive drug test with a subsequent week of unemployment compensation that could be claimed up to 52 weeks after the date of initial application. The effect of such an interpretation is to render a test useless for weeks claimed many weeks after the individual became unemployed and prohibit testing for the weeks of unemployment compensation as they are claimed. The regulations adopted in final form not only severely limited the circumstances under which a state may conduct a drug test, but also unduly limited the types of tests that a state would be permitted to conduct, the claimants that could be tested, and the occupations with respect to which tests could be conducted. A number of states have indicated an interest in enacting legislation consistent with federal law to permit drug testing, but the severe limitations imposed by the regulations have frustrated administration of drug testing as part of the UI administrative process. Employers pay the federal and state unemployment taxes required to fund administration and benefits paid through the Unemployment Insurance system. Drug testing of UI claimants should be permitted as part of proper administration by states to assure that only eligible claimants are paid and that unemployed workers are able and available to work to meet workforce needs of employers. Thank you for the opportunity to express our support for H.J. Res 42. Sincerely, DOUGLAS J. H OLMES , President. 
SECRETARIES ’ INNOVATION GROUP , Milwaukee, WI, January 31, 2017. KEVIN BRADY , Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN BRADY : I am writing you on the topic of drug screening and testing of Unemployment Insurance claimants in my capacity as the Executive Director of the Secretaries’ Innovation Group, after consultation with Texas Workforce Commission Executive Director Larry Temple and workforce secretary members of SIG on a recent national conference call. As you know, the Secretaries’ Innovation Group is a network of state workforce and human service secretaries from states with Republican governors making up about half of the country. We meet to exchange state program innovations and opportunities and to press for national policies favoring work, healthy families, federalism and limited government. By way of background, in 2012, the bipartisan Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act made a number of reforms to the UI program, including overturning a 1960s era DOL ban on the screening or testing of UI applicants for illegal drugs. The 2012 provision allowed (but did not require) states to test UI applicants who either (1) lost their job due to drug use, or (2) were seeking a new job that generally required new employees to pass a drug test. However, in implementing this law through regulation, DOL issued an overly prescriptive final regulation making it almost impossible for most states to implement the provision. Our SIG state secretaries who run UI, WIOA and welfare to work programs routinely meet with employers to seek their input as to what characteristics they require to meet their business needs. By far the most common stated requirements are requests for individuals who are reliable and can pass a drug test. Therefore it is highly important that states to have the ability and authority to operate drug screening and testing. It is also important they have the option to condition UI benefits on cooperation in such tests and to mandate treatment, if and when necessary, on a case by case basis. States do not have the ability to operate this way under the current restrictive regulation promulgated by the Department of Labor. During the national conference call with SIG workforce secretaries to discuss drug screening and testing which took place on 
January 24th and included TX, AL, AR, ID, KS, ME, MD, MS, NE, NM, NH, NV, ND, OH, OK, UT, WI, WY, none of the secretary participants endorsed the DOL rule in question as written. We hope the Congress will take up this issue and permit states who wish to do so the ability to implement screening and testing of UI claimants with the flexibility intended by Congress. Yours truly, JASON TURNER , Executive Director. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, as Chairman BRADY highlighted earlier, Members of this body have clearly stated their intent time and time again over the last few years through letters, hearings, public comments, and meetings. Yet, the Department of Labor has continued to push Congress’ concerns to the side and legislate from the executive branch. Supporting this resolution means supporting the role of Congress to write laws and for them to be implemented as intended. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Workers collecting unemployment benefits earned their benefits by working hard. Workers only receive benefits if they are out of work through no fault of their own and are actively searching for new jobs. There are considerable challenges facing our unemployment system. More than half of the State trust funds, including that in my home State, are insolvent and could only pay earned benefits for a short period of time if a recession hits. Only about one in four unemployed workers currently receives unemployment insurance benefits. Some States have cut benefits, increasing the chance that workers will exhaust benefits before finding jobs. H.J. Res. 42 does not address these challenges. There are also real problems with drug use in this country and a severe shortage of treatment options for those who need them. H.J. Res. 42 does not address these problems either. Instead, we are considering a policy that slanders unemployed workers by assuming that they are drug users; that ignores all research showing that drug use is not higher among unemployed workers than in the general population; and that violates the constitutional protection against illegal search and seizure, a protection that courts have clearly said exists regardless of whether one receives public benefits. The statutory provision that has required this regulation was appropriately limited to a very narrow group of workers, those for whom finding suitable work required a drug test. Counter to some GOP arguments, this resolution is not about helping those with drug problems get treatment. It is about cutting benefits. States with drugtesting provisions do not pay for expensive treatment services for those who test positive. Moreover, workers cannot receive benefits while in treatment because they are not actively seeking work. Thus, they lose their earned unemployment benefits. Congress should be helping communities suffering from high unemployment, addressing persistent longterm unemployment, aiding workers in upgrading their skills to get good jobs. Congress should be strengthening our unemployment insurance system to make sure it is ready to respond in the next recession. b1345 We should not encourage States to waste resources on an unconstitutionallybased drug testing requirements for struggling unemployed workers who claim benefits. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI ). Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 42. This resolution is the latest effort in the House to undo the wave of bureaucratic overreach from the Obama administration. Five years ago, Congress passed a bipartisan law that included a commonsense provision giving the States flexibility to drug test some applicants for unemployment insurance. Instead of following the law Congress passed and allowing—not requiring— States to implement the policies right for their citizens, the Obama administration decided to tie States’ hands. It issued a regulation that left no flexibility for States, the opposite of the bipartisan law Congress passed. Mr. Speaker, frankly, it is sad that we are even here today. This all could have been avoided if the Obama administration had simply followed the congressional intent, but yet here we are. I support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), former chairman of this committee and, certainly, a former ranking member on this side. (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, at the onset of the Great Recession, our unemployment insurance system was completely inadequate. Democrats took the lead, against increasing Republican opposition, to improve the system and to provide unemployment benefits to Americans who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. The result was an emergency Federal unemployment compensation program which helped more than 24 million people. Research from a broad array of experts shows these Federal UI benefits, in combination with Stateprovided benefits, saved more than 2 million jobs, prevented 1.4 million home foreclosures, and kept an estimated 5 million Americans out of poverty. In short, a strong unemployment insurance system helped prevent the Great Recession from turning into another Great Depression. Today, our unemployment insurance system is again inadequate and totally unprepared to respond to a future recession; and once again, rather than stepping up with solutions, Republicans’ answer to working people is a cold shoulder. Instead of responding to the deterioration of our unemployment insurance system, Republicans today want to shame and blame Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, while also violating their constitutional rights. Here are the real problems this legislation completely ignores: Number one, only one out of every four jobless Americans now receives unemployment benefits, near a record alltime low. Two, eight States have cut back on the maximum number of weeks of benefits available for unemployed workers, including my home State of Michigan. Three, the value of UI benefits has declined over time, with 30 States now having maximum UI benefits that are less than half of the State’s average weekly wage. Four, the triggers for the federally funded Extended Benefits program, EB, are extremely out of date, so they do not turn on when unemployment begins to rise significantly. Five, our Nation’s UI system is underfunded, with only 18 States’ funds reaching a minimum level of adequate solvency, according to a 2016 DOL report. Six, the Federal UI trust funds, which support extended benefits during downturns in the economy, have a deficit of over $8 billion, hurt by the majority’s decision to allow part of the revenue stream to those funds to expire in 2011. Seven, our spending on workforce development as a percentage of GDP is now only oneseventh of its 1979 peak; and since 2010, Republicans in Congress have cut workforce education programs by $400 million. So we are doing less to help the unemployed while they look for work and less to help them prepare for a new job. Today’s bill ignores these problems completely and, instead, attempts to demean those needing help. In discouraging access to unemployment benefits, it reminds me of a massive problem we have uncovered in Michigan that involved at least 20,000—and perhaps many more—UI claimants being wrongly accused of fraud and ordered to pay huge penalties. We should be focusing today on ensuring our UI system is ready for the great challenge, not to mention helping Americans who are seeking work right now. Instead, this majority has 
brought up this misguided bill, and I urge all Members to oppose it. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SMITH). Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 42, to eliminate the Obama administration’s intentionally unfaithful execution of our laws. Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, the previous administration knew exactly what they were doing when they wrote this regulation. President Obama signed off on the underlying law to allow States to drug test certain unemployment insurance recipients, then he worked to block its implementation. Today, we will vote to end President Obama’s obstruction. Instead of faithfully executing the law, as our Constitution demands, the Obama administration effectively blocked States from making sure hardworking taxpayer dollars only go to deserving citizens. The Congress spoke in 2012, before I arrived here, but here is what happened. Congress spoke, and the President signed a bill into law to give States an option—not a mandate, an option—to drug test. I stand today to say let’s roll back and undo our previous President’s unfaithful execution of the law and allow States like Missouri to have the freedom to decide for themselves. This is not a mandate; this is simply about states’ rights. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this joint resolution. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ), a tireless protector of the rights of individuals. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my strong opposition to H.J. Res. 42. I think most Americans are tired of hearing about what President Obama did or didn’t do while, at the same time, it seems like it has been years since we had his stable leadership and we have been proceeding under the chaos of the current administration. It seems like much longer than 25 days. But I will tell you, the campaign is over. It was a long campaign. Throughout the entire campaign, the Republicans controlled both Houses of Congress, House and Senate, and we had the President who was a Democrat. So the Republicans complained that they weren’t able to do anything and they needed a Republican President. Now they have a Republican President, and what have they done during this last 25 days in terms of a jobs bill? Not one, not one job created in the last 25 days. If the public goes back and looks over the calendar of proceedings for this body, they will find that it has simply been one regulatory bill after another, to change a regulation that was set during the Obama administration. That is all we have been doing over the last 3plus weeks is trying to reverse regulations—not one affirmative bill that establishes one job. So what are they doing? They are kind of dancing for the American people, while the House burns, while the President is conducting foreign policy at MaraLago, in the open air, to impress all of his wellheeled friends that have paid $100,000 and now have to pay $200,000 to join his club, while we should be overseeing the operations of the Trump Hotel and who is paying millions of dollars to reserve banquet facilities in that taxpayerowned location. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. JODYB. H ICEof Georgia). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Those are the issues that the American people certainly would be interested in knowing, what is happening with their property. But instead of creating a jobs bill, what we are dealing with here is a measure that would repeal a Department of Labor rule that limits which unemployment compensation applicants can be tested for drugs. Supporters of this resolution are suggesting that there is a nexus between losing your job and being unemployed and illicit drug abuse. However, there is no evidence that suggests higher drug use among unemployed workers compared to the general population; though I will concede that it has been a timehonored tradition that when you lose your job, you go down to the local bar and drown in a glass of beer. But nobody is talking about disabusing alcohol abuse with this legislation—no alcohol testing, just drug testing. Why? It is because they want to get at a certain group of people who they want to deprive of the ability to receive the unemployment compensation that they have paid in and earned. It is pennywise and poundfoolish to take away the financial security for people who have the least. That is the only thing they have, and you are going to take it away from them and make them pay for the drug test, too. It is ridiculous. We should be considering legislation that would create jobs and address economic disparities, but instead, we are looking to roll back provisions that undergird the financial security of the most vulnerable among us. I would ask that my colleagues oppose this H.J. Res. 42 and get on with the business that matters most to the American people. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO). Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 42, and I thank Chairman SMITH for taking the lead in fighting for American workers with this commonsense piece of legislation. I believe there has been a misconception about the intent of this CRA. Congress is not acting because we have a malicious intent to punish American workers. We are not even trying to disincentivize them from participating in the program. My colleague, Mr. DAVIS, said we should strengthen our programs, and what we are attempting to do is exactly that: strengthen the system that is intended to help unemployed Americans and allow them to prepare to reenter the workforce. The 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act made commonsense reforms to the unemployment insurance system with the goal of assisting Americans in returning to gainful employment. Yes, this included allowing States, like my own of Florida, to determine whether or not they wanted to include drug screening and test unemployment insurance applicants. And, yes, the law specifically stated two conditions: if the applicant had lost their job due to drug use and if they were seeking a new job that regularly required new employees to pass a drug test. Now, when the Department of Labor drafted the rule, they clearly went beyond the intent of Congress and tailored it too narrowly. This will only hurt prospective employees in the long term. The rule covers occupations such as those that require the employees to carry firearms, flight crews, transportation, and the like. b1400 The problem here is that employers in occupations outside of this narrow scope also regularly require drug testing of their employees. So under this rule, unemployed Americans who are using and looking for employment outside of the specific occupations outlined in the rule could potentially find employment in a different industry, be drug tested, and subsequently terminated. How is this helping American workers? It doesn’t make sense to me, and it shouldn’t make sense to any of my colleagues either. This is a bad rule, and it needs to be repealed so the Department of Labor can go back to the drawing board and craft a rule that will actually strengthen the unemployment insurance, help the American worker, and ultimately strengthen the economy. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE). Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Congressman DAVIS for yielding and for his tireless advocacy on behalf of the most vulnerable everywhere. I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 42, which is really another baseless attack on the poor, on lowincome individuals, and on the unemployed. Drug testing unemployed individuals is downright wrong. Let me be clear. This resolution is another way for Republicans to stop 
workers from claiming their right to unemployment benefits. It also is a scare tactic that flies in the face of facts. First, there is no evidence that people who receive public assistance use drugs any more frequently than those in the general population. Unemployment compensation, mind you, is not public assistance. By unnecessarily drug testing jobless workers, we are throwing them out in the cold when they are simply trying to get back on their feet. Mr. Speaker, workers receive unemployment benefits because they worked hard, they played by the rules, and they were laid off through no fault of their own. More importantly, working people have earned their right to apply for these benefits. They pay into the program. Their constitutional rights should not be violated. I also know that people want to work. People don’t want to be on unemployment insurance. They want to provide for themselves and their families. Let me remind you, there is an opioid and heroin drug epidemic in this country, and it not only affects Democrats, this drug crisis is affecting Republicans, Independents—everyone. Yet, once again, you are throwing them out in the cold. Instead of passing this appalling resolution—and this resolution is appalling—we should be expanding job training, unemployment benefits for all, and provide resources for drug treatment. It is hard to believe that you want to punish people. That is what this resolution really does. It punishes people for working. That is really a shame and disgrace. So I strongly oppose this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I also urge you to encourage people to work, to provide those job training resources and drug abuse resources for our mental health centers, for our drug counseling centers, and for everyone who needs treatment rather than drug testing to keep them from getting a job. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE) who had an office next to mine for many years. I know she has tremendous commitment, energy, and fortitude. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman, and I thank the manager of this legislation. But my distinguished friend, Mr. DAVIS, and I have worked on societal issues dealing across the gamut, and the respect that he holds in the communities across America that recognize that second chances, unemployment compensation, summer jobs, and a whole manner of opportunities for individuals to restore their lives is the right way for America to go. In the backdrop of an executive order that saw one of my constituents, a 16 yearold with proper papers coming in from Jordan, held for 50 hours at George Bush Intercontinental Airport, in defense of those employees that I respect, CBP, they had no information how he got in, but they took this young man. Lo and behold, he wound up in Chicago because he didn’t speak English, and that was the only bed they have. Why am I mentioning this? I am mentioning this because sometimes government gets it wrong. They get it wrong. This disapproval is wrong. What did happen was right, because what happened was that this rule didn’t just pop up in the administration, meaning the Obama administration. It came about through a compromise—an intelligent compromise— dealing with middle class tax relief and job creation. Because at that time, there were people who randomly wanted to drug test, but wise individuals said this, they said that you could allow drug tests if you had lost your job or you are a drug user, so we want to get you right; therefore, you could be tested. Some people agree to disagree, but that is reasonable. Or that the job that you were looking for or had a job that required the kind of criteria and the kind of skills that drug use would impair or impact, that makes sense. But now you are talking about someone at the lowest ebb of life, losing jobs through no fault of their own, giving States that may be sensitive to human needs or reckless the ability to randomly test people because they lost their jobs, because they have been defeated. Well, I know it is too late, but maybe we should amend for Congresspersons, Senators, and Governors who get unelected. They lost a job; didn’t they? It doesn’t make sense. I rushed to the floor. We are in the Judiciary Committee addressing the question of how we are going to utilize the oversight plan, whether we want to investigate and fix for the American people this horrible scenario of the Russian involvement in the elections and the connection to the present administration. We want to fix things, but what you are doing here is that you are casting a bad light on people who are in need. I just want to say States have the ability to administer drug testing, and this change would needlessly shift employer costs to the States. State unemployment programs already penalize jobrelated drug use. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. W EBSTER of Florida). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Twenty States also explicitly deny benefits for any job loss connected with drug use or a failed drug test. In addition, six States—Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin—passed legislation equating a failed or refused preemployment drug screen for refusing suitable work. We are already condemning everybody. Other States have other programs. This is not one that falls under the 10th Amendment. But the specialist drug testing of governmentbenefit recipients likely violates the Fourth Amendment, and it is cruel and inhuman treatment. I ask my colleagues to reject this cruel and inhuman treatment of individuals who, through no fault of their own, are unemployed or they may be poor or they may be needing public assistance. Let America’s humanity shine. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the bill. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I want to hopefully draw some attention to the fact that we have a problem on our hands. We have a problem with the Federal Government going too far, and we have a problem with the State governments coming to us as policymakers at the Federal level wanting to help their own constituents, their own citizens in need. Right now the Federal Government stands in the way. It is time for us as policymakers hopefully to act in a responsible fashion to assist States in their need and their desire to help their own citizens. States are better at that than is the Federal Government, and I hope that we can empower the States to help their own constituents. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, as I prepare to close, let me just, first of all, thank the more than 40 organizations who have sent letters in opposition to this legislation, especially the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African American Ministers in Action, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and many others. They have sent letters because they have a will to help, not a will to hurt. They have a will to assist. They know that the individuals we are talking about have lost their jobs, their opportunity to work, and their connection, in many instances, with humanity. I would urge that we do everything in our power to help them find their way back and not hurt them. Therefore, I would urge all of my colleagues to oppose this legislation and vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, since the law was enacted some 5 years ago, Members of this body have clearly stated their intent time and time again through letters, hearings, public comments, and meetings, and yet the previous Department of Labor continued to push Congress’ concerns to the side and legislate from the executive branch. Again, supporting this resolution means supporting the role of Congress 
to write laws and for the laws to be implemented as intended. I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 42, disapproving of the Department of Labor’s regulation of the drug testing on unemployment insurance applicants. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the joint resolution. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint resolution. The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
b1415 DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO SAVINGS ARRANGEMENTS BY STATES FOR NON GOVERNMENTAL EMPLOYEES Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 116, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 66) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to savings arrangements established by States for nongovernmental employees, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 116, the joint resolution is considered read. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: 
H.J. R ES. 66 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to ‘‘Savings Arrangements Established by States for NonGovernmental Employees’’ (published at 81 Fed. Reg. 59464 (August 30, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force or effect. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) and the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 66. The Obama administration spent a lot of time and taxpayer dollars emphasizing the need to protect retirement savers, but as was often the case with the previous administration, their rhetoric rarely matched their actions. For example, the Obama Department of Labor spent years advancing a flawed rule that will limit access to affordable retirement advice for low and middleincome families. Despite repeated calls for a more responsible approach, the Department pushed forward with an extreme, partisan rule. Then, late last year, the Department finalized two additional rules that will also negatively impact the retirement security of workers. The administration crafted a regulatory loophole that allows States to establish government run IRAs by circumventing protections workers and employers have enjoyed for decades. As was usually the case, the actions of the previous administration hurt the very people it claimed to be helping. First, this loophole would lead to fewer protections for retirement savers. Working families will have less information about how their retirement plans are managed, and they will have fewer options if those plans are not managed well. They will also have less control over the money they worked so hard to put away. We need to honor hardworking taxpayers, Mr. Speaker, who save for their retirement and not have the Federal Government do things to harm them. The loophole also threatens to inflict significant harm on small business employees. It is already hard enough for many small businesses to provide their employees with retirement options, and this regulation only makes it less likely they will do so. In fact, many small businesses could actually be discouraged from offering 401(k)s or other private sector options. Others could cancel their retirement plans and dump their employees into governmentrun retirement plans. Finally, the Obama administration’s regulatory action puts taxpayers at risk. We already know that many governmentrun pension plans for public employees are woefully underfunded. Let me repeat that, Mr. Speaker. We already know that many government run pension plans for public employees are woefully underfunded. If governmentrun IRAs for private sector workers are mismanaged, does anyone seriously believe hardworking taxpayers won’t be asked to foot the bill? These may be unintended consequences, but they will be detrimental to workers, retirees, and small business all the same. Too many hardworking men and women struggle to plan for the future and retire with financial security and peace of mind. The resolution under consideration today will close a loophole that threatens that security and peace of mind. To be clear, these resolutions will not prevent States and cities from providing workers and retirees with new, innovative retirement options. These resolutions will simply ensure that all workers and retirees enjoy the same protections that have been guaranteed for decades. I want to thank Representatives WALBERG and R OONEY for leading this effort and working to protect the retirement security of hardworking men and women across the country. I urge my colleagues to support both resolutions. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 66. Working families in my home State of Oregon and across the country deserve the opportunity to retire with security and dignity. Unfortunately, that is not a reality for far too many Americans who face a growing retirement security crisis. In fact, nearly 40 million private sector workers, including an estimated 1 million in Oregon, do not have access to retirement savings plans at their jobs. The AARP and others have noted that people who do not save for retirement risk becoming dependent on social safety net programs that increase costs for taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, Congress has not stepped up to address our country’s retirement security crisis, so several States, including my home State of Oregon, have developed and implemented innovative solutions that will help workers save for retirement. Oregon’s program is set to launch in just 5 months. Workers who do not have access to a retirement plan through their employer will have access to a plan facilitated by the State. It is not mandatory—workers can opt out—and there is minimal paperwork for employees. Oregon’s plan is portable, so workers can keep their retirement savings when they change jobs. Consider Oregonian Penny Wicklander, who has worked hard but hasn’t had access to a good retirement plan. Penny managed an apartment complex for lowincome seniors, and she saw the hardships that residents faced without retirement security. Some lived on $10 in the last 10 days of the month. She said, in support of Oregon’s plan: 
No one wants to retire into poverty and rely on public services, but it’s hard to plan for the future when there are so many other financial challenges facing our families. We need a simple retirement account that makes it easy for everyone to save part of what they earn, regardless of where they work. 
Bobbie Sotin, a home care worker who cares for seniors and people with disabilities doesn’t have access to a retirement savings plan through her employer. Bobbie said: 
Working with seniors in poverty, many care providers see their own future every day. Once they reach retirement age, they have to make the decision to live in poverty or keep working until they die. Even if it 
means just $50 or $100 more per month, that kind of income would make a huge difference to each and every one of us. 
Penny, Bobbie, and people across the country need access to retirement savings plans. Oregon and several other States are working to fill that need. Congress should be supporting them and encouraging retirement savings programs like Oregon’s and similar plans in California, Illinois, Connecticut, and Maryland. Instead, House Republicans are advancing a Congressional Review Act joint resolution of disapproval that would endanger these plans, discourage other States from taking action, and undermine states’ rights. Specifically, this resolution would nullify an important Department of Labor rule that simply clarifies that these Statebased savings plans do not run afoul of ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The safe harbor rule went into effect last October. Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle may characterize this as ‘‘closing regulatory loopholes’’ and they may question whether more government is the answer, but that is not what this is about. The National Conference of State Legislatures and the State treasurers of Oregon, Illinois, and California submitted letters in opposition to this resolution. They found the ‘‘DOL safe harbor provides flexibility to states, codifies clear protections for employers who facilitate retirement savings arrangements for their employees, and enables innovative solutions to addressing the growing retirement crisis facing this country.’’ Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  these letters and several other letters in opposition to this resolution. 
FEBRUARY 10, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. SPEAKER RYAN: Earlier this week, Reps. Tim Walberg and Francis Rooney introduced two resolutions of disapproval (H.J. Res 66, H.J. Res 67) to rollback key Department of Labor (US DOL) rules. These resolutions will limit our abilities as states to provide solutions to the growing retirement savings crisis, and could make it harder for small businesses to participate in staterun programs. We are writing to ask that you defend our state’s rights by voting ‘‘No’’ on H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67. The rule in question gives clarity for states across the country to provide access to retirement savings options for millions of privatesector workers. California, Illinois, and Oregon are all in the process of implementing legislatively approved stateadministered plans that will enable nearly 8 million privatesector workers to save their own money for retirement. As Treasurers, we chair the respective Boards governing our state plans and have been actively working with employers, employees, payroll providers, and financial service organizations for the last two years. The reality is, that without access to an easy and affordable savings vehicle, far too many workers risk retiring into poverty and becoming overly reliant on Social Security or state and federal safety net programs. The final rule from US DOL provides key protections for employers who facilitate enrollment for their employees—confirming a safe harbor from ERISA and protecting businesses from litigation or liability related to state programs—while maintaining key consumer protections for program participants. While this rule has been finalized, opponents are seeking to repeal or weaken the rule through the Congressional Review Act. We respectfully request that you oppose efforts to repeal the rule and vote no on H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67. The US DOL safe harbor provides flexibility to states, codifies clear protections for employers who facilitate retirement savings arrangements for their employees, and enables innovative solutions to addressing the growing retirement crisis facing this country. We are happy to provide additional information. Thank you for your support. Sincerely, JOHNCHIANG , California State Treasurer. MICHAEL FRERICHS , Illinois State Treasurer. TOBIAS READ, Oregon State Treasurer. 
AARP, February 8, 2017. DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS : On behalf of working Americans who struggle to save for their retirement, AARP urges you to vote against a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the Department of Labor’s final rule on ‘‘Savings Arrangements Established by States for NonGovernmental Employees’’. AARP, with its nearly 38 million members in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands, is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide organization that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse. Today, 55 million working Americans do not have a way to save for retirement out of their regular paycheck. Despite decades of federal incentives, employer sponsorship of retirement savings plans has remained static. The lack of employersponsored savings plans has a direct impact on the retirement readiness of workers, because employees are 15 times more likely to save if they have access to a payroll deduction savings plan at work. In response to the stubborn lack of growth in employersponsored retirement savings plans, numerous states have removed regulatory and operational barriers for small businesses who want to offer a retirement savings vehicle to their workers. These bipartisan, commonsense solutions are known as Secure Choice or Work and Save. In the last two years more than half the states considered a variety of options to provide employers and their employees with lowcost savings options, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. In 2016, the Department of Labor promulgated a rule providing states with guidance on how to enter into publicprivate partnerships aimed at increasing personal savings rates among small business employees. This rule makes it clear that any automatic IRA program established by a state must remove the operational burden of running a retirement plan from small business owners. In fact, it asserts that a small business owner’s only interaction with a Work and Save plan would be to facilitate payroll deductions for these individual savings plans. A Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn this rulemaking will have a significant chilling effect on states, sending the political message that state flexibility is not a priority. There is successful precedent for states to take action to promote personal financial responsibility. When college savings plans, known as 529 plans, were created twenty years ago, less than $2.5 billion had been saved for college in these programs. Today, individuals have put away more than $253.2 billion for college in 529 plans. Similarly, in the retirement context, states are acting as facilitators, aggregating small businesses to get the cost benefit of pooling. All private financial firms can bid to invest the savings from employees. The only employer role is to set up the payroll deduction and forward materials to employees, a role employers already perform for unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, and other similar programs. Often, states are the pioneers of solutions. State governments more directly interact with both workers and employers, and state policymakers are aware that growth in the number of older Americans who do not have a secure retirement will be felt most acutely in cities and states. As laboratories of change, states are often more willing and able to test creative solutions to improve the retirement security needs of their workforce while respecting the unique characteristics and demographics of each jurisdiction. The lack of options to save for retirement at work is a persistent problem that demands action today. States desire flexibility to move forward with innovative reforms—Congress should not curtail state efforts to promote retirement savings. Americans need easy savings options. No one wants older Americans solely dependent on Social Security. Employer plans are not growing and states are trying to meet the needs of their citizens using private investment firms. Lack of access to workplace savings plans is especially acute for people of color—only 54 percent of African American and Asian employees and 38 percent of Latino employees work for an employer that sponsors a retirement plan, compared to 62 percent of White employees. Those who do not save enough for retirement risk becoming dependent on social safety net programs, costing taxpayers down the line. In fact, states taking action today could save taxpayers as much as $4.8 billion in the next ten years. Congress should support these important state savings programs, not take steps to end them. AARP urges Congress to support private retirement savings and vote no on a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the Department of Labor’s rule on Savings Arrangements Established by States for Non Governmental Employees. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact me. Sincerely, NANCY A. L EAMOND, Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy and Engagement Officer. 
ANDCONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS , LEGISLATIVE ALERT , Washington, DC, February 15, 2017. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : The AFL–CIO urges you to oppose H.J. Res. 66 and H.J. Res. 67. These resolutions of disapproval block Department of Labor (DoL) regulations that 
create safe harbors under which certain retirement savings arrangements established by states or eligible political subdivisions for privatesector workers will not be considered ERISAcovered employee benefit plans. While the vast majority of union members who work in the private sector benefit from collectively bargained pensions and retirement savings plans, over 38 million private sector workers are not offered any kind of plan at work. The DoL regulations provide a path forward for states and municipalities to create an easier way for these Americans to begin building a retirement nest egg through payroll deduction contributions into their own Individual Retirement Account (IRA). A vote to rescind these regulations is a vote to ensure that these Americans will remain financially vulnerable in retirement. Thank you for your consideration of our views. Sincerely, WILLIAM SAMUEL , Director, Government Affairs Department. 
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE , COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOY EES, AFLCIO, Washington, DC, February 10, 2017. U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, DEARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 1.6 million members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to urge you to oppose the two Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions of disapproval blocking the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) regulations for state and city retirement savings programs, H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67. Using the CRA to overturn these rules is an example of an arbitrary process that upsets years of work by federal agencies acting in strict adherence to the Administrative Procedures Act to promulgate important federal rules and actions. After thorough consideration that has involved the public, state and local governments, and the Congress, resolutions of disapproval should not be used for partisan purposes to scrap agency rules at the last minute and to subvert the regulatory process contrary to real needs of Americans. We know there is a growing retirement security problem in this country. It is estimated that 55 million full and parttime private sector workers in the U.S. lack access to retirement coverage through work. This problem has grown unabated and without adequate attention at the federal level. Finally, new DOL rules that are under attack will enhance retirement security for the millions of Americans who do not have access to pensions and have limited means to increase savings for retirement. The new rules simply allow states and cities to set up important autoenrollment programs to enhance savings if they chose to do so. One rule encourages state autoenrollment taxfree savings plans, or statecreated taxfree saving plans for private business. The second resolution would block a rule that clarifies when county and city autoenrollment plans will be exempt from federal retirement law. California and a number of other states have either already adopted plans or are considering adopting plans. In addition, cities such as New York, Philadelphia and Seattle are also considering similar measures. These resolutions of disapproval would unfairly impact these new plans and the millions who want to take advantage of them. Approximately half of all workers lack access to any type of pension or employment based retirement savings plan. The DOL regulation is narrowly tailored to authorize governments to establish plans for those employers who do not offer retirement programs. The burden imposed upon such employers is minimal. Significantly, the regulation simply clarifies that states and local governments can create autoenrollment programs. In the absence of the regulation, states may still offer the programs, although the legal status is uncertain. These regulations not only clarify the matter, but provide some important protections for participants. I urge you to vote no on H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67, which would harm these important state and local savings programs. Sincerely, SCOTT FREY, Director of Federal Government Affairs. 
OFTEACHERS , Washington, DC, February 15, 2017. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : For many Americans, the ability to maintain their living standards in retirement continues to be a source of anxiety and concern. Twothirds of participants in the Employee Benefit Research Institute’s 2016 Retirement Confidence Survey indicated that they had no retirement plan, and more than 50 percent reported they had less than $25,000 in retirement savings. As a result, a large number of states are moving legislation to help employees of small employers to access retirement savings plans. The Department of Labor has assisted this effort by excluding such plans from ERISA. In light of these facts, the AFT urges you to vote no on Congressional Review Act resolutions (H.J. Res. 66 and H.J. Res. 67) that would reimpose ERISA standards on governments and only serve to chill state and city innovation. Although most jobs are created by small businesses, most small business workers are not offered any retirement plan. According to the Center for Retirement Initiatives (CRI), 98 percent of all firms in the U.S. employ fewer than 100 workers, and about two thirds of these workers lack access to any retirement plan. Many smallbusiness owners who were contacted by the Government Accountability Office reported shying away from sponsoring any retirement plan because of all of the administrative requirements and fiduciary responsibilities for selecting investment funds and managing plan assets. Unless something is done to improve the retirement prospects of the smallemployer workforce, these individuals will fall into poverty in retirement, and place emotional stress on their families and financial stress on their government sponsors. In response to this retirement savings gap, a large number of states have removed regulatory and administrative barriers for small businesses that want to offer a retirement savings vehicle to their workers. These bipartisan commonsense approaches are collectively known as ‘‘Secure Choice.’’ In the last few years, about half of all states have considered ways to provide small employers and their employees with lowcost, professionally managed savings options. Seven states already have enacted legislation and are preparing to implement their plans. In 2016, the DOL promulgated an rule providing states and cities with guidance on how to enter into publicprivate partnerships, with the goal of increasing savings rates among employees of small businesses. The rule clearly states that an automatic IRA program established by a state or city must remove the burden of administering the retirement plan from smallbusiness owners. The rule puts in place only one requirement: Small employers that do not offer any other retirement plan to their employees must offer a payroll deduction for employees who voluntarily choose to participate in the savings plan. In short, the DOL rule eliminates much federal red tape, and gives governments more flexibility to innovate. This allows states and cities to provide a glide path for small employers to offer a retirement savings plan to their workers. Just as states facilitated the pooling and investing of 529 college savings plans in partnership with private investment firms, the same convention is being employed in a retirement savings context. Private investment companies can bid to invest the pooled savings from employees of small employers. Workers will enjoy the twin benefits of low cost and wellmanaged investments. Small employers are only required to provide payroll deduction and forward the program information to employees. Again, the AFT urges Congress to support these statesponsored, publicprivate retirement savings programs—collectively referred to as Secure Choice—by voting against Congressional Review Act resolutions H.J. Res. 66 and H.J. Res. 67. Sincerely, RANDI WEINGARTEN , President. 
OFSTATE LEGISLATURES , Washington, DC, February 13, 2017. MEMBERS OF THEUNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES : The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), the bipartisan organization representing the legislatures of our nation’s states, territories, and commonwealths, urges you to vote against H.J. Res. 66, a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the Department of Labor’s final rule on ‘‘Savings Arrangements Established by States for NonGovernmental Employees.’’ As our nation’s laboratories of democracy, states are developing and implementing innovative solutions that will improve the retirement security of private sector workforces and that will also save taxpayers billions of dollars. Passage of this resolution is an affront to those in Congress who advocate for the 10th Amendment as it will result in an unwarranted preemption of state innovation, will restrict the ability of millions of hardworking Americans to save for retirement, and will prove costly to federal and state budgets. As the number of workers who lack enough savings to cover the costs of retirement expenses continues to grow, states need the flexibility to develop creative solutions to this problem. Restricting the ability of states to establish private sector savings plans will put an even greater strain on public finances because states and the federal government are ultimately responsible for funding the social safety programs that are utilized by retirees who are not financially independent. Eight states have enacted laws that will establish statefacilitated retirement plans’ and many other states are considering these plans for their state’s private sector workers. Passage of H.J. Res. 66 will likely prevent states from establishing these innovative plans and will result in increased costs for federal and state budgets as tens of millions of Americans who depend solely on social security will increase dependency on other entitlement programs. Finally, we challenge the argument that private sector workers, who lack retirement options, should not depend on their state governments to establish these retirement saving programs. We ask members of Congress that if states did not act to address this growing problem, who would? It was only after years and years of failure by the private sector to address the retirement of 
its small business workers that state governments were left with no alternative but to provide an innovative solution for these retirees’ future. Congress should respect the states’ efforts to reduce a further financial burden on future taxpayers. NCSL urges Congress to support state innovation regarding private retirement savings and vote no on a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the Department of Labor’s rule on ‘‘Savings Arrangements Established by States for NonGovernmental Employees.’’ Sincerely, SENATOR DANIEL T. B LUE, JR., North Carolina, President, NCSL. SENATOR DEBPETERS , South Dakota, PresidentElect, NCSL. 
RETIREMENT SAVINGS FAST FACTS  Threequarters of private sector workers feel anxious about having enough money to live comfortably in retirement. Fiftyfive million Americans work for employers that do not offer any form of a retirement savings plan. 80 percent of private sector workers between the ages of 18 and 64 support statefacilitated plans designed to help them save their money for retirement. Statefacilitated retirement savings plans are designed similarly to the popular 529 college savings plans, as the plan’s assets would be the personal property of the individual saver, and their money could only be used to benefit the individual saver. Statefacilitated retirement savings plans would be managed by outside private sector fund managers and there will be no connection between statefacilitated programs and public pensions for government employees. Statefacilitated retirement savings plans would provide employees the options to decline participation; however, data suggests that employees with access to workplace retirement plans are 15 times more likely to save for retirement. 
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF LARAZA, Washington, DC, February 10, 2017. Hon. VIRGINIA FOXX, Chairman, House Committee on Education & Workforce, Washington, DC. Hon. BOBBY SCOTT, Ranking Member, House Committee on Education & Workforce, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN FOXX AND RANKING MEMBERSCOTT: On behalf of the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), the nation’s largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization, I write to ask you to oppose H. J. Res 66 and H. J. Res 67, resolutions of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), to block the Department of Labor (DOL) rules that allow states and cities to implement their own Individual Retirement Account (IRA) retirement plans. In the absence of congressional action to increase access to retirement plans, state plans have stepped up to innovate and fill that gap. H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67 impedes state and local innovation and entrepreneurialism to solve the retirement issue. If the DOL rules are abolished, it would have a chilling effect on the states and cities that are working to implement programs, including California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, and Oregon, which have all passed legislation to setup these programs and New York City, Philadelphia and Seattle which are currently considering their own auto IRA plans. Rep. Tim Walberg’s (R–MI) H.J. Res 66 and Rep. Francis Rooney’s (R–FL) H.J. Res 67 would nullify the DOL rules that offered the clarification necessary to help states and cities implement their own autoIRA plans consistent with The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which would provide millions of workers access to a workplace retirement plan. If these retirement plans were to become subject to ERISA, they would not be able to move forward. One of NCLR’s goals in 2017 is to ensure the successful implementation of the California Secure Choice Retirement Savings Program. In September 2016, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill that allows workers to access staterun IRAs, which will feature automatic enrollment for people working for employers with five or more employees. Just over 7.5 million Californian workers who do not currently have an employersponsored plan—half of whom are Latino—will benefit from this program. LATINOS HAVE A STRONG DESIRE TOSAVE NCLR has worked to improve opportunities for Hispanics in the United States for nearly 50 years. One of our core areas of work is economic security, which is contingent on an individual’s retirement readiness. While many Americans have difficulty saving for retirement, the issue is even more acute for communities of color. For example, 62% of Black and 69% of Hispanic households lack any assets in a retirement account. For those who can save, their account balances are disproportionately low: four in five Latino households aged 25–64 have less than $10,000 in retirement savings, compared to one in two White households. Prior to the DOL rule, limited access to traditional retirement savings products severely affected Latino workers’ ability to invest in their future. Efforts, whether at the federal or state level, to increase access to quality retirement savings plans are crucial to enhance Latino retirement readiness. The difficulty in saving for retirement is the result of a variety of factors, including lack of availability of employersponsored retirement plans and lower rates of participation in those plans when they are offered. Workers of color have less access to retirement savings vehicles compared to Whites: 38% of Latino employees aged 25–64 work for an employer that sponsors a retirement plan, compared to 62% of White employees. Of those workers who have access to an employersponsored plan, not all participate: only 29.7% of Latino workers who have an employer plan participate compared to 53.8% of White workers. Low wages make investing for retirement especially challenging given that housing, health care, and education costs continue to rise while wages remain stagnant. 42% of all Latinos earn povertylevel wages, even with having the highest rate of labor force participation among all racial and ethnic groups. Despite earning low wages, numerous studies have shown that Hispanics value saving. A 2014 national Prudential survey of Latino consumers found that ‘‘the ‘saver’ mindset prevails’’ with Latinos. However, while 53% Latinos think that saving for retirement is a high priority, nearterm financial needs often compete for limited resources. Limited access to traditional retirement savings products severely affect Latino worker’s ability to invest in their future. Efforts to increase access to quality retirement savings plans are crucial to enhance Latino retirement readiness. In the absence of congressional action to increase access, state and city plans can help to fill that gap. It is for the above reasons that NCLR urges you to opposes H. J. Res 66 and H. J. Res 67 and ensure that millions of workers have access to a workplace retirement plan. Sincerely, ERICRODRIGUEZ , Vice President, Office of Research, Advocacy, and Legislation. 
Ms. BONAMICI. In summary, proponents of this Congressional Review Act resolution are rushing to nullify a rule that will make it easier for people save for retirement. That is unacceptable. Every American deserves to retire with dignity, and this resolution puts that fundamental American value at risk. I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing H.J. Res. 66. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG ) be permitted to control the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from North Carolina? There was no objection. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 66. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 66, a resolution to protect retirement savers. During the final days of the Obama administration—in fact, the final hours—the Department of Labor created a regulatory loophole that threatens the retirement security of working families. We are here today to use Congress’ authority under the Congressional Review Act to close that loophole by blocking a misguided regulation from taking effect. The regulation paves the way for States to force certain employers to automatically enroll their employees into government IRAs. States would be allowed to skirt Federal law and deny workers important protections designed to safeguard their retirement savings. The Obama administration’s action is somewhat perplexing. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, has enjoyed strong bipartisan support for decades. As President Ford said when he signed the law, the American people have ‘‘greater assurances that retirement dollars will be there when they are needed.’’ Yet, over 40 years later, the same administration that frequently touted the importance of consumer protections moved to exempt States from ERISA. b1430 The question is why. To facilitate the creation of governmentrun plans that 
would lack basic protections for retirement savers? As a result, workers and retirees would have nowhere to turn if their savings were mismanaged. Let’s be honest about what this regulation is really about. It is part of an assault on small business retirement plans that began under the Obama administration. First, small businesses were hit by the fiduciary rule that would make it harder for them to access the financial advice they need to set up retirement plans for their employees. Then the Obama administration created a lastminute regulatory loophole that could discourage small businesses from offering retirement plans in the first place. As a result, many families could soon realize, If you like your 401(k) plan, you may not be able to keep it. Because of this loophole, taxpayers also are at risk. Many of the States leading the charge on these governmentrun plans have a long history of mismanaging public employee pensions. Today there is an estimated $5 trillion in unfunded State pension promises—$5 trillion. That figure is completely unsustainable. It begs the question: Will taxpayers or retirement savers foot the bill if these governmentrun IRAs are similarly mismanaged? However, we are not here today to debate the merits of State policy. To be clear, States should be free to experiment with new retirement options, and more options are certainly needed. It is up to the voters in each State to hold their elected officials accountable. The point of this debate is that States should not be exempt from a law that has, for decades, provided important protections for retirement savers. If States want to come up with new ways to help workers save for retirement, they can. But they should follow the law in the process. The goal of this resolution is simple. It is to uphold protections Congress— including Members of both parties— have long afforded retirement savers. Today we can close a regulatory loophole that would be detrimental to the retirement security of hardworking Americans, and we can ensure retirement savers in every State continue to have the same protections under Federal law. I urge my colleagues to support strong protections for retirement savers by voting in favor of H.J. Res. 66. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the ranking member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, our country is experiencing a retirement security crisis. Nearly 40 million private sector workers do not have access to a retirement savings plan at their jobs. The data and research also show that many middle and lowincome workers lack the ability to save enough on their own for retirement. Too many Americans lack access to retirement savings plans and too few are able to build a retirement nest egg on their own. Unfortunately, Congress has not stepped up to comprehensively address our country’s retirement security challenges, but many States have stepped up and enacted innovative solutions to expand working people’s access to retirement savings. California passed a law establishing a program that is estimated to provide 6.8 million workers access to a retirement savings plan. In Illinois, more than a million people are expected to benefit from the State’s retirement savings program. Six other States have enacted programs. Dozens more have considered proposals to study or implement State based retirement plans. Several of these States have worked with the Obama administration’s Department of Labor on rules to ensure that their workplace retirement savings initiatives did not inadvertently run afoul of ERISA, the Federal law establishing minimum standards for private sector pensions. Last August, the Department of Labor finalized the rule specifying the ERISA safe harbor conditions for State payroll deduction retirement savings plans. The rule went into effect last October. In December, the Department of Labor finalized another rule that made certain cities and counties eligible for the same safe harbor protections. This rule only went into effect last month. Now, if there are legitimate concerns with the rules, the Trump administration has the administrative tools available to appropriately amend the final rules in the same fair, thoughtful, transparent manner in which they were promulgated. However, this CRA disapproval resolution, which was just introduced last week, will nullify the rule that puts a safe harbor in place to ensure the plans do not run afoul of ERISA. At the same time, under the CRA rules, it would make it impossible to enact a similar rule to protect these savings plans in the future without specific congressional approval. This afternoon, the House will also consider a CRA disapproval resolution which would overturn the monthold rule aimed at helping certain cities and counties offer workplace retirement programs. Mr. Speaker, Congress should not be in the business of destabilizing efforts that increase workers’ ability to save for retirement, and we should not be going out of our way to undermine states’ rights to implement their own innovative solutions. These two resolutions represent an attack on our Nation’s working families. Congress must stand up for working people who do not have access to retirement plans at their jobs. America’s working families deserve an opportunity to be able to save enough to retire with dignity and peace of mind. I urge my colleagues to reject both of these CRA joint resolutions of disapproval. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROE), the immediate past chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 66, a resolution that uses the Congressional Review Act to roll back the Department of Labor’s harmful socalled safe harbor rule. This rule allows States to automatically enroll employees in governmentrun IRAs without the important consumer protections provided by ERISA. This bureaucratic regulation restricts working families’ access to essential plan information required to make wise investments, while also increasing the risk for financial mismanagement of Staterun IRAs which would ultimately fall on the backs of the taxpayers across the U.S. Mr. Speaker, there is a retirement crisis occurring in this country. The Government Accountability Office reports that 29 percent of Americans age 55 and older have no retirement savings—zero—and no traditional pension plan. Further, nearly 40 million working families also haven’t saved a dime for retirement. This is a serious problem, and we must work together across the aisle to pursue policies that make it easier, not harder, for families to save. Unfortunately, the Obama administration’s answer to the retirement crisis was less consumer choice and more financial risk. This all started with the Department of Labor’s misguided decision to pursue a fiduciary rule which, if implemented, will be a disaster for low and middle class savers. The DOL published a rule that is nearly 1,000 pages to define the word ‘‘fiduciary.’’ Let me say that again, a 1,000page rule to define the word ‘‘fiduciary.’’ I hold in my hand Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, which has a few more pages than that to define every word in the English language. This dictionary defines every word in the English language, and it takes a thousandpage rule to define fiduciary. Does anybody think that is going to be better for savers? I seriously doubt it. Thankfully, the President is working to delay its implementation. Here we are today trying to keep yet another misguided rule from the waning days of the last administration from taking effect. It should be no surprise that the Obama administration’s safe harbor rule continues to trend toward a lack of consumer choice and more Federal involvement through a patchwork of bureaucracy. Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve the opportunity to choose their retirement savings vehicle and not to be thrust into a governmentrun IRA that could eventually fall on the backs of their fellow taxpayers to fund. I 
have worked tirelessly with my colleagues in the House to overturn these harmful regulations, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Trump administration to do just this. I agree with my colleagues across the aisle wholeheartedly that we need to work together to encourage and create policies that encourage the American people to save for their retirement. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL), the ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the doctor for that Webster’s dictionary. That dictionary was published in Springfield, Massachusetts, and I am glad that the doctor from Tennessee sees it as the last word. Mr. Speaker, let me rise in opposition to the CRA resolutions we are debating today that would block Department of Labor regulations on Staterun retirement programs. Our country is in the midst of a retirement savings crisis, as duly noted. To address this issue, we should be working together to help people get into a responsible retirement savings plan. Half the people who get up to go to work every single day in America are not in a qualified savings plan for retirement. This opportunity here is to begin a history lesson. In July of 2007, a decade ago, I introduced the Automatic IRA Act with my Republican Ways and Means colleague, Phil English. That same year, Senators Bingaman and Smith introduced a companion bill in the U.S. Senate. The Brookings Institution and The Heritage Foundation scholars jointly developed my auto IRA concept. So conservatives and liberals came together on a commonsense proposal to make it easier for working families to save. However, fast forward to 2017. I can’t find a Republican to join me in sponsoring the auto IRA legislation. Remember, The Heritage Foundation worked with me to construct this initiative. If we can just keep it amongst ourselves here, being a Democrat from Massachusetts and having a plan that is endorsed by The Heritage Foundation is not one of our easier endeavors. But between Brookings, a liberal think tank, and Heritage, a conservative think tank, we came up with a pretty good plan. Today American families struggle to prepare for retirement. To make matters worse, 55 million Americans work for employers who don’t offer a retirement plan. As I noted earlier, that is half the workers between 18 and 64. Because of Congress’ failure to act on any legislation and address the retirement savings crisis, many States implemented their own auto IRA plans based upon the NealEnglish bill. In fact, 30 States have moved to implement or are considering a Statefacilitated retirement plan. Credit unions would love this, community bankers would love this, and insurance agents would like to sell these plans, but here we can’t find a Republican to sign on. So today they are trying to block the guidance that provides clarity and flexibility to States that want to launch their own initiative. This is troubling. If these resolutions become law, it would have a chilling effect on State efforts. The States are the laboratories of experimenting on these retirement plans because the Federal Government doesn’t get it done. If Republicans are looking for a single national effort, let’s work together to develop a Federal auto IRA legislation piece that would work in the interim and work in the future and help people set up, Mr. Speaker, a responsible retirement savings plan. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I guess the point that I would make again is not the fact that we are trying to stop States from doing this. In fact, this CRA does not do that at all. It just simply says we express our concern that States would be allowed as a result of what was put through in midnight fashion that exempted States from having to come under the same protections of ERISA that we would expect to be covered for all retirement plans. That is the challenge. We want to make sure that retirees’ incomes are protected in a secure, safe way, and that is the value of ERISA. This proposal or the rule that was put through did not cover that, and that is our concern, again, protecting retirees. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. DAVIS), a senior member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, after the extraordinary events of this week, I certainly had hoped that the House would move forward with a swift investigation into White House dealings with Russia. But, not to be distracted, it looks like the majority would rather spend the day stripping retirement benefits from millions. We have known for a long time that workers who have access to retirement plans through their workplace are more likely to save for retirement than those who don’t. It makes sense. b1445 We also know that nearly half of middle class workers will fall into poverty when they retire. Last year, the State of California did a great thing. It established a program to provide 7 million Californians with the tools to save for retirement. The Secure Choice program lets workers who do not have a retirement plan through their employer contribute a share of their income to an IRA account administered by the State. Under this voluntary program—and I stress voluntary—countless Californians will get access to tax preferred retirement accounts for the very first time. That is extraordinary. In August, the Department of Labor cleared the way for Secure Choice by ruling that States could move forward with their own programs to help workers save for retirement. Seven other States are in the process of implementing similar laws, and dozens more are considering their options. The resolution in question today would undo the DOL’s ruling, leaving States in a legal gray area that could put these programs in jeopardy. So I ask, Mr. Speaker, is this really how we should be spending our time? DOL spent months reviewing public comments and carefully crafting this rule. The House will vote to repeal it without a single hearing. Really? We should be doing everything we can to encourage savings across the board, certainly not voting to making savings harder for folks. In States across the country, this effort has been bipartisan. I wonder if we would be considering this resolution if the rule in question had not been issued by a Democratic administration? The word ‘‘irresponsible’’ does not even begin to do this for what would be justice in this area. So I urge, Mr. Speaker, a ‘‘no’’ vote on this. Let’s move forward. Let’s allow more States to experiment so they can decide for themselves whether or not this is something that the folks in their State want to do. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to make note that, as we discuss this here today, there have been points made about businesses wanting this change, they want to work with the States, and they are concerned about liabilities. Well, if that were the case, we wouldn’t have endorsements of this coming from the Chamber of Commerce, Air Conditioning Contractors of America, American Benefits Council, NFIB, just looking through, the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, National Federation of Independent Business, National Electrical Contractors Association, National Black Chamber of Commerce, and I could go on and on, businesses and the business associations and groups that deal with this and have concern about their employees, their retirees, having a good and safe mechanism by which to have their retirement savings protected, supporting our efforts here to take back what took place under the cover of darkness, as it were, which took retiree savings off the benefit of ERISA. I just want that to be made clear. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, just to clarify, there was a comment made that these are governmentrun plans. Under these plans, the States establish the framework for deducting the contributions, but these will be managed by investment professionals, not by the State. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
DESAULNIER ), my colleague, and a leader on the Education and the Workforce Committee. Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from the State of Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ) for the brief opportunity to speak. I did want to speak personally just briefly on my experience in my previous job in the California legislature when I voted for the Secure Choice Act. Then we spent over 4 years working with the business community, the investment community, and our attorneys to make sure the issues that the majority have brought up in regards to ERISA and other concerns, and I did this specifically as a former smallbusiness person with the smallbusiness stakeholders, to make sure these concerns were taken care of. We think that they have been taken care of, and we are proud of the Secure Choice Act. Close to 7 million Californians and 55 million people nationwide, most of them low and middleincome, don’t have access to retirement benefits through their employer. We are talking about people mostly who work for small businesses where neither the employer nor the employee can afford to enroll in expensive Wall Streettype financial advisers. They aren’t able to pay the fees and the expenses. This element of the U.S. economy, and at this point I have to agree with The New York Times editorial today, that this resolution appears to be more directed towards Wall Street than to Main Street. Wall Street, the financial sector, takes around 25 percent of all corporate profits in the United States, represents 7 percent of the U.S. economy, and creates merely 4 percent of all jobs. The Secure Choice Act was directed away from those expensive investments and allowed for a more efficient process for working class Californians and Americans to be able to replicate this program and to be able to have a secure retirement. The majority often talks about states’ rights and having States be the laboratories of creation. I think in California we have done that on multiple issues, and certainly on this issue. Without programs like this, most of the 55 million private sector Americans will end up relying on social security for more than half of their retirement income, which averages about less than $1,400 a month. California and seven other States that have created similar retirement programs are looking out for working families. American workers are doing more today than they ever have before. Over the last 40 years, worker productivity has risen 73 percent, yet hourly pay has only increased 11 percent. Now they find their retirement more and more in jeopardy. I would ask the majority to strongly reconsider this approach, and to work with California and other States to make sure that we can allow these Americans to have access to a secure retirement. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We are certainly willing to work with the States and would concur that there ought to be a laboratory. But again, our concern, and basically the only concern, that this resolution deals with is that they be managed in such a way that they come under the protections given under ERISA. And why do we say that? Well, we look at, for instance, Illinois’ unfunded liability. We are looking at $114.8 billion at the end of fiscal year 2016—a State plan managed by, yes, an outside manager—but $114.8 billion under. We look at California Public Employees’ Retirement System, CalPERS, which has a $228.2 billion shortfall in funding. Oregon’s unfunded actuarial liability of the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, again, managed by someone for Oregon, of $21.8 billion. If we looked at it all put together, we have over $5 trillion unfunded liability for State plans managed by some outside source. That is where our concern comes from—this rule that was put through— that takes people out of the protections of ERISA. So we are saying: Have at it, States, but do it according to the rules and the protections that are there. That is all we are asking. We want retirees’ savings to be protected for the purposes that they planned for and not come up short some day because of a lack of care and the coverage of ERISA on their plans. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I assure my colleague that, as someone with a consumer protection background, I would not be opposing this resolution if it had consumer protections. In fact, this rule applies when States have strict investor protections. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ), the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.J. Res. 66, which is just a continuation of the House Republicans’ attack on working families and their retirement security. H.J. Res. 66 would dismantle the Department of Labor rule allowing for Statebased retirement savings programs. This does nothing more than make it harder for this country’s roughly 40 million private sector workers who do not have a way to save for retirement directly out of their regular paycheck. Under the current Department of Labor rule, State administered retirement programs can allow employees, who do not have access to a workplace savings plan, to establish an IRA through a payroll deduction. In my State of California, we have the California Secure Choice retirement savings program through which the State is working to provide a savings option to roughly 6.8 million low to middle income workers. Last Congress, House Republicans unanimously voted to undermine another Department of Labor rule designed to protect retirement security for working families. In that case, the rule ensured that workers receive retirement investment advice that is in their best interest, referred to as the ‘‘fiduciary rule.’’ Now congressional Republicans want to prevent workers from participating in voluntary savings programs. The Department of Labor rule that the Republicans are now seeking to roll back provides clarity for States and employers so that California, and the several other States that have already enacted similar plans, can provide a simple savings tool for millions of working families. Mr. Speaker, I just don’t understand the arguments that are being made against the average working person who would like to have retirement savings. I don’t know who is going to benefit if we do away with their ability to have a savings plan, even if they don’t have one under the job that they work on. Who benefits? Is it Wall Street again? What is happening here, and why is it that we have H.J. Res. 66? Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, we are not opposing voluntary plans. We are not opposing States setting up plans that will encourage retirement. We are not opposing that. We are just saying we want to make sure they are protected under the same requirements of ERISA that all other plans are. We want to make sure that those dollars are there when the people need them. That is all we are saying. We are not opposed to voluntary or plans for retirement. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROSKAM ), my colleague and good friend, the chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy. Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman WALBERG . There is an irony here, and it is an irony I think that is worth pointing out. This is, obviously, in the context, like the gentlewoman from California pointed out, of the fiduciary rule, which we are familiar with. That was an effort by the Obama administration to promulgate a new rule to create a new standard that would have an impact, Mr. Speaker, on investment advice. It was clear that the net result of that was to do what? It would have crowded people out at the lower end of the economic spectrum, not give them access to the coverage or the advice that they needed, because the advice, Mr. Speaker, would have been too expensive, and it would have created the selffulfilling prophecy, unfortunately, where wealthier people, who can afford it, are able to get good advice. It was a terrible idea. We worked on a bipartisan basis. The administration 
wouldn’t have any part of the bipartisan solution. They jammed the rule down. It was a bad idea. Yet, the same administration, Mr. Speaker, is now saying to the entities that we really shouldn’t have confidence in, that is States and localities on these pensions, you have more flexibility. So think about it. Taking away flexibility from people who need help, locking them out, not intentionally, but locking them out, and yet giving more flexibility to the very entities that have demonstrated that they have not used that properly. It is ironic. I mean, you can’t make this up, basically. We need to do what we can, and here is what we can do. We can support this resolution, H.J. Res. 66—and 67—move its passage, reset this debate, and fundamentally have a new discussion about this, but we don’t have to yield to these poor plans from the Obama administration. b1500 Ms. BONAMICI. May I inquire as to the remaining time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Oregon has 11
1⁄2minutes remaining. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ), a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, my friend, Mr. ROSKAM , said you can’t make things up. Well, unfortunately, people are. First and foremost, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are conflating accounts that are in the name of individual savers who don’t have pensions that would be set up under these proposals, with what has happened with State and local pension plans and, frankly, private pension plans that got over their skis, that overpromised, that added to things. These are just the accounts that belong to individuals. Now, the hypocrisy strikes me that my Republican friends want to strip away the protections of the Affordable Care Act and turn it back to the States. Let them do with it what they will for Medicaid, for other local health programs. They think that is a great idea. But when governments on the State level like mine spent years developing a proposal that is innovative, that would protect people, that would involve no public tax dollars but at least engage people in a lowcost, transparent savings plan like we all have as Federal employees, then they don’t want innovation, then they don’t trust the States, then they want extra regulation that was never designed for programs like this. I find it troubling that we would take a lowcost, highimpact program that has been developed in a number of States to help savers who have no program, that the private sector doesn’t think they are important enough to invest in—or it is not worth their while— and strip that away. I think there is a reason why some business organizations, like the Chamber and other financial groups, are worried about this because this is a lowcost, highimpact, transparent program that will deliver benefits directly to employees. That is what more people should have. I think they are afraid of the model and they are not willing to give the flexibility to the States in retirement that they are trying to do, throwing out the Affordable Care Act and having all sorts of innovation there. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD additional letters in opposition to this resolution. 
SERVICE EMPLOYEES  INTERNATIONAL UNION, Washington, DC, February 13, 2017. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the two million members of the Service Employees International Union (SEID), I urge you to vote against H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67, resolutions disapproving of the Department of Labor’s rules relating to retirement savings arrangements established by states and qualified state political subdivisions. The Department of Labor rules make it easier for small employers to offer their workers access to programs for retirement savings and achieve an essential component of the American dream. There is a retirement savings crisis in our country. Fiftyfive million workers do not have access to a retirement savings plan at work. As a result, nearly half of all workers have no retirement assets—no pension, no 401(k), and no IRA. States have stepped in to begin to address this crisis with innovative legislation that gives workers the opportunity to set aside their own money in low fee, professionally managed savings accounts. Importantly, private sector money managers and administrators will be hired to run these programs on behalf of the states, generating American jobs. The Department of Labor issued rules that clarified that employers would not be subject to the fiduciary responsibilities and reporting requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) under these state initiatives. In addition to helping workers achieve a dignified retirement, the state initiatives provide small businesses with easy, lowcost access to a retirement savings plan. Small employers are the least likely to offer retirement savings plans because the cost can be prohibitive and the ERISA requirements can be onerous at the start. The state initiatives also are fiscally prudent actions that will save public spending. A new study by Segal Consulting estimated that state Medicaid costs would be reduced by $5 billion within the first ten years of implementation of the state plans. Those savings would grow exponentially over time as more workers retired with greater amounts of savings. Five states—California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland and Oregon—have enacted legislation and will soon begin taking payroll contributions. About half of states have studied or are studying this concept. Massachusetts and Vermont are considering legislation that would also allow employer contributions. Contrary to misinformation being spread about these plans, the program funds are not guaranteed by the state, and state and participating employers will have no liability for the payment of retirement funds earned by the participants. These state plans are bipartisan public/private initiatives that appropriately use states as laboratories for innovation. They are a win for workers, for employers, and for governments at all levels. SEIU is also deeply concerned with efforts under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to circumvent the Executive Branch process of rulemaking and issuing regulatory guidance. Using the CRA authority to undo Agency regulations and guidance crafted carefully and with public input strips away the importance of the rulemaking process. Using this authority could significantly weaken or undo past and future rules that protect workers. SEIU respectfully urges you to vote against resolutions H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67 disapproving of these important rules. We may add votes on this legislation to our legislative scorecard. If you have any questions please contact John Gray, Legislative Director. Sincerely, MARYKAYHENRY , International President. 
SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY , Washington, DC, February 13, 2017. Re House Joint Resolutions 66 and 67. Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY , Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCARTHY : As a leading representative of the 28 million small businesses in America, Small Business Majority writes today urging you to oppose HJR 66 and HJR 67, which would overturn the U.S. Department of Labor’s rule enabling states to establish retirement savings plans for private sector workers. Striking down this rule would have a chilling effect on states that are setting up their own retirement savings programs, which would be harmful to small businesses and their employees. We strongly believe states should be allowed to decide whether to implement these types of programs and how best to administer them in order to serve small businesses and employees who struggle to save for retirement. The U.S. currently suffers from a retirement savings gap of more than $6 trillion, and more than three million households do not have any retirement savings at all. This lack of savings for retirement disproportionately affects those who are employed by small businesses. Eighty percent of workers employed by businesses with fewer than 25 employees do not have any sort of pension or retirement plan at all. This is important because small businesses employ about half of all private sector workers. Unless small business owners and their employees start doing more to prepare for the future, many Americans will not have enough money for their golden years. Small Business Majority’s state opinion polling found small business owners struggle to offer retirement savings programs due to a number of barriers, but they want to offer this benefit to their employees because it helps them attract and retain talent. What’s more, the majority of small employers are concerned their employees will not have enough saved for retirement. That’s why small businesses overwhelmingly support state efforts to establish stateadministered retirement savings programs, like the Secure Choice Savings programs in Illinois and California. When implemented, these programs will offer a convenient and affordable option for small businesses and their employees to save for the future. What’s more, these programs will not be funded by taxpayer dollars, and employers will not contribute to funds, manage funds or have any responsibility for financial advice for their employees’ investments. 
Business owners know offering benefits like retirement savings create a happier and more productive staff, which in turn leads to increased productivity. Many small business owners think of their employees as family, so it’s not surprising they support programs that enable them to foster a happier workforce while protecting their workers and their bottom line. Additionally, programs like these help level the playing field between small businesses that want to offer retirement benefits but can’t, and their larger counterparts that can. This helps small businesses compete for the best employees, and gives employers peace of mind that they are doing what’s best for their workers. Small employers need retirement savings options for their employees that make sense for their business and their bottom line. Stateadministered retirement savings programs, like those currently being established in California and Illinois, can help many small business employees better save for their futures. We urge you to uphold the Labor Department’s rule and allow states to decide how best to serve their small businesses and private sector workers. Sincerely, JOHNARENSMEYER . 
TUESDAY , FEBRUARY 14, 2017. Hon. PAULRYAN, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. SPEAKER RYAN: Nearly 55 million workers across the country lack access to employer sponsored retirement plans, and millions more fail to take full advantage of employer supported plans. Without access to easy and affordable retirement savings options, far too many workers are on track to retire into poverty where they will depend on Social Security, state, and federal benefit programs for their most basic retirement needs. States across the country have been innovating to address this problem. We are writing to respectfully urge you to protect the rights of states and large municipalities to implement their own, unique approaches. Last week, two resolutions of disapproval (H.J. Res 66, H.J. Res 67) were introduced to repeal key Department of Labor (US DOL) rules. If passed, these resolutions would make it more difficult for states and municipalities to seek solutions to the growing retirement savings crisis. We ask that you support the role of states as policy innovators by voting ‘‘No’’ on H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67. Thirty states and municipalities are in the process of implementing or exploring the establishment of statefacilitated, privatesector retirement programs. Eight states have passed legislation to allow individuals to save their own earnings for retirement (no employer funds are involved as these are not defined benefit plans). While most state and municipal plans will be governed by independent boards, the daytoday investment management and recordkeeping would not be conducted by the state, but rather by private sector firms—the same financial institutions that currently provide retirement savings products. These programs would apply to businesses that don’t currently offer a retirement plan, and would in no way limit an employer’s ability to seek out and offer their own employersponsored plan. Many states and municipalities are planning to use Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) that will be wholly owned and controlled by the participant, while others are pursuing options such as Voluntary Multiple Employer Plans (MEPs) and marketplace concepts. These plans would follow all relevant guidelines and other noted regulations, and current consumer protections would apply. Many of these programs are modeled off of the 529 College Savings Plans or supplemental public retirement plans that states administer today. States are pursuing a multitude of solutions to address this growing retirement savings crisis. We request that you vote ‘‘No’’ on H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67 with the understanding that the US DOL rule provides important flexibility to states and large municipalities as they seek to address the growing retirement crisis facing this country. We insist that states be allowed to maintain their constitutional rights to implement such legislation. We are happy to provide additional information or answer any questions. Thank you for your support. Sincerely, Beth Pearce, Vermont State Treasurer; Joseph Torsella, Pennsylvania State Treasurer; Allison Ball, Kentucky State Treasurer; Ron Crane, Idaho State Treasurer; David Da mschen, Utah State Treasurer; Kelly Mitchell, Indiana State Treasurer; Tobias Read, Oregon State Treasurer; Lynn Fitch, Mississippi State Treasurer; Terry Hayes, Maine State Treasurer; Michael Frerichs, Illinois State Treasurer; John Chiang, California State Treasurer; Brian Bonlender, Director, Washington State Department of Commerce; Nancy Kopp, Maryland State Treasurer; Kevin Lembo, Connecticut State Comptroller; Ron Henson, Louisiana State Treasurer.

Res 67 with the understanding that the US DOL rule provides important flexibility to states and large municipalities as they seek to address the growing retirement crisis facing this country. We insist that states and large municipalities be allowed to maintain their constitutional rights to implement such legislation. We are happy to provide additional information or answer any questions. Thank you for your support. Sincerely, TIMBURGESS , Seattle City Council, Finance Chair. SCOTT M. S TRINGER , New York City Comptroller. ALANL. B UTKOVITZ , Philadelphia City Controller. 
FEBRUARY 15, 2017. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : We are writing to strongly oppose H.J.Res 66, which overturns the recent Department of Labor rule supporting states’ efforts to establish retirement savings plans for nongovernmental workers. As a national, nonpartisan Millennial research and advocacy organization, we have been working hard to strengthen the financial security of young adults by increasing access to retirement savings plans. This legislation may have a chilling effect on the implementation of Secure Choice, an important new program that will help address the looming retirement crisis without costing taxpayers a dime. Changing dynamics in the workforce mean that Millennials tend to work in industries that offer lower wages and fewer benefits. Despite an interest in saving the small amounts of discretionary income they do have, many young adults do not have access to workplace retirement savings plans, including less than half of lowincome Millennial workers. Young adults are significantly less financially secure today than their parents were just one generation ago: 25–34 yearold Millennials have half the net wealth and earn 20 percent lower incomes when compared to 25–34 yearold Baby Boomers. Limiting access to tools for saving makes catching up financially that much more challenging for this generation. Many states have worked diligently for over four years to develop Secure Choice, which will provide workers who do not have access to a workplace retirement plan a simple, voluntary, lowcost, and portable retirement plan. Experts agree that direct contributions from a paycheck into a retirement account is the simplest and most effective way for individuals to save. This is why support among Millennials for a state facilitated retirement savings plan like Secure Choice is extraordinarily high: over 85 percent of young adults across political affiliation and ideology support ‘‘a voluntary option for workers without a way to save for retirement at work.’’ 
We urge you to oppose H.J.Res 66 and allow individual states to develop the tools young Americans need to save for retirement. Sincerely, YOUNG INVINCIBLES . 
STATE OF CONNECTICUT , OFFICE OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER , Hartford, CT, February 14, 2017. Hon. JOECOURTNEY : Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE COURTNEY : I am writing to seek your support in preserving and strengthening the rights of Connecticut and other states to address a growing retirement savings crisis that threatens our state and national economy. I am proud that Connecticut is among the states leading the way for retirement security. The Connecticut Retirement Security Authority savings program will ensure that retirement savings opportunities are more readily attainable for the 600,000 privatesector workers who lack access to a retirement savings plan through the workplace and who deserve financial security after a lifetime of work. According to Connecticutspecific data from the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at The New School, between 2000 and 2010, employers offering a retirement plan declined from 66 percent to 59 percent. In other words, four out of 10 workers residing in Connecticut do not have access to a retirement plan at work. In Connecticut’s market analysis conducted by Boston College, we found that these uncovered workers were more likely to earn lower income and are largely unserved by the financial sector, so their needs are often different from other 401(k) participants. It is important to protect against a transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top because high fees on low dollar accounts are a huge obstacle to retirement savings, particularly for lower income workers. There is an entire generation of employees, many of them lifelong hardworking middle class people, who are headed to retirement financially unequipped, in part due to lack of access to a workplacebased retirement savings option. This is a problem, not only for those individuals and families who are financially forced to delay retirement indefinitely, but for our entire state and economy. In many cases, these individuals may be forced to turn to the state for assistance with health care, nursing care, food, housing, energy or other costly services. The goal is not to compete or replace the private market, but to fulfill a significant unmet need in the market that must be answered for the sake of those families and our entire state economy. The market is currently failing to reach nearly half of our workforce even though the demand is there According to an AARP 2015 survey, 64% of small businesses in Connecticut that were not offering a retirement plan stated that they would take advantage of a state plan if it were offered. Connecticut was heartened by the U.S. Department of Labor rule last August, providing a safe harbor for states to conduct these programs. While we have been advised by several ERISA attorneys that the U.S. Department of Labor rule was not required, and that states already have the right to establish such programs, the proposed bills nullifying the U.S. Department of Labor rule and attempting to roll back states’ rights may create a chilling effect on the companies who would want to administer these programs. I strongly urge you to vote against H.J.Res.66 and support states’ rights to create these programs. Sincerely, KEVIN LEMBO , State Comptroller. 
Ms. BONAMICI. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ), the cochair of the Congressional Task Force on Seniors. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and her leadership on the Working Families Agenda. Get this: Americans over 44 years of age are more afraid of running out of income in retirement than they are afraid of dying. Median retirement savings in the United States of America is only $2,500. We have a retirement crisis. Only my Republican colleagues haven’t gotten the message. The New York Times asked: ‘‘Who’d Want to Limit Retirement Plans?’’ and answered with two words: ‘‘House Republicans.’’ It isn’t just that Republicans haven’t made retirement security a priority; they are actually working against it. They oppose the rule that saves retirees up to $17 billion a year, lost to bad investment advice, a rule that simply requires financial advisers to give advice that is in the client’s best interest, not their own. Today Republicans are trying to prevent States and cities from expanding private retirement savings. Nearly 1.3 million workers in my State, Illinois, lack jobbased retirement savings options. State Senator Daniel Biss won passage of the Illinois Secure Choice Savings Program that creates a retirement plan with automatic deductions that has proven successful in increasing individual retirement savings. Last summer, the U.S. Department of Labor acted to move this plan forward for Illinois and other States. Today we face Republican efforts to block action, to overturn the Department of Labor rule and jeopardize the financial security of 1.3 million Illinois workers and millions of others across the country without access to job based retirement plans. There is a saying: ‘‘Lead, follow, or get out of the way.’’ If my Republican colleagues won’t lead or follow, at least they should get out of Illinois’ way. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter, undersigned, representing thousands of businesses, individual employees, and retirees from almost two dozen specific groups in support of H.J. Res. 66. 
FEBRUARY 13, 2017. TO THE MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES  CONGRESS : The undersigned organizations, representing thousands of businesses, express our support for H.J. Res. 66 and H.J. Res. 67, resolutions of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (‘‘CRA’’) to invalidate the Department of Labor’s (‘‘DOL’’) ‘‘safe harbor’’ regulations on Savings Arrangements Established by State and Political Subdivisions for NonGovernmental Employees. These ‘‘safe harbor’’ regulations allow states and cities to mandate private employer participation in statesponsored automatic IRA programs. It also provides that states that offer these programs are not subject to ERISA despite considerable opinions to the contrary. Thus the DOL is encouraging state and local governments to provide private sector employees retirement programs that do not have the same highlevel protections as other private employersponsored plans. Below we highlight a number of our concerns with the ‘‘safe harbor.’’ Lost worker protections—States offering these plans to private sector employees are not subject to ERISA, therefore limiting the protections for workers in these plans. Different standards from state to state result in an administrative quagmire for employers—States can and will have different rules for their programs, so employers operating in multiple states, or just with workers from multiple states, will have to track the complex web of varying rules to ensure compliance. Fewer employer plans, especially among small businesses—If a state mandates auto IRAs, some employers will decide to avoid taking on the work of offering their own plans and let the state take it on instead, resulting in the loss of significant retirement savings opportunities for their workers. Mismanagement of state pension funds— Many states have mismanaged their public employee retirement systems, and it’s not clear they’ll do a better job controlling assets of millions of small private sector savers. Also, some state pension funds restrict investments to favor state initiatives or engage in politically motivated investment and divestment schemes instead of investing in the economic interest of the workers. Imposes a mandate on private employers— The ‘‘safe harbor’’ requires that the state program mandate employer participation even though retirement savings plans are traditionally voluntary. We urge Congress to take timely action under the CRA to vitiate these misguided regulations. We thank you for addressing this important issue.

Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ), a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, America should no longer be shocked with the Republican mantra of ‘‘no’’ to everything—that is, until Wall Street and the financial services industry calls. Today’s action on H.J. Res. 66 and 67 illustrates this unfortunate reality. Congressional Republicans once again are putting the financial industry ahead of average American workers. Their attempt to roll back President Obama’s Department of Labor rules, which expanded working families’ abilities to save their own retirement money through State and large cityadministered retirement savings programs. The Republican proposal restricts saving options for working people. For years, Republicans have hawked a false crisis about Social Security solvency; meanwhile, now they are proposing a very real retirement security crisis for America’s seniors. We are nearing a boiling point. The difference between what average Americans have saved for retirement and where their savings should be is staggering: more than $6 trillion in shortfalls. Roughly half of all U.S. families have no money set aside for retirement. Thirtynine million Americans don’t have access to a workplace retirement savings plan. Even Americans who work diligently to save for retirement are falling behind. With 10,000 American seniors reaching retirement age every day, enormous strain on the Federal budget is mounting to make up the difference. Today most workers don’t have a pension. Those that do, can’t be so sure it will be there throughout their golden years. There has been a dramatic decline in guaranteed retirement benefits through employer support. Without access to easy and affordable savings vehicles, far too many American workers will retire into poverty. This leads to overreliance on Social Security and other State and Federal assistance programs. It surely isn’t the American Dream. President Obama identified this crisis. He spoke to Congress about trying to work together to address it through bipartisan action, but our Republican colleagues said ‘‘no.’’ Their failure to act drove President Obama to coordinate with States, eight of which have already passed laws to create Stateadministered retirement programs for private sector workers, which H.J. Res. 66 and 67 would roll back. More than half the States are considering similar action to improve retirement readiness, and these plans help small businesses offer savings plans for their employees without imposing financial burdens. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 10 seconds to the gentlewoman. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, so what do Congressional Republicans have as an alternative solution? Nothing. The cost to roll this rule back is significant. It is not good for retirees or workers, and it maintains the growing burden on taxpayers who fund assistance programs. I urge all of my colleagues to reject this shortsighted action. Stand up for the American working class and oppose both H.J. Res. 66 and H.J. Res. 67. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I just make one comment that, when my colleagues on the other side of the aisle had both Houses and the White House and the opportunity to do these reforms, they weren’t done. Yet, now, when we stand with great concern because of a midnight rule that was put through that takes away the security of retirees in programs that will be, as I said earlier, foisted upon employers to automatically enroll their employees into governmentrun IRAs—allowing the same States to skirt the Federal law of ERISA—and deny workers important protections, we are pushed back on. I have some concern about that. When the opportunity to do what they say they want to be done could have been done with both Houses under control of the same party and the White House, this was not undertaken. Yet we are called out and told that we are hurting retirees when, in fact, we are giving assurances to retirees that you will come under the same protections regardless of where you go, and we expect that to be the case because it has worked. That is decried. I find that less than objective in its honesty. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. PELOSI ), the Democratic leader of the U.S. House of Representatives. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her hard work on this important issue. Mr. Speaker, every American should be able to trust in the promise that, after a life of hard work, a secure and dignified retirement will be there for them. But today, that promise is at risk. Half of all private sector employees in America, almost 60 million people, do not have access to any type of employersponsored retirement plan. It is a problem that Republicans should remember when they plan to raise costs on seniors, when they work to slash Medicaid and they destroy the sacred guarantee of Medicare. Yet, once again, Republicans have come to this floor not with the retirement security of hardworking families in mind, but with a greedy Wall Street first agenda. Under the Obama administration, the Department of Labor empowered the States to create innovative solutions to the retirement savings crisis. The gentleman is talking about—some of these savings didn’t even exist when we had the majority. In States across the Nation, the great laboratories of our democracy went to work just as they should. My State of California decided to create something called Secure Choice, a Staterun retirement plan that allows employees to be autoenrolled into an IRA if they work for a business with five or more employees. In doing so, California will give almost 7 million workers access to retirement savings—no substitute for a pension or a 401(k), but a vital step toward a greater retirement security. Other States have stepped forward with their own plan, the gentlewoman’s State of Oregon being one of them: Oregon, California, Illinois, Washington State, Connecticut. The Republican measure targets workers’ savings accounts in those States and chills efforts to foster retirement savings accounts in some 20 other States. In some cities, including the city of our chair, Mr. CROWLEY , New York City is attempting to move in that direction. So today, instead of supporting States’ innovation—this is a states’ rights bill to the party of states’ rights—Republicans have decided Wall Street’s profits are more important than workers’ retirement savings. This Republican resolution is opposed by the AARP, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the AFL– CIO. In fact, the AARP letter to Congress states, starts, as a matter of fact: 
On behalf of hardworking Americans who struggle to save for retirement, AARP urges you to vote against a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the Department of Labor’s final rule on ‘‘Savings Arrangements Established by States for NonGovernmental Employees.’’ 
And while Republicans race to do the bidding of their Wall Street friends, they still have not lifted a finger to create more goodpaying jobs for hardworking Americans. b1515 Let’s just make a comparison. On Friday, it will be 4 weeks since President Trump took office. Let’s go back 8 years to when President Obama took office. On January 20, 2009, President Obama stood on the steps of the Capitol and asked for swift, bold action now to create goodpaying jobs, to establish education for the 21st century, and the list goes on for swift, bold action now. One week and one day later, the House passed the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act. One week after that, the Senate passed the bill. And on February 17, which would be Friday of this week, 4 weeks since the inauguration of President Obama, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which created or saved around 4 million jobs of the American people, stopping the loss of jobs that existed in the Bush administration. That is something that is so remarkable. So where is the jobs bill from the Republicans? Wasn’t this election about jobs? Where is their jobs bill? Where is the infrastructure bill? By the way, President Obama also passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act even before the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. He also signed the SCHIP program, which had bipartisan support in the Congress and much more. This donothing Congress, except do stuff for your friends who will exploit the environment, clean air, clean water—you name it—retirement savings, has done nothing. As I said, within 4 weeks of the Obama administration, all those bills had passed. Today is February 15, and I ask my Republican colleagues: Where is your jobs bill? Why do you have time for Wall Street’s agenda, but no plans to create jobs for hardworking Americans? This is the people’s House. We must do the people’s business. You must do a better job by the people we serve. When you are ready to do that, we look forward to working with you in that regard. I join the AARP in urging a ‘‘no’’ vote on this illadvised CRA. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In response to the gentlewoman from California, I would just say that much of what we have been doing for the past 4 weeks on the floor, including today, is trying to give a shot in the arm to our economy, to our workers, our workforce, our retirees, and savers to take off some of the traps that have been put in place that have frustrated this economy and the growth of this economy for 8 years. There is a reason for what took place at the ballot box. And the expectation is that we move to take some of the clamps of the Federal Government off the private sector, the States, the local communities, and, more importantly, the citizens of this country. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire as to the remaining time, please. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Oregon has 4
1⁄4minutes remaining. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES ). Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to yet another reckless attack by the majority on the retirement security of millions of Americans. I don’t get why the majority is so determined to go after the retirement security of so many millions of Americans across this country, but that is what H.J. Res. 66 would do. It may get harder for everyday Americans to prepare for their retirement. The resolution we are considering today would prevent State governments—it doesn’t make any sense to do this—from providing retirement savings opportunities for their citizens. The fact of the matter is, as was just alluded to, this resolution was designed at the behest of Wall Street and well connected lobbyists to sideline competition and transparent financial products in the retirement savings market. But this isn’t the first time. They put all their energy behind blocking the automatic IRA when it was a proposal that came forward a few years back, even though it was a Heritage Foundation proposal. Then they went after the fiduciary rule that President Obama and the Department of Labor sought to put in place that would protect our retirees from unscrupulous investment advisers. Then President Trump comes in with an executive order to undo what the Department of Labor was trying to do. So we shouldn’t be surprised by this action, but we ought to be furious about it. My State, Maryland, was one of the States that tried to figure out how to protect retirees because we couldn’t get it done up here. Now, what are we doing? The party of states’ rights is advancing a Congressional Review Act resolution designed to hinder State legislatures that are working to provide access to safe and affordable retirement savings options for their citizens. We shouldn’t allow this to happen. I encourage my colleagues to reject this senseless resolution. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank all of my colleagues who came this afternoon to speak in opposition to this resolution. It shows how important it is to the working people in our States and in our districts. These are people who do not have a retirement plan. That is who we are looking out for. I urge all my colleagues today to stand up for workers who deserve that chance at saving for retirement and who will get that chance because Oregon and other States have stepped up and are taking action. Again, the Department of Labor safe harbor rule applies to States that have strict investor protections. We wouldn’t be here today if those strict investor protections were not maintained. I especially urge my colleagues, particularly those of us who are concerned about states’ rights, not to undermine States like Oregon and all the others that have stepped up to create these innovative solutions. There is a gap. That is why so many people today do not have retirement savings. Colleagues, please join us in opposing H.J. Res. 66. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and I express appreciation for the full throated debate that went on here. It is good to do that. It is good for the opportunity to make it very clear that retirement security is a significant challenge facing this country. We have said that. I am glad that on the floor of the House today both sides of the aisle indicated concerns for that. Far too many men and women are struggling to save for their retirement years. Unfortunately, in recent years, we have seen regulations like the fiduciary rule that will make it harder for low and middleincome families to save for retirement. And we have seen a regulation that would strip away important protections for retirement savers. As policymakers, we must do more to expand retirement options for workers. That is a given. That we can agree on. However, the regulatory loophole created by the Obama administration is clearly not the answer. I want to remind my colleagues that this resolution does not prevent States from coming up with new retirement options for workers. That is not what this resolution is about, and simply reading it will assure you of that. This resolution is about ensuring every American has strong protections for a secure retirement. I urge my colleagues to protect retirement savers by voting in favor of H.J. Res. 66. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 116, the previous question is ordered on the joint resolution. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint resolution. The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on passage of the joint resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO SAVINGS ARRANGEMENTS BY QUALIFIED STATE POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS FOR NONGOVERNMENTAL EMPLOYEES Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 116, I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 67) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to savings arrangements established by qualified State political subdivisions for nongovernmental employees, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 116, the joint resolution is considered read. The text of the joint resolution is as follows: 
H.J. R ES. 67 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to ‘‘Savings Arrangements Established by Qualified State Political Subdivisions for NonGovernmental Employees’’ (published at 81 Fed. Reg. 92639 (December 20, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force or effect. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG ) and the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 67. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 67, the second of two resolutions the House is debating today to ensure strong protections for retirement savers. There are two parts to the regulatory loophole we are seeking to close today. First, the Obama administration created a sweetheart deal that would allow States to deny important protections for retirement savers. Then, a second regulation was issued to extend that sweetheart deal to cover certain cities and counties. The resolution we are debating right now would block the second regulation and ensure retirement savers in every city are afforded longstanding protections under Federal law. It would also ensure employers continue to have clear rules of the road for retirement plans. The last thing employers, who are trying to provide benefits for their employees, need is a confusing patchwork of rules that vary across cities and counties, even in the same State. As I mentioned during the earlier debate, States and cities should be free to experiment with new ways to help workers save for retirement. All this resolution says is that they must follow the law and provide retirement savers strong protections. That is a commonsense idea that we should all get behind. I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 67. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 67, which would nullify the Department of Labor rule enabling certain State political subdivisions, such as cities or counties, to establish payroll deduction retirement savings plans. Working families across the country deserve the opportunity to retire with security and dignity. That is not a reality for millions of Americans. In fact, about 40 million private sector workers do not have access to retirement savings plans at their jobs and are struggling to make ends meet. Several States, including my home State of Oregon, have developed and are ready to implement innovative solutions that will help workers save for retirement. Municipalities are also interested in stepping up to address this challenge and help their residents save. These are people who do not have a plan currently. They want help; they need help in saving. So in August of 2016, the Department of Labor issued its final rule providing guidance and clarity to States and private sector employees on the kind of Statebased payroll deduction retirement savings programs that would not be subject to ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. As part of that August 2016 final rule, the Department of Labor indicated that it would initiate another rulemaking process to consider whether and how to include other jurisdictions. The Department of Labor invited and considered public comment on this process. As a result, in December of 2016, the Department of Labor issued a final rule that would allow certain localities under specific conditions to establish retirement savings programs. b1530 To be eligible, the locality must have an authority under relevant State law; it must be larger than the least populous State, which is currently Wyoming, at approximately 600,000 residents; it must not be in a State that has already enacted a statewide payroll deduction savings plan; and it must implement and administer the plan for its workers. Now, according to the Department of Labor’s final rule, three cities, New York City, Philadelphia, and Seattle, were identified as having potential interest. New York City’s comptroller has noted that 57 percent of the city’s private sector workers do not have access to a retirement plan at their place of employment. This final rule just went into effect last month, and now my friends on the other side of the aisle are rushing to repeal the rule and prevent the Labor Department from issuing any substantially similar rule in the future. Congress should be in the business of helping people save for retirement, not in the business of unfairly limiting or jeopardizing workers’ ability to save for retirement; nor should Congress go out of its way to undermine the rights of cities and counties to implement innovative solutions that are needed for their residents. I urge my colleagues to reject H.J. Res. 67 and get to work on meaningful solutions to address our country’s retirement security crisis. America’s working families deserve the opportunity to be able to save enough to retire with dignity and security. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. FRANCIS  ROONEY ), who evidenced his complete commitment to meeting the needs of all people by receiving an ambassadorship and performing duties very well to the Holy See. Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 67, a resolution which will protect individual savers for their retirement and small business retirement plans. I was proud to introduce this resolution to affirm the bipartisan protections the ERISA law has afforded workers and retirees for decades. ERISA offers important legal safeguards so workers and retirees will receive their hardearned savings. We need Federal Government policies that will empower workers to save for their retirement and incentivize small businesses to offer 401(k) plans to their employees. H.J. Res. 67 preserves these policies and protections, and will terminate the defective efforts instituted in the last hours of the recent administration, in which they implemented regulatory loopholes to replace private savings for retirement with sweetheart deals for city and Staterun programs with fewer protections and lower standards. The California folks that are in charge of this stuff were quoted in an article in a national publication in the spring, gloating about their exciting win, and that it ‘‘would have no liability or fiduciary duty for the plan. . . . We have been given the green light. ...  ’ ’  The regulation we are terminating here would restrict our hardworking savers from deciding what they can invest in. They will be required to blindly entrust their hardearned money to State and local bureaucrats unless they affirmatively opt out. 
The government will decide what investment options will be available to them. There is a serious risk of political or social investing by these bureaucrats instead of individual investorbased decisions. Worst of all, the regulation which we are abolishing would undermine the very successful 401(k) retirement savings program. Due to 401(k)’s and related definedcontribution plans, savings have gone from $7.8 billion to over $25 billion in about 20 years. It has been a huge success. We should be encouraging Americans and private companies to privately invest in 401(k) plans, which offer three distinct advantages: The contribution amount to a 401(k) plan is three times what can be put in an IRA. Employers match contributions. Many companies match 1 for 1 up to 4 percent of what the employee puts in. That is a powerful incentive for the employee to save. The last thing is, 401(k) plans are protected by the ERISA law. They ensure that workers’ savings are secure. Furthermore, some 57 million Americans currently participate in privately funded IRAs. In the end, the regulations which we are abolishing were just another Big Government mandate to crowd out the private sector. These resolutions will put an end to the Obama administration’s sweetheart deal, and will ensure that private sector workers continue to receive strong protections as they save for their retirement. This resolution will block the chance for cities and States to get their hands on our friends’ and our employees’ retirement savings. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to protect retirement savers today by voting in favor of H.J. Res. 67. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ), the chair of the House Democratic Caucus and a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, sweetheart deals? Since when is it a sweetheart deal to have a modicum of retirement for working poor and middle class people? That is a sweetheart deal? All I hear from the other side of the aisle is people talking about government overreach, executive orders, and unnamed bureaucrats. So it is surprising that today the Republican majority is creating a manmade roadblock toward helping working Americans save their own money for their own retirement. We have all heard about the olden days when, if you worked for a company for life, you could retire with a guaranteed pension. Now, with the exception of union workers, the days of a guaranteed pension plan for most private sector workers are a thing of the past. Captains of industry don’t offer them anymore. They line their own pockets instead. Some employers have tried to fill that retirement income gap by offering 401(k) retirement savings plans. Not a bad thing, but it was not the answer that everyone thought it was going to be, the panacea that everyone made it out to be. But for far too many companies, they don’t offer any retirement package to their employees at all. Today, half of all Americans going to work are not offered a retirement plan from their employer, meaning these workers are not accumulating any nest egg outside of Social Security for their retirement years. To address this growing retirement savings crisis, the Obama administration made it easier for States and large municipalities to sponsor their own 401(k)style retirement plan for their residents who work in the private sector, but are not offered any retirement plan from their private sector job. They are not offered by their employer that 401(k) plan. They have nothing, no opportunity. These rules do not require employees to participate, so the captains of industry who don’t offer their employees a retirement plan, under the Obama administration rules, would not even have to participate. These rules do not require any employer contributions. What these rules simply do is create a pathway for States and large cities, if they choose, to enroll private sector workers into a retirement savings vehicle so they can start saving early to enjoy the benefits of a more financially secure retirement. And what is wrong with that? It is a universal fact that the most successful way to get people to save for their retirement is to enroll them in a retirement plan through their workplace and have a percentage of their pay taken out automatically and invested for the longterm future and for their benefit. So these Obama administration rules were actually adopting best practices to help workers who had been offered no opportunity to save for their retirement, to start to build their own nest egg with their own money for their own future, potentially even investing in a private 401(k) plan down the road. The cruel irony is, if these two bills pass, congressional Republicans will have prohibited States and local governments from trying to help those workers who have been forgotten about by some in the Federal Government and ignored by the private sector marketplace. What ever happened to local government being the laboratory of democracy? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from New York. Mr. CROWLEY. Now, I could understand if Republicans in Congress were working on a national plan to ensure that every American who works their whole life could have some form of guaranteed income in addition to—and not as a replacement for—Social Security. But you don’t have one. You never have. I won’t say you never will, but you don’t have, and you never have yet. Then maybe there would be some justification for the action you are taking today, but that is not the case. In fact, Republicans in Congress have done nothing to protect workers or retiree benefits, and they are the party that wants to privatize Social Security. But today, with these two bills, they go one step further to eliminate the ability of millions of workers from even the potential to enjoy some financial comfort after a lifetime of work. It is time for a progressive agenda for America that puts America’s workers first and their families first. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again, I just—for matters of accuracy about the legislation that is in front of us, I think it ought to be clear that both sides of the aisle can agree that we ought to encourage retirement savings and we ought to be willing to look for choices, opportunities, variety, all of that, and allow States, local communities, cities, to be creative, to look for a means by which we can foster increased retirement savings. All this legislation is doing, though, is saying that we want those approaches to be protected for the retirees. That is all we are saying. We are not opposing States. We are not opposing cities. We are not opposing counties, municipalities, from establishing plans. But we want them to come under ERISA, the same requirements that other people come under, and make sure that people aren’t sold a bill of goods that they lose in the future. That is all we are saying. Mr. Speaker, I just want to make that clear. None of the proposals or the statements that are being made that what we are trying to do is stop people from having retirement options is accurate. We just want them to be protected. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, to clarify further, this rule simply amends the State rule that we addressed in H.J. Res. 66, that gives the safe harbor to jurisdictions with strict investor protections. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT ), a new member of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 67, which is yet another assault on working families. Mr. Speaker, not only are my Republican colleagues launching a broad, overreaching attack on increasing access to retirement savings opportunities for our workers, but through H.J. Res. 67, they are directly targeting my 
home of New York City and the constituents of New York’s 13th Congressional District. Once again, without any regard to the consequences of these reckless actions, Republicans are playing politics with the lives and financial security of our citizens. If passed, H.J. Res. 67 will nullify a Department of Labor rule, just 1 month after it went into effect, that supports the efforts of large cities or counties, like New York City, in establishing retirement savings plans for their residents. This rule is narrowly applied to jurisdictions that are populous enough to be their own State and whose States do not already have provided statewide payroll deduction saving plans. This is to ensure that the policy only goes into effect in cities where the people are in real need. In New York City alone, 1.5 million private sector workers—almost 60 percent of the private sector workers throughout the city—do not have access to a retirement plan through their employer or business. b1545 This rule gives New York City the ability to expand access for private sector workers to retirement savings plans. Rolling back this rule rips the opportunity to save for retirement out of the hands of millions of people. Mr. Speaker, rushing to overturn this innovative rule without offering a single constructive alternative is irresponsible. This is just another example of Republicans attempting to hastily undo provisions that have helped people in real need without even providing a replacement plan to ensure working families have financial security after their retirement. To make matters worse, using the Congressional Review Act to roll back this rule will prevent the Department of Labor from reissuing any substantially similar rule in the future. This is all on top of last year’s Congress’ abuse of the CRA in an attempt to nullify the fiduciary rule, which ensured that the advice workers receive is in their best interest. This only further solidifies that House Republicans are not interested in helping workers. Instead, they are interested in deconstructing rules that protect our workers. House Republicans have failed to pass comprehensive and potentially bipartisan legislation to address our Nation’s retirement security crisis and, instead, are pushing partisan legislation that is harmful to our Nation’s workers. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ) because New York, according to their comptroller, has noted that 57 percent of the city’s private sector workers do not have access to a retirement plan at their place of employment. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, we need to tackle a challenge that is threatening the financial security of the middle class and those who are working hard to remain in it. That is not just in New York City, that is throughout our entire country, but particularly in my home city and my home State, and that is a savings and retirement security crisis in America. The word ‘‘crisis’’ is no exaggeration, Mr. Speaker. Nearly half of U.S. households do not have a savings plan. Less than onethird have a cushion to cover basic expenses for just 3 months if a layoff or other emergency leads to loss of income. The status for retirement savings is even more dire, Mr. Speaker. Remember, one out of every two Americans going to work today doesn’t have a retirement plan provided by their employer. We are seeing a new generation of Americans growing up with little or no savings to help them climb the economic ladder or simply weather a difficult time. Younger workers are trying to save for their children to go to college. They are trying to buy a home or build the emergency fund they will need if their car breaks down. Others are wondering if they can afford to start their own business or have the financial security to leave their job for a better opportunity. Older Americans are looking at retirement and if they will be able to support themselves and maintain a good quality of life without working. We know that savings are the path for middle class families to achieve the American Dream, yet that dream is increasingly being put at risk. We can turn this around, Mr. Speaker. We can put building a college savings account, a nest egg, and a retirement plan back in reach for millions of American families. That is why I have put forward a plan of action entitled ‘‘Building Better Savings, Building Brighter Futures.’’ You can read my action plan on my website at crowley.house.gov. This plan is a comprehensive approach to ensure no American who works their whole life will spend their retirement in poverty. But to get to that point, we need to stop wasting time going backwards. So let’s allow States and local governments to continue to do what they are doing to help those workers who are being left behind now. Oppose these two bills that target workers’ retirement savings, and let’s work towards positive solutions to address the real problems of America’s working families. We can do that with my proposal, Building Better Savings, Building Brighter Futures. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. This has been a good discussion, but I want to reemphasize that there is a need in this country. People are insecure about their retirement. There are too many people—millions of people across the country—who do not have retirement savings. So, today, my colleagues aren’t coming here and saying: We have a plan; let’s help these people save for retirement. Instead, they are going to make it harder for States and municipalities who are stepping up to fill this critical need. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with workers who deserve a chance at saving for retirement and who will get that chance because, as with the State bill, now there are several large municipalities stepping up to help. I urge my colleagues not to undermine the work of those cities and municipalities that are working to enact innovative solutions. Again, these are managed by investment professionals. There are investor protections in these plans. People do not have to participate, but they are hungry for this opportunity. Millions of people across the country are watching. Where is the solution? Let’s not get in their way. Please join me in opposing H.J. Res. 66 and H.J. Res. 67. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate the fullthroated debate that went on here in the discussion of a most important issue. I am grateful that ERISA was in place for my father, a tool and die maker, a machinist. He didn’t have pensions, but he was able to, as a result of making littlebylittle allocations to a retirement savings plan, set aside money to make sure that, most specifically, my mother was taken care of— and she was—as a result of protections that were put in place, requirements that were put in place, and a savings plan for retirement outside of any pension. Her basic needs were cared for until the end of her life. So I certainly resonate with the desire to make sure middleincome, middle class families, and everyone has the opportunity for secure retirement savings. We all support creating new options for retirement savers. Unfortunately, the regulatory loophole created by the Obama administration is not the answer. Every American, regardless of what city or State they live in, deserves strong protections and secure retirement. That is why, for over 40 years, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act has been the law of the land. Denying those longstanding protections to certain workers is a completely backwards approach that undermines the retirement security of working families, and I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don’t want that to happen. We agree on that. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.J. Res. 67 to ensure workers and retirees in every city across the country continue to have the legal safeguards they need to retire with security and peace of mind. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 116, the previous question is ordered on the joint resolution.

DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO DRUG TESTING OF UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION APPLICANTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The unfinished business is the vote on passage of the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 42) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to drug testing of unemployment compensation applicants, on which the yeas and nays were ordered. The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the joint resolution. This is a 5minute vote.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: OFFICE OF THE CLERK , HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, February 15, 2017. Hon. PAULD. R YAN, The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. SPEAKER : Pursuant to the permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Clerk received the following message from the Secretary of the Senate on February 15, 2017, at 3:59 p.m.: That the Senate agreed to without amendment H.J.

APPOINTMENT OF MEMBERS TO THE HOUSE COMMISSION ON CONGRESSIONAL MAILING STANDARDS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair announces the Speaker’s appointment, pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 501(b), and the order of the House of January 3, 2017, of the following Members to the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards: Mrs. DAVIS, California Mr. SHERMAN , California Mr. MCEACHIN , Virginia 
b1715 EYES IN THE SKY: FLIGHT ATTENDANT SAVES VICTIM OF TRAFFICKING (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on a recent flight, flight attendant Shelia Fedrick of Alaska Airlines noticed a young girl, 14 or 15 years old, with blonde hair. Shelia approached two individuals, but the young girl refused to speak or make contact with her. The man next to the girl was defensive as she tried to make conversation. Something was just not right. Shelia quickly devised a plan. She convinced the girl to go to the bathroom where Shelia had left a note stuck to the mirror. The girl wrote back on the note, and she needed help. The flight crew quickly alerted the police on the ground. Shelia Fedrick ended up saving a victim of human trafficking. Traffickers often ship their victims across the country like baggage. The Department of Homeland Security and flight attendants are working together through training to spot warning signs of modernday slavery. Thanks to Shelia Fedrick and other flight attendants for their work in rescuing victims of trafficking. We must continue to stop traffickers in their tracks. And that is just the way it is. f 
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on an issue that is of critical importance to every person in this room, every father, mother, every family in our Nation. That issue is our national security. While the resignation of General Flynn was appropriate, it has led to more questions than answers. One of the most important, who directed General Flynn to do what he did? In my 27 years as a law enforcement officer, I have conducted both internal and criminal investigations at the highest level of law enforcement. I understand the importance of seeking the truth through such investigations. In a time of confusion and uncertainty, the American people deserve answers and transparency. That can only come through a thorough, bipartisan, independent investigation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to join me in calling for a thorough investigation. I know they understand the gravity of this issue and believe it is our duty to work together to keep our Nation safe. 
OUR NATION’S INFRASTRUCTURE (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, California has been blessed with a lot of rain this year, a lot of snowfall in order to alleviate a drought. It has gone a little extreme here, but we are still thankful for the water. I would like to report that Lake Oroville is stable right now with the dam, and the spillway situation is such that they are working very hard to make sure that that will be something, if we get continued rainfall, we will be able to handle the new load. I also want to commend and thank President Trump for his very rapid reaction to our request for emergency help from the Federal Government on Oroville Dam. His team responded very quickly to our ask, and he understands and is working for infrastructure needs and repairs across this whole country. He also understands that it isn’t just about building new things, but it is going back and repairing our aging infrastructure, whether that is our highways, our bridges, or what needs to be done, like on Oroville Dam spillway. So I appreciate that. Again, my full thanks to President Trump’s staff, as well as the President himself, on his speedy response to our need. 
HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN CAMBODIA (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, last week, Congressman STEVE CHABOT and I, as the cochairs of the Cambodia Caucus, called upon Secretary Tillerson and the administration to prioritize human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in Cambodia. Just days later, Sam Rainsy, the leader of the opposition party in Cambodia, resigned in the face of a proposed bill that would dissolve the opposition party if he continued to lead the party. This law on political parties would give the government farreaching powers to suspend political parties at will. I urge the Cambodian National Assembly to set aside this undemocratic law that dangerously moves Cambodia toward being a oneparty state, and to allow the Cambodian people to freely choose their own leaders. 
ONLY CONGRESS HAS THE POWER TO DECLARE WAR (Mr. DEFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have just seen a news report that the President may invade Syria with ground troops. Now, I criticized former President Obama for his actions in Libya, Iraq, and Syria, without seeking authorization from Congress, and leaning on the weak need that these were somehow authorized back in the AUMF after 9/ 11. This is far beyond the scope of that resolution, which I helped write, so to have a ground invasion of Syria, without authorization from Congress, will trigger the War Powers Act. Let’s be clear: The Constitution says, once we are at war, the President runs the war as Commander in Chief. But it is only the United States Congress that has the power to declare war, authorize war, which this essentially would be. So the President must come to the Congress and ask for a new Authorization for Use of Military Force before launching any ground invasion of Syria. 
SEATTLE’S DIVESTMENT FROM WELLS FARGO (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my hometown, the city of Seattle, on its historic decision to terminate its $3 billion relationship with Wells Fargo Bank over its financing and support of the Dakota Access pipeline. Last week, the Seattle City Council voted unanimously to divest from Wells Fargo, making it the first major city to do so. Led by Native American and environmental activists, our city made an important statement about the vision that we have for our community and for our world. That vision centralizes both the rights of our native brothers and sisters, and our environment. Just like it did with the $15 minimum wage, Seattle continues to be a leader and a model for the rest of the country, and activists and cities around the United States have picked up the torch. We stand united in prioritizing our environment, as it is deeply connected to the health of our communities. Rather than allowing dangerous pipeline projects to continue, putting millions of people at risk, we should be focused on being leaders in the international fight against climate change. I am committed, Mr. Speaker, to taking every opportunity to protect our resources and fight for a bold alternative energy plan that includes a just transition that creates great union jobs and puts us on a sustainable path forward. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE HONORABLE JOHN MERCER LANGSTON (Mr. MCEACHIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Honorable John Mercer Langston, who served in the 51st Congress as the first African American Congressman from Virginia and, incidentally, represented the same district that I do, Virginia’s Fourth. Representative Langston became the fifth AfricanAmerican man to graduate from the Oberlin Collegiate Department, and continued his education at Oberlin to receive a master’s degree in theology. Although he was deprived of admission to law school, Mr. Langston studied law under Philemon Bliss and passed the bar in 1844 to become Ohio’s first AfricanAmerican lawyer. Mr. Langston’s passion to uplift the Black community was demonstrated through the organization of State and local antislavery societies, his efforts to assist runaway slaves, and through calls for social reform. Among his many other life accomplishments, Langston also served as the president of what is now known as Virginia State University. I have great respect and appreciation for Mr. Langston and the life he led. Not only will his legacy live on through his descendants, but through myself and all of us who occupy this great hall who fight for the spirit of equality and justice. 
RUSSIAN INFILTRATION (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it is literally every day now that something new and even more shocking comes out about the Trump administration and its connections with the Russian Government. Just last night, it was reported that, according to American intelligence officials, at least four members of the Trump campaign, senior members, were in constant contact with Russian intelligence officials for a year. Mr. Speaker, this is not so much about Republican or Democrat as it is about democracy, our democracy. I want to thank those few Republicans in the Senate who have had the courage to put country before party and come forward and demand an independent, bipartisan investigation. Sadly, that has been met with silence on the Republican side of the aisle in this House. We must have a 9/11like commission to investigate to what extent Russian intelligence infiltrated our election. f 
MUSLIM AND REFUGEE BAN (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I want to read a letter from a Syrian refugee to the interfaith coalition sponsoring his family, which settled in Bloomfield, New Jersey, last month. Muhammad is a father of four. His family was one of the last to arrive prior to the signing of President Trump’s ban. Muhammad wrote: 
I feel ashamed when I repeat the words: Thank you. I feel it’s very few and very weak in front of your interest and your generosity. The first thing I want to learn in the English language is how I can thank you more and more. America is beautiful because you live in it. 
These are the kind of families the Trump administration wants to turn away. They are the oppressed and the persecuted, the kind of people this country was founded for. I understand the need to vet people coming to our country, and the importance of protecting our Nation’s security. No one questions that at all. But we cannot close our country to refugees like Muhammad and his family. We cannot sacrifice what it means to be American. Muhammad is right, America is beautiful, and we can keep it that way by remaining a beacon of freedom and hope. 
APPOINTMENT OF MEMBER TO BRITISHAMERICAN INTERPARLIAMENTARY GROUP The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BERGMAN ). The Chair announces the Speaker’s appointment, pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 276l, and the order of the House of January 3, 2017, of the following Member on the part of the House to the BritishAmerican Interparliamentary Group: 
b1730 THE BLUE COLLAR CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, we are going to talk today about something very important: our economy, jobs, and the state of America in regards to those subject matters. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN ), who is a good friend of mine, our colleague, and our assistant leader, to come address us on a very important issue that relates to many of those things that we talk about. I would like to invite Leader Clyburn to come and talk to today. I really appreciate his coming and taking the time to be part of this hour. Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman VEASEY , from the great State of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as part of the observation of Black History Month to continue my series of remarks recognizing HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and Universities. I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina. Founded in 1870, just 5 years after the end of the Civil War, by the American Baptist Home Mission Society, Benedict was originally named Benedict Institute, after Stephen and Bathsheba Benedict of Rhode Island, Baptist abolitionists who had donated the funds to acquire the property on which the campus sits. Formerly the site of a pre Civil War plantation, the first classes were held in a dilapidated mansion on the grounds. Benedict Institute was formerly chartered by the South Carolina General Assembly in 1894 and renamed Benedict College. From its founding through 1930, Benedict was led by northern White Baptist ministers. In 1930, Reverend John Starks, an alumnus of Benedict, became the school’s first African American president. The heart of its campus has been designated the Benedict College Historic District, consisting of Morgan Hall, Pratt Hall, Duckett Hall, Antisdel Chapel, and Starks Center. Like Allen University, its neighbor, Benedict College has a long legacy of activism for civil rights and social justice. One of the very first civil rights campaigns in South Carolina was organized at Benedict College in 1937. Students participating in a national NAACP campaign led a demonstration in support of antilynching legislation pending in Congress. One of Benedict’s early graduates was Reverend Richard Carroll. Born into slavery in Barnwell, South Carolina, Reverend Carroll was a prominent Baptist minister in the late 1800s who received honors and appointments from both President William McKinley and President Theodore Roosevelt. Other prominent alumni include Modjeska Simkins, a prominent civil rights and public health champion; General Matthew Zimmerman, who served as Chief of Chaplains of the United States Army; and I.S. Leevy Johnson, the first AfricanAmerican president of the South Carolina State Bar Association. In the modern era, under the leadership of President David Swinton, Benedict has grown to a student body of more than 2,800 undergraduate students. In 1995, Swinton revived the football program and marching band 30 years after they had been shut down. He also championed a new sports complex on Two Notch Road in Columbia, which includes a football stadium, tennis courts, baseball fields, and fitness facilities. The liberal arts curriculum now offers degrees in 30 different disciplines. President Swinton also has led the efforts to preserve and restore many of the historic buildings on the campus, in part paid for with Federal funds from the HBCU Historic Preservation Program that we in this Congress have championed. President Swinton will retire this summer after 23 years of service to the institution. I wish him well and thank him for his leadership. Today, on the same land where Blacks once toiled in slavery, their descendants are now learning the tools they need to live up to Benedict College’s motto: to be powers for good. Like so many HBCUs, Benedict offers a unique religious experience in which students from many different backgrounds share a common struggle for equality, and I am pleased to recognize them today. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the leader for his comments and for participating tonight. I really appreciate his words and that recognition. I want to thank everyone that is with us today to talk about our Blue Collar Caucus and jobs in this country. I think that there is nothing more important to any individual—any man or woman—than the ability to be able to have a good job, to take care of your family, and to be able to be a part of the American economy and to contribute to that economy. I want to start off talking about President Barack Obama. Under President Barack Obama, the American economy added 9.3 million jobs and overcame one of the worst economic crises our Nation has ever seen. In Arlington, Texas, which is part of the district that I represent in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, we have a General Motors plant. As you know, we could have lost our car industry. We have probably the most profitable plant in the General Motors family. All of the cars that you see around here at the Capitol, all of the Yukons, all of the Suburbans, the Tahoes, the Escalades, we make those in Arlington, Texas. We are very proud of our plant, very proud of the company being there all those years and for the UAW workers there that help make that plant great. Despite the gains that we have seen with President Obama’s saving the auto industry with the 9.3 million jobs and our overcoming one of the worst economic crises, again, that our country has ever seen, many workers across the U.S. felt that the economic recovery had left them behind. The rise of automation and outsourcing pushed many of those workers out of jobs that they absolutely loved. The frustration felt by these workers is understandable. Everyone—everyone—wants a good job that lets them, for their family, be able to take care of themselves, be able to pay their bills, send their kids to college, and buy a car. President Trump appealed to many bluecollar workers during his campaign with a populist message and pledges to help working America, but his actions since taking office directly contradict so many of his promises. President Trump is playing one of the slickest political scams we have ever seen on hardworking American families. It is a scam. It is not real. On his first day in office, President Trump signed an executive order that raised mortgage rates for new homeowners. Those same people that live in those Rust Belt States are those same individuals that were Democrats that went on television and went on social media and said they were going to give this guy a chance. What does he do on the very first day? We are going to raise interest rates on new homeowners, people trying to live the American Dream. There is nothing more that embodies the American Dream than being able to buy that first home. It was a slap in the face to those blue collar workers and a boost to Wall Street. President Trump also signed an executive order that made it easier for Wall Street bankers to make money on risky bets. His Labor and his Treasury Cabinet nominees both have track records that are very unfriendly to the middle class and have no understanding what middle class workers face. It is clear that President Trump does not have a plan to fight for the working man and woman as he promised on the campaign trail. That is why my colleagues and I—BRENDAN BOYLE who is here with me from the State of Pennsylvania, we formed the Blue Collar Caucus to address challenges facing 
bluecollar workers in today’s economy. We are going to stand up to the Trump administration when he turns his back on working class America. Our mission is to listen directly to middle class America’s concerns and translate their needs into policies that allow them to adapt to the changing job market. We have to be able to equip our bluecollar workers with training that leads to jobs and opportunities. We just can’t say ‘‘job training.’’ Those training opportunities have to lead to something of substance, which is a real job with a paycheck and some benefits. This year alone, the U.S. is expected to add 2.5 million middleskill jobs, the majority of which employers are telling me—and they have been to my office, and Mr. BOYLE has probably heard the same thing. They are saying that these jobs are hard to fill. The Blue Collar Caucus is going to prioritize training and retraining initiatives to provide real opportunity and security to working class Americans. I have a lot more to say, but I do want to turn it over to BRENDAN BOYLE  from Pennsylvania, my good friend, who also has the same passion to represent and really stand up for working class America, for bluecollar America—not just promise them things, not just get them pumped up with a bunch of hype, but to really talk about real policy initiatives that will help them be able to put some food on the table, put some money in the bank, be able to buy that first house and buy that car that they always wanted. I thank the gentleman very much for his dedication to bluecollar America. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. I am very excited to be joined in this effort with the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, this comes out of a number of conversations that my colleague, MARCVEASEY , and I have had just in the back of this Chamber about both of our experiences growing up, which are very similar, coming from working class or bluecollar parents who worked very hard to make sure that their children had opportunities that they may not have had. In many ways, that is the American experience: people who work hard, play by the rules, pay taxes, raise their kids, and hope that their kids will have opportunities that they didn’t have. That is what built the American middle class. What is so difficult about the time in which we are living is that it is not just about an economic growth that is 2 percent; it is not just about the statistics that we often cite on this House floor. It is about a loss of hope in the power of the American Dream. There was a statistic that came out— having just said it is not about statistics, let me cite one—that I think is, in fact, very telling and really shocking. Ninetytwo percent of the World War II generation went on to earn more than their parents did. For the generation of which I am a part and MARCis a part, taken at exactly the same point in life, that figure is exactly onehalf—46 percent. Consider another statistic. Compared to the year 2000, in inflationadjusted figures, the middle class has less wealth today than at that point 16, 17 years ago. That is the only decadeand ahalf that you can look at in American history in which the middle class is worse off than the decadeandahalf that preceded it. So while these are presented as just ‘‘economic issues,’’ really, they are much more than that. They strike at the very heart of who we are as Americans and what we stand for. So we are going to be talking, as part of this caucus and over the next close to an hour or so and for many weeks and months to come, about what we can do specifically for the bluecollar economy, for those who work with their hands and for those who have been, in many ways, held back because of transitions that our economy has faced. I have many things that I want to talk about as part of that, but I don’t want to go on too long because we have been joined by someone who doesn’t just talk the talk, but has walked the walk, a union worker himself, an ironworker, I believe, a good friend of mine from Massachusetts, and someone who works hard himself both in his previous occupation and now standing up and fighting for working people. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of Massachusetts (Mr. LYNCH ). b1745 Mr. LYNCH. It is wonderful to join Mr. BOYLE and Mr. V EASEY from Texas. I thank them for creating the Blue Collar Caucus. I think the time is perfect for the challenges that we face as a country, and I think also, as a Democrat, embracing some of our tradition. I think, in some cases, we have drifted from that. I do want to talk about the bluecollar economy and what is happening to people who work in the building trades and work as truck drivers and nurses and people who are really the backbone of this country. As BRENDAN mentioned, I was an ironworker for about 20 years. I know what it is when you are trying to work from paycheck to paycheck, strapping on a pair of work boots every single day. I also want to focus tonight on one part of Mr. Trump’s executive orders and policies that have really hurt people in our demographic: regular working people. I want to speak specifically about veterans. As most people heard, President Trump, when he came into office, initiated what was called a Federal worker hiring freeze, stopping any workers from going to work for the Federal Government. I just want to remind people out there that about 30 percent of those workers are veterans. So 30 percent of the people who go to work for the Federal Government are veterans. By putting a freeze on Federal workers, you are blocking almost one third of workers who are veterans who would be trying to go to work. The Federal Government is expansive. That includes workers at the VA; it includes workers at the FAA; it includes workers at the Defense Department, the State Department; on and on and on. So this is really freezing out veterans from going to work. I had a young veteran in my office the other day who had some skills in radiology. He learned that through his military service in the Navy, but also when he got out, with the GI bill, and trying to go to work at the VA. I had to explain to him that President Trump, when he came into office, put a hiring freeze on, and that we were going to have to try to figure out another way to put him to work. Well, that case is playing out over 50 States, and thousands—probably tens of thousands right now—of veterans are being denied the opportunity to go to work for the Federal Government. Many of them have skills that are necessary. We have people retiring and leaving Federal employment on a daily basis. We have nurses that are retiring at the VA and folks that work for the EPA are leaving at the end of their working lives. They are retiring. Yet, we are blocking these veterans from filling those positions because of the President’s hiring freeze. Seeing that, I actually drafted a bill that I am happy to share. It is H.R. 1001. It will basically create an exception. It will keep the President’s freeze in place, except for veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan, veterans who have served in previous conflicts. Anyone who has put on this country’s uniform as a veteran would be exempt from the hiring freeze so that we can do the right thing. Each and every one of these young men and women—and there are a lot of women—I have been to Iraq 17 times now; Afghanistan, about 9 times; and I am amazed at the number of young women who serve our country in uniform. I already have, including my colleagues here, 23 Democrats who have signed on. I would love to get some of my Republican friends on this bill. This should not be a partisan issue, trying to put veterans to work. I am sure we have got some good Democrats and Republicans out there that agree on this, and this should be a bipartisan issue. We can stop the—let’s be hopeful it was unintended consequences of the hiring freeze. We can stop this by coming together. Sign onto H.R. 1001. Again, I thank my colleagues for their advocacy on behalf of workers. I notice today that the President’s nominee for Labor Secretary, Mr. Puzder, who had a very bad record with workers, withdrew his nomination. He has withdrawn from consideration. I think it is because of the hard work that Mr. VEASEY and Mr. B OYLE have done in speaking out on behalf of American workers and pointing out the 
bad decisions and the wage and garnishment issues that Mr. Puzder had. I just think that their advocacy helped enormously in having him withdraw that nomination. I thank my colleagues again for the great work that they do on behalf of all American workers, and I appreciate their service to the country. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. B OYLE ). Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. We are planning, actually, to talk about someone who was, quite frankly, the worst Labor Secretary nominee in our Nation’s history; literally putting the fox in charge of the henhouse. You can tell I am from the city because I botched that metaphor, but maybe MARC will be able to help me with that. To put someone in charge of the Labor Department who had a complete history of ripping off fast food workers, paying in some places, in some Hardy’s, below minimum wage because they were falsely classifying workers, I can’t think of really someone who, in many ways, epitomized the kind of greed that we see in our economy today than the former Labor Secretary nominee. That actually works to a point that I wanted to raise. I think it is a big part of what has been happening in our American economy today. In the postWorld War II era, for roughly three decades we had large gains in productivity and large gains in wage growth. That is from roughly the mid1940s to about the late 1970s. You saw workers becoming more productive, working harder and smarter and better than ever, and you saw wages growing to almost exactly the same percentage: 97 percent increase in productivity, 91 percent increase in wage growth. But then, over the last 30 years, something quite different has happened. The productivity growth has continued. The American worker is more productive than at any point in our Nation’s history and is the most productive workforce in the world. That is not boasting; that is an economic fact. Yet, since the 1970s, wages have barely gone up at all. Those are the averages. That doesn’t account for the fact that when you are talking about the bluecollar economy, when you are talking about those who don’t have a higher education, when you control for just that group, wages are actually lower today than they were 30, 40 years ago. Now you might wonder: Well, how are CEOs doing? Have they shared in the pain? Well, 50 years ago, CEOs made 20 times what typical workers make. As of 2013, they make just under 300 times a typical worker’s pay—from making 20 times more than your average worker to more than 300 times your average worker. I believe in capitalism and I believe in the market, but clearly something is deeply wrong in our economy, the structure of it, when we have that sort of situation, when workers are not being rewarded for their hard work. I recall my colleague, Mr. VEASEY , talking a little bit about his family experience and the similarities to my own and the fact that bluecollar workers like our parents actually have fewer opportunities in America today than they did when we were growing up: fewer job opportunities for lower wages and not as rich benefits. I say not as rich benefits, but, actually, very insecure benefits in terms of health care and a lack of a defined pension. If Mr. VEASEY would possibly talk more about that and other parts of the heart and soul of our Blue Collar Caucus. Mr. VEASEY. One of the things I remember growing up in Fort Worth, Texas, was that we were blessed to have several manufacturing facilities that were union shops. We had General Dynamics, which is now Lockheed Martin. When I was growing up, it had about 30,000 employees out there. We had Bell Helicopter, which is owned by Textron now. There are lots of employees out there. We had Miller Brewing Company, which is still there. Now it is MillerCoors. We had several places, like General Motors, which I think I mentioned a little bit earlier. So we had several places that had good benefit. I had family members that worked at many of those places. Good benefits, good jobs that people could really be proud of. One of the reasons why we have seen the decline of pay in this country is because of the Republicans and their efforts to undermine labor. When you start talking about undermining labor and when you turn on these talk radio shows—you turn on The Rush Limbaugh Show, you turn on Mark Levin, you turn on these shows— they are always talking about how bad unions are in this country. But when I think about my own experience growing up in Fort Worth and I think about towns like White Settlement; towns like Benbrook; the community that I grew up in, Stop Six and Como; and I think about the middle class jobs that many of these union shops brought to all communities, again, whether it was the White community, the Hispanic community, or Black, they allowed people to be able to put some food on the table. I have got to tell you, I was really kind of tickled and shocked at the same time by an article in the opinion section in The Wall Street Journal back on September 3, 2015. It was titled: ‘‘The Shop Steward in the White House.’’ It was taking a shot at President Obama for all of the things that he was doing for American workers, and many of the things that the Wall Street guy that wrote the article was complaining about, saying all these things about President Obama, they were all actually really good things that the President was advocating for. My question and what I want to know and what I want Rust Belt workers and people all around the country to ask: Is this Presidency, is this administration going to embody and really embrace those same principles that were talked about for President Obama when he was really trying to protect these workers? Is this President going to do the same thing? Are his partners in the legislative branch, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Senators on the other side of the Capitol that are Republicans, are they going to also stop going after American wages, stop going after American workers and their benefits, and start standing up for these workers so they can put some more food on the table? That is what I want to know. Those are the type of questions that we should be asking and we should be talking about. President Trump can put out a statement on this right now if he wanted to, but obviously he has a lot of other things going on. The DavisBacon Act, as many of us know, is the rule that ensures all Federal contractors are paid a fair wage while they are working on public works projects. If there was ever a repeal of Davis Bacon, we would see a decrease in the quality of bluecollar jobs, and we can absolutely not afford that. Stagnating wages, like I talked a little bit about earlier, has left workers unable to care for their families. As a result, one third of bluecollar families are enrolled in one or more social safety net program. That is not what bluecollar workers want. They want the ability to be able to take care of their own families. They don’t want these social safety net programs. They want to be providers and be proud of their jobs. The Blue Collar Caucus intends to defend the DavisBacon Act and fight any attempts to decrease wages for America’s already struggling working class. We know that we can build an economy that works for everybody if we just work together. So work with us as we stand against President Trump’s unfulfilled promises and stand up for these bluecollar workers. That is what we want our friends on the other side of the aisle to do. But what I would really like to see right now, even before President Trump reaches out to, again, his Republican friends in the legislative branch, is for him to come out and make a statement for these bluecollar workers, for these people in the Rust Belt, for these people in the South, for these people in DallasFort Worth, and all over the country. I want him to come out and make a statement on where he stands on DavisBacon. b1800 It is one thing to just talk in broad categories about bringing jobs back to 
our country, stopping our jobs from going overseas. This is an actual policy that we know has been good for many workers in Mr. BOYLE ’s district and in mine and, again, everywhere. Where is the President on this issue? Why is he not saying anything about Davis Bacon? I want to hear what he has to say. I know that Mr. BOYLE knows about just how important things like DavisBacon are and other issue areas are. Another area is the Supreme Court nominee, Mr. Gorsuch. Where is he going to rule when it comes to working families? That is what I want to know. That is the type of thing that I hope that people on the factory floors and shops across this country start talking about is how is this man going to rule? We already know that he has made several bad rulings as it relates to working families, rulings that will directly affect how big their paychecks are, literally has made rulings that have taken money right out of their pockets, right out of their bank accounts. Those are the types of things that we need to be talking about, not all this 35,000feetupintheairtype stuff, but actual policy details that we know can impact and hurt families. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, MARC is exactly right. I was so glad that he brought up unions and the important role that they play because when I talked earlier about the fact that for 30, 40 years we had an economy that was working well, that saw productivity gains but also wage gains in roughly equal proportion. And then suddenly in the last 30 years you have seen that change. You have seen the productivity gains continue, but you have seen wage growth at practically zero. Well, it is not a coincidence that for three, four decades you had strong unions, from the mid1940s until about the late 1970s or so. They were there fighting for workers, fighting for increased wages, fighting for a secure retirement, fighting for real health benefits. Then you saw an economy beginning in the early 1980s where the power of unions declined. The number of workers involved in the workforce who were unionized declined. I don’t think it is a coincidence that just as you saw the number of workers in unions decline and the number of unions decline and the power of unions decline, you also saw real wages decline. Certainly no coincidence. For 70 years, worker wages and the strength of unions have moved in tandem, going up together or going down together. Critical to the strength of the American workforce are provisions like DavisBacon that have existed since the late 1940s that guarantee a prevailing wage on Federal projects. It helps not just those workers who are unionized. It lifts all workers because when you have a union that is out there fighting for higher wages and fighting for better benefits for its members, it helps all workers. It helps all of those in the workforce. I talked earlier, and I was thinking about this when MARC was talking about his family’s experience in those towns in the DallasFort Worth area. I remember from my own family’s experience, we were very lucky that my dad, without a college education, with the equivalent of a high school education, after many years of trying, was able to break in to Teamsters Local 169 as a warehouseman. It simply means he worked in a warehouse for Acme Markets. He did that for 25 years. There were a couple thousand such workers who were employed in the city of Philadelphia. Then in the late 1990s, around the year 2000, they closed all those warehouses. They laid off close to 2,000 workers. They decided that they would set up shop, instead, in a place where they could pay the workers half the wages, reduced benefits, and not as many workers. Fortunately, things worked okay for my dad. He ended up on his feet. He spent the last 16 years as a worker, as a janitor for SEPTA, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. Many of the guys who got laid off in their 50s and 60s weren’t as lucky. Many of them never found, again, a job as well paying or as secure. Some of them turned to alcohol. Some of them turned to drugs. A couple even committed suicide. Again, I want to show that these are not just economic issues. Sometimes the elites—and I mean elites not just on the Republican side; elites of all political ideologies— sometimes look at these as just economic issues. They are reallife issues. When we see the diseases of hopelessness that are happening right now in places like western Pennsylvania or Texas or Kentucky or, really, all parts of our country—and, by the way, White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, what we are talking about touches all races, all ethnicities, all backgrounds—these diseases of hopelessness that have been on the dramatic rise are a real problem for our society, but to look at them as just a drug problem or just an alcohol problem or just a mental health problem and not see the economic link is very naive and incomplete and will never solve the real problem, go to the heart of solving the real problem. Mr. Speaker, MARC and I both look forward—he had mentioned it to me— to periodically coming to this House floor and talking about this new President’s record when it comes to addressing these issues. He talked a lot during the campaign, made a lot of promises. He is great at making promises. In fact, you would probably say he is the best ever at making promises. Well, we are going to be showing his record, to see if he is keeping those promises to the American people. On some issues, he sounded like a Democrat. On some issues, when it came to infrastructure or trade, he said things that I can agree with and do agree with. Now that he is President, let’s see if the record matches the rhetoric. We are going to be here to hold him accountable, to hold both sides accountable because, you know, the fact is this town, for many decades, has not looked out for the bluecollar worker. We are quick to indict the other side where they are wrong, and I think appropriately so. This Blue Collar Caucus is for all those who really want to make a difference in the bluecollar economy, for those who want to put the American worker first and foremost. I can say President Trump is not off to a great start with some of his Cabinet picks, who look more like the board at Goldman Sachs than any union hall. I hope that this first month will not be a sign of more to come, but whether he is getting an A or an F, we are going to be here to grade his performance on these reallife, meatandpotato issues that matter to the vast majority of American families. Mr. Speaker, MARC and I represent two different regions of the country, two different areas, yet, in many ways, exactly the same kind of folks. I wanted to know what MARCis hearing as he goes out into his community in Fort Worth about how things are going for American workers and what they want from this administration. Mr. VEASEY. Absolutely. When I am back in the district in the DallasFort Worth area—and Dallas and Fort Worth are the two most recognizable cities that I represent in the district, but there are other cities. We have Irving that is there, we have Grand Prairie, we have Arlington where the Cowboys stadium is located, and a lot of people are asking: When are we going to get these good jobs back? We want to see some of these good jobs come back. I have got to tell you, the President made a lot of promises when he was on the campaign trail about bringing some of these jobs back, and I want to see those jobs come back, too. I think that with everything going on right now, with the resignation of General Flynn and there being so much talk about campaign operatives on the Trump campaign talking to Russian intelligence officials, I think that he is going to be too distracted to help these workers. I think that Republicans are going to be too distracted to help these workers in the Rust Belt, to help these middle class, these bluecollar workers. I have got to tell you, during our retreat last week while we were in Baltimore, I opened up The Wall Street Journal first thing in the morning. I saw this article about how—and it was about jobs still pouring in to Mexico, and it was really one of the saddest things that I ever read. For some manufacturers, Mexico is still the best move. They specifically were talking about a corporation called the Rexnord Corporation. It really broke my heart when I was reading the articles about how they were asking the workers at this plant 
in America, in our country, to actually train individuals from foreign countries to replace them. They wanted them to train them for the jobs that they currently had here in our country and asking them to, you know, train these people so we can ship your job out of the country and you can be replaced. How demoralizing to go to work knowing that you are training someone next to you for your job to be sent overseas or sent out of the country, your livelihood, everything that you have known. For a lot of these little, small towns, these companies really are the face of the town. In Texas, and I am sure it is like this in Indiana and in other parts of the Rust Belt and other parts of bluecollar America, Friday night football is a really big deal, maybe the local high school basketball game is a really big deal, but also that ranks right up there with both of those two athletic activities in these towns, their identity is driven by their job. I thought that was such a sad commentary about where we are now. Again, with all of the executive orders, when you start talking about the travel ban on citizens from Muslim countries, when you start talking about the executive order to raise interest rates on firsttime homeowners, no executive orders whatsoever to protect the American worker. We are a month into the administration. No executive order, no action, no comments on DavisBacon, nothing to reinforce the fact that we are with these guys, and it is really sad. I am sure that these workers out there, in America, in New Jersey, in other States, I bet you they are sitting back watching, saying: How in the world is this President going to help us with all of the distractions that are going on over there? When is he going to help us? He has done all these other things with the executive order, why not do something for the American worker? Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. We have been joined by DONALD  NORCROSS , our colleague within the Democratic Caucus and here in the House, and my neighbor from just the other side of the Delaware River. MARC brought up football a couple times. Yes, he is a diehard Cowboys fan. Well, as a Philadelphia Eagles fan, I am glad to have been joined by another Eagles fan, someone much like STEPHEN  LYNCH , someone who doesn’t just talk the talk but has walked the walk, who has worked with his hands and is someone who brings great credibility to these issues, as someone who himself was out as a bluecollar worker every day and now gets the chance to fight for them here on the House floor where that fight is badly needed. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS ). Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank BRENDAN —Representative BOYLE —and M ARCfor putting together a Blue Collar Caucus just to remind ourselves what we should be doing here is focusing on jobs. Jobs, which is the best social program I have ever been with. I entered my professional life as an electrician, as an electrical apprentice. I went through the other 4 years of school. It was called an apprenticeship. I worked on bridges, refineries, pipelines throughout the Delaware Valley. I understood how tough it is sometimes for people to make it. When work got slow, we got laid off. We collected unemployment. Those are the struggles that men and women in our great country are going through each and every day. If anything, this last election cycle reminded us of that, that sometimes the dignity of being able to take care of your family, send your kids to school, and retire with dignity is the most important thing we can do. b1815 I have seen firsthand what happens with minimum wage. They tend to think it is all a bunch of kids flipping hamburgers. Well, it is much more than that. It is a woman I spoke to, who had a child 8 years old, who had to work two jobs just to make sure that in the winter, when her daughter needed a coat for winter, that she could take care of her. And she recalled to us how badly she felt that her daughter’s teacher for PTA wanted her to come in and help. She had to decide whether or not to keep food on her table or participate in her child’s school. That is a tough decision when we both want to help. When we look at what we have done as a country, as compared to elsewhere in the world, it is very different when we look at the blue collar, particularly in the building trades where I came from. Throughout Europe, particularly in Switzerland and Germany, they look at working with your hands with just the same dignity as going through college. This country doesn’t always do that. Guidance counselors tend to push them into college as the only measurement. College isn’t for everybody. I have three brothers. They went the traditional college route. I decided I really enjoyed working with my hands. I went and became an electrician. Those jobs, we are on over 20 years ago, I still talk to my kids about it today—the dignity of working with your hands. This country is starting to change, particularly when you need an electrician. When Mr. BOYLE ’s lights in his house go out, who does he call? That electrician is worth his weight in gold, isn’t he? And I know Mr. BOYLE ’s story. His parents came over here as first generation and are living the American Dream. They have to be so proud of him. And in Mr. VEASEY ’s district, those refineries are important for jobs, as they are in mine. I think we absolutely have to keep the focus on making sure that we have renewables, that we have clean energy. But we also understand with each of those decisions comes whether or not somebody is going to be able to go home and say: Honey, I lost my job today. Today was a remarkable day—the first withdrawal of a nominee for the Department of Labor. And I guess this is where, during the election cycle, I see the difference. It is very clear that the President wanted to talk about jobs, good jobs, putting America back to work. And then we have the secretary nominee put up—who talks about minimum wage is a bad thing, talks about robots are things you don’t have argument with. He wants to outsource. That is not the way to rebuild the economy. Mr. BOYLE talked about the discrepancy between those who work for a living, the average worker on the line, and those who are the CEOs. When I grew up, there was an implied partnership with so many of those companies. Those who went to work in a firstgeneration company, that CEO knew every employee’s name. But time after time, when that company gets sold, that disconnect comes in. They forget about that. And that is where those relationships, that partnership that is so important, starts to break down. We had a conversation in our Education and the Workforce Committee the other day about the NLRB, which is the group from the Department of Labor that judges whether or not elections with unions are done fairly. There was a suggestion somehow that they are not being treated fairly. It couldn’t be any further from the truth. If workers want to have a voice, they should have that voice and choose whether or not they want to join with the union. That is the American way— that democracy. Yet, the nominee for Labor wanted to do away with the NLRB. In fact, when we look at the total case history, it is like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse, unless, of course, you own the henhouse, and then it is okay. I want to finish up by saying to Mr. VEASEY and Mr. B OYLE how appreciative I am of keeping this focus on the forefront of what we do here in Congress. I created a Building Trades Caucus, along with a colleague, Mr. MCKINLEY , out of West Virginia. We could try to move this forward, create an infrastructure package that puts America back to work and keeps our roads, our bridges, and our grid safe. Let’s remember one thing: a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work and the dignity of a job. I appreciate what you have done. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS ). I really appreciate his heartfelt words. I thank him for telling us about his journey, employment, and how much electricians mean to this country, and other people that work with their hands. I think it is sad that in a lot of our public schools that type of work has 
been—quite frankly, there is no other way to say it—some of it has been put down. But those workers are important. We need to stop having people rank jobs and make sure that we know that all jobs in this country are important. Since 2000, the United States has lost about 4.8 million manufacturing jobs. That is a 29 percent decrease in jobs for bluecollar workers. Again, manufacturing jobs are goodpaying jobs. Manufacturing jobs pay about 20 percent higher than service jobs do. So any manufacturing job that we lose in this country is bad. One of the saddest stories—and there are so many sad stories about these plants that have closed down, and so much of the focus has been on the Rust Belt, and rightfully so. And MARCY  KAPTUR may tell me if I am pronouncing the name of this city correctly. But there is a story about the closing of a Rubbermaid facility in a place called Wooster, WOOSTER. They said that they were shutting down this Rubbermaid facility in Wooster, Ohio, but they were going to keep the big outlet mall open. And I thought to myself: How in the world can people afford to go to the outlet mall, or any shop, if the jobs are gone? It is just another sad story about how America is losing manufacturing jobs. Luckily, we have people like the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ), who fights for her State and fights for manufacturing jobs, and not just in her State, but for the entire country. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. KAPTUR for her dedication to the working class men and women in this country and for all bluecollar workers. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ). Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. VEASEY ) for his great leadership in bringing us together in this Blue Collar Caucus. I feel very comfortable. I actually have blue on today. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. B OYLE ) of the greater Philadelphia area, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS ), and myself from the Toledo to Cleveland, Ohio, part of our country to bring to the attention of the American people the fact, for example, that workers in northern Ohio, since the year 2000, earn on average $7,000 less than they did at the beginning of the century. They have taken some great hits. They are hardworking people. They are fighting back, but they need our help. In the last 3 weeks, if we take a look at President Trump’s term thus far, we begin to see the real Donald at work, if I might quote one of the news media. After months of grandiose campaign promises to renegotiate NAFTA, bring back American manufacturing jobs, and make America great, we can begin to assess where he is putting his attention. I think this is really important for us, as we represent bluecollar America, what is he doing for them. I think the proof is in his actions, or lack thereof. After roughly 20 executive orders and actions, we see President Trump has a penchant for mediagenic events and moments with a hodgepodge of executive orders, but apparently not sending any legislation up here yet. And most striking is his clear motivation to assist his wealthy friends on Wall Street with appointments to the administration, such as Secretary of Treasury, rather than paying attention to average Americans who voted for him. He exhibits a great penchant for public approval rather than a focus on efforts to improve the current economic stagnation of average Americans. We are noting that he is filled his Cabinet with billionaires and multimillionaires who simply can’t figure out how to walk in the shoes of blue collar America. His actions to help the wealthiest Americans will have significant consequences. So what happened with his promise to drain the swamp? I thought in the first month we would have had something that would really resonate out in the heartland. While all of this happens just miles away at the White House, our Republican congressional colleagues remain either silent or moving the car in reverse. Why would they criticize activity that helps those who fund their elections? We need campaign finance reform to dominate their political focus and write their policy objectives, like taking away today here in the House the ability of workers to save money for their own pensions, for heaven’s sake. In Trump’s first days, he took action to roll back the financial reform bill called DoddFrank and tried to eliminate protections for seniors as they seek retirement investment advice. We know there are a lot of sharks out there in the financial waters. Why wouldn’t you want to help the American people rather than hurt them more? He did nothing to address the trade issues, which were in his power to do on day one, and propelled his victory through our part of the country. I note my colleagues come from Texas, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and me being from Ohio. It was actually the Midwestern States that lifted this President to victory. He hasn’t declared China as a currency manipulator. He could have done that already. He had no elimination of the Buy America waiver, which affords access to U.S. Government contracts for all firms and goods from 45 World Trade Organization nations and 16 additional U.S. Free Trade Agreements that exist. Not a word about that. No NAFTA renegotiation. He could have pulled the plug on that on day one. Nothing. Where is the negotiating team in place to take care of what NAFTA has done to the people of the heartland and our country in general? What will President Trump do for ongoing negotiations he inherited on the U.S.China Bilateral Investment Treaty, the Trade in Services Agreement, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership? Will he put American workers, global workers, and environmental concerns at the forefront of negotiations? Or will he continue to allow corporate and wealthy financial interests to dominate and run roughshod over workers and communities? Candidate Trump promised the 15,000 steelworkers laid off due to a flood of unfairly traded imports that he would support America’s manufacturing and industrial base. He came to Ohio and said that. He promised to protect our industries from the Chinese and to keep jobs at home. But in the pipeline of executive action, he actually enforced the trade agreement Buy America waiver, negating his promises to help America’s steelworkers. How about that? That was done in the first month. Just recently, the U.S. Department of Commerce released a report that showed the U.S. trade deficit hit a 4 year high as it rose to over half a billion dollars for 2016. Middle America isn’t surprised this trade deficit continues to hollow out U.S. manufacturing jobs and depress incomes across our great Nation. Reducing our trade deficit should be a top priority for the new administration. I hope the President puts a big scoreboard in front of the White House on his progress on this front. It would do wonders to fix the economy for working Americans if we balanced that trade deficit. As Congressman VEASEY has said, the Democratic Party has long championed issues for bluecollar America that create real life success for working class people. Lost in the political dialogue is the reality that Democrats have always stood for individual and economic rights for average Americans of all backgrounds. Each of us in our own lives represents that, and it is a privilege to serve here in this House. For bluecollar families, education remains a vital steppingstone in upward mobility. Democrats continue to prioritize early childhood literacy and STEM education, efforts to make Americans globally competitive in advanced manufacturing, science, medicine, and research and development. Democrats continue to expand apprenticeship options to allow young people to enter the workforce trained and without the enormous burden of student loans. Meanwhile, Republicans push policies that exacerbate the everexpanding wealth gap, even allowing it to invade our school systems. Just watch the opposition Mr. Trump and his newly minted Education Secretary Betsy DeVos have towards public schools. In closing, let me thank our esteemed leaders here in the Blue Collar Caucus, Congressman VEASEY and Congressman BOYLE . I don’t see that this 
President is draining the swamp. He is actually digging deeper into it. I really thank them for being an accountability wing here in the first branch mentioned in the Constitution—the legislative branch. I congratulate both of them. It has been a great privilege to join them this evening. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative KAPTUR and everybody that has participated tonight. I yield back the balance of my time. 
b1830 ISSUES OF THE DAY AND REFLECTING BACK The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, in our Judiciary Committee today, we have been marking up what should have been a couple of rather simple bills, but it is really as if the instructions on the Sorosfunded website, manual, things telling people how to obstruct the current majorities in the House and Senate and administration, could possibly be carrying over here into the Capitol itself because there are so many amendments being offered and things being drug out and people saying the same thing over and over. It is about Russia and corruption and one thing and the other—on and on and on. It is just interesting when people are talking about their dramatic concerns over Russia, who, for years, have been totally silent. When everybody I know of on the Republican side here had been asking that President Obama and his administration do something about the terrible hacking problem from Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, he didn’t seem terribly bothered. I mean, it was as if he were afraid he might hurt Putin’s feelings or Khamenei’s feelings in Iran and maybe they would want to kill Americans in a more brutal way, the Iran terrorists being paid. I can’t help but think that there will be people in the next 4 years who are Americans, who are Muslim, Jews, Christians—especially those groups—who would be killed because of the billions and billions of dollars that this administration forced into the hands of the largest supporter of terrorism in the world: Iran. It was as if the world—and in particular, the United States—had not been punished enough for the mistakes of the Carter administration in thinking that by pushing the Shah of Iran— not a great man. Apparently, he could be pretty brutal in his own right, but he kept radical Islam at bay. When President Carter encouraged his forcing out of office, much as President Obama did the same thing with the President of Egypt, in both cases, it created a vacuum that was immediately filled by radical Islamists. The Muslim Brotherhood is who filled it in Egypt. In Iran, yes, it was radical Islamists. And probably for the first time since the Ottoman Empire, radical Islamist leaders were given a country, a country’s military with which to wreak their havoc on the world. It is just hard to believe that, in the intervening years between President Carter leaving office in January 1981 and President Obama coming in in January of 2009, all history had been forgotten or possibly even not really learned. I guess, if you are learning at the hands or at the feet of Jeremiah Wright, who has such contempt—GD America was his feelings and expression—or if you are at the feet of Bill Ayers, who felt that blowing up police stations, things like that, hadn’t quite served the purpose, or perhaps if we take over educating college students who will one day train elementary students and high school students, then we can ultimately create the anarchy that we were trying to create in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Back then, we were unsuccessful, but great inroads have been made here recently. You would just have to believe that America was the problem for the world in the last 100 years, and apparently there are those who feel that way. But for those of you who have talked with friends of different religions— Muslim, Christians, Jews, secularists— in different parts of the world, those who are actually fair minded make it very clear: the United States has been the greatest force for good as a nation that the world has ever known since the Dark Ages. It just has. And thank God we have had such wonderful allies in the endeavors that we have undertaken. Of course, in the liberation of Kuwait from Saddam Hussein’s hands, we had many other countries who joined us. President George H.W. Bush was going to liberate Iraq. So many Democrats had screamed at President George H.W. Bush as troops were moving into Iraq after the liberation of Kuwait, screaming: Stop, stop, stop. They are giving up. They are giving up. President George H.W. Bush ordered the stoppage, and immediately thereafter, the Democrats that screamed for him to stop began berating Bush because he didn’t finish the job in Iraq. Some of those same people were around to condemn his son George W. Bush when he actually did finish the job. There was yellowcake uranium that was taken out which showed that Joseph Wilson had apparently said one thing to CIA agents and testified to something totally different, who said something totally different from his original interview when he got back from Africa. Of course, he was heralded a hero by the mainstream media. But it has just been amazing to see the ebb and flow of international relations. And reflecting back as I did earlier today, as so much from my Democratic friends in Judiciary was made about connections between the Trump administration and Russia, it is just hard not to remember so vividly the comments by Mitt Romney in a debate with President Obama in 2012 that Russia was potentially the greatest threat. I may be mistaken, but it seems like President Obama even said something glibly like, you know, ‘‘The 1980s called and they want their foreign policy back,’’ something rather cheeky like that, when, actually, my friends across the aisle, in Judiciary at least, have come to realize that that was one thing Mitt Romney was right about and President Obama was wrong about. But if you look at what the Obama administration did, as soon as President Obama took office, instead of taking a principle stand—and I know there was a lot of perceived hatred by those coming in with the Obama administration for George W. Bush. Perhaps it goes back to President Obama’s days when he was growing up in Indonesia and he commented in his book, ‘‘Dreams from My Father,’’ about how his stepfather was apparently paid off by these fatcat guys from Texas, oil guys, fat cats from Texas and Louisiana, something to that effect, and you realized, holy smokes, he has had a great disdain for Texas, for Louisiana going back to, you know, preteen years. You couldn’t help but wonder if, in policies, it was carried through. Of course, he didn’t appreciate his stepfather for working, and working with the Americans back in those days. But perhaps that has affected him. So if George W. Bush took a principled stand against Russia after Russia assaulted the independent nation of Georgia—I mean, some of us remember that President George W. Bush, trying to look for the good in people, came back from meeting Putin and said, you know: I looked into his eyes and saw his soul. He thought that is what he saw—may have been looking into shark eyes. But in any event, he soon learned the error of his ways. And that is one of the things I liked about President George W. Bush. If he made a mistake, he was big enough to say that wasn’t the right way to go, and he would try to fix it. That is exactly what he did in his relationship with Russia. When Russia attacked Georgia—unprovoked, really—President George W. Bush, his administration, properly took a very principled stand. Some didn’t think it went far enough, but he immediately caused a cessation of the great relations that had been going on and took some steps to chill those relations because of Russia’s unilateral attack against Georgia, hoping to wake Putin up that you can’t just go attack a neighboring country like that. Even if you want the old Soviet Empire back, you can’t just do that without repercussions. So because of Putin’s imperialistic attack, Bush took a strong stance and let Russia know: We don’t approve of what you have done, and we are cooling things, we are freezing things. 
One of the first things that occurred after President Obama took office, he sent his new Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, to meet with the Russians and they had this red plastic button—looked pretty cheap, but it was supposed to have said ‘‘reset,’’ but apparently, they couldn’t get the translation right. I am not sure what it said, peregruzka. I don’t know what it said. I don’t know what it was. But somebody that didn’t know how to translate ‘‘reset’’ put it on and delivered the wrong message. But the more important message that Secretary Clinton and President Obama delivered to the rather ruthless imperialist leader of Russia was this: George W. Bush overreacted when you attacked your neighbor, Georgia, Mr. Putin, and we want you to know, we don’t have a problem with you attacking Georgia, attacking your neighbors, trying to take over their territory. So we are here with big smiles and big laughs because we want to be such a good friend of yours, and we think it is perfectly fine what you are doing. We think you are terrific. b1845 That is the message after Bush let Putin know: Wait a minute. We are not going to let you be the big bully in the world. Enough. But the Obama administration sent a very clear message: We are not Bush. We don’t have a problem with you attacking Georgia. And it is hard to think anything but that message that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, as our President, sent to Putin was clear: We would be okay if you attacked Ukraine, Crimea. You know, we are okay with that. If it is adjoining, yeah, yeah, attack away. What else is Putin supposed to think when President Bush reacts harshly when he attacks a neighboring country, and the new President comes in and says: We are fine with everything you are doing. We are nothing but smiles and plastic red buttons. We are good. We don’t mind anything you have done. We want to be your good friend. If the message from that was not clear enough, before he was reelected in 2012, a microphone he didn’t realize could pick him up, picked up our President telling the President of Russia: Basically tell Vladimir I will have a lot more flexibility after the election. Well, now that could only have one meaning, and that is, I got to look tough and like I am standing up tough to Putin right now before the 2012 election, but make sure Putin knows that after the election I can give the farm a whole lot easier. I can let him do a whole lot more that he wants to do. We can be a lot more chummy once I get past my second and last election as President. So you make sure Vlad knows—my bosom buddy over there, my best friend forever—I am going to be able to work with him like he wants me to once I get past the next election. So with those kind of messages, then, as if it wasn’t enough, followed up by another message to Russia and the world when he stated that, basically, if President alAssad in Syria used gas on people in Syria, that would be a red line. And if he crossed it, obviously we would have to do something. He created a red line. Nobody asked him to. Putin picks up messages like that. For all of the problems he presents, one problem he does not present is where he stands, where he wants to go, and what motivates him. He’s very clear. I have never met the man, but I have studied enough about Russia, and I have learned enough about Putin to know exactly who he is, what he is capable of, what he wants to do. And it is pretty clear: He wants to rebuild his empire. He hates the United States. He blames the United States for the fall of the glorious Soviet Union, that great USSR that once ruled the waves and the world. He wants a grand return to those days, and he wants to be the leader like Khrushchev or Brezhnev. Really, he would rather be in the nature of Stalin. As Stalin himself once said, a translation: With power, dizziness. Stalin said that, and he should certainly know. I think probably Putin has run into that as he has gotten all this glamour. During the Obama years, so many magazines and journalists just couldn’t get enough of Putin with his shirt off. I mean, it may have helped the sex status of—as the status symbol of people who were bald. Maybe I should be proud and happy for that, but it didn’t seem to affect me at all. But there was so much laid on the shoulders—the mantle laid by the Obama administration on the shoulders of Putin. And when that didn’t seem to work out very well, it looked like the next big step was to ingratiate this Nation’s Presidency, administration to the most evil leaders in the world, those who are leading Iran. They can be an evil empire all by themselves. They have wreaked so much havoc in the world. So many of the Americans that died liberating Iraq, lost their lives at the hands of IEDs or other weapons of war inflicted on them by Iranians—are sent to Iraq from Iran. There is a big price to pay for mistakes in judgment of Presidents. I believe Donald Trump will ultimately end up being one of the greatest Presidents in foreign relations because I think he is going to figure out, as George W. Bush did, Putin is not someone you can trust. You need to understand where he is coming from and where he wants to go. And you can use him when it is to our advantage against a common enemy. But make no mistake, he would glory in the fall of the United States. He is wrong about why the Soviet Union fell. It fell because it was based on communism, totalitarianism, and it was destined to fall. I could see that during the summer that I was there as an exchange student, and I went out to a collective farm. And being from East Texas, I worked on farms and ranches. And during summer, as this was sometime in July, I went out to a collective farm there; and there were massive acres, huge numbers of acres out there. I couldn’t really tell what was being cultivated and what wasn’t, what even the crop was. It didn’t look good. It was brown. I couldn’t get over how sad things looked out there. This was down in the Ukraine, the bread basket of what was the Soviet Union at the time. I know that if you are going to work around the latitude that that was in Ukraine—similar to ours back in Texas—in the summer, you best start around sun up so that you don’t have to work when the Sun reaches its hottest time in the day. Seeing all of the farmers gathered in the shade there near the center of the village—a little town they had there— they were all sitting in the shade midmorning. I tried to use my best Russian that I could speak at the time and asked them, tried to use a smile: You know, when do you work out in the field? They laughed. I thought, well, maybe I messed up a word and made it into a weird translation. Then one of them spoke up in Russian, and he said: I make the same number of rubles if I am out there in the field or if I am here in the shade— if I am out there in the Sun or here in the shade, so I am here in the shade. I thought at the time that is why socialism, communism could never work. If you are going to pay people the same thing not to work as you do the people who are working, then eventually most people are not going to work. It is a good thing to have a safety net for those who, through no fault of their own, find themselves unemployed; but you can’t turn into a Socialist nation where you reward people—provide the safety net, sure—but you can’t provide incentives to sit in the shade and not work at all. Because eventually some day, your people will go hungry and your nation will fail as a nationstate, and it did. There were many factors that contributed, but the bottom line is that type of system can never work in this world, in this life. The Pilgrims tried it in that beautiful Mayflower Compact where they were all going to work and bring into the common storehouse and share. It was just a beautiful, lovely way to approach things. I have loved looking, as I did last night, at the painting there in the rotunda reflecting the Pilgrims’ famous prayer meeting there in Holland. It says ‘‘Speedwell’’ right under the platform where they were. They were on the ship, the Speedwell, before they left in two ships—the big Speedwell and the small Mayflower—and went over to England. The Speedwell, the big ship that was going to allow them to take so many more to the new land, America, began 
taking on water, for whatever reason. There were different things said about what may have been the cause. But for whatever reason, they had to do a bit like Gideon did. They had to winnow it down to the people that had the best chance of making it to America so they could fit on that small Mayflower. So they winnowed the group down. They came over on the Mayflower. It was a beautiful thing, loving, working hard as they did. But when such a huge number of their settlers died during that first winter, basically, the short version, they ultimately tried something new resembling private property: You take your property. You grow. You use it however you want. And whatever you grow and produce, that is yours. It’s amazing that worked out so well. Unlike the collective farms in the Soviet Union, there was incentive to work hard, produce, and people thrived, did so well. That actually gave a lot of incentive to others. Hey, this private property thing can work out well. Here, all these years later, we have people wanting to go back to that way of life that has failed every time it has been tried. Even when the Apostle Paul tried it, he ultimately had to throw up his hands and say: Okay. New rule. If you don’t work, you don’t eat. Because the socialist way of doing things in this world is not going to work. I am glad that my friends who were so vocal about not wanting a strong relationship with the current leader of Russia, I am glad they finally realized what those of us on the Republican side—most of us—have been saying for a very long time. Yeah, we can work with the Russians to defeat our common enemy, but you should never lose sight of the fact Putin does not really want us for friends. He wants to see this country gone. He wants to see our way of life fail. So just don’t lose sight of that. It is also interesting—we had amendments being proposed today with the same theme being repeated constantly about a Muslim ban, in essence, that we should not ever take religion into account when it comes to immigration. That has no place. Yet, when our chairman, one of our other Members brought up the—I believe it was RAU´LLABRADOR —the Lautenberg amendment that so many of us support, when you know a group of people—such as the Jewish people in another part of the world—are being killed and they are being persecuted, when we know that is taking place, it is a good thing to consider who they are and that their religion is being persecuted. When there are Christians in another part of the world being persecuted beyond what other religions are, it is a good thing to try to help them. b1900 When there were Muslims being persecuted in Eastern Europe, the Clinton administration responded, came to their aid. And for those that say, gee, standing up to radical Islam will only encourage more recruitment—my word—how much worse can it get than it has gotten during the last 8 years? There was no ISIS. President Obama took office, Afghanistan, they were still fighting; but actually, the Taliban had been totally—any organized Taliban had been destroyed by February of 2002, and we hadn’t lost a single American life. We had used—we had let the Northern Alliance, residents, citizens in Afghanistan, we let them fight our enemy because, though they were Muslim, most of them, they didn’t want radical Islamists running Afghanistan. A mistake was made after our friends in the Northern Alliance totally routed the Taliban. We sent in tens of thousands of American troops, and our friends, who loved us and heralded us for our liberation from the Taliban in Afghanistan, began to look at us as occupiers. I have been to Afghanistan enough. I have seen the way that relationship has gone, from us being the heroes that liberated their country from these radical Islamists that were a bane to the existence of just peace loving Muslims wanting to live and not be terrorized by radical Islamists, and somehow we ended up becoming bad guys to so much of the country because of our massive presence. I do believe, Mr. Speaker, there is potential with all of the chaos that is beginning to raise its head again in Afghanistan. I heard a report this morning that Afghans had confided to a Republican here in town when he was over there visiting that alQaida is even back in Afghanistan. So it is not just the Taliban back stronger than ever; now alQaida is back in Afghanistan. And what was the cost to America, to our military over the last 8 years in allowing the Taliban to come back stronger than they were originally, to alQaida, to come back in Afghanistan stronger than they were originally? My personal opinion, I believe it was because of President Obama’s rules of engagement. But we lost four times more precious military lives in Afghanistan during President Obama’s command than were lost during just under 8 years under Commander George W. Bush. How could we lose four times more American military and suffer such a setback over the last 8 years, where we are back maybe a little worse off than things were when we went in to Afghanistan in October of 2001? Well, it has to do with the commitment. I heard former Vice President Cheney say that when President Obama announced he is committed to Afghanistan and he sent a surge into Afghanistan, he also announced, what seemed almost simultaneously, and we are going to be out in 18 months. As we know from history, nobody that ever won a war, a police action, a confrontation, ever set a deadline: We are going to win by this date or we are coming out, whether we have won or not. That message went out loud and clear to the Taliban that was growing back that if we can just hang on for 18 months, we will own Afghanistan all over again. I understand that, apparently, General Harwood, that has apparently been named by President Trump as the new National Security Adviser—and Mr. Speaker, I am sorry. I have got to say this because of what Billy and Karen Vaughn have come to mean to me since I met them some years back, after the death of their SEAL Team 6 son, Aaron. Gosh, I have come to know—I never met him while he was alive, but I have come to know him and feel like I knew him as a friend and as one of his admirers, vicariously, through his parents, Billy and Karen. When I heard the general’s name come back up as one of those being considered, I thought, oh, please, surely not, because Billy and Karen made clear, you know, as family members were finding out what happened there in Afghanistan that took the most SEAL team lives we had ever had, they went onto a Chinook that should not have carried our SEAL team members. They went onto this Chinook and, supposedly, going on a mission, and yet because of the rules laid down by President Obama and his administration, they had to make sure that the Afghans knew exactly what was going to occur, where they were going, what they were going to do. Even knowing that after Vice President Joe Biden’s gaffe, where he released classified information, that it was the SEALs who took out Osama bin Laden, it wasn’t supposed to come out. It was another gaffe. But immediately, Bill and Karen said, after Biden outed the SEALs and it came out it was SEAL Team 6, they got a call from Aaron saying: Hey, you need to get off social media. The radical Islamists are going to be looking for us, for our family members. So this administration put big targets on SEAL Team 6 by disclosing classified information that ultimately led to their deaths, and it put targets on family members of SEAL Team 6. I know they didn’t mean to do it. I know it wasn’t intentional. They just didn’t realize how serious things were. I know they must not have realized, or at least President Obama must not have realized, how serious it was when I watched the video of the gentleman that was called his body man, was with him through so many days, and he was answering questions at a university in California. It has been some years back that I watched. But he was asked, in effect, what was it like being with President Obama when he went into the room where they were watching SEAL Team 6 go after Osama bin Laden. He basically said: Oh, we didn’t stay in there long. The President looked in but said, ‘‘I’m not watching this,’’ and they 
went and played cards, several hands of cards, while the SEAL Team 6 was putting their lives on the line for their country. So if that is your way of thinking, then it is understandable that you wouldn’t appreciate the dangers in which you put SEAL Team 6 when you out them as the people who went after Osama bin Laden. But they knew, and the chatter was clear, and it was loud. They wanted to take casualties and get a price back with lives of SEAL Team 6 members. The mission that they were on should have ended right then, when the Afghan commander came up. They knew where they were going. He comes up and pulls off their elite soldiers, off the Chinook helicopter, and replaced them with people whose names were not on the manifest. Well, under the rules, that should have ended the task, should have ended the operation right there. They were told to go on, so they went—I have seen the transcript of testimony, statements—by gunship, C–130 gunship in the area. They had all kinds of imaging. And this isn’t classified because this was on the DVD that was given to the family members. They were later asked if they would give it back. They didn’t realize quite how much information they had put. Yeah, they sure didn’t because the family members, like the Vaughns, watched it, read it, found out what was on it. We had a C–130 gunship, and I—my 4 years on Active Duty in the Army, I was never in combat. I think we should have gone into combat in Iran when an act of war occurred and our embassy was attacked. But that was CommanderinChief Carter’s call, and he decided not to send anybody. I think if he had responded within 48 hours and said, ‘‘You either release our hostages, or we are sending our United States military, and you better not hurt them or there will be a powerful price paid by you and your country,’’ I think they would have released them. I think that is why, probably—I mean, I was watching closely from Fort Benning. All of us were watching the news. Were any of us going to be sent? The Ayatollah had a spokesman. I have not seen anything about it since I watched back in those days, ‘79, but I recall him. It was very interesting. For a few days, he kept distinguishing that it was the students that attacked the U.S. Embassy. It was the students that had the hostages. I said to some of my Army friends at Fort Benning: I think he is afraid Carter’s going to send our military, and he is using the students as a back door for him. So if Carter shows a backbone and says, ‘‘You either release our hostages or we are sending—you are going to feel the full vengeance of the United States military,’’ they had a back door. It gave the Ayatollah an opportunity to save face by saying: You don’t have to do it. We have negotiated with the students. Here are your hostages back. You don’t have to invade Iran and take out our administration. See, we are your friend. We helped you out. But after a few days, I am not sure exactly what it was, but after a few days, it was clear, I think, to the Iranian leaders that this President is not going to do anything. He is just going to ask us to let their people go, and so we don’t have to worry. They began to say ‘‘we have the hostages’’ because they knew Carter wasn’t going to do anything. I still believe, based on what I learned at Fort Benning, that if President Carter had allowed all the helicopters to go that I was told were originally requested, then there would not have been one chopper—they had to have six to be able to make it the 500 miles into the staging area there in Iran. As has come out publicly, they all knew, if we don’t get six choppers out of the—eight was all the Carter administration would allow to go. They should have sent 12 because they expected to have a 50 percent loss, turbine engines going across sand like that 500 miles. They knew they had to have six or the mission was an automatic abort. As we know, when only five got there and it was clear there was not another one coming, then it was aborted. As I understand, the investigation indicated the helicopter pilot, as sand swirled around his chopper, must have gotten vertigo and not relied on his instruments. The helicopter tilted. The blade went through the C–130, and everybody on the chopper and the C–130 was killed. b1915 But, once again, we were embarrassed because we didn’t have a Commander in Chief that was totally committed to doing what it took to get our hostages out. Again, I will always believe, if he had shown a backbone within 48 hours of our embassy being attacked and our hostages being taken, there would be thousands of American military lives still in being today. So having witnessed firsthand lessons of poor decisions by Commanders in Chief, having seen the data, the statistics of dead American military in Afghanistan, four times more under Commander Obama than under Commander Bush in approximately near the same amount of time, we haven’t learned the lessons of the past very well. I feel absolutely confident that the President is going to learn his lessons. He has made a couple of mistakes. And certainly I agree, you can’t have a National Security Adviser that is not completely honest with the Vice President and the President; you just can’t. You have to be able to totally trust him. That has been a problem in our intelligence community. They were leaking and undermining President Bush, and now it is happening again to President Trump. So as I was talking about SEAL Team Six, these devastated families that had lost the greatest military members that we could have lost at that point, their every life is just priceless, invaluable. But there was so much money spent in training up these SEAL teams. It is an investment. You need to make sure they have the right equipment, that you don’t have Afghans pulled off that are the best fighting members that Afghanistan has, and you put what they considered expendable Afghanistan soldiers on with our elite SEAL Team Six, especially when you know there are targets on their backs. But when the families met General Harward, they said they were just so crushed, they were so devastated, and they found out that this AC–130 gunship, that there were opportunities to take out this patrol, this team, that shot down the Chinook and our SEAL team members. And there were other precious American lives on that helicopter in addition to the SEAL Team Six members, and they should not be shorted in when we owe them and their memories. But they asked if they had an opportunity to take these guys out. And the crew said they did. They had the thermal imaging. They could see these guys moving like military. They could see them moving up to the high point and getting ready to fire. They asked for permission to take them out, and they were denied permission to take them out. They watched them fire over and over at the helicopters with the rocketpropelled grenades apparently of some kind, and they missed with the first one. As I understand it, they were still not allowed to shoot them down, take out the Afghan rebels. They fired again, and they fired again. And the second and third took out our precious American military members along with those precious Afghan lives who should never have been on that helicopter to begin with. Then they watched them dismantle their equipment and start to climb down. They asked permission to take them out, it is my understanding, and, once again, they were told there may be civilians in the area, so, no, do not fire; and they watched them fade back into the population of Afghanistan after killing so many of our SEAL Team Six and others on the helicopter. They asked the general who is now apparently going to be our National Security Adviser: Why didn’t you take out these people, these Afghan radical Islamists? Why didn’t you take them out before they took out our military members, our SEAL Team Six? Why? His statement, from their memory, as related to me, was, in essence: Because we were trying to win hearts and minds. Our National Security Adviser is going to be more interested in—or at least he has in the past—apparently has been more interested in winning hearts and minds of people that hate our guts than he is of protecting the most precious assets the United States of America has: American lives. 
We haven’t won any hearts and minds by allowing SEAL Team Six—so many of those members on that Chinook—to be killed. We haven’t. That strategy didn’t work. I am sorry. I want to be supportive. I was excited President Trump won, but when I know how this man, who I understand today has now been named to be the new National Security Adviser, was given the task of encouraging and being empathetic to the family members who lost those precious American family members in that Chinook that should never have been shot down, it should never have been allowed to take off, and the best he could do is say: Sorry, they had to die because we were trying to win hearts and minds instead of win the war. I hope that his mentality has changed. I hope he will not be willing to expend the best trained, the best and brightest military members we have, as he tries to win hearts and minds instead of trying to win a battle and win the war; but I guess time will tell. Mr. Speaker, I want to finish by saluting all those brave Americans that have defended freedom, that have fought for America, and who have responded in a voluntary military since 1979 and given their lives at the hands of radical Islamists. I hope and pray this President will pick people from here who will have the same feelings about precious American lives. I know Donald Trump does, and I think he will be a good President. I think he blew it on this call, but time will tell. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
INTERNATIONAL HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) for 30 minutes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome my colleague, Congressman JOECROWLEY , the chair of the Democratic Caucus who is joining us this evening as well. I know how very busy he is, and I appreciate it. As author of the legislation that created our Nation’s World War II Memorial here in Washington, I felt obligated and actually compelled to come to this well tonight. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the Trump administration’s hollow January 27 statement commemorating International Holocaust Remembrance Day. 
STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT TRUMP ON INTER NATIONAL HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY— JANUARY 27, 2017 ‘‘It is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust. It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror. ‘‘Yet, we know that in the darkest hours of humanity, light shines the brightest. As we remember those who died, we are deeply grateful to those who risked their lives to save the innocent. ‘‘In the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good. Together, we will make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world.’’ Ms. KAPTUR. Astoundingly, the White House statement made no reference to the 6 million Jews that perished in the Holocaust. There was no mention of antiSemitism nor a reference to Israel, as has been customary in prior statements issued by our past Presidents. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a statement by President George Bush in 2008. 
ON THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF COMMEMORA TION IN MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE  HOLOCAUST —JANUARY 27, 2008 On the third International Day of Commemoration, we remember and mourn the victims of the Holocaust. I was deeply moved by my recent visit to Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust museum. Sixtythree years after the liberation of Auschwitz, we must continue to educate ourselves about the lessons of the Holocaust and honor those whose lives were taken as a result of a totalitarian ideology that embraced a national policy of violent hatred, bigotry, and extermination. It is also our responsibility to honor the survivors and those courageous souls who refused to be bystanders and instead risked their own lives to try to save the Nazis’ intended victims. Remembering the victims, heroes, and lessons of the Holocaust remains important today. We must continue to condemn the resurgence of antiSemitism, that same virulent intolerance that led to the Holocaust, and we must combat bigotry and hatred in all forms in America and abroad. Today provides a sobering reminder that evil exists and a call that when we find evil, we must resist it. May God bless the memory of the victims of the Holocaust, and may we never forget. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I will also include in the RECORD a statement by President Barack Obama from 2015 showing what the White House said about Holocaust Remembrance Day. 
STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT OBAMA ON INTER NATIONAL HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY 
AND THE 70THANNIVERSARY OF THE LIBERA TION OF AUSCHWITZ BIRKENAU —2015 On the tenth International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the 70th anniversary of the liberation of AuschwitzBirkenau, the American people pay tribute to the six million Jews and millions of others murdered by the Nazi regime. We also honor those who survived the Shoah, while recognizing the scars and burdens that many have carried ever since. Honoring the victims and survivors begins with our renewed recognition of the value and dignity of each person. It demands from us the courage to protect the persecuted and speak out against bigotry and hatred. The recent terrorist attacks in Paris serve as a painful reminder of our obligation to condemn and combat rising antiSemitism in all its forms, including the denial or trivialization of the Holocaust. This anniversary is an opportunity to reflect on the progress we have made confronting this terrible chapter in human history and on our continuing efforts to end genocide. I have sent a Presidential delegation to join Polish President Komorowski, the Polish people, official delegations from scores of nations, and many survivors, at today’s official commemoration in Poland. As a founding member of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, the United States joins the Alliance’s thirty other member nations and partners in reiterating its solemn responsibility to uphold the commitments of the 2000 Stockholm Declaration. We commemorate all of the victims of the Holocaust, pledging never to forget, and recalling the cautionary words of the author and survivor of Auschwitz Primo Levi, ‘‘It happened, therefore it can happen again....  I t  can happen anywhere.’’ Today we come together and commit, to the millions of murdered souls and all survivors, that it must never happen again. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: between 1933 and 1945, 14 million unarmed men, women, and children were murdered in Eastern Europe. These bloodlands were where most of Europe’s Jews lived and where Hitler’s and Stalin’s imperial plans overlapped. Of the 14 million human beings who were killed, at least 6 million were Jewish souls. Their carnage was the largest in human history. Thus, the brevity of the Trump administration’s statement was surprisingly and unusually short and general—only about 100 words. When the White House was asked about these glaring omissions, multiple officials in the new administration at the White House merely confirmed ‘‘the statement was no mistake.’’ The Trump White House statement chose not to explicitly acknowledge the deaths of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust. This is atypical of any former President of our country. Moreover, the Trump statement implies that the recognition of the death of Jews during the Holocaust would come at the exclusion of other groups. The tone of those remarks takes the reader in the direction of denying the suffering of the Jewish people. For the President not to mention Jews is a terrible omen. So let us go through some history. The term ‘‘holocaust,’’ arising from World War II, has come to mean annihilation of Jewish persons. From 1933 to 1945, those Jewish souls who perished in Europe totaled at least 6 million human beings. Between 2.7 million and 3 million Jews were murdered in Nazirun death camps. In the USSR, 1,340,000 Jewish deaths were ordered by Joseph Stalin. At least 1.5 million of the victims forcibly killed by Hitler and Stalin were children. Cumulatively, this carnage represented about twothirds of the 9 million Jews who had resided in Central Europe. By way of explanation, for the 8 million Christians and others who were also murdered, the term generally used to describe their carnage is martyrdom. As an example, in Poland, 3 million Catholic Christian Poles were martyred by Nazi and Soviet killing machines. The Holocaust also included Stalin’s mass executions and forced starvation 
and relocation of Soviet prisoners of war to fight in horrendous places like the Battle of Monte Cassino after being marched through the Middle East. Many of them were buried in Tehran. Stalin also perpetrated a massive postwar ethnic and religious cleansing of Jews and nonJews. As Hitler and Stalin fought for control of the European continent, over 14 million innocent people—these aren’t soldiers I am talking about. This was in addition to the 14 million—women, children, and men who were civilians died in their vastly evil plunder. Millions of Eastern Europeans were trapped between the two most murderous regimes in not only European history, but human history: Nazi Germany and Communist Soviet Union. As an aside, I found it chilling that President Trump’s top adviser, Steve Bannon, in an address to the Vatican in 2014, referenced in a most troubling line of thought the name of Julius Evola and his murderous movement. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  excerpts of an article entitled ‘‘This is How Steve Bannon Sees the Entire World,’’ which is also available at www.buzzfeed.com. 
[From BuzzFeed News Reporter] THISISHOWSTEVE BANNON SEES THE ENTIRE  WORLD  (By J. Lester Feder) Donald Trump’s newly named chief strategist and senior counselor Steve Bannon laid out his globalist nationalist vision in unusually indepth remarks delivered by Skype to a conference held inside the Vatican in the summer of 2014. Bannon: I think it’s a little bit more complicated. When Vladimir Putin, when you really look at some of the underpinnings of some of his beliefs today, a lot of those come from what I call Eurasianism; he’s got an advisor who harkens back to Julius Evola and different writers of the early 20th century who are really the supporters of what’s called the traditionalist movement, which really eventually metastazied into Italian fascism. A lot of people that are traditionalists are attracted to that. One of the reasons is that they believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional institutions, and he’s trying to do it in a form of nationalism—and I think that people, particularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty for their country, they want to see nationalism for their country. They don’t believe in this kind of pan European Union or they don’t believe in the centralized government in the United States. They’d rather see more of a statesbased entity that the founders originally set up where freedoms were controlled at the local level. I’m not justifying Vladimir Putin and the kleptocracy that he represents, because he eventually is the state capitalist of kleptocracy. However, we the JudeoChristian West really have to look at what he’s talking about as far as traditionalism goes— particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism—and I happen to think that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing. I think strong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors, and that is really the building block that built Western Europe and the United States, and I think it’s what can see us forward. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, Julius Evola has been described as one of the most influential Fascist racists in Italian history, admired by the Nazi SS, its commander, Heinrich Himmler, and Benito Mussolini. Nazi SS Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler was most certainly responsible for the Holocaust. Hitler’s madness obsessed over creating an Aryan nation. Joseph Stalin’s depraved dream of conquest knew no bounds. Stalin even conscripted Jews to lead hunts to exterminate other ethnic groups, and then killed the Jews when the mission was completed. The level of Stalin’s depravity is difficult for sane people to understand. Violent antiSemitism and hatred did not end with the defeat of Nazi Germany and the ultimate collapse of the Communist Soviet Union. We can observe a resurgence in certain places in Europe and, sadly, even in isolated incidents here in the United States. b1930 History tells us that the rising anti Semitic violence is not just a threat to civil society today, but the future of free people everywhere. The recent antiSemitic terrorist incidents in Paris at the Bataclan, Jewishowned enterprises, or Nazi symbols appearing in hateful situations here in our own beloved country demand that decent people find peaceful means to stare down hate. Timothy Snyder’s masterful book ‘‘Bloodlands’’ documents the 6 million souls of the Holocaust and 8 million souls of martyrdom and murder. The Nazis established killing centers for efficient mass execution. These killing centers, also referred to as ‘‘extermination camps’’ or ‘‘death camps,’’ were almost exclusively ‘‘death factories.’’ German Schutzstaffel and police murdered nearly 2.7 million Jews in these killing centers either by asphyxiation with poison gas or by shooting. For the nonJewish populations of Europe, the 8 million nonJewish victims of Nazi and communist campaigns of mass murder include Romas, Soviet prisoners of war, Aktion T4 patients, Ukrainian Holodomor famine victims, Serbs, the disabled, the LGBTQ communities, and others known only to God. There were also unfathomable crimes against entire nations, as Poland and Belarus were both slated for complete extinction. Poland lost an astounding 20 percent of its entire population, with 6 million killed in the war, and Belarus, though smaller in population, lost 25 percent of its population. In Poland, leaders were annihilated. Many members of the Catholic clergy were either threatened with deportation, kept in custody, or sent to camps. The Catholic Church was particularly suppressed, for nearly a fifth of all priests—over 3,000—were killed between 1939 and 1945, most in concentration camps. From 1932 to 1933, Joseph Stalin’s forced famine engulfed much of presentday Ukraine and its eastern flank. The heaviest losses were in Ukraine—which is struggling for its freedom today—which had been the most productive agricultural area of the Soviet Union. Stalin was determined to crush all evidence of Ukrainian pride. As with Poland’s leadership, the famine was accompanied by a devastating purge of all of Ukraine’s intelligentsia. Millions of peasants were condemned to death by starvation. Troops and secret police units waged a merciless war against peasants who refused to give up their grain. Any man, woman, or child caught taking even a handful of grain from a collective farm could be, and often were, executed or deported to work camps. Stalin’s system of internal passports and brutal secret police forced collectivization of the land to Communistrun production. After a long search through history and recordkeeping, I can personally give testimony and even learned that the Catholic Church located in today’s Ukraine, in which our maternal grandparents were married, held a dark secret. Joseph Stalin’s secret police, the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, the NKVD, killed 168 people in its basement as Stalin’s Black Raven trucks drove the innocents to their death. Historians continue to seek truth even until today about what happened. Their painstaking research includes information from the Soviet archives. Though some people try to erase history or ignore it, others work diligently to record it and learn from it. I recall how fondly our grandmother spoke of Jewish storekeepers in the region from which she emigrated, welcoming her before and after church on Sunday and telling her to change into her church shoes there before attending mass and after her 5mile hike from her village and the 5mile hike back. The Jewish storekeeper would always give her a piece of candy. There are other Members here tonight that wish to speak. I am so grateful for their presence here tonight because we are the bearers of liberty’s torch. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York, (Mr. CROWLEY ), the great leader of the Democratic Caucus, and I thank him for taking time from his busy schedule to be here with us. Mr. CROWLEY. I thank my friend, the gentlewoman from Ohio, for being here this evening to have this Special Order to speak on an issue of such magnitude, of importance to we the people of the United States, important to the world, that we never forget what took place: the horror, the utter destruction of humankind during the Holocaust, but, in particular, the focus of that destruction upon the Jewish race. It is important because we are seeing a rise, quite frankly, of antiSemitism not only around the world, but right here in the United States. It takes different forms in different places, but, in 
the end, has the same result of targeting and hurting one of the historically most vulnerable groups in our world: the Jewish people. One of the things that has been the most concerning to me is the minimizing of the suffering of the Jewish people during the Holocaust. Frankly, it is really outright disturbing—I don’t know if that does it justice—that the White House of the United States of America, the home of our President, our present administration, representing the same country that defeated Nazi Germany, the same country that bore the Greatest Generation, the same country that led the fight against antiSemitism worldwide, while recognizing from time to time it had to douse it here in the United States, our country, this same White House that I referred to deliberately refused to mention that the Holocaust was designed to eliminate the Jewish people from the face of the Earth. Not a single mention of the Final Solution. The Final Solution was to obliterate, eliminate the Jewish people off the face of the Earth. Yes, many people died in the Holocaust, as the gentlewoman made reference to so eloquently—disturbingly, but eloquently. Of the tens of millions of people who died, we know of them historically, but no race or religion was designated for elimination like the Jewish people were. The Final Solution was about ridding the Jewish people from the face of the Earth. It is that simple. It is imperative that this moment does not pass without some clarity. What is clear is that the White House purposely removed the reference. They are proud of it. They doubled down. They tripled down. They removed the reference to the Jewish people in its statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Why does this matter, you may ask? Well, first and foremost, it feeds the extremists. We know they exist. Let’s face it, extremists have welcomed this White House statement. They love it, they glorify it, not just theoretically, but literally. Literally, White supremacists have welcomed the White House decision to leave any mention of the Jewish people out of the Holocaust remembrance. Secondly, it matters because a lot of people in the world today either don’t know that the Holocaust happened or don’t believe that the Holocaust happened—not just theoretically, but literally don’t believe that the Holocaust took place. Literally, a 2014 global survey of antiSemitic attitudes found that 35 percent of people around the world have never heard about the Holocaust. Maybe you can understand that. But an additional 32 percent, more importantly, believe it is a myth or greatly exaggerated. Thirdly, it matters because there are many Holocaust survivors—I know them and their descendents—in the United States and throughout the world. The actions behind the statement were just downright cruel and inhumane to them, not just theoretically, but literally cruel and inhumane. Literally, groups that are dedicated to this issue are deeply, deeply disturbed. The Anne Frank Center and others have raised their voices. This is not just coming from Democrats. I don’t want to mislead here at all. There are a range of Republican leaders—and there are four of them— and Republican groups that have expressed their anger at the White House position on the Holocaust, but one entity. We will come back to this House in a moment. The White House hasn’t seemed to have heard their outcry, but the gentlewoman from Ohio and I, the Democratic Caucus, we have heard. What has taken place is wrong; simply wrong. You would think that the President would correct the situation. In fact, today, he had the opportunity to condemn antiSemitism at his press conference with Prime Minister Netanyahu, and he didn’t do it. In fact, when he was asked on this very subject of the failure to mention the Jewish people of the Holocaust, he used the opportunity not to clarify his position, but to make reference to how great his election victory was. In watching that press conference, as disturbed as I was about the answer from our President, I was more than a bit disappointed, quite frankly, by Prime Minister Netanyahu’s failure to challenge the President on that. I wish Prime Minister Netanyahu would have asked President Trump to change his statement; not to whitewash what was done, but to change his statement on the Holocaust. I still hope that the Prime Minister does that in the time that he is here. So this Special Order tonight will help us set the record straight, not just on behalf of the millions of Jewish Americans across this country, but to send a clear message to all those who engage in this type of behavior. I ask this question: Where are our Republican colleagues on this issue? Do you hear that? Silence. We have given them opportunity after opportunity to speak out against what the White House has done, but our Republican colleagues refuse to criticize the White House for the omission of the Jewish people in the Holocaust resolution. Could you imagine for a moment what the outcry would have been had President Obama accidentally omitted this, putting aside purposely omitting it, but the outcry if he had accidentally omitted the mentioning of the Jewish people in his annual statement? He never did that, though, nor did President Bush, as the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) has pointed out. This was no mistake. It was a willful omission. Yet still, nothing from our Republican colleagues. The gentlewoman from Ohio knows that I have offered a resolution. We will continue to ask our Republican colleagues to join us on that resolution asking the White House to set the record straight and to include the mentioning of the Final Solution and the attempt by the Nazi regime to eliminate the Jewish people from the face of the Earth. b1945 We will use every legislative mechanism possible to do that, whether it is a motion to discharge, whatever that will be. I am putting my Republican colleagues on notice, because they must raise their voices. They must raise their voices to what has taken place in this White House. Whether it is Steve Bannon and those who work within the cellar, the deep cellar of the White House who came up with this resolution to purposely omit the mentioning of the Jewish people, our Republican colleagues will either have to answer for the White House and defend it or condemn it. You can’t have it both ways. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio once again for bringing us together. It needed to be done. We will continue to raise this question until the White House comes to its senses and sets the record straight and does no longer continue to enable Holocaust deniers. I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for holding this Special Order this evening. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful for Mr. CROWLEY ’s presence and his eloquent remarks this evening, representing one of the major cities in our country where Jewish leaders from all walks of life have helped elevate America. I know how proud they are of him and what he is attempting to do. I hope every one of our colleagues, all 435, sign on to his resolution. It is most worthy. I thank him so very, very much for joining us this evening. I want to tell a story in the region that I represent, though this particular neighborhood was cut out of my district. A Nazi swastika was painted on a garage door recently of the home of a Muslim family. It was really repugnant and very cruel, but what happened in our community? What did the American people do? One neighbor came over with a bottle of red paint and she made a big heart over the swastika. Then the conductor of the symphony came and musicians came, and they played ‘‘Ode to Joy’’ to the family, and other friends came and the American people. I love the American people because deep in their hearts they live the values of liberty and justice for all. The garage door itself was replaced by the Toledo Overhead Door Company. They gave the family a new door for free. I am just so proud of them. I am just so proud of them. Our communities don’t have to bear this sadness of antiSemitism and of degradation by those who really don’t 
get what this country is made of. I know the Trump White House statement on the Holocaust falls far short of the administration’s ability to properly recognize and record history accurately. The Trump White House has the means to hire appropriate staff to prepare thoughtful, carefully researched statements, and their 2017 statement is out of touch with history. History teaches us that wherever antiSemitism has gone unchecked, the persecution of others has been present or not far behind. Presenting historical truth and defeating antiSemitism must be a cause of great importance not only for Jews but also for us, for people who value liberty, truth, free expression of religion, justice for all. I know that is the vast majority of the American people. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of our Special Order this evening. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Ohio? There was no objection. Ms. KAPTUR. I want to thank Mr. BRENDAN F. B OYLE of Pennsylvania also for coming to the floor this evening. If there is any remaining time, I would just like to read a couple of the sentences of Congressman BOYLE ’s remarks because they are so incredible. He talks about Deborah Lipstadt, an American historian and author of influential books such as ‘‘Denying the Holocaust,’’ who wrote an important article in The Atlantic, entitled, ‘‘The Trump Administration’s Flirtation With Holocaust Denial.’’ He talks about ‘‘’hardcore Holocaust denial.’ In this type of rhetoric, anti Semites argue that the Holocaust simply did not occur; that there was no systematic plan to destroy the Jewish people based solely on their religion. ‘‘This type of hate speech has unfortunately been espoused by those who seek to delegitimize the suffering of the Jewish people since the Holocaust began.’’ But he talks about a more insidious form of denial in rhetoric that has begun to creep into our national discussion. Lipstadt terms this ‘‘’softcore Holocaust denial.’ This form of denial, argues Lipstadt, uses different tactics but has the same endgoal. . . . It does not deny the facts, but it minimizes them, arguing that Jews use the Holocaust to draw attention away from criticism of Israel. . . . ‘‘Softcore denial also includes Holocaust minimization, as when someone suggests it was not so bad. Softcore denial, then, is potentially more insidious than our traditional form of denial, by minimizing the suffering of the Jewish people and suggesting that while the Holocaust may have occurred, it was not just about the Jews per se.’’ I appreciate those listening this evening and am very grateful to have this privilege of entering into the RECORD materials we believe important not only to our Republic, but to free people everywhere. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, recently, Deborah Lipstadt, American historian and author of influential books such as Denying the Holocaust, wrote an important article in The Atlantic. In this article, entitled ‘‘The Trump Administration’s Flirtation with Holocaust Denial,’’ Lipstadt specifies an important distinction in types of Holocaust denial. Most people are familiar with what Lipstadt identifies as ‘‘hardcore Holocaust denial.’’ In this type of rhetoric, antiSemites argue that the Holocaust simply did not occur; that there was no systematic plan to destroy the Jewish people based solely on their religion. This type of hate speech has unfortunately been espoused by those who seek to delegitimize the suffering of the Jewish people since the Holocaust began. It is not acceptable and we must do all we can to teach our children the tragic events of the Holocaust and how to counter such hateful rhetoric. Yet, perhaps a more insidious form of denial rhetoric has begun to creep into our national discussion. This is what Lipstadt terms ‘‘softcore Holocaust denial.’’ This form of denial, argues Lipstadt, ‘‘uses different tactics but has the same endgoal . . . It does not deny the facts, but it minimizes them, arguing that Jews use the Holocaust to draw attention away from criticism of Israel ....  ‘‘Softcore denial also includes Holocaust minimization, as when someone suggests it was not so bad.’’ Softcore denial, then, is potentially more insidious than our traditional form of denial, by minimizing the suffering of the Jewish people and suggesting that while the Holocaust may have occurred, it was not about the Jews per se. By minimizing the suffering of the target of the Holocaust and the six million Jews who perished at the hands of the Nazis, we are denying the truth and setting ourselves up to forget the worst genocidal massacre in human history. What is more disgusting and unacceptable, though, is that the President of the United States is now espousing these dangerous and hateful ideas. By refusing time and again to acknowledge that Jews were the targets and victims of the Holocaust, our President is denying the truth of the Holocaust and is aiding and abetting the Holocaust deniers and White Nationalists in their goals of once again persecuting individuals based on their ethnicity, religion, race, etc. We must do better. I call on the President to recall his statement and make clear that the Holocaust was a systematic persecution of the Jewish people. Anything less than this outright admission is Holocaust denial. 
AMERICA 2.0 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN) for 30 minutes. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity. I just want to say thank you to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) for her great words and Congressman CROWLEY , who was here a little bit earlier, for his good words as well. I am starting tonight a segment that I am calling America 2.0. I think we are in the midst of, obviously, some chaos in the United States, in Washington, D.C., and in so many communities across the country that feel we are disoriented with our politics, disconnected from our politics, and we are disoriented around the idea of what is happening in our economy. Globalization, automation, all of these things have dramatically affected the American economy and American wages and standard of living. We have actually seen, Mr. Speaker, over the course of the last 20 years, a huge decline, a sucking out of middle class wages that have gone primarily to the top 1 percent. Now, I am not here to bash rich people. I am not here to make any enemies, but I think it is important and instructive for us to look at where we were and where we are now. If you look at where we were in 1980, of all the income growth in the Nation in 1980, 70 percent of all income growth went to the bottom 90 percent of Americans. So we had some significant income growth, and 70 percent of it went to the bottom 90 percent, 30 percent went to the top 10 percent. The wealthy were getting more, but the middle class, the upper middle class and the lower middle class, the bottom 90 percent saw 70 percent of the gains. Fast forward from the early 1990s until just recently just a few years back, the bottom 90 percent, Mr. Speaker, got zero percent of the income growth that happened in the United States—zero. So the economy in 1980, for average families in Youngstown, Ohio, or Struthers, Ohio, or Akron, Ohio, saw that hard work paid off; that if you worked hard, you played by the rules, you did what you were supposed to do, and if you were in the bottom 90 percent, you saw some income gains. Fair enough. Where the anxiety has come in now is that people are working harder, they are working longer hours, and they are not seeing any growth in their incomes. We have teachers, for example, in the Youngstown City Schools who have not seen a costofliving raise in 9 years—9 years. Police and fire, people who cut hair, people who are waitresses, people who take showers after work instead of before work, those people aren’t getting ahead, and the cost of everything is going up. So that is where we are, erosion of our manufacturing base and globalization and automation. I was just looking at an article earlier about a new Amazon project—I 
think it is called Amazon Go—where you can actually go into a grocery store—how cool is this? You can actually go into a grocery store and shop and pick out whatever it is that you want at the grocery store and walk out. Everything gets rung up, scans and all the rest, and you get billed, and you pay your bill. Now, here we are in 2017, that is pretty cool stuff. The downside of that is, there are 2.7 million workers who work at grocery stores. Where I come from, some of those grocery stores are actually unionized where the person at the counter actually makes a pretty good wage and has a pension and has a decent healthcare plan, standing on their feet all day long, probably not the easiest line of work to be in, but people go there and they work hard. Those jobs are going to be gone. We hear all this technology about driverless cars and driverless trucks. Youngstown is not too far from Pittsburgh, and Ford just committed a billion dollars to Pittsburgh to advance driverless vehicles. Uber is in Pittsburgh talking about investing in the research and development for driverless vehicles. It is going to be great. The downside is, in about 25, 26, 27 States, the number one job is driving a truck. It is driving a truck. Pretty cool that my son, who is going to be 3 in June, may never have to drive a car. As a parent who also has a 13 and 14year old at home and talking about when they are going to get the keys to the car, I kind of like the idea of a driverless car. I kind of like that. At that point, it would be pretty safe. But we have the downside to that, which is the loss of all of these jobs. So what we need to do as a country, as a dynamic country, as a wealthy country, as a creative country is we need to figure out what is America 2.0 because this isn’t your dad’s or your grandfather’s America. This isn’t going to be your grandmother’s America or even your mother’s America. Things are accelerating so quickly that as a legislative body that was designed to be slow, and those of us operating in a political system that was designed to slow things down, we didn’t want a concentration of power where a king ruled. We took that, and we divided the power up into a legislative branch, and then divided that up between the House and the Senate and the executive branch. The executive branch has some powers, and they have got to figure out how to work with each other. If they have got a problem, we have got a judicial branch that is going to reference the Constitution of the country to make sure that everything that is going on is abiding by the basic values on which we started the country. Pretty cool system, elections every 2 years, replenish the ideas in the legislative branch, and every 4 years in the executive branch, so we can try to get some new ideas. But the system was designed to be slow. So here we are, working within a system that is designed to be slow with an economy that is going 150 miles an hour down the highway, which means the legislators and the President and the Governors and the people elected to office, we better get our act together. We better figure out how to make things work because that is what we owe our constituents. That is what we owe that family who, for 30 years, hasn’t seen a raise. You know what? They want to send their kid to college. b2000 Do you know what? They want to have a job, they want to have a pension, they want to have a secure retirement, and they want their kid to have more opportunity than they had. They are not going to complain, they are not going to moan, they are going to put their boots on, and they are going to go to work. It is our job to help create an environment where they can go and take advantage of those opportunities. God helps those that help themselves. You have got to go to work and you have got to put the time in. It is not going to be easy, especially in this economy. It is going to be tough. It seems like it is going to get harder. But with all of this automation coming down the pike, what are we going to do as a country with all of these people in my district that are 50year old men who used to work in a steel mill, now it is closed, or used to work in an auto plant that used to have 16,000 people working there and now it is down to 3,000, or the supplier to that auto plant that used to have 13,000 people and now it is 1? So we can say, yeah, pull yourself up by your boot straps and work hard. The jobs aren’t there. They are not there anymore. So what are we going to do here in 2017? How are we going to get our President with his good brain that he has to sit down with us and figure out what we are going to do? So America 2.0 is: What is the next version of this great country, what is the next version, to where my grandfather could be a steelworker and a couple of generations later his grandkids are doctors, lawyers, and Congressmen? That is what is important about these jobs we have. That is why they shouldn’t be taken lightly. That is why instead of tweeting about some show or some family business, you should be focused like a laser beam on how we fix these problems. If you are not, you are not doing what you said you were going to do. America 2.0 is a series of ideas. I will share a few tonight and a few over time on what I think we need to do. We have a nearterm problem, midterm, and longterm, some of what I mentioned. The nearterm problem is wages, jobs, and workforce participation. Workforce participation rates are at 63 percent. They are still too low. People aren’t just employed, they are underemployed. They are making less today than they were before the great crash in 2008, 2009, and 2010. So what are we going to do? I know we have talked a lot about we are going to retrain. It is going to be great. We are going to get you this job, and you are going to be trained up and ready to take it. What job? We need to create jobs. And it just so happens we need to rebuild the country. So let’s make the investment to put people back to work by rebuilding the country. We need waterlines. We need new sewer lines. We have lead in our pipes that people are drinking. We have old dilapidated homes all over older communities that need to be taken down. Even if we are going to put up just parks and green space, take those down. Those are all jobs that could be created. We need roads and new bridges. Most bridges are deficient in the United States. A good many of them need to be rebuilt. We need steel in those bridges, and we need concrete. So let’s do a big jobs bill where we rebuild the country. I am not making stuff up. We have got to do this. Let’s put Buy American provisions in there so we put the American steelworker back to work, and the people that work at the concrete plants in America get the money, get the contract. Those private businesses that do the roads and bridges and all of the rest, let’s make sure it is DavisBacon, it is a prevailing wage, so that our friends who work so hard and are so skilled in the unions are able to get that work because they have a good pension, a good wage, a good retirement plan, good healthcare benefits, and they are the most skilled workers in the country. Let’s make sure they get the work so we are actually lifting people up; and get people in these unions so that more people can earn a good wage, have a secure retirement and a little bit less anxiety. So roads, bridges, pipes, airports, ports on the ocean, rebuild them. This is nobody’s fault. The country is getting older. A lot of this stuff was done 50, 60, 70 years ago. It is time to reinvest. It is time to put a new roof on the house. We will put people back to work. For every $1 billion we spend on infrastructure, we put about 27,000 people to work. So if we have a $1 trillion infrastructure plan and we ask the wealthiest people in the country— maybe people in the capital markets who have seen a significant amount of wage growth, we ask them to help us pay for it so we don’t have to borrow the money and put it on the backs of our kids. So we are putting people back to work, we are doing what needs to be done, we are using American steel and American concrete and American union workers and having more people join the union so more people can have a secure living, and we are creating jobs. That is step one. What also needs to be included in this is: How are we setting ourselves up for success in the next 10, 20, or 30 
years? How are our kids going to be able to operate in this bridge we are creating to this new economy? One of the things we need to do is we need to wire the country. We need to have the most sophisticated, broadband capabilities in every corner of the country so that every community can participate in the new economy that is driven by a digital world. We have companies, for example, in Youngstown, where we don’t have a whole lot of broadband in Youngstown. We don’t have a whole lot of penetration for broadband in Youngstown. We have companies that are very sophisticated that try to get defense work or work with defense contractors that actually are put at a disadvantage because they don’t, and we don’t, have the broadband capability for them to be able to download the kind of files they need to be able to download in order to get the contracts they need to do the advanced manufacturing work. So not having broadband in your community would be like not having a road going in and out of your community, or waterlines going in and out of your community 50, 60, 70 years ago. Do you want to start a factory and create jobs? How are you going to get the raw materials in and the product out if you don’t have a road? The same concept with broadband in a 2017, 2027, 2037, 2047 economy. So this is a great investment. The World Bank has studied this. They have said that every 10 percentagepoint increase in broadband penetration equals 1.2 percent growth in your GDP. So you are making these investments and you are growing your economy at the same time. I think we go to these coal miners who have been put out of work, we go to the steelworkers who have been put out of work, we go to the autoworkers who have been put out of work through the deindustrialization, through globalization and automation, and we say: You are hired. You are going to get onthejob training. This isn’t going to be: We are going to train you for some job that may or may not come. You are hired in America 2.0. You are going to work. You are going to lay broadband. We need to upgrade our energy grids. We need smart grids that are more efficient, more secure, and less prone to terrorist attacks—more efficient, can communicate with the end user better so you know how much money you are spending when you wash your clothes. And you may go off hour so you can wash them at a different time and save a little money on your energy bill, money in your pocket because we make these investments. You are going to work now on the smart grid. You are hired. And this country, as wealthy as we are, we are going to pay for it. We are going to build it, and we are going to change the trajectory of our country, and we are going to be ready to play ball in the economy. So these workers that we are hiring that may be 50 or 55 years old, they don’t know how they are going to get to retirement, they are hired. They are hired. And this is no makework job because we feel bad for you. This is a job we need you to have in order for you to change the trajectory of our country for your kids and for your grandkids. If we don’t make these investments, if we don’t make this happen, America is going to be bringing up the rear. We have got a great dynamic economy still, even with the stagnation that we have. We have just got to make a few key investments and not get caught up in this polarized political discussion that is getting us nowhere. Nobody in this Chamber suffers. Everybody in this Chamber draws a paycheck. They have got a job. It is the family in Youngstown, it is the family in Gary, Indiana, it is the family in Milwaukee that suffers because we have failed to make the basic investments that this country has always made—always: the interstate highway, the intercontinental railroad, land grant colleges, NASA, the space program. Look at all of the technologies that spun out of NASA—in health, telecommunications, energy— because we said, ‘‘We are going to the Moon’’; and it was as much about going to the Moon and about spinning off new technologies and saying, ‘‘We can figure out how to go to the Moon’’ because we were committed, as a country, to do great things. And now we are committed to tweeting about some nonsensical show that is on TV or some backhanded comment that somebody gives. There is too much at stake. Every time we do that, we fall further and further and further behind. One other piece of America 2.0, and the final piece or two I will share tonight, is green energy, resuscitating manufacturing in the United States. How do we do it? I know we have discussions here about climate change. Some people say it is not happening. Some people say it is not man made. It is an important point to make that 98 percent of scientists who have reviewed all of the literature on this say it is happening and it is caused by man. I think that is an important point. But let’s set that aside. How do we help people with their energy bill and how do we resuscitate manufacturing in the United States? I believe that, if we move towards a green economy, we will have a renaissance in manufacturing, and let me tell you why. Because for every windmill that we put up, there are 8,000 component parts to the windmill: gearshifts, hydraulics, steel, aluminum, plastics, all kinds of things, bolts. There is a sidewalk mile of concrete in a windmill. b2015 These are things we make in this country. These are things we make in northeast Ohio. Talk to Timken; talk to Parker Hannifin; talk to some of these energy companies that make solar panels. That stuff needs manufacturing. And we can do it here in the United States with the smart energy grid, and broadband, and use renewable energy to increase our manufacturing base, reduce our carbon footprint in our country and around the world, export the technologies and the stuff that we make, and put people back to work. What is the matter with this? What is wrong with this picture? We have a country now that is more reliable on renewable energy, that is increasing our manufacturing base, that is putting people back to work. To me, that makes a lot of sense. So these families that are struggling—because we will be making a heck of a lot more solar panels than we are now—we can start getting these solar panels up on people’s homes and reducing their energy cost. So if we do the smart grids and we do the solar panels, and we start reducing people’s energy costs in their homes, you are putting money in their pocket, you are starting to close that gap a little bit, you are starting to reduce that anxiety a little bit, and you are starting to get us into new technologies and new ideas that are going to lead to growth. So let’s build out the country. Let’s build out our roads, bridges, ports, and airports. Let’s extend broadband to every corner of the country and hire Americans to go do this work. Let’s redo our grid and extend it so that we can get this renewable energy all across the country; put people to work doing that; resuscitate our manufacturing base; and change the trajectory of our country so that our kids are wired, prepared, and living in a country that is ready to lead the world again in some of the great challenges that face us. That is the outline of America 2.0. In my mind, that is the direction we need to go in. It starts, Mr. Speaker, by getting people back to work, by us getting focused and being disciplined, and talking about the things and figuring out how to work out the deals that need to be worked out here in order to help those people back home. That is our obligation because the generations before us—whether it was the Intercontinental Railroad, or the social justice movement, or the equality movement, or the interstate highway, or the landgrant colleges, or NASA—gave us a pretty good world to grow up in. And now it is our obligation to take this to the next level and create the next version of America. Create America 2.0. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
