Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago, in March of 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law after a 2year process of hundreds of committee meetings, exhaustive markups— which I personally participated in— floor debate that went on for days, and, again, backandforth between the House and the Senate. Since that date, despite the, again, bitter criticism by the Republican majority when that law went into effect, there have been 60 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act; and up until this morning, the majority has always begged the question about: What is your replacement? Again, just last week, we heard rumors that there was a replacement, that the Speaker actually had drafted a bill. Well, with scenes that looked like it was out of ‘‘The Blair Witch Project,’’ we had Members of Congress going around the Capitol opening doors with cameras doing live streams and live coverage, again, to empty rooms and denials that there actually was a bill that anyone could actually take a look at. Well, as I said, this morning, we now have been told that there actually is a bill that has been filed, which tomorrow will be marked up and voted out of committee with not one single public hearing and, incredibly, with no analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, which any bill that has any impact on budget, whether it is a tax bill or a spending bill, has, as a matter of course, for decades, always been the case. There is no measure which contains more significance in terms of a Congressional Budget analysis than reforming the healthcare system of America, which constitutes about 15 to 20 percent of the American economy and affects the lives of tens of millions of Americans. Well, from what we have seen so far, it appears there is a good reason that the folks wanted to keep the bill a secret. Again, the basic fundamentals of the Affordable Care Act is built on two pillars. There was an expansion of Medicaid, and there were subsidies based on income for Americans to be able to buy insurance through the marketplace. In the State of Connecticut, where I come from, we have cut the uninsured rate down to 3.6 percent from approximately 9 percent when the bill was signed into law 7 years ago. What this bill does is, again, it just basically decapitates the Medicaid expansion. So about 11 million Americans are going to have their healthcare coverage threatened. And those are not just, you know, people on entitlement programs. We are talking about working Americans. I know a farmer in my district who almost lost his foot from a chain saw accident, who thanked me the other day that he had Medicaid to cover the costs of his hospital coverage. Again, the subsidies which allowed people to buy plans on the insurance marketplace, well, they basically, as I said, decapitate Medicaid. And they also convert the subsidies from an incomebased system to an agerated one, which means that, basically, a wellto do person gets the same tax credit that a poor person or a single parent has. A conservative economist, Avik Roy, just a few minutes ago, issued a statement, saying: Expanding subsidies for high earners while cutting health coverage for the working poor sounds like a caricature of mustachetwirling, tophatted Republican fat cats. 
Again, you cannot imagine a more Robin Hood in reverse than a plan that does what this tax credit change encompasses. And, again, the list goes on and on in terms of some of the really just outrageous proposals that this new measure contains. For seniors, again, the Affordable Care Act contracted the age rating from 3 to 1 from what existed before; it was about 6 to 7 to 1. In other words, a senior, an older person, could be charged seven times the same rate as a 20yearold. Again, the Affordable Care Act reduced that span to 3 to 1. This bill expands the span again to 5 to 1, which the American ARP has already issued a statement, saying: 
It is nothing more than an age tax. It is charging people based on their age, which is nothing that any human being can control. 
It also, again, rolls back tax increases, slight tax increases, for high income earners, as Mr. Roy’s comment indicates, and worsens the fiscal solvency of the Medicare trust fund, reduces its solvency by 4 years. Again, the Catholic Health Association has come out today criticizing this proposal. Again, just an incredible array of stakeholder groups all across the country are already speaking out. The fact that this measure is going forward in committee tomorrow morning, less than, really, 24 hours for the American people to have even a glimpse in terms of what is being proposed without an analysis in terms of a budget score, again, is just an abuse of the legislative and democratic process. Mr. Speaker, again, we have seen an outpouring of Americans over the last 2 months at townhall meetings—I have had four of them—people telling heartfelt stories about how the ACA helped them. Yes, we can improve the law. There are many ideas that we can work together on. That is what we should be focused on, not butchering the law, which this proposal seeks to do. 
THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, for years Americans across the country have struggled under a government takeover of health care. Because of ObamaCare, insurance markets are collapsing, healthcare costs are soaring, and patients’ choices are dwindling. Simply put, the flawed healthcare law is failing. It is hurting hardworking men and women across the country, and the American people deserve better. That is why Republicans promised to deliver the healthcare solutions Americans desperately need. This week, we are making good on that promise and moving forward with an effort that will provide a better way on health care. After a thoughtful and collaborative process, members of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee recently unveiled a legislative plan that will repeal and replace ObamaCare. The plan, the American Health Care Act, includes a number of positive, commonsense reforms that will help create more choices, lower costs, and give control back to individuals and families. These reforms will create a new and innovative fund giving States the flexibility they need to design programs that fit the needs of their communities. They will responsibly unwind ObamaCare’s Medicaid expansion in a way that protects patients and strengthens the program for future generations. The plan will also dismantle ObamaCare taxes and mandates—including the individual and employer mandate penalties and taxes on prescription drugs, overthecounter medications, health insurance premiums, and medical devices. It will expand health savings accounts to empower individuals and families to spend their healthcare dollars the way they want and need. It will provide tax credits to those who don’t receive insurance through work or a government program, helping all Americans access high quality, affordable health care. At the same time, we on the Education and the Workforce Committee are working to advance additional reforms that will help expand coverage, make health care more affordable, and promote a healthy workforce. One legislative proposal will empower small businesses to band together to negotiate lower healthcare costs on behalf of their employees. Another will protect the ability of employers to selfinsure, providing greater access to affordable, flexible healthcare plans for their workers. The third will give employers the legal certainty they need to offer employee wellness plans, helping to promote a healthy workforce and, again, lower healthcare costs. These three legislative proposals reflect a few shared principles. Families should have the freedom to choose the healthcare plan that meets their needs. Americans need more affordable healthcare options, not fewer. Healthcare decisions should rest with patients and their doctors—not government bureaucrats. Instead of prescriptive mandates, we should ensure employers have the tools they need to help their employees afford health care. These proposals—along with those in the American Health Care Act—are exactly the kind of freemarket, patient centered reforms Republicans promised, and they reflect the priorities of President Trump and his administration. They are the products of a careful process that took into account the ideas and concerns of men and women from all walks of life, and they will now be considered through an open, transparent process that provides policymakers on both sides of the aisle an opportunity to share their views and offer their ideas. I encourage everyone—my colleagues in Congress, as well as all Americans— to join in this process. Visit readthebill.gop. See for yourself the plan we have laid out, and help us move forward with these positive solutions. Together we can help ensure all Americans have access to the high quality, affordable healthcare coverage they deserve. 
THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) for 5 minutes. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, we just heard a lot about competition and better and improved markets. The basic problem the Republicans have—and they know this very well—is that the health insurance industry is exempt from the antitrust laws of the United States of America, so they can, and they do, get together and collude. They collude to drive up prices. They collude to share markets: hey, if you are pulling out of that State, I will pull out of this State and cut those kind of deals. They can’t be prosecuted. We had a bipartisan vote on the floor of this House when we were originally considering the House version of the Affordable Care Act—infinitely superior to the thing passed by the Senate which we got stuck with—and it was over 400 votes to take away their antitrust immunity. Is that in this bill? Heck, no. They are the second largest PAC contributor to the Republican Party, so I am afraid we are not going to take away their antitrust immunity—but we are going to have a really free, competitive, and transparent market. You will be able to go out and get your policies, whatever the insurance companies have decided as they colluded behind closed doors. Now, the other issue here is, for some reason, Republicans seem to have taken and painted a big target on the back of low and middleincome seniors in two ways. They are going to repeal some very small taxes on people who earn over onequarter of a million dollars a year. You know, they really need another 4 percent because they are just hurting. Those people who earn $1 million, $2 million a year, they are hurting. We have got to repeal that tax. So that is one of the highest priorities in this bill: repeal that tax. Unfortunately, that means that the Medicare trust fund will be exhausted 4 years earlier. That is right. The money those very highincome people are paying goes to Medicare, to the trust fund, which is in trouble right now. It is going to be exhausted in 2028. Under their plan, it is going to be exhausted in 2024. So they have painted a big target on seniors. But don’t worry, the seniors can go into the competitive— well, not so competitive—insurance market and buy a plan. But then another little twist and another arrow in the heart of seniors— seniors now, under their plan, instead of a cap of three times the cost of a policy to other, younger subscribers, it is now they are going to jack it up to five times. Why do you hate seniors so much? What is the deal here? Yeah, the high income seniors will do fine. But what about the middle and lowincome seniors, those who are struggling to make ends meet on Social Security and others? Then for some other bizarre reason, they have got it in for Planned Parenthood. They say it is about abortion. Well, guess what? It is not. Federal law has prohibited Federal money from going to abortions for 40 years. It is not about abortion. It is about something 
different. It is about breast exams, Pap smears, physical exams, STD testing and treatment, information and counseling about sexual reproductive health, cancer screenings, pregnancy tests, prenatal services, and access to affordable birth control. Why do they want to kill that for 1 million people, many of whom live in rural areas that are already underserved? They don’t have an alternative for those services. But they want to kill that—oh, just for 1 year maybe. Well, actually, they would like to do it permanently, but they are going to say: well, we are just going to do it 1 year and see how it works out, how those million women do. Then, as my colleagues from Connecticut said, everything around here has to be scored, and it can’t add to the deficit—unless it is something they want to do. Now, in this case, this has not been scored. We have no idea what it is going to cost the American taxpayer, this new Rube Goldberg, and they don’t have any analysis of how many people are going to lose coverage. b1215 Now, granted, they put off the huge loss of coverage until 2020. They delayed the big changes in Medicaid until 2020. That is when tens of millions of people will lose their health insurance. But there are still going to be a lot of people losing their health insurance a lot sooner, and it would be useful for people to know about that before they vote on it: how much is it going to cost the taxpayer and how many people are going to lose coverage. Under the ruse of fixing something that is broken that has given 23 million people an opportunity to have health insurance and brought us the lowest rate of uninsured in recent history in this country, they are cutting taxes for wealthy people. By the way, there is a little gift in there for health insurance companies. They can fully deduct their CEO’s $20 million salary. Today, it is limited to $500,000. So another tax break for the health insurance industry. Did they take on Big Pharma? Did they do anything about the unbelievable price gouging that is going on today through the pharmaceutical companies, where someone buys up a generic drug that has been around for 50 years and jacks up the price 1,000 percent? No, they are not going to do anything about that. We are not going to have more affordable prescription drugs. I don’t know if they undid the fix to the doughnut hole that was in the ObamaCare bill. If they really wanted to do something, they would say: Let’s have a national notforprofit plan offered in a national exchange so that every American can afford health care at a reasonable cost without excess profits to an industry which is exempt from antitrust law, colludes, and pays their execs $20 million and $50 million a year. 
HONORING REILLY RENKEN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 minutes. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Reilly Renken, a remarkable young lady making a big difference in central Illinois. Just after she was born, Reilly was diagnosed with a rare genetic abnormality, along with a form of epilepsy that severely impacts her neurological development. Her parents were told by numerous specialists that she would need support for the rest of her life and that she would likely never read or write. But Reilly proved them wrong. While her genetic makeup is one of a kind, she also has a oneofakind personality. Despite the obstacles she has overcome, Reilly was determined to be a cheerleader. Now she is an integral part of the cheerleading squad at Glenwood Middle School in Chatham, Illinois. Cheering on the Titans has become one of Reilly’s greatest joys, and her presence on the squad has been a joy for her teammates as well. They will tell you that they wouldn’t be the squad they are without Reilly and her positive attitude. She brings life to their practices and they always count on her to make them smile. Reilly is a true inspiration. She shows all of us what is possible when we put our minds to something. Thanks to her, students at Glenwood Middle School have learned the importance of celebrating our differences. Way to go, Reilly. 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WORKS IN MAINE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PINGREE ) for 5 minutes. Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act has saved thousands of Mainers from losing their lives or going bankrupt simply because they got sick. Quality of care has improved through preventative care, without cost sharing for consumers. Overall costs have been lowered. Republicans have had 7 years to come up with an alternative healthcare plan that preserves the progress we have made under the Affordable Care Act— one that would not take us back to a time when many without employer sponsored insurance or a clean bill of health could get coverage. But after all this time, they have come up with a plan that will cost older Americans up to five times more than younger enrollees; will charge the uninsured 30 percent more to buy coverage; and it will defund, not defend, Planned Parenthood; cut Medicaid significantly; and still has no price tag. We owe it to Americans to have an open debate on this proposal, and I expect my Republican colleagues not to forget the millions of Americans for whom the Affordable Care Act has been a lifesaver. In January, I asked my constituents to share their Affordable Care Act stories. Within a few days, more than a thousand stories were submitted. Some shared their ongoing challenges. I agree there are opportunities to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and make it affordable, but the overwhelming number of people shared compelling stories of how the Affordable Care Act has improved their lives. I am honored to share a few of those powerful stories today, and I hope my Republican colleagues are listening. Eleanor from Belfast, Maine, said: ‘‘I am a 63yearold smallbusiness owner who has health insurance for the first time in my adult life since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The same is true for my partner of 17 years. She was diagnosed with breast cancer this year and has recently undergone a mastectomy with followup care. After her diagnosis, I went for my firstever mammogram.’’ The Republican plan puts these preventive services at risk. Matthew from Brunswick, Maine, said: ‘‘Five years ago, I left a comfortable job with good benefits to start my own business. Those first years were tough on my family. My wife and I were able to put our children on Maine’s Dirigo Health, but we had to do without. . . . Today, through God’s grace, hard work, and the support of my wife; my business is prospering. Food assistance is a thing of the past and we’re actually contributing more in taxes now than we ever did before. We still have to watch what we spend but we’re breathing a lot easier. Each year that I’ve made more money our subsidy has gone down, and that’s just as it should be. That subsidy still matters though. If the ACA were eliminated today and I had to buy health insurance on the open market I’d be paying an extra $4,800 a year. That’s real money.’’ Under the Republican plan, small business owners like Matthew may not be able to afford care for their family. Ret, a 9/11 first responder from Rockland, Maine, said: ‘‘ . . . The ACA means that as a self employed resident of the state of Maine, I can actually acquire coverage with a preexisting condition. After working search and rescue/recovery at Ground Zero in 2001, I developed a lung condition necessitating costly medication. Before the ACA, I was terrified of losing my job and losing health care because of my preexisting condition.’’ Under the Republican plan, those with preexisting conditions, like our 9/ 11 first responders, may not get affordable coverage. Elisabeth from Phippsburg, Maine, said: ‘‘In 2014 . . . my husband died from earlyonset Alzheimer’s. I was 50 when 
my husband was diagnosed. Eventually I left the workforce to care for him . . . and, of course, lost my employerprovided health insurance at the same time. The ACA has provided me with options ever since then; options that I never had before its passage. In 2014 I had three joints replaced; life changing surgeries that restored my active lifestyle and removed chronic pain from my life. These were only possible because I was able to access health insurance as an individual, at a reasonable cost.’’ The Republican plan for increasing costs for older Americans threatens people just like Elisabeth. These stories matter. These lives matter. We must all keep them in mind as we look to change the Affordable Care Act. 
OPPOSE BILL REFORMING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. BERA) for 5 minutes. Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to oppose this bill that repeals the Affordable Care Act, and here is why. I stand here not as a Member of Congress, but as a doctor. When I took the oath to enter medicine, like thousands of other doctors, there are really three basic ethics in there: Benevolence: to do good. Mr. Speaker, this bill does not do anything good. It makes it harder for people to get health care. The second ethic was nonmalfeasance: to do no harm. Mr. Speaker, this bill is going to harm millions of Americans. It is going to pull healthcare coverage away from folks. In fact, I have heard from folks who have come to my townhalls and have talked about how the Affordable Care Act has saved their lives. If you pull health care away from them, people are going to get sicker, and some people may potentially die. And the third ethic is patient autonomy: the ability of patients to make the choices that impact their lives. Mr. Speaker, this bill does not empower patients to make their own choices. This bill limits those choices. It takes choice away from them. This is a bad bill that goes against everything that we in the medical profession swear to when we enter the profession. That is why you see doctors standing up and opposing this bill, hospitals opposing this bill, and health plans opposing this bill. That is why, when patients see what is in this bill, you will see American patients pushing back. If you thought the townhalls have been boisterous over the last few months, just try to pass this bill and take necessary health care away from folks. You are going to see those patients showing up in your townhalls. Let’s talk about some of the good things that have happened in the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act expanded and made coverage for birth control much more readily available. That is a good thing. Whether you are antichoice or prochoice, like I am, it is a good thing. What we have seen by expanding coverage to birth control is the number of unintended pregnancies are near alltime lows. That is what we ought to be doing. The Affordable Care Act expanded access to preventive health services. We know if we want to bring down the cost of health care, let’s diagnose the cancer early. Let’s treat it and let’s save that life. Let’s better manage disease. Let’s not go back to the old days where the patient showed up with the heart attack and then we went into action. That costs us a lot more. Let’s prevent that heart attack. Let’s provide better access to care. Mr. Speaker, let’s not make the President have to renege on a promise that he made. On the campaign trail and after being inaugurated, the President has said that any healthcare legislation was going to expand coverage, it was going to be cheaper, and it was going to be more accessible to patients. We know this bill that is being introduced does none of that. It cuts coverage. It is going to be more costly for people and fewer people are going to get it. Mr. Speaker, don’t make the President have to renege and go against the promise that he made. The American public is going to hold him accountable for that. Mr. Speaker, do the right thing. Let’s put American patients first. That is what we as doctors do every day, and that is why, again, doctors are against it, hospitals are against it, and health plans are against it. Mr. Speaker, let’s reject this bill. I urge all my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to stand against this bill. It is a bad bill. 
DESTABILIZING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DELBENE) for 5 minutes. Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, last night, House Republicans released a dangerous and irresponsible bill that threatens to destabilize our Nation’s healthcare system and rob millions of Americans of their health insurance plans. Since coming to Congress, I have worked tirelessly to find commonsense fixes to our Nation’s healthcare laws. We should be working together to build upon the reforms we have already made to expand coverage and reduce costs. But what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have put forward would make working families, seniors, children, and people with disabilities foot the bill for their poorly conceived experiment. What is worse, they are giving our constituents and their Representatives in Congress less than 48 hours to review it before jamming it through committees. As a former businesswoman and entrepreneur, I am always stunned to see leaders in Congress put forward a half baked plan like this—one that threatens massive disruption and chaos, released in the middle of the night without any data or metrics to show how it makes literally anything better. In the private sector, that is the sort of behavior that can get you fired. For a moment, let’s put aside the fact that committees are planning to mark up this legislation tomorrow without any data from the Congressional Budget Office on how many of our constituents can expect to lose health coverage or see their taxes go up. Let’s talk about the one thing we do know: this bill is an enormous tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. Through this bill, Republicans are trying to give an average tax cut of around $7 million to the 400 highestincome households—a tax cut they don’t need and didn’t ask for. They are doing it while ripping health insurance away from millions of hardworking Americans; forcing seniors to pay a staggering $3,200 more on premiums every year, for less coverage; increasing the cost of prescription drugs for middle class families; eliminating coverage for women’s health care, like birth control, breast cancer screenings, and maternity care; and decimating the Medicaid program for 62 million children and families, seniors, pregnant women, and people with disabilities. This is hardly what I would call a great deal or a better way for the middle class, which is what the American people were repeatedly promised by President Trump and Speaker RYAN. b1230 No, their idea of a healthcare plan is a tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. When our healthcare system falls apart, we will all pay the price. My inbox has been flooded with phone calls, emails, and letters from constituents who are terrified about what the Republicans are trying to do. Like Stacie, from Snoqualmie, who got coverage under the Washington State exchange after spending years struggling to pay for health care. She recently wrote to me and said: ‘‘Just last week I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I am terrified—not as much by the cancer, but by the thought that we might not be able to pay for health insurance.’’ This bill spells disaster for people like Stacie. As her representative in Congress, I will not stand for it. I will fight every day to protect the reforms that have made health insurance accessible and affordable for her. We can’t go back to a time when getting sick meant going bankrupt, and that is exactly what this legislation would do. 
HOW LONG? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, my father, James LeRoy Butler, worked as a janitor. He had a fifth grade education, and now his youngest child is a Member of the 115th Congress. My father worked hard, and his word was his bond. On January 15, 2017, President Trump promised insurance for everyone. He also promised Americans would have much lower deductibles. On January 22, 2017, President Trump’s administration promised no one would lose healthcare coverage. But after only a glimpse of his plan, we now know these promises are not true, like so many other things that the White House has said. The people who need coverage the most, the people depending on the President the most, the middle class, working families, and the working poor will be left behind under this plan. In my district alone in Florida, over 66,400 people stand to lose healthcare coverage. To my Republican colleagues, I ask: How long will we endure empty promises and madeup stories coming out of the White House? How long? I call on the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, delivered in 1965, when he marched from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, and he asked this question: ‘‘How long? Not long, because no lie can live forever.’’ How long? Mexico will pay for the wall. I will release my tax returns. Discriminatory travel bans. Hidden ties with our enemy Russia. How long? Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please hold President Trump accountable and do what you know in your hearts is right. Demand answers and allow the facts to lead you to justice. How long? 
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REPLACEMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans released a bill last night. That bill deals with every American’s welfare—every American’s welfare—every child’s welfare in this country. None of them were able to testify before the committee, before the committee marks it up on Wednesday. None of them were able to come to that committee and say how it will affect them or their families or their fellow citizens. None of them were able to testify as to the benefits of the Affordable Care Act for them, their families, their children, and their neighbors. None of them will have been able to read and digest the bill. Mr. Speaker, last night, after locking it away in a basement for days, and just as reporters were leaving to go home, Republicans released the text of their legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The country has been waiting for 7 years for the Republican replacement, for the Republican alternative, for the Republicans to redeem their promise of a better plan, a better way to ensure the security of having health care that is affordable and available to each American and to their families and their children. Republicans have been promising, since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, that they would repeal it entirely and enact something better. They don’t repeal it entirely, and they don’t offer something better, something that covers more Americans and lowers costs to consumers. For 7 years, they have said we have a better plan. Last night, they revealed the inaccuracy of that representation; the baitandswitch, if you will, of that representation; the pretense to their conservatives who have voted some 65 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act that they were not going to offer a bill that did that, notwithstanding the fact that they said that is what they are going to do. The legislation they introduced would repeal, of course, some parts of the Affordable Care Act and replace them with policies that will take health coverage away, take health care away from millions of Americans and make millions of others pay more for less. President Trump, just the other day from that rostrum, promised the American people that the Republican plan would ‘‘have insurance for everybody.’’ That was not true. Neither the House Republicans nor the Senate Republicans nor President Trump have offered such a plan, and the plan that was revealed last night does not fulfill that representation. Mr. Speaker, it should not surprise us, however, that our President says things that prove to be not accurate. He also said from that rostrum that the policies would be far less expensive and far better than they are now. This bill does not do that, and the President has offered no bill that does that. This plan fails that representation miserably. It increases healthcare costs for middle class families in order to pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest, who don’t need them to afford health care. We should not penalize people for becoming wealthy. We applaud their success. But we should not subsidize health care for those of us who can afford our health care while those who cannot are left to fend for themselves. In other words, the Republicans are once again saying you are on your own. Their bill also raids the Medicare trust fund, threatening its longterm solvency. In fact, the affordable care added to the life expectancy of Medicare. The bill that the Republicans have put forward imposes severe cuts to Medicaid as well. It forces States and healthcare providers to carry the burden of the uninsured while taking away funding for expanded Medicaid. Their bill requires States to ration care by throwing those with preexisting conditions into ‘‘sick pools,’’ with higher premiums, higher deductibles, and waiting periods for coverage. And what services would be available under Medicaid? Their plan replaces the individual responsibility requirement which, by the way, Mr. Speaker, as you may well know, was the proposal of The Heritage Foundation. The Heritage Action for America, which is the political arm of the foundation, opposes the Republican bill. Not for the same reason I do, but because they believe it continues much of what ACA tried to do in protecting Americans in a plan that was initially proposed by The Heritage Foundation and adopted by Governor Romney in Massachusetts. Unbelievably, Mr. Speaker, Republicans won’t even tell the American people how much this legislation will cost and what its impact will be on consumers’ wallets and on our insurance markets. How do you do that? You have hearings, you listen to people, you listen to their experiences now, you listen to what their needs are, and you listen to those who have the greatest experience on their view of what the impact of this legislation will be. There have been no such hearings and none are planned. Republicans know that millions of Americans will lose coverage under their legislation: those covered under Medicaid, the health insurance exchanges, and even those with employerbased insurance. That is why, Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, they are rushing to see this bill put in force before it is illuminated by the light of day and before the American people find out how they will be impacted. Thankfully, Mr. Speaker, it will be difficult for House Republicans to enact their bill into law, not only because of the extreme opposition to those proposals by the American people, as we have seen in townhall meeting after townhall meeting after townhall meeting across this country, but also because the House and Senate Republicans are already rejecting it. It is not certain that House Republicans can even reach a majority in this House on their legislation. The head of the Republican Study Committee, the largest group of Republicans, has said this bill is not acceptable. The gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS ), the head of the Freedom Caucus, has said this bill does not repeal the Affordable Care Act, which is his objective and the objective of the Freedom Caucus. Senator CRUZ has said that as well. Senator PAULhas said that as well. Senator LEEhas said that as well. One thing is clear, however, Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are going to have to find the votes on their own to dismantle the protections incorporated in the Affordable Care Act that the American people now have. Is the Affordable Care Act perfect? It is not. Should we have spent the last 6 
years trying to make it work as well as it possibly can? Yes, we should have. Were we able to do that? No. The only alternative the Republican Party offered to the American people and to this House was to repeal. Not to replace, not to repair, not to fix, not to make sure it was more affordable and more available to the American people so that we would be a healthier and stronger nation. Their only option was to repeal. b1245 Mr. Speaker, I urge Republican leaders to withdraw this bill. Let us work together to ensure what almost every Member says they want, and that is a healthcare program in America that is affordable by all, available to all, and enjoyed by all. That is what President Trump said at that rostrum just days ago. This bill that the Republicans are going to mark up on Wednesday does not do what they say or what President Trump said. The American people will oppose it, and we will reflect their opposition in this House. But we are available to our Republican colleagues in good faith to work together to ensure that what the President said— available to all, at a lower price, with everybody having access—we will support that bill, if it exists, and we will work with our Republican colleagues to pass it and give that protection and security to the American people. Mr. Speaker, I note that there have not been many Republicans to speak this morning. I understand that one Republican spoke about this bill. I am amazed if they think this is a better way. I am amazed if they think this will do a better job than the Affordable Care Act. I am amazed if they think they are going to bring costs down and care up, and that we don’t have a lot of Republicans, Mr. Speaker, coming to this floor and claiming victory. They are not here because they can’t claim that victory. Let’s reject this bill, Mr. Speaker. Let’s work together. We can do better. The American people expect us to do better. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until 2 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 48 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. FOXX) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER Reverend Gary Studniewski, St. Peter’s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer: O God, You, who have looked upon this grand American experiment with such favor from its beginning and who have preserved it by Your providence, graciously hear our prayers for our Nation, that it may be a bastion of liberty, of justice, of true freedom. Bless this governing assembly with the spirit of Your wisdom, that its Members may decide everything for the wellbeing and peace of all. May these servants never turn aside from just and noble purposes, as You give them the light to discern these purposes. Dear Lord, grant each House Member, their families, and their staffs strength, comfort, and always the peace of the kingdom where You reign today and forever. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House her approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. SOTO led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
HONORING MADILYN GAWRYCH TURNER (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a bright young constituent from my district in southern Illinois on winning a scholarship in the VFW Patriot’s Pen essay competition. Enacted in 1995, the Patriot’s Pen program is designed to foster patriotism by allowing students the opportunity to express their opinion on patriotic themes. This year’s theme was ‘‘The America I Believe In.’’ Madilyn GawrychTurner of Jonesboro Elementary School in Jonesboro, Illinois, was sponsored by the VFW post in Anna, Illinois. I would like to congratulate Madilyn, and I know she will have a very bright future. Also, Madam Speaker, I would like to take just a second, if I may, to wish my wife a happy anniversary for the 37 years that we have been together. 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REPEAL (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, last night our Republican colleagues finally revealed their secret healthcare bill, and it is clear that TrumpCare doesn’t care. Here are the top five reasons why: Number one, TrumpCare cuts Medicaid. It creates block grants to States that will lead to less care, including forcing seniors out of nursing homes and reducing health care for the poor. Number two, TrumpCare eliminates healthcare subsidies. In its place, it creates substandard tax cuts that will ensure millions of Americans can no longer afford health insurance. Number three, TrumpCare favors the rich. It provides a tax giveaway for the rich, while leaving the middle class with less access to care. Number four, TrumpCare hurts our hospitals. It kicks people off of insurance, guaranteeing hospitals, employer plans, and taxpayers will ultimately foot the bill. Number five, TrumpCare defunds Planned Parenthood. This will leave millions of women without health care. In summary, TrumpCare doesn’t care, and it won’t work. f 
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE SOUTH CAROLINA WOMEN’S BASKETBALL TEAM (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, Sunday afternoon, the University of South Carolina’s women’s basketball team clenched their third consecutive Southeastern Conference championship. The Gamecocks beat Mississippi State 59–49 in the SEC’s women’s basketball tournament title game in Greenville, South Carolina. Juniors Kaela Davis of Suwanee, Georgia, and A’ja Wilson of Irmo, South Carolina, an extraordinary constituent, led the team with an impressive 38 combined points. This allstar team will likely hold the number one seed in the NCAA tournament that will begin on March 17. Head coach Dawn Staley joined the University of South Carolina in 2008, building a team based on teamwork and determination. In the eight seasons that Coach Staley has been with the program, the South Carolina Women’s Basketball Team has also seen three SEC regular season championships, three Sweet 16 seasons, and the program’s first number one national ranking, with an average home attendance of over 14,000 Gamecock fans. As March marks Women’s History Month, it is especially fitting to congratulate Coach Dawn Staley and the historic Gamecock women’s basketball team. Best wishes for continued success in the NCAA playoffs. Go Gamecocks. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REPEAL AND REPLACE (Mr. EVANS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, last night House Republicans released their plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans and the Trump administration say that they want a healthcare plan that cuts costs and covers more Americans; yet they introduced a plan that takes away from millions of Americans and puts the poorest Americans, our seniors, our people with preexisting conditions, and working class families at greater risk of getting sick. According to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, approximately 220,000 Philadelphians would lose their health insurance if the Affordable Care Act is repealed without adequate replacement. We cannot take this risk. The new plan is an insult to the millions of Americans who have fought hard to try to get ahead. Now is the time to resist. 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S PEEPING TOMCRATS (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, the census counts the population every 10 years, but the Census Bureau also sends out a mandatory, intrusive personal and more timeconsuming, 28 page document called the American Community Survey. The survey asks intrusive questions like how many toilets does a person have in their house; what time does a person leave and come home from work; does any person in the house have poor eyesight, difficulty dressing, or mental issues. If this Orwellian survey is ignored, the government may come after the citizen. First, the telephone calls start: weekly, then daily. Then Uncle Sam sends his peeping tomcrats to lurk around homes, forcing citizens to comply. If a person still refuses to hand over private information to the intrusive eyes of the government, the government may assess fines up to $5,000. My bill, H.R. 1305, makes the American Community Survey voluntary and also removes the associated criminal penalties. The ACS is a violation of privacy and a costly abuse of government power. And that is just the way it is. 
THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, in recent weeks, I held three townhall meetings and a roundtable discussion about health care in my district. Hundreds of constituents attended, and altogether I spent more than 10 hours listening to our folks. The best ideas come from the people, Madam Speaker. I know you know that, and I feel it is my duty as a Representative to hear my constituents’ input. The American Health Care Act reflects what I have heard from patients, families, doctors, and many others over the past 8 years. Our bill will lower costs, increase choices, and give patients greater control of their health care. We are helping middleincome Americans gain access to affordable coverage. It also protects those with preexisting conditions and allows young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance until age 26. Most importantly, this legislation is moving through the Congress in an open and transparent manner. I invite the people of Florida’s 12th Congressional District and everyone to read and share the American Health Care Act at readthebill.gop. f 
FORSYTH ACADEMY (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, March is National Reading Month, and students across the country often kick off this observance by celebrating the birthday of treasured children’s author Dr. Suess. Last week I visited Forsyth Academy in WinstonSalem, North Carolina, where I read ‘‘There’s a Wocket in My Pocket!’’ to first grade students. Forsyth Academy is a charter school serving students from kindergarten through eighth grade. The school was founded on the principles of academic excellence, moral focus, parental partnership, and student responsibility. Its leadership believes in setting high standards, making expectations clear, providing meaningful instruction, and watching children surpass expectations as a result. It is always a pleasure to visit local schools and witness the great things happening in classrooms across the Fifth District. Every student in every school deserves an excellent education, but, unfortunately, we are falling far short of that goal. Thankfully, innovative charter schools like Forsyth Academy are providing thousands of families new hope and opportunity. School choice is a powerful tool to help children succeed, and I am encouraged by the momentum that is building. I look forward to the work ahead and exploring additional opportunities to provide parents more choices for their children’s education.

b1700 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky) at 5 p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1362) to name the Department of Veterans Affairs communitybased outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa, the Faleomavaega Eni Fa’aua’a Hunkin VA Clinic. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1362 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITYBASED OUTPATIENT CLINIC, PAGO PAGO, AMERICAN SAMOA. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs communitybased outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa, shall after the date of the enactment of this Act be known and designated as the ‘‘Faleomavaega Eni Fa’aua’a Hunkin VA Clinic’’. Any reference 
to such communitybased outpatient clinic in any law, regulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the United States shall be considered to be a reference to the Faleomavaega Eni Fa’aua’a Hunkin VA Clinic. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. RADEWAGEN ) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from American Samoa. 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and add extraneous materials. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from American Samoa? There was no objection. Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1362, a bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs community based outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa, the Faleomavaega Eni Fa’aua’a Hunkin VA Clinic. I have sponsored this bill in order to honor my predecessor and a true public servant, the Honorable Faleomavaega Eni Fa’aua’a Hunkin. Born on August 15, 1943, in Vailoatai Village, American Samoa, Mr. Faleomavaega graduated from Brigham Young University in 1966 and subsequently joined the United States Army and served in Vietnam. However, his career in the Army was just the beginning of his public service. Mr. Faleomavaega served as a staff member to A.U. Fuimaono, American Samoa’s first Delegate atlarge to Washington, D.C., from 1973 to 1975. Having earned his law degree from the University of Houston, he next served as staff counsel to the Committee on the Interior and Insular Affairs. In 1981, Mr. Faleomavaega returned to American Samoa to serve as our deputy attorney general until 1984, then as our lieutenant governor until 1989. During this period, Mr. Faleomavaega reentered military service in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1982 to 1989. In 1989, Mr. Faleomavaega began his tenure as the congressional Delegate from American Samoa. He went on to win 13 consecutive terms, making him the longest serving Delegate to date from American Samoa. While in Congress, he diligently served the interests of his constituents as a member of both the House Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Natural Resources. Sadly, my friend Eni Faleomavaega passed away on February 22. He is survived by his wife, 5 children, and 10 grandchildren. I would now like to say a few personal words about the man whom I came to call a true friend. Given that I challenged him for his seat from 1994 until 2014, when I won my first term, Eni and I had a long and complicated relationship. Though we were often at odds politically, we always treated one another with the utmost respect and grace, allowing us to form a shared bond that I am very thankful for and will never forget. Ours was a true friendship that demonstrated that, despite whatever political differences we may have, we can all come together for the good of those we serve. While we may have had disagreements on national issues, we were very much in sync when it came to Federal policy and funding for American Samoa. As a veteran whose longterm health suffered due to his service in Vietnam, Eni dedicated his life to improving conditions for veterans in American Samoa and took great pride in securing funds to build the local VA clinic which has served our veterans well. Therefore, I can think of no better way to memorialize his dedication to the people of American Samoa and his service to our country in uniform than having the local VA clinic in Pago Pago, which he worked so hard for, named in his honor. I want to encourage my colleagues in the House and Senate to salute my predecessor by supporting this measure so that we may honor this good man for his lifelong service and dedication to the people of American Samoa and to veterans everywhere. This legislation satisfies all of the committee’s naming criteria and is supported by the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post Number 3391. Once again, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1362. This tribute to our fellow colleague, a fellow veteran, our friend Eni, who passed last month, is truly well deserved. I would also like to thank the gentlewoman from American Samoa for bringing this bill to the floor. And just as importantly, in her time here, she has proven to be the staunchest advocate of this Nation’s veterans, a true friend to veterans, and a colleague who carries on Eni’s commitment to this unwaveringly. Eni devoted his public life to service, it was clear, ensuring that the unique needs and interests of the people of American Samoa were met in every bill that came through this body. For any of us who worked alongside him during those 13 terms, his unfailing commitment to his people and his ever present smile will never be forgotten. In addition to his work here and the things you heard the gentlewoman say, Eni served in the United States Army from 1966 to 1969 and as an officer in the United States Army Reserve from 1982 to 1989. He served honorably in the Vietnam war and left the military with the rank of captain. He and his wife were also active members of their church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints. As a Vietnam veteran and Army Reserve captain, congressional aide, lieutenant governor, and Member of Congress, there simply could be no better example of what it means to be a representative of his people and a citizen of this great Nation. I fully support the naming of this outpatient clinic at Pago Pago in his honor and urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time until all Members have had an opportunity to speak on each side. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. SABLAN ), another true champion of our veterans and a member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1362, a bill that honors the late former Delegate from American Samoa, Eni Faleomavaega, by naming the veterans communitybased outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa, the Faleomavaega Eni Fa’aua’a Hunkin VA Clinic. A Vietnam veteran himself, Eni worked tirelessly to secure this clinic for veterans in American Samoa. His efforts to ensure all veterans in his district enrolled in VA health care, to secure rentfree space for the clinic through an agreement with the United States Army Reserve, and his testimony to the VA’s CARES Commission resulted in a recommendation that a clinic be established and eventually led to the approval of the clinic by the Veterans Administration. Eni was relentless in his pursuit of this goal so his fellow veterans in American Samoa would no longer have to travel more than 2,000 miles to Honolulu to seek care at a VA facility. It is fitting that it now be named after him. Eni was someone I looked to as a leader. He was the dean of the Territories Caucus when I first came to Congress in 2009. He had served here for some 20 years by that point; but his experience was even more longstanding, having worked on the staff of Representative Philip Burton, a champion of the territories and all of the people in America who are often overlooked and forgotten. There were two things in particular I saw in Eni. First, he had absolutely no hesitation in representing the people of American Samoa and providing glimpses of the culture with the rest of us. He relished the opportunity to wear his lavalava, one of the traditional pieces of clothing. He took pride in his traditional tattooing. He never hesitated to 
sing the songs of his people 8,000 miles away. Though a Delegate in this House, Eni Faleomavaega never presented himself as anything less than a Member of Congress. In doing so, he never diminished the standing of his constituents and their right, like all Americans, to have their voice heard here in the people’s House. The second lesson I learned from our departed friend was that the responsibilities of a Member of Congress go beyond the parochial concerns of our district. Of course, we are here to be sure that the people and place we represent are treated fairly and that our special circumstances are taken well into account in the formulation of Federal law and policy; but beyond that local responsibility, we all have a larger responsibility to act and speak on behalf of our Nation as a whole. Eni certainly demonstrated that larger role we must all accept by his advocacy for Native Americans and by taking leadership in the foreign affairs of our Nation, especially in Asia and the island nations of the South Pacific. A good Member of Congress takes care of their own people, just as Eni did. A great Member of Congress understands that their people can only thrive when the Nation as a whole is a place of justice and peace. Those are the lessons I learned from knowing Eni Faleomavaega, and for what he taught me, I will forever be grateful. Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this important piece of legislation. When those veterans in American Samoa see Eni’s name, it will strike them about what he has done and the work that he did here in Congress. I would also like to give a heartfelt thanks again to the gentlewoman for bringing this bill forward and for honoring her friend the way she has. I encourage Members to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers at this time. Once again, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1362 a bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs community based outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa the Faleomavaega Eni Fa’aua’a Hunkin VA Clinic. This is a fitting way to honor the life and service of my good friend and colleague former Congressman Eni Faleomavaega of American Samoa. During his 26 years of service in the House of Representatives, Congressman Faleomavaega displayed unwavering commitment to addressing a wide range of issues affecting veterans in the Pacific. His focus on access to health care and veteran services in remote areas of the Pacific ensured that veterans had access to the critical resources and services they needed and deserved after serving their country. His efforts directly contributed to increasing the quality of life of veterans throughout the Pacific region. Naming the VA facility in Pago Pago in his honor is a tribute to his service and commitment to the veterans in the Pacific region. Congressman Faleomavaega’s compassion for veterans can be attributed to his own service as an Army officer during the Vietnam conflict. Serving in this capacity gave him firsthand knowledge of the sacrifices servicemen make to protect our way of life. I deeply miss Eni’s advice, friendship and compassion for veterans. His passing has created a void for all that have known him. On behalf of the people of Guam, I extend my condolences to his family and the people of American Samoa. Our lives are richer for knowing Eni. I also extend my appreciation to Congresswoman RADEWAGEN in putting forward this legislation. It is a very appropriate way to memorialize an important part of Eni’s work on behalf of the people of American Samoa. Un dangkulo na si Yu’os ma’ase (with deepest gratitude), Eni. You are deeply missed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. RADEWAGEN ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1362. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
FRED D. THOMPSON FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 375) to designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 719 Church Street in Nashville, Tennessee, as the ‘‘Fred D. Thompson Federal Building and United States Courthouse’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 375 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The Federal building and United States courthouse located at 719 Church Street in Nashville, Tennessee, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Fred D. Thompson Federal Building and United States Courthouse’’. 
Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the Federal building and United States courthouse referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Fred D. Thompson Federal Building and United States Courthouse’’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. b1715 
Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 375. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 375 would designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located in Nashville, Tennessee, as the Fred D. Thompson Federal Building and United States Courthouse. I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACK BURN ) for her leadership on this legislation. Senator Thompson was respected for his work as a lawyer, an actor, and as a United States Senator. This legislation is a fitting tribute that I am honored to bring to the floor today. Fred Thompson first made a name for himself as an assistant U.S. attorney from 1969 to 1972. That experience brought him to the national stage in his subsequent position as special counsel on a number of Senate committees, most notably as minority counsel with the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, better known as the Watergate Committee. It was thenCounsel Thompson who helped frame Senator Howard Baker’s now famous question, ‘‘What did the President know, and when did he know it?’’ in regards to the Watergate controversy. Thompson himself asked an even more important question related to the existence of taped conversations in the Oval Office—tapes that led to President Nixon’s eventual resignation. After returning to the private practice of law in Nashville, Thompson represented the chairperson of the State Parole Board who unearthed a cashfor clemency scheme involving the then Governor of Tennessee. This case was eventually made into a book and into the film ‘‘Marie.’’ Fred Thompson was cast to play himself, which launched his acting career. Throughout the 1990s, Fred Thompson appeared in supporting roles in some of the decade’s biggest movies, including ‘‘Days of Thunder,’’ ‘‘The Hunt for Red October,’’ and ‘‘Die Hard 2.’’ 
In 1994, Fred Thompson ran for political office for the first time and was elected to fill the remaining 2 years of Vice President Al Gore’s Senate term. He was reelected in 1996 to a full 6 year term and served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs until his retirement in 2002. That didn’t slow Senator Thompson down. He returned to acting and won the role of New York District Attorney Arthur Branch on the hit NBC show ‘‘Law & Order’’ between 2002 and 2007. It was in 2007 that Senator Thompson returned to politics by announcing his candidacy for the United States Presidency. Although his return to the political realm was unsuccessful, Senator Thompson’s popularity did not wane. He returned to acting on screen and on TV, wrote a memoir, and appeared often to comment on politics. Tragically, in 2015, Senator Thompson died from a recurrence of lymphoma. Senator Thompson was a man of many talents. Through it all, he never lost his roots as a Tennessean. Given Senator Thompson’s dedication to the law and public service, I believe it is more than fitting to name this courthouse and Federal building in Nashville after him. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this legislation, H.R. 375, which names the Federal building and U.S. courthouse in Nashville, Tennessee, after the late Senator Fred Thompson. Senator Thompson had a long and extraordinary career in many roles that included actor, lobbyist, private attorney, and radio show host. But he is best known and respected not for his hawking of reverse mortgages but for being an assistant U.S. attorney, a congressional staffer, and, lastly, a U.S. Senator representing the State of Tennessee. Senator Thompson was a graduate of Memphis State University and Vanderbilt Law School. Senator Thompson got his start in public life in 1967, when he served as an assistant U.S. attorney in Nashville, Tennessee. During his time in that office, he met U.S. Senator Howard Baker from Tennessee who became a lifelong mentor to Senator Thompson. After managing Senator Baker’s successful U.S. Senate campaign in 1972, Senator Thompson moved to Washington, D.C., where he was appointed counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee investigating the Watergate breakin and famously helped shape the direction and tone of those hearings. I think that he will be known as one who helped Senator Baker in formulating that ageold, timeless question: ‘‘What did President Nixon know, and when did he know it?’’ It is ironic that today, Mr. Speaker, people are asking about our current President, President Trump: What did he know, and when did he know it? I will tell you, President Trump stood right there at the rostrum of the House last week and said that the Republican health insurance plan would have insurance for everybody, the insurance would be far less expensive and far better than what we have today. But we see now that that was incorrect, as the Republicans have, on a Monday, I guess at some point before the day ended, introduced their repeal bill of the Affordable Care Act. We are here talking about Senator Thompson today, but I just can’t help asking: When did President Trump know that the Republican plan was going to throw 20 million people off of the Affordable Care Act depriving them of insurance? When did he know that? What did he know about this plan? Because not a whole lot of people around here knew of the plan until it was released because it was shrouded in secrecy, and it was released and a hearing scheduled to mark it up, to mark up the legislation with no hearings taking place on the underlying legislation. So no CBO score, no congressional hearings about it, introducing it in a cloud shrouded in secrecy, and, boom, it is dropped on the American people at a time when you are trying to distract attention from other questions about what President Trump knew about Russia, Russian hacking, and those kinds of questions. What did he know about the GSA hotel that the taxpayers own that he is leasing and now he is the lessor and the lessee of that hotel that belongs to the American people? What did he know and when did he know it? Those are questions that the American people have. We intend to get down to the bottom of it on this side. I hope that we will have some help on the other side. I do want to say that I support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I think the American people would be horrified to learn that of the 30 million people who were able to attain health insurance coverage and access to the healthcare system as a result of passage of the Affordable Care Act, many of those, a substantial number of those, will be thrown off of the rolls and deprived of the ability to have access to the healthcare system because of this new replacement bill that has been filed, which, as I said before, has not been scored. We don’t know how much the Medicare solvency issue is going to cost. We don’t know how much it is going to cost. We don’t know how much it is going to cost the taxpayers. We don’t know how many people will lose their jobs because, after all, it stands to reason if you are serving 30 million more people, that means you have brought a whole lot of people into the healthcare delivery business, people who are working, people who have jobs, people who have husbands, wives, parents, and children who are depending on them for support, and you are going to tell them that their jobs are at risk. Yes, they are, with this new law that has been halfbaked introduced and fasttracked to become law without people really knowing about it. This is something that people need to know about, people need to get out and exclaim their opposition to because it is going to hurt a lot of people. The way that this bill changes the Affordable Care Act is it makes it unaffordable for most Americans to be able to afford the insurance that they have gained as a result of passage of the Affordable Care Act. The premium subsidies are recalculated. Instead of based on a sliding scale which is an indication of need, this Republican plan is going to replace that and calculate the amount of the premium subsidy based on age. Now, what does that do, especially when you consider that some elderly people are more wellheeled than others? They can afford insurance, and they can afford to front the policy cost in return for the tax subsidy that they get. But what does that do to the younger people? So it is good news for some older people who are wellheeled. They will be helped by this Republican plan. But the average wage earner is going to be hurt—the younger people— because it is going to be more expensive for them. But then I have some bad news for the elderly people, also. Insurance companies under this new plan will be able to charge the elderly five times more than they will charge a younger person. That differential had been abolished in the Affordable Care Act, but the Republicans are bringing it back. Who is going to pay? It is going to be those same elderly people. You put it in one hand, and you take it out of the other. All of the elderly people in America, regardless of how much money you earn, should be concerned about that. Prioritizing health savings accounts over these premium subsidies is going to provide a great big tax cut to the wealthy. You can’t get away from that. It is going to hurt the working people of this country. It is going to be a tax giveaway to the wealthy. I am sad to hear and to see this plan, and all of you should be, also. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 11 minutes remaining. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT ). Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I stand today in strong opposition to the Republican proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act. This is a rushed bill, Mr. Speaker, that was written behind closed doors in total secrecy with no daylight and with no access to the important content of this bill that all of us should have ample time to be able to digest the details of it and be able to make a good decision that is consistent with the will of our constituents. This is a 
rushed bill that was written behind closed doors, again, in total secrecy. Mr. Speaker, procedurally, we have not seen a CBO score of this bill. There have been no hearings on this bill. There has been no expert testimony on the impact of this bill, and the effect to healthcare costs for families or the quality of coverage all of those families will receive is completely unknown. Substantively, this bill is an absolute nightmare. It guts Federal requirements for essential health benefits like maternity care. It shatters working Americans’ access to insurance covering abortions. It creates agebased subsidies, repeals all the ACA taxes, and completely destroys the Medicaid expansion program which so much helped many of our States. b1730 In our country, at least 11 million people will lose their healthcare insurance coverage as a result of this reckless dismantlement of Medicaid. In my district alone, over 156,000 individuals are going to lose their coverage with the repeal of the Medicaid expansion. Over 156,000 people, Mr. Speaker, will lose their coverage. This bill kicks the elderly, the poor, and the sick to the curb and benefits only the young, healthy, and incredibly wealthy. I urge my colleagues to stand with me in opposition. This bill is a serious heart attack to the American people. It is a blatantly partisan action to dismantle President Obama’s successful signature project: ObamaCare. Again, the 1 percent get their way. Mr. Speaker, as we move forward, decades to come, we will be able to go back and think of health care within the context of three major programs: Medicaid, Medicare, and ObamaCare. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE ), my friend. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, with exactly zero hearings on the topic, our Republican friends have now revealed their TrumpCare plan. Just to remind everyone what President Trump said during the campaign and promised, he said that his Republican plan would ‘‘have insurance for everybody,’’ and that it would be ‘‘far less expensive and far better’’ than what we have today. Well, now we actually have the plan out. What does it do? It kicks 20 million Americans off their health insurance. It sharply increases outofpocket costs for millions of American families. It rations care for millions of Americans on Medicaid. It includes massive cuts to Medicaid. It would make maternity care much more expensive. But don’t worry, there is good news. If you are a CEO of a healthcare company and you make, on average, as they do, somewhere between $13 million and $14 million, the tax increases that were leveled on you 6 years ago will now be repealed. So, congratulations. Those folks benefit, but 20 million Americans lose their health insurance. Please join me in saying ‘‘no’’ to TrumpCare. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just can’t get out of my mind, Mr. Speaker, those words of President Trump that everybody would have insurance and that it would be far less expensive and far better than what we have today. The Republicans have campaigned incessantly for the last 7 years on repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act, which they derisively referred to as ObamaCare. We are going to repeal it and we are going to replace it on day one is what they all said. And here we are at day 45, something like that, and we have had nothing but one scandal after another; but we have finally now gotten to the House Republicans revealing what they have shrouded in secrecy for so long over the last 7 years. It sputters out without much ado, trying to sneak it in, trying to keep it undercover so that the American people won’t realize what is being done to them. I can tell you that what is being done under those covers is not worthy of my comment descriptively at this time, but I will say that it is an illicit, illegitimate situation that is taking place because you are taking from a group of people who are in need and you are giving more to individuals who have and who don’t need. In this country we are all in the same boat together. That is what the Affordable Care Act did. It was an aspiration for health care for everyone. It wasn’t perfect. It is not a perfect bill. It needs some repairs done, if you will, some enhancements. We have never had the cooperation from the other side of the aisle to do anything to enhance that foundation that was already laid. Nobody can argue with the fact that 30 million people who did not have health care access and now having it is a bad thing. Nobody can argue that. They could argue that: Well, the way that it was done was bad. They say that we rushed it through without any input from them, but there were literally dozens of public hearings and markups. The bill, all 1,000 pages, was available for everyone to be able to read. They talk about reading the bill. Well, there are so many bills coming through right now that they don’t want people to take the time to read them. That is why they introduce them late in the day and then they schedule markups for them without even putting them in front of the committee for a hearing. No airing out of the bill and what it does. Why are they holding this and hiding it from the American people? It is because they are trying to get away with something that is going to be bad for the people. That is why. They knew that their changes, their repeal and replacement bill, if properly vetted, if the American people had an opportunity to learn what is in it, they knew it would not be popular. That is why they hid it from the public. That is why they are not having any hearings on it. They just want to proceed straight to a markup; pass it out of the committee; put it on the floor of the House; pass it out of the House with little debate; send it over to the Senate for a rubber stamp, they hope; and then on to President Trump, who, as I said, when did he know that this bill that he was going to be presented with perhaps did not provide coverage for everybody and was not far better in coverage than the Affordable Care Act? When was it that he learned that? The American people want to know a whole lot. There is a whole lot to investigate about President Trump and his campaign. There is a whole lot to investigate about this repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act with an inferior product, one that is slanted to the rich and hurts the working people of this country. Then it guts the Medicaid program, which millions and millions of people depend on to keep grandma and granddaddy and momma and daddy at the nursing home. Medicaid helps to make nursing home care affordable. But under this healthcare repeal legislation that the Republicans have filed, they are going to cut Medicaid. They are going to use the expansion of the Medicaid program which enabled 10 million people to gain coverage that they could not afford, and they are going to cut that. At the same time, they are going to cut the other part of the Medicaid program which provides for people to be able to have their loved ones properly cared for at the nursing home, instead of down in the basement or upstairs in the spare bedroom. So, get ready, ladies and gentlemen, for that inevitability if this legislation passes. Get ready for your loved ones to have no place to go, no nursing home facility to take care of them, because they will not be able to afford it and you will not be able to afford it. Who will suffer most? Momma and daddy and granddaddy and grandma. They are the ones that get the care that is so needed for the elderly. So in this bill, where they are going to cut 20 million people off the healthcare rolls, they are going to cut momma and daddy from the nursing home by cutting the Medicaid program and turning it into a block grant program and turning it over to the States. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 375. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
FAIRNESS FOR BREASTFEEDING MOTHERS ACT OF 2017 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1174) to provide a lactation room in public buildings, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1174 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fairness For Breastfeeding Mothers Act of 2017’’. 
(a) L ACTATION ROOM IN PUBLIC BUILDINGS .— Chapter 33 of title 40, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ‘‘§ 3318. Lactation room in public buildings ‘‘(a) DEFINITIONS .—In this section: ‘‘(1) APPROPRIATE AUTHORITY .—The term ‘appropriate authority’ means the head of a Federal agency, the Architect of the Capitol, or other official authority responsible for the operation of a public building. ‘‘(2) COVERED PUBLIC BUILDING .—The term ‘covered public building’ means a public building (as defined in section 3301) that is open to the public and contains a public restroom, and includes a building listed in section 6301 or 5101. ‘‘(3) LACTATION ROOM .—The term ‘lactation room’ means a hygienic place, other than a bathroom, that— ‘‘(A) is shielded from view; ‘‘(B) is free from intrusion; and ‘‘(C) contains a chair, a working surface, and, if the public building is otherwise supplied with electricity, an electrical outlet. ‘‘(b) LACTATION ROOM REQUIRED .—Except as provided in subsection (c), the appropriate authority of a covered public building shall ensure that the building contains a lactation room that is made available for use by members of the public to express breast milk. ‘‘(c) EXCEPTIONS .—A covered public building may be excluded from the requirement in subsection (b) at the discretion of the appropriate authority if— ‘‘(1) the public building— ‘‘(A) does not contain a lactation room for employees who work in the building; and ‘‘(B) does not have a room that could be repurposed as a lactation room or a space that could be made private using portable materials, at a reasonable cost; or ‘‘(2) new construction would be required to create a lactation room in the public building and the cost of such construction is unfeasible. ‘‘(d) NOUNAUTHORIZED ENTRY .—Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize an individual to enter a public building or portion thereof that the individual is not otherwise authorized to enter.’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1174, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues for their work on bringing this bill to the floor today. H.R. 1174 is a straightforward bill that would make nursing rooms available to new mothers in public buildings. The bill would apply to buildings already open to the public and which already have nursing rooms for employees. The requirements would not apply if existing space cannot feasibly be repurposed. This is a good bill that will make the lives of nursing mothers easier and will improve the accessibility of public buildings. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1174, the Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act of 2017, introduced by my good friend, ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON . I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ). Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Georgia for yielding. I certainly thank him for being a cosponsor of my bill. I should start, however, by thanking Chairman SHUSTER , and Ranking Member DEFAZIO, who have moved this bill so quickly. The bill is called the Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act of 2017. This is a real motherhood bill. Mr. DEFAZIO, Mr. JOHNSON , and B ARBARA COMSTOCK  have all joined me as cosponsors. H.R. 1174 requires locations that are either federally owned or leased to provide designated private and hygenic lactation space for nursing mothers. As I will indicate, no new space in buildings or expenditures is contemplated. Last Congress, I offered this bill as an amendment to the Public Buildings Reform and Savings Act of 2016, and I was pleased to have it pass the House. Space for lactating women is already required for Federal employees. We are really not talking about a new kind of benefit. Certainly, there is no new money. The reason that this is not new is because Federal employees already have lactating space under the Affordable Care Act. So I have to ask my good friends on the other side: As you try to repeal the Affordable Care Act, do you propose to erase this motherhood provision as well? Will you preserve it? b1745 My bill extends the lactating space requirement to include not just employees, but visitors and guests of Federal facilities across the Nation. H.R. 1174 also does not require additional Federal funds or space to be mandated at all. Since Federal employees already have this space, I look forward to visitors to Federal buildings also making use of this space. In our country, new mothers often come to visit Federal buildings, not only those who work in Federal buildings. The reason this is such an important bill is that the benefits of breast milk are so well documented: antibodies and hormones that boost babies’ immune systems, lower risks of asthma, diabetes, respiratory infections, and other diseases among breastfed babies. There are benefits also for nursing mothers. Research has shown that there are lower risks of diabetes and even cancer as a result of breastfeeding. Speaking of motherhood, the Republican healthcare plan would even make maternity care significantly more expensive. Now, this, of course, is a bill that is very easy to support, but when we think of its links to other important legislation, I ask that there be sincere consideration given to whether or not at this moment in time my good friends across the aisle want their legacy to be: We actually repealed your health care. I don’t think they are going to be able to do it. My Republican friends have no experience with structural reform. If you look at all the structural reform in our country, beginning with the New Deal, none of it was done by Republicans. Whether you are talking about the administrative agencies that are so important to all that we do in this country, Medicare, Medicaid, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, whatever you have in mind, these are structural reforms that Republicans 
have, if anything, opposed, as they opposed Social Security, for example. So here what they are trying to do is to unravel, take away health care, and then put something in its place. They have no experience doing anything like it. Anybody who has looked closely at it has to doubt, as I do, that they can do it. Look what they will be doing. In my own district, the District of Columbia, we have cut in half the rate of uninsured. Are Republicans going to give me a guarantee that that cut will remain if they replace the bill with the markup that is going on as we speak? Ninetysix percent of District of Columbia residents have health coverage today. That is comparable to other advanced countries in the world. As we know, most countries in the world already afford this kind of coverage. That makes the District, according to whoever is doing the counting, number one, number two, or number three in the Nation in health care provided to our residents. I am very proud of that. I am going to fight like mad to keep it. Mr. Speaker, many of us had healthcare townhalls over the recess. We saw what happened at the townhalls on affordable care that my good friends on the other side also had. They met a revolution from their own constituents. We didn’t have that problem in our townhalls. Some of the stories that residents brought forward are truly heartbreaking, so I want to leave you with one. A woman who came to testify at my healthcare townhall, her name is Markita. Markita’s grandmother was a D.C. Public Schools cafeteria worker for most of her career. She retired early. She retired before she had Social Security or Medicare. She was suffering from diabetes and a stroke, but she was so prideful that she never let anyone know that she had to slice her pills in half just to get by. Now she is under the protection of the Affordable Care Act. Markita’s grandmother is healthier and can afford her medication. She is no longer splitting her pills in half. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. COMSTOCK ). Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 1174, the Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act. I thank my colleague for introducing it. It was unanimously supported—thank you, Mr. Chairman—in committee and in full committee. As expected, it is going through because people understand this is a commonsense bill, so I am happy to support this once again. I know you were discussing H.R. 375 earlier. I did want to return to the bill to designate the Federal building and courthouse in Nashville, Tennessee, to my good friend, Fred D. Thompson. That building will now be named after him appropriately. Fred Thompson was a largerthanlife character, a true patriot, and a great wit who believed in and lived the American Dream in starring roles on stage, screen, and national politics. He served as a Senator for 8 years, and then later he ran for President. Originally he was here in Congress serving as a counsel where, of course, we had that famous line: ‘‘What did the President know, and when did he know it?’’ That was a line that he was well known for. What he was also often not given credit for was what a profoundly good lawyer he was. He had come to the attention of people in Tennessee by LAMAR ALEXANDER when Howard Baker came and asked nowSenator LAMAR  ALEXANDER to take a role in the Watergate hearings, he said: No; you want to have Fred Thompson there. He asked his friend Fred Thompson to come and serve in that role. Fred then became an actor because when they went to write a movie about a woman who had been dealing with corruption in Tennessee politics, and Fred had been her lawyer, they couldn’t find someone to play Fred, and they came and asked him: Could you play yourself? He said: Well, I guess I could. That is how he became a character actor and a largerthanlife character there. Some of his famous lines there: ‘‘Stack ‘em, pack ‘em, and rack ‘em.’’ In ‘‘Die Hard’’ I believe that one was. In movies, he starred with Paul Newman, Tom Cruise, Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Robert Duvall, Bruce Willis, Sissy Spacek, and so many others. After he came here to the Senate, he humorously said: ‘‘I often long for the realism and sincerity of Hollywood.’’ So this is somebody who took his job very seriously but never took himself seriously and continued to have that great wit. My husband and I were very privileged to know him and learn from him and spend many a good day and delightful time and evening with him and his wife, Jeri, his family, his children, and his many friends and admirers. We are so grateful for and appreciate his celebrated service and justly celebrated service to our country. This building will be a great memorial in a State that still very much reveres him. I was privileged to be able to attend his service where hundreds and hundreds of people from Tennessee came to honor him, from country singers to people who stood by the side of the road as we drove to his funeral service, saluting him and thanking him for his service. This is somebody who in today’s politics is sorely missed by all of us, and certainly most by his many friends, his family, and his scores of fans. God bless the Honorable Fred Thompson. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity to be able to have this building now be a legacy to his great service and being a great attorney and lawyer for this country. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. What happened 43, 44 years ago during the Watergate hearings with that seminal question that everyone keeps asking, ‘‘What did the President know, and when did he know it?’’ and in the words of Yogi Berra: ‘‘It’s deja vu all over again.’’ People are asking that question today, and it rings more loudly today than it did back then in 1973, 1974, ‘‘What did the President know, and when did he know it?’’ about a lot of issues. But this issue of the Affordable Care Act and whether or not you are going to repeal it and replace it with something better or you are going to repeal and replace it with something worse, what did the President know, and when did he know it? Because it is clear now to everybody who has had the opportunity to look at this offering that the Republicans have put forward, you are going to be worse off today than you were when the Affordable Care Act was implemented because 20 million of the 30 million people who are on coverage now will be off coverage if this thing passes. This Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act of 2017, which was introduced by my colleague and friend, Congresswoman NORTON , which I am so pleased to be a cosponsor of, is a bill from a mother herself who knows the needs of other mothers. This is bipartisan. I am so happy that this bill is passing today, but I will tell you, I can’t help but think of the 20 million people who are going to lose their coverage. A lot of those people are women and children, even some babies. They are going to lose coverage because the Republicans are kicking them off under their plan. They will be a healthy part of that 20 million people who lose their coverage. It is unfair. It is not right. It is unAmerican. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on my side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 8
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SANFORD ). Mr. SANFORD. I thank the chairman for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise with the greatest respect for my colleague from the District of Columbia and her passion on this subject and the bill that she has introduced. I rise with equal respect for my colleague, Chairman BARLETTA , and the way in which he has walked this bill through the process, but I am going to oppose this bill. I am going to do so on the basis of process. I thought it important to explain why, given, I think, the amount of energy that has gone into the bill and the fact that I wasn’t able to voice a vote against it when it was voice voted at the committee level. I do so because I think that blank checks rarely work out well for the 
taxpayer. In fairness to the bill, it is not a blank check. The bill is actually prescribed in three different ways—the way in which it will impact Federal buildings. My problem, though, is on methodology in that the General Services Administration that ultimately gave the numbers to the CBO on which they base their score did not get in final form how many Federal buildings we are talking about. I think that leaves, therefore, something of an open end as to what this bill will ultimately cost; and that then goes to impact the very children for whom the breastfeeding will take place. b1800 A child born in America today is going to inherit a giant liability from the Federal Government in terms of the cost of our Federal Government. By accountants from both the left and the right, they have said what we have in place is not sustainable. Therefore, I think it is very important, from a process standpoint, that we look at a final form number on any of these bills that we throw out and we prescribe, regardless of, again, how wellmeaning they are and how measured they are, which is certainly the case with this bill. I wanted to stand to give a quick explanation. I thank the gentleman for the time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SANFORD ), my friend, opposes the bill because the CBO scoring process, which came up with a nocost estimate for this bill, the contention is that that CBO study was insufficient. Well, I am sure that my colleague and friend from South Carolina will agree with me that with no CBO scoring for this congressional Republican healthcare repeal bill that they have put forward, then we are certainly not in a position to proceed further with a fasttrack legislating process, as this bill seems to be on. They are going to mark it up with no hearings. When we were dealing with the Affordable Care Act, we held 79 hearings over 2 years, heard from 181 witnesses from both sides of the aisle, and posted the bill online for 30 days. The CBO scoring actually showed that this bill was going to save money, as opposed to cost. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleague from South Carolina to be in opposition to his own party’s healthcare repeal bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the kind gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY ), my friend. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his work on this. Mr. Speaker, after weeks of empty promises that he had a secret plan to insure every American at lower costs with higher quality care, President Trump is now standing behind a House GOP repeal plan that was introduced last night that fails every single one of those promises. Based on estimates that we have seen so far, millions of Americans stand to lose coverage, out ofpocket costs will skyrocket, and the quality of care will plummet. But today, hours after that bill was introduced, Mr. Speaker, our President referenced a tobeannounced second and third phase of his healthcare rollout that Secretary Price referred to as ‘‘a work in progress,’’ once again injecting our healthcare system with crippling uncertainty that is hurting our patients, hospitals, behavioral health providers, and local economies. If you are so proud of this bill, why has it been locked in dark rooms? Why not have an open debate? What are we so afraid of to have a debate on this floor? That is why I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, to support my resolution of inquiry tomorrow, to try to make sure that the details that have been discussed by this White House and by the Republicans behind closed doors are open for America to understand before we cram a healthcare overhaul down our throats. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I was looking at my congressional calendar, and I noticed that this year we are working in Washington, D.C., more than we have under the past 5 years of the rein of the Republicans. We have been the most donothingest Congresses on record for many years, and so this year we will be working. But I am baffled as to whether or not it is because the Republicans don’t want to go home and face their constituents in a townhall meeting about the Affordable Care Act repeal bill that they have filed. We will be here in session now for another 4 weeks before the public has a chance to hear from their Representative when they return home for an extended time. But on the flip side, that gives everybody time to prepare for those upcoming townhall meetings which need to be held to explain what they are trying to do to the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ), my friend. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Last Thursday, I was wandering the Capitol searching for the Republican’s secret repeal bill. We went from room to room, and it wasn’t there. But now that I have seen it, I understand why they would want to hide it. Even if we can all agree that we need to make health care more affordable and more accessible, this bill is not the solution. In fact, this bill will only make things worse. The Republican repeal bill gives tax breaks to the rich. We are talking about over $600 billion overall, while taking away health coverage from millions of Americans. The Republican repeal bill will drastically increase the cost of health insurance for millions of Americans, with the biggest increase for seniors and for working families. It would radically change the Medicaid program, slashing funding, and covering fewer people. The Republican repeal bill will force Governors and State legislators to ration care. My Republican Governor weighed in now and said that it would be trouble for Illinois if Medicaid is cut back. Who do they want to cut out? Children, the elderly, people with disabilities. Thousands of hardworking individuals in Illinois will lose access to health coverage. As I said, in fact, Republican Governor Bruce Rauner said that our State ‘‘won’t do very well’’ if the Republican repeal bill becomes law. The Republican repeal bill breaks the promise made by President Trump to cover more Americans at lower cost. I oppose this bill. I am going to fight tooth and nail to protect our care. And, frankly, I think this bill, as my mother would say, is deader than a door nail. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON ). Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to correct the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. SANFORD ), who opined that this bill was not scored correctly. We are talking about space already designated for Federal employees. The intent of the bill, and I am the author of the bill, which could never have gotten through committee if it involved the expenditure of funds. Yes, sometimes these lactation rooms will be dedicated to lactation, but that doesn’t mean they are exclusively designated to lactation. And the whole notion that some Federal buildings don’t have such space means they are in violation of the Affordable Care Act, which requires that they have such space, even if it is not space that is exclusively used for the few women who are lactating or nursing. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have one more point that I needed to make about this abolition, this abolishment of the Affordable Care Act plan that has been submitted. A foundation of their plan is the demise of the individual mandate that requires people to purchase insurance, so they are claiming that that is a matter of freedom. Well, the fact is that when everyone is required to have insurance, it reduces the cost for everyone else. So it was a costsaving measure that has worked with the rise in premiums being at the lowest level in decades. The affordable care has worked to cut the cost of health care. But what they are doing when they abolish that individual mandate is they are also going to penalize people who decide to drop their coverage and pick 
it up later. Or if you miss one payment because you missed work, missed a paycheck or something like that, you missed 1 month and have to reinstate, then you are going to pay a 30 percent penalty on your insurance. That is highway robbery. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

TITLE II—SUSTAINING NATIONAL SPACE COMMITMENTS 
SEC. 201. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUSTAINING NATIONAL SPACE COMMITMENTS. 
(1) honoring current national space commitments and building upon investments in space across successive Administrations demonstrates clear continuity of purpose by the United States, in collaboration with its international, academic, and industry partners, to extend humanity’s reach into deep space, including cislunar space, the Moon, the surface and moons of Mars, and beyond; (2) NASA leaders can best leverage investments in the United States space program by continuing to develop a balanced portfolio for space exploration and space science, including continued development of the Space Launch System, Orion, Commercial Crew Program, space and planetary science missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope, WideField Infrared Survey Telescope, and Europa mission, and ongoing operations of the ISS and Commercial Resupply Services Program; (3) a national, governmentled space program that builds on current science and exploration programs, advances human knowledge and capabilities, and opens the frontier beyond Earth for ourselves, commercial enterprise, and science, and with our international partners, is of critical importance to our national destiny and to a future guided by United States values and freedoms; (4) continuity of purpose and effective execution of core NASA programs are essential for efficient use of resources in pursuit of timely and tangible accomplishments; (5) NASA could improve its efficiency and effectiveness by working with industry to streamline existing programs and requirements, procurement practices, institutional footprint, and bureaucracy while preserving effective program oversight, accountability, and safety; (6) it is imperative that the United States maintain and enhance its leadership in space exploration and space science, and continue to expand freedom and economic opportunities in space for all Americans that are consistent with the Constitution of the United States; and (7) NASA should be a multimission space agency, and should have a balanced and robust set of core missions in space science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight and exploration, and education. 
Congress makes the following findings: (1) Returns on the Nation’s investments in science, technology, and exploration accrue over decadeslong timeframes, and a disruption of such investments could prevent returns from being fully realized. (2) Past challenges to the continuity of such investments, particularly threats regarding the cancellation of authorized programs with bipartisan and bicameral support, have disrupted completion of major space systems thereby— (A) impeding planning and pursuit of national objectives in space science and human space exploration; (B) placing such investments in space science and space exploration at risk; and (C) degrading the aerospace industrial base. (3) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109–155; 119 Stat. 2895), National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–422; 122 Stat. 4779), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18301 et seq.) reflect a broad, bipartisan agreement on the path forward for NASA’s core missions in science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight and exploration, and education, that serves as the foundation for the policy updates by this Act. (4) Sufficient investment and maximum utilization of the ISS and ISS National Laboratory with our international and industry partners is— (A) consistent with the goals and objectives of the United States space program; and (B) imperative to continuing United States global leadership in human space exploration, science, research, technology development, and education opportunities that contribute to development of the next generation of American scientists, engineers, and leaders, and to creating the opportunity for economic development of lowEarth orbit. (5) NASA has made measurable progress in the development and testing of the Space Launch System and Orion exploration systems with the nearterm objectives of the initial integrated test flight and launch in 2018, a human mission in 2021, and continued missions with an annual cadence in cislunar space and eventually to the surface of Mars. (6) The Commercial Crew Program has made measurable progress toward reestablishing the capability to launch United States government astronauts from United States soil into lowEarth orbit by the end of 2018. (7) The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, in its 2015 Annual Report, urged continuity of purpose noting concerns over the potential for cost overruns and schedule slips that could accompany significant changes to core NASA programs. TITLE III—MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOWEARTH ORBIT SEC. 301. OPERATION OF THE ISS. 
(a) S ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) after 15 years of continuous human presence in lowEarth orbit, the ISS continues to overcome challenges and operate safely; (2) the ISS is a unique testbed for future space exploration systems development, including longduration space travel; (3) the expansion of partnerships, scientific research, and commercial applications of the ISS is essential to ensuring the greatest return on investments made by the United States and its international space partners in the development, assembly, and operations of that unique facility; (4) utilization of the ISS will sustain United States leadership and progress in human space exploration by— (A) facilitating the commercialization and economic development of lowEarth orbit; (B) serving as a testbed for technologies and a platform for scientific research and development; and (C) serving as an orbital facility enabling research upon— (i) the health, wellbeing, and performance of humans in space; and (ii) the development of inspace systems enabling human space exploration beyond lowEarth orbit; and (5) the ISS provides a platform for fundamental, microgravity, discoverybased space life and physical sciences research that is critical for enabling space exploration, protecting humans in space, increasing pathways for commercial space development that depend on advances in basic research, and contributes to advancing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics research. (b) OBJECTIVES .—The primary objectives of the ISS program shall be— (1) to achieve the long term goal and objectives under section 202 of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18312); and (2) to pursue a research program that advances knowledge and provides other benefits to the Nation.

Subtitle C—Journey to Mars 
Congress makes the following findings: (1) In accordance with section 204 of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (124 Stat. 2813), the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, through its Committee on Human Spaceflight, conducted a review of the goals, core capabilities, and direction of human space flight, and published the findings and recommendations in a 2014 report entitled, ‘‘Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration’’. (2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy communities. (3) With input from the public, the Committee on Human Spaceflight concluded that many practical and aspirational rationales for human space flight together constitute a compelling case for continued national investment and pursuit of human space exploration toward the horizon goal of Mars. (4) According to the Committee on Human Spaceflight, the rationales include economic benefits, national security, national prestige, inspiring students and other citizens, scientific discovery, human survival, and a sense of shared destiny. (5) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed that Mars is the appropriate long term goal for the human space flight program. (6) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that NASA define a series of sustainable steps and conduct mission planning and technology development as needed to achieve the longterm goal of placing humans on the surface of Mars. (7) Expanding human presence beyond low Earth orbit and advancing toward human missions to Mars requires early planning and timely decisions to be made in the nearterm on the necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve shortterm and long term goals and objectives. (8) In addition to the 2014 report described in paragraph (1), there are several independently developed reports or concepts that describe potential Mars architectures or concepts and identify Mars as the longterm goal for human space exploration, including NASA’s ‘‘The Global Exploration Roadmap’’ of 2013, ‘‘NASA’s Journey to Mars–Pioneering Next Steps in Space Exploration’’ of 2015, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s ‘‘Minimal Architecture for Human Journeys to Mars’’ of 2015, and Explore Mars’ ‘‘The Humans to Mars Report 2016’’. 
(a) S ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) expanding human presence beyond low Earth orbit and advancing toward human missions to Mars in the 2030s requires early strategic planning and timely decisions to be made in the nearterm on the necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve shortterm and longterm goals and objectives; 
(2) for strong and sustained United States leadership, a need exists to advance a human exploration roadmap, addressing exploration objectives in collaboration with international, academic, and industry partners; (3) an approach that incrementally advances toward a longterm goal is one in which nearerterm developments and implementation would influence future development and implementation; and (4) a human exploration roadmap should begin with lowEarth orbit, then address in greater detail progress beyond lowEarth orbit to cislunar space, and then address future missions aimed at human arrival and activities near and then on the surface of Mars. (b) HUMAN EXPLORATION ROADMAP .— (1) IN GENERAL .—The Administrator shall develop a human exploration roadmap, including a critical decision plan, to expand human presence beyond lowEarth orbit to the surface of Mars and beyond, considering potential interim destinations such as cis lunar space and the moons of Mars.

(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the following findings: (1) NASA initially estimated that the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission would launch in December 2020 and cost no more than $1,250,000,000, excluding launch and operations. (2) On July 15, 2016, NASA conducted its Key Decision PointB review of the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission or approval for Phase B in mission formulation. (3) During the Key Decision PointB review, NASA estimated that costs have grown to $1,400,000,000 excluding launch and operations for a launch in December 2021 and the agency must evaluate whether to accept the increase or reduce the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission’s scope to stay within the cost cap set by the Administrator. (4) In April 2015, the NASA Advisory Council— (A) issued a finding that— (i) highperformance solar electric propulsion will likely be an important part of an architecture to send humans to Mars; and (ii) maneuvering a large test mass is not necessary to provide a valid inspace test of a new solar electric propulsion stage; (B) determined that a solar electric propulsion mission will contribute more directly to the goal of sending humans to Mars if the mission is focused entirely on development and validation of the solar electric propulsion stage; and (C) determined that other possible motivations for acquiring and maneuvering a boulder, such as asteroid science and planetary defense, do not have value commensurate with their probable cost. (5) The Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission is competing for resources with other critical exploration development programs, including the Space Launch System, Orion, commercial crew, and a habitation module. 
(6) In 2014, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that NASA conduct an independent cost and technical assessment of the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission. (7) In 2015, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that NASA preserve the following key objectives if the program needed to be descoped: (A) Development of high power solar electric propulsion. (B) Ability to maneuver in a low gravity environment in deep space. (8) In January 2015 and July 2015, the NASA Advisory Council expressed its concern to NASA about the potential for growing costs for the program and highlighted that choices would need to be made about the program’s content. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the technological and scientific goals of the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission have not been demonstrated to Congress to be commensurate with the cost; and (2) alternative missions may provide a more cost effective and scientifically beneficial means to demonstrate the technologies needed for a human mission to Mars that would otherwise be demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission. (c) EVALUATION AND REPORT .—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall— (1) conduct an evaluation of— (A) alternative approaches to the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission for demonstrating the technologies and capabilities needed for a human mission to Mars that would otherwise be demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission; (B) the scientific and technical benefits of the alternative approaches under subparagraph (A) to future human space exploration compared to scientific and technical benefits of the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission; (C) the commercial benefits of the alternative approaches identified in subparagraph (A), including the impact on the development of domestic solar electric propulsion technology to bolster United States competitiveness in the global marketplace; and (D) a comparison of the estimated costs of the alternative approaches identified in subparagraph (A); and (2) submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the evaluation under paragraph (1), including any recommendations. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall contract with an independent, nongovernmental systems engineering and technical assistance organization to study a Mars human space flight mission to be launched in 2033. (b) CONTENTS .—The study shall include— (1) a technical development, test, fielding, and operations plan using the Space Launch System, Orion, and other systems to successfully launch such a Mars human space flight mission by 2033; (2) an annual budget profile, including cost estimates, for the technical development, test, fielding, and operations plan to carry out a Mars human space flight mission by 2033; and (3) a comparison of the annual budget profile to the 5year budget profile contained in the President’s budget request for fiscal year 2017 under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code. (c) REPORT .—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the study, including findings and recommendations regarding the Mars 2033 human space flight mission described in subsection (a). (d) ASSESSMENT .—Not later than 60 days after the date the report is submitted under subsection (c), the Administrator shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress an assessment by the NASA Advisory Council of whether the proposal for a Mars human space flight mission to be launched in 2033 is in the strategic interests of the United States in space exploration.

(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the following findings: (1) Human space exploration can pose significant challenges and is full of substantial risk, which has ultimately claimed the lives of 24 NASA astronauts serving in the line of duty. (2) As United States government astronauts participate in longduration and exploration space flight missions they may experience increased health risks, such as vision impairment, bone demineralization, and behavioral health and performance risks, and may be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation. Exposure to high levels of radiation and microgravity can result in acute and long term health consequences that can increase the risk of cancer and tissue degeneration and have potential effects on the musculoskeletal system, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, immune function, and vision. (3) To advance the goal of longduration and exploration space flight missions, United States government astronaut Scott Kelly participated in a 1year twins study in space while his identical twin brother, former United States government astronaut Mark Kelly, acted as a human control specimen on Earth, providing an understanding of the physical, behavioral, microbiological, and molecular reaction of the human body to an extended period of time in space. (4) Since the Administration currently provides medical monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment for United States government astronauts during their active employment, given the unknown longterm health consequences of longduration space exploration, the Administration has requested statutory authority from Congress to provide medical monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment to former United States government astronauts for psychological and medical conditions associated with human space flight. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the United States should continue to seek the unknown and lead the world in space exploration and scientific discovery as the Administration prepares for longduration and exploration space flight in deep space and an eventual mission to Mars; (2) data relating to the health of astronauts will become increasingly valuable to improving our understanding of many diseases humans face on Earth; (3) the Administration should provide the type of monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment described in subsection (a) only for conditions the Administration considers unique to the training or exposure to the space flight environment of United States government astronauts and should not require any former United States Government astronauts to participate in the Administration’s monitoring; (4) such monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment should not replace a former United States government astronaut’s private health insurance; (5) expanded data acquired from such monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment should be used to tailor treatment, inform the requirements for new space flight medical hardware, and develop controls in order to prevent disease occurrence in the astronaut corps; and (6) the 340day space mission of Scott Kelly aboard the ISS— (A) was pivotal for the goal of the United States for humans to explore deep space and Mars as the mission generated new insight into how the human body adjusts to weightlessness, isolation, radiation, and the stress of longduration space flight; and (B) will help support the physical and mental wellbeing of astronauts during longer space exploration missions in the future.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017. This bipartisan and bicameral bill grew to maturity through many long and serious discussions about the future of our Nation’s space program. I am encouraged by the bill’s persistent emphasis on the continuity of purpose and stability. It is crucial that we continue to support NASA’s ongoing human exploration efforts. I am proud to note the inclusion of the To Research Evaluate, Assess, and Treat Astronauts Act, better known as the TREAT Astronauts Act, which will ensure that our Nation’s astronauts receive support for medical issues associated with their service. The language of this bill is exactly the same as the TREAT Astronauts Act that was passed in the House on December 7, 2016. As a medical professional myself, I care deeply about this issue. I am honored to have sponsored the original legislation, and am proud to contribute to an important program that will support the brave men and women of our astronaut corps. Outer space poses many medical challenges. The human body simply is not designed to thrive in microgravity, or weightlessness. We know that spending time in space is risky. We want to understand the reasons why the TREAT Astronauts Act will ensure the retention of our astronauts’ medical data and help to continue our research in aerospace medicine, while also providing our astronauts with the medical care that they need and deserve after risking so much in service to our country. This bill continues support for the important work on the Space Launch System, the Orion crew vehicle, and commercial cargo and crew programs. 
b1815 The future of the International Space Station is another key topic addressed in this legislation. We are committed to operating the ISS until 2024. Beyond that date, however, maintaining NASA’s current level of support for the ISS will dramatically affect the rest of NASA’s portfolio, particularly in human spaceflight. This bill opens the debate about how and under what circumstances NASA’s presence in lowEarth orbit can and should be continued beyond 2024. Balancing NASA’s presence and low Earth orbit and beyond low Earth orbit will require thoughtful and informed decisionmaking. My hope is that NASA will explore unique partnerships that will maintain NASA’s ability to utilize low Earth orbit in an efficient manner by leveraging private sector investment. This bill will help inform and frame that imminent debate. This bill also addresses NASA’s facilities and infrastructure here on Earth. NASA must develop a plan so that its labs, tools, facilities, and infrastructure can support a robust exploration agenda. Rightsizing NASA’s footprint is a longstanding challenge. We must maintain critical capabilities but also find efficiencies where they may exist. The bill before us would call on NASA to develop a policy to ensure that NASA maintains infrastructure to support bold exploration. If NASA determines that facilities are not necessary or could be transferred to the private sector, the bill calls on NASA to do so in accordance with a transparent and equitable process. The bill also urges the administration to pursue a sensible policy on termination liability so that NASA makes the best possible use of taxpayer dollars rather than the inefficient policy implemented by the previous administration. This bill sets out clear intentions for NASA as we move forward into the next chapter of American space exploration. I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 442, the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017. NASA is a catalyst for scientific discovery, innovation, inspiration, and economic growth. This bill helps to ensure that NASA continues to make significant advances in science, aeronautics, human exploration, and space technology. During the last Congress, the House passed the NASA Authorization Act of 2015, H.R. 810. H.R. 810 was a bipartisan effort and, in particular, it set the longterm goal of sending humans to the surface of Mars and directed NASA to prepare a human exploration roadmap for what is needed to get there. I am pleased, Mr. Speaker, that the Senatepassed bill that is before us today reflects significant content from H.R. 810. Sending humans to deep space destinations and eventually to Mars is a challenge and goal that I know will bring out the best of our U.S. industry and universities, and it will inspire our young people to seek the education and develop the skills needed to help the United States send first astronauts to the martian surface. Of course, keeping our focus on that goal over multiple Congresses and administrations will really not be easy. That is why this bill, S. 442, comes at a critical time. Witnesses at a recent hearing of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology emphasized the need for stability for NASA if it is to carry out the challenging tasks that our Nation has given it. While S. 442 is a 1year reauthorization, it enables NASA to continue making effective progress on its programs, including on the key systems that will enable us to send NASA astronauts beyond low Earth orbit and on to Mars. The bill also provides policy direction in a number of important areas, including astronaut health care, human spaceflight safety, protection of Apollo lunar landing sites, orbital debris mitigation, and facilities and infrastructure planning. Mr. Speaker, while I support S. 442, it is not a perfect bill. It does not directly address all of NASA’s science programs, namely, earth science and heliophysics. Those programs provide the spacebased measurements to help scientists understand the Earth’s systems and changing climate to predict space weather events, which can have devastating impacts on our terrestrial infrastructure. At the same time, I believe that section 501 of the bill reaffirms the importance of maintaining a balance and adequately funded science program, which includes astrophysics, planetary science, earth science, and heliophysics. In addition, while the bill reflects the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies’ topline mark of $19.5 billion for NASA for fiscal year 2017, I am disappointed that it authorizes lower levels than the proposals of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for NASA’s science, aeronautics, and space technology accounts. We should be investing more, not less, in these important R&D areas. Mr. Speaker, we need a strong NASA, and we need to provide it with a sustained commitment of vision, resources, and support to carry out the challenging tasks our Nation has given it. Before I close, I want to recognize the efforts of committee leadership, including Chairman LAMAR SMITH, Space Subcommittee Chairman BRIAN BABIN, and the former Subcommittee Ranking Member Donna Edwards for their work on H.R. 810, a significant portion of which is included in this Senate bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this Senate bill, the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH), the chairman of the full committee. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Subcommittee on Space for yielding me time. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017 provides bipartisan and bicameral guidance for NASA as we usher in a new era of space exploration. I support this bill and the direction it establishes for America’s space program. S. 442, which passed the Senate by unanimous consent on February 17, includes almost all of the policy provisions from the House authorization bills that passed the House in the last Congress with broad bipartisan support. In fact, it authorizes the House’s proposed fiscal year 2017 funding level of $19.5 billion. This bill provides a balanced NASA portfolio across all of the mission directorates. It maintains congressional direction for priority nearterm programs, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, the Space Launch System, the Orion crew vehicle, the International Space Station, and the Commercial Crew and Cargo Programs. NASA’s exploration projects are vulnerable to changes in the political landscape. We must have a flexible space program, but not one that is knocked off course. Successfully combining flexibility with constancy of purpose requires thoughtful planning. This bill directs NASA to create a roadmap for human exploration. An exploration roadmap will help NASA inform Congress and the President, as well as direct the future path and tempo of exploration for decades to come. This legislation also looks to the future of scientific exploration. It provides support for NASA’s Mars 2020 rover, the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, and a mission to Europa, Jupiter’s icy moon that possibly harbors the building blocks of life. It establishes that one of NASA’s fundamental objectives is ‘‘the search for life’s origin, evolution, distribution, and future in the universe.’’ Toward that end, this legislation directs the NASA Administrator to develop both an exoplanet exploration strategy and an astrobiology strategy within 18 months after the bill is signed into law. It also directs the NASA Administrator to report on how the Administration can expand collaborative partnerships for these scientific endeavors. Just 2 weeks ago, NASA announced that it had confirmed the existence of 
seven planets around a nearby star, three of which are in the ‘‘habitable zone.’’ This bill builds upon these awe inspiring discoveries and will help ‘‘unlock the mysteries of space,’’ as President Trump said in his inaugural address. Part of achieving success in space exploration is making sure that NASA is not burdened with funding other agency missions. For example, there are 17 agencies with responsibility for studying climate change, but only 1 agency, NASA, is responsible for space exploration. This bill directs the NASA Administrator to seek reimbursement whenever responsibilities are transferred to NASA from another agency or when NASA funds another agency’s activities. Finally, I would like to thank my colleague and Texas friend Dr. BRIAN BABIN, the chairman of the Space Subcommittee, for his work on the TREAT Astronauts Act, which is included in this authorization. Chairman BABIN’s legislation gives NASA the ability to care for our astronauts and enhance our understanding of the effects of spaceflight on the human body. I would also like to thank the Science, Space, and Technology Committee staff for their years of effort on this bill, especially the Space Subcommittee director, Tom Hammond, who has worked diligently to ensure that this bill became a reality. I also recognize the minority staff who were essential to the process as well. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California, (Mr. BERA), the current ranking member of the Space Subcommittee. Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member and the chairman for this bill. This bicameral and bipartisan bill that we are considering today, the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017, authorizes NASA’s appropriations for the fiscal year 2017. If enacted, the bill’s provisions will provide important stability and funding and consistent vision that we need for NASA to succeed as they continue to make progress across disciplines of space and earth science, in human exploration and spaceflight, innovative technologies, biomedical research, and in aeronautics. Mr. Speaker, NASA truly is a symbol of American excellence and ingenuity. For NASA to continue doing the great things that it does, including preparation for flying SLS and Orion, launching the James Webb Space Telescope, and landing humans on Mars, it is critical that S. 442 be enacted. And while I would have preferred a more comprehensive outlook of NASA’s science discipline—namely, in earth science, planetary science, astrophysics, and heliophysics—I am pleased the bill provides the consistent policy direction our Nation’s space and aeronautics programs require and deserve. Notably, the bill sets the longterm course of sending humans to the surface of Mars and directs NASA to provide a human exploration roadmap outlining the capabilities and milestones needed to achieve the goal. In closing, Mr. Speaker, NASA’s space and aeronautics programs help maintain our competitiveness, stimulate innovation and economic growth, and inspire the next generation to dream big and garner the skills to turn those dreams into action. NASA and our space program have a long history of bipartisan support. I urge Members of the House to pass S. 442, the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017. Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER .) Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, and I hope I don’t take 5 minutes. I rise today in support of S. 442, the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017. I have long been a supporter of our Nation’s space program. I have seen what we can accomplish when we put our best and brightest in a room together and give them the resources they need to solve tough scientific, engineering, and mathematical problems to better our society and our understanding of the solar system and beyond. The bill before us today ensures the hardworking people at NASA and the thousands of private aerospace workers in Colorado and across the country have a constant sea of purpose and the backing of Congress to continue advancing our quest to understand our planet and explore other celestial bodies. Mr. Speaker, I enjoy serving on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. While we may not agree on every issue, when it comes to our space programs, we come together and find the best solutions to the problems we face, and this bill does exactly that. b1830 As my colleagues on this committee know, I am very passionate about getting our astronauts to the surface of Mars. This bill will require detailed plans from NASA on how to do that and, more importantly, on the timelines so that we can get to Mars through the development of a human exploration roadmap. In addition to this roadmap, section 435 of the bill also requires NASA to report back on the feasibility of a human mission to Mars by the year 2033. Sixteen years from now, Earth and Mars will be aligned for what could be the most significant and inspirational journey in history. About 18 months ago, our committee heard testimony from former NASA leadership about our deep space exploration missions. I asked them to provide us a date: When can we get to Mars? As it turns out, the planets’ orbit and alignment in 2033 is optimal. So as my colleagues on the committee know, I have prepared a bumper sticker, Mr. Speaker, just for you, showing 2033 as the time we are going to get our astronauts to Mars. I thank Chairman SMITH, Representative BABIN, Representative E DDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas, as well as Representative BERA for allowing me to work and to help put section 435 into the bill. I know we can do this. This is a mission that all Americans will be proud of. They are so proud of our space program, the scientists and engineers at NASA. This will give us a real goal and a real project to get our astronauts to Mars by 2033. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time on the bill. I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. I thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their work: our chairman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH); and also the ranking gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON ); my counterpart on the subcommittee, Representative BERA; and also Representative PERLMUTTER , the gentleman from Colorado; and all of my fellow members on the subcommittee and our entire committee. I take a moment to also thank our hardworking staff, and that includes Tom Hammond, Mike Mineiro, Jonathan Charlton, Ryan Faith, Molly Fromm, and Chris Wydler from the majority staff. I also thank Steve Janushkowsky, Jeannie Kranz, Stuart Burns from my congressional staff, and Allen Li and Pamela Whitney from the minority staff. Mr. Speaker, it is because of their countless hours of hard work, negotiation, and finding common ground that we will now send this bill from the floor of this House of Representatives to the resolute desk of the Oval Office to be signed into law. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 442. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause (2)(a)(1) of rule IX, I rise to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the privileges of the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the form of the resolution appear in the RECORD at this point. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WOMACK ). Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California? There was no objection. The form of the resolution is as follows: 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President shall immediately disclose his tax return information to Congress and the American people. Whereas, in the United States’ system of checks and balances, Congress has a responsibility to hold the Executive Branch of government to the highest standard of transparency to ensure the public interest is placed first; Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax return information to the public; Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline disclosure because they contain highly instructive information including whether the candidate paid taxes, what they own, what they have borrowed and from whom, whether they have made any charitable donations, and whether they have taken advantage of tax loopholes; Whereas, disclosure of the President’s tax returns could help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election understand the President’s financial ties to the Russian Federation and Russian citizens, including debts owed and whether he shares any partnership interests, equity interests, joint ventures or licensing agreements with Russia or Russians; Whereas, the New York Times has reported that President Trump’s close senior advisers, including Carter Page, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and General Michael Flynn, have been under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their ties to the Russian Federation; Whereas, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Interfax, a Russian media outlet, on November 10, 2016 that ‘‘there were contacts’’ with Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, and it has been reported that members of President Trump’s inner circle were in contact with senior Russian officials throughout the 2016 campaign; Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in companies located in the United States and around the world; Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the Office of Government Ethics, the President has refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses; Whereas, the director of the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics said that the President’s plan to transfer his business holdings to a trust managed by family members is ‘‘meaningless’’ and ‘‘does not meet the standards that . . . every president in the past four decades has met’’; Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the U.S. Constitution for the express purpose of preventing federal officials from accepting any ‘‘present, Emolument, Office, or Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state’’; Whereas, according to the Washington Post, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. has hired a ‘‘director of diplomatic sales’’ to generate highpriced business among foreign leaders and diplomatic delegations; Whereas, according to Reuters, the Trump International Hotel could receive up to $60,000 from the Kuwaiti government for a party it held at the Hotel on February 22, 2017. Whereas, according to the New York Times, the President used a legally dubious tax maneuver in 1995 that could have allowed him to avoid paying federal taxes for 18 years; Whereas, the most signed petition on the White House website calls for the release of the President’s tax return information to verify compliance with the Emoluments Clause, with 1 million, 78 thousand signatures as of the date of this resolution; Whereas, the Chairmen of the Ways and Means Committee, Joint Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee have the authority to request the President’s tax returns under Section 6103 of the tax code; Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the information public; Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103 authority in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers; Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to international affairs, tax reform, government contracts, or otherwise: Now, therefore, be it: Resolved. That the House of Representatives shall— 1. Immediately request the tax return information of Donald J. Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as provided under Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and vote to report the information therein to the full House of Representatives. 2. Support transparency in government and the longstanding tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates disclosing their tax returns. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will now recognize the gentlewoman from California to offer the resolution just noticed. Does the gentlewoman offer the resolution? Ms. ESHOO. I do, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution. The Clerk read as follows:

the information therein to the full House of Representatives 2. Support transparency in government and the longstanding tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates disclosing their tax returns. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentlewoman from California wish to present argument on the parliamentary question whether the resolution presents a question of the privileges of the House? Ms. ESHOO. I do, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California is recognized. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, under clause 1 of rule IX, questions of the privilege of the House are ‘‘those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.’’ I believe the dignity and the integrity of the House are put at risk when this body refuses to exercise its statutory authority and constitutional obligation to operate as a check on the executive branch. Under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, three congressional committees have jurisdiction to request tax returns: House Ways and Means, Senate Finance, and the Joint Committee on Taxation. This authority was placed in the Tax Code by Congress in 1924 to allow for full investigations of several scandals in the Harding administration, including the Teapot Dome bribery scandal. Section 6103 was the subject of considerable debate in this Chamber, but, ultimately, Congress passed it in order to provide an important investigatory check on the executive branch. In 1974, section 6103 authority was used by the members of the Joint Committee on Taxation to publish a staff report on President Nixon’s tax returns revealing that he owed nearly a half a million dollars in back taxes. Today, I worry that we are rapidly approaching a scandal of a similar magnitude to these previous events. Since we voted on a similar resolution last week, the Attorney General and other senior administration officials have admitted that they met with Russian officials during the campaign and the transition period. This comes after the campaign and unequivocally last year saying that there was ‘‘no communications between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign.’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman will suspend. The gentlewoman is reminded that she must confine her remarks to the parliamentary question of whether the resolution qualifies under rule IX. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I understand, and I am working to establish that case. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman will confine her remarks to that question or the Chair will be prepared to rule. Ms. ESHOO. Further reports about the President’s potential conflicts of interest suggest that the House should exercise its oversight authority immediately, including massive foreign payments to the President’s hotels and prior business deals with foreign oligarchs around the world. The only way to determine whether these dealings represent—— The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman will suspend. Does the gentlewoman wish to present an argument as to whether the resolution qualifies under rule IX? The Chair has been patient. The gentlewoman must confine her remarks to make that argument. If not, the Chair is prepared to rule. The gentlewoman from California is recognized. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I am attempting to set forward the question of the privileges of the House on a privileged resolution, and this is a part of it. I believe the only way to determine whether these dealings represent violations of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution is by fully examining the President’s tax records. Contrary to the Chair’s ruling last Monday, there is no direct precedent in section 706 of the House Practice manual for the situation because the current situation is unprecedented. The President’s business empire makes him more susceptible to conflicts of interest than any President in our history. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is no longer recognized. The Chair is prepared to rule on the question. The gentlewoman from California seeks to offer a resolution as a question of the privileges of the House under rule IX. As the Chair ruled on February 27, 2017, and as demonstrated by section 706 of the House Rules and Manual, a resolution directing a committee to meet and conduct certain business does not qualify as a question of the privileges of the House. The resolution offered by the gentlewoman from California directs the Committee on Ways and Means to meet and consider an item of business under the procedures set forth in 26 U.S. Code 6103. Accordingly, the resolution does not qualify as a question of the privileges of the House. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is: Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the House? 
Mr. M CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. McCarthy moves that the appeal be laid on the table. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to lay the appeal on the table. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. RECORDED VOTE  
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15 minute vote on tabling the appeal will be followed by a 5minute vote on suspending the rules and passing H.R. 375, if ordered.

b1929 Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas changed his vote from ‘‘aye’’ to ‘‘no.’’ Messrs. ROKITA and LAHOOD changed their vote from ‘‘no’’ to ‘‘aye.’’ So the motion to table was agreed to. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
FRED D. THOMPSON FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FERGUSON ). The unfinished business is the question on suspending the rules and passing the bill (H.R. 375) to designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 719 Church Street in Nashville, Tennessee, as the ‘‘Fred D. Thompson Federal Building and United States Courthouse’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR ANTHONY ‘‘TONY’’ BEILENSON (Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I regret to inform the House that my predecessor, Anthony ‘‘Tony’’ C. Beilenson, died over the weekend. Anthony Beilenson was known for integrity, civility, intelligence, courage, and a willingness to work across the aisle, even when that caused him to differ from the orthodoxy of his own party. He served in this House for 20 years, from 1977 through 1997, and served for 2 years as chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He passed on Sunday, and I ask that Members rise and that the House observe a moment of silence. 
PUBLIC TIRED OF BIASED MEDIA (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, from Investor’s Business Daily: ‘‘The mainstream media’s open hostility to President Trump may be starting to backfire, according to the latest IBD/ TIPP poll. The poll found that 55 percent of the public says they have grown ‘weary from the media’s persistently negative coverage of President Trump.’ A roughly equal share, 54 percent, also believe that the news media ‘has assumed the role of the opposition party, constantly opposing the president and his policies at every turn.’’’ ‘‘The results are understandable, given the unusually hostile relationship the press has with Trump. ‘‘A study by the nonpartisan group Media Tenor found that only 3 percent of network news stories in the first month of the Trump administration could be described as positive.’’ ‘‘The poll found that 57 percent back Trump’s plan to hire 10,000 more immigration agents; 58 percent support the deportation of illegal immigrants charged with a crime, even if they haven’t been convicted; and 53 percent back Trump’s call to withhold federal aid to ‘sanctuary cities.’’’ ‘‘Meanwhile, 42 percent say Trump is providing strong leadership for the country, which is higher than the 40 percent Obama got last October.’’ f 
HOUSE REPUBLICANS’ BILL TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, it took 7 years, but it is finally here: the House Republican plan to make America sick again. Under this plan, millions of Americans will lose their health insurance, and millions of other families will pay more for worse coverage. At the same time, the Republicans’ bill rolls back Medicaid expansion and allows insurers to charge older enrollees more. We always knew that the House Republican plan would harm the most vulnerable Americans, but we still do not know how much this bill will cost and how many Americans it will cover. Now, House Republicans prefer it this way. They know that their bill will cover far fewer people than the Affordable Care Act does. They want to hide this fact from the American people and rush this bill through committee. Mr. Speaker, this is an obvious and embarrassing display of cowardice from the House Republicans. The American people deserve to know the consequences of this bill just as they deserve quality and affordable access to health care. With the Republican plan, it looks like the American people will get neither. 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, LILLIAN COX (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I work for the Texans in Meadows Place. They are led by Mayor Charles Jessup. The locals call Meadows Place the best square mile of smalltown America. Meadows Place has a secret. Shhhhh. Every man who lives there is in love with the same woman. We all love Lillian Cox. Lillian turned 110 on February 22. In 352 days, I am taking Lillian out for her 111th birthday. She will put on a nice dress, a necklace, and earrings. I will take her to the Live Oak Grill, where she will have the fried catfish she loves so much. I will have the chicken fried steak. And we may go dancing, if I can keep up with her. Lillian, happy 110th birthday. I will pick you up at 5 p.m. on February 22, 2018. 
THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am glad to be an adherent of the Constitution, as I know that my colleagues are. We believe in the separation of the three branches of government. That is why it was so noteworthy and so outrageous that the leader of the free world and Commander in Chief issued a patently irrational email or Twitter on Saturday morning this past Saturday regarding a personal and direct attack on the past President of the United States of America regarding that President having wiretapped this individual in an outrageous manner. Let me cite for you headlines in the Houston Chronicle: FBI chief seeks Trump rebuke of that horrible statement. I ask the Department of Justice to immediately respond to Director Comey’s request that you rebuke this outrageous statement that would accuse the President of any wiretapping that require either a Title III court, DEA, FBI, or require a FISA court. Mr. President, explain yourself. Justice Department, respond to this untruth now. The Constitution requires it, and the separation of the three branches of government, out of respect, requires it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind Members to direct their remarks to the Chair. 
CONGRATULATING SPECIALIST SUSAN TANUI (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to recognize and congratulate Specialist Susan Tanui, the 2016 Army SoldierAthlete of the Year. Specialist Tanui currently serves the soldiers at Fort Riley, Kansas, as a dental assistant. During her time in service, she has exemplified the Army’s seven core values—loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage—through her dedicated service, which is exemplified by her numerous decorations and awards. In addition to serving the U.S. Army, Specialist Tanui is currently pursuing a degree at Liberty University, represents the Fort Riley Division running team, the All Army team, and the U.S. Armed Forces as an Army athlete. She has also represented the U.S. Army in the U.S. Track and Field National Cross Country Championships in 2015 and 2016 and hopes, one day, to compete in the Olympics. I commend Specialist Tanui’s accomplishments, her outstanding character, and look forward to witnessing what she will do in the near future. Mr. Speaker, we are so proud of Specialist Tanui, the soldiers of Fort Riley, the home of the Big Red One. HONORING DR. NEHEMIAH DAVIS (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the life of a dedicated civil rights leader and pastor, Dr. Nehemiah Davis. Pastor Davis faithfully served the Mount Pisgah Baptist Church on Evans Avenue in Fort Worth, Texas, on the south side, for over 50 years. Along with serving as a spiritual leader in my hometown, Mr. Davis served as the president of the National Missionary Baptist Convention of America, where he supported churches nationwide. Pastor Davis’ dedication to the community eventually led to his induction into the Religious Hall of Fame and the recognition by the Boy Scouts of America with a Distinguished Service Award. Dr. Davis not only believed in nurturing spiritual growth, but fought for the equality of all Americans. He fought fearlessly on behalf of the AfricanAmerican community and led the local NAACP chapter for over 20 years. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Nehemiah Davis’ life of service. f 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S FAMILY BUSINESS (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, President Trump is a master at diverting attention, even the media’s. His diversions are a perfect foil from the constitutional questions that his and his family’s behavior have raised since he took the oath of office. With hotels and property developments all over America and the world, the Trump empire is dramatically expanding its domestic business, raising vital questions as to the Trumps’ profiting from public service, including from foreign entanglements that violate the Constitution. Outlined in Article II of the Constitution, the clause prohibits the President from receiving, other than his salary, any compensation, gift, or other form of profit from the United States, a State government, or their instrumentalities. Congress reserves its ability to consent to foreign emoluments but not to domestic emoluments. Our Founding Fathers were clear—no exceptions. It has been heavily reported in the papers that the Trump sons have now signed at least 17 new letters of intent with potential developers, even listing specific cities. They don’t have to tell their father about all this. The newspapers cover it in abundance. And the American people should never have to wonder whose interests the President serves. Today those doubts abound. America, the scales of justice need tending. [From The Washington Post, Mar. 4, 2017] TRUMP SONS, PLANNING EXPANSION OF FAMILY  BUSINESS , LOOK TO LEVERAGE CAMPAIGN  EXPERIENCE  (By Jonathan O’Connell, David A. Fahrenthold and Matea Gold) NEWYORK.—Donald Trump’s adult sons, who are overseeing a nationwide expansion of the family business during their father’s presidency, are envisioning ways that their experiences from the campaign trail can help them establish a footing in dozens of new markets. The idea is to move beyond a focus on luxury hotels in big metropolises and build boutique properties in a broader mix of cities, including some the Trump brothers came to know well during more than a year of intensive travel, fundraising and grassroots networking on the road to The White House. ‘‘I got to see a lot of those markets on the campaign,’’ Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, told The Washington Post in a recent interview from his office on the 25th floor of Trump Tower. ‘‘I think I’ve probably been in all of them over the last 18 months.’’ The initial plan is tied to the Trumps’ previously announced new chain, Scion, which is being designed as a lesscorporate feeling brand of highend hotels with a more affordable perroom price point than the Trumps’ fivestar properties. As with many existing Trumpbranded property deals, the developers would own the hotels while the Trumps would be paid licensing and management fees. The company says it has signed at least 17 letters of intent with potential developers. It is targeting an array of cities such as Austin, Dallas, St. Louis, Nashville and Seattle—and Trump Jr. said the campaign proved useful in forging relationships with potential new connections. ‘‘I met people along the way that would be awesome partners,’’ he said. The expansion plan illustrates how President Trump’s political rise has the potential to affect his business even as he and his sons promise to adhere to a strict ethical boundary between the company’s moves and the Trump administration. And it shows the inherent challenge in separating the family’s political work from its corporate interests, with upsides and potential problems. Extending the Trump business into a greater cluster of American cities could bring political benefits for a president who has vowed to bring jobs and economic prosperity to struggling communities. But it also comes as Trump has faced criticism from Democrats and ethics officials for his decision to retain his ownership stake in the company, a decision that means he stands to personally benefit from its growth. Building new hotels, for example, could create issues—tax disputes, allegations of labor violations or environmental violations—that require federal departments to consider cases that could directly impact the president’s finances. And while the Trumps have vowed to sign no new foreign deals, pursuing a raft of new domestic contracts from coast to coast means the Trumps are likely to engage in negotiations with private developers, banks and investors who see additional benefits in doing business with the president’s company. ‘‘It’s just going to add fuel to the fire that is already burning . . . with him having still a foot in both the boardroom and one in the Oval Office,’’ said Scott Amey, the general counsel of the nonpartisan watchdog group Project on Government Oversight. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The president in January added a team of ethics lawyers to the White 
House Counsel’s Office, while the company hired a longtime Republican attorney tasked with ensuring the Trump Organization minimizes conflicts of interest. In interviews, the Trump sons waved off the idea that their plans created any potential ethical problems. ‘‘There are lines that we would never cross, and that’s mixing business with anything government,’’ Eric Trump said. Donald Trump Jr. said that since the inauguration, he has spoken with his father twice on the phone and once in person—when he and his brother attended the announcement of their father’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. Eric Trump said he may ask his father how things are in the White House but would never discuss government or business affairs. ‘‘Will we ever talk about tax policy? Will I ever ask for anything that could otherwise benefit the business? Absolutely, emphatically not,’’ Eric Trump said. ‘‘He has no need to know what we’re doing, and I certainly don’t need to know what they’re doing, and I don’t want to.’’ The Trumps’ point man on the expansion is Eric Danziger, an experienced executive who was hired in 2015 after previously overseeing expansions at Carlson Hotels Worldwide, Starwood Hotels and the former Wyndham International. One of the first Scion projects is slated to open in Dallas, where a Turkishborn developer aims to open a sleek glass sixstory hotel as part of a $50 million mixeduse downtown development. The Austin, Cincinnati, Denver, Detroit, Nashville, Seattle and St. Louis areas are also possible targets, according to reports by Bloomberg News and business trade publications. The Trumps declined to say what other cities they were exploring for projects but said they were actively seeking contracts in many places. Danziger, speaking last month to Skift, an industry publication, called Scion a ‘‘fourstar lifestyle brand’’ with wide geographic appeal. ‘‘That kind of brand can be in every city— tertiary, secondary,’’ he said. ‘‘So, how many is that? The opportunity is for hundreds.’’ Because of the prohibition on foreign deals, Danziger said the company is ‘‘going to have full focus—instead of some focus—on growth domestically of both Trump and Scion.’’ The expansion will not be easy, according to analysts. The Trumps will be entering a crowded marketplace of new hotel lines from Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt designed to appeal to a broad crosssection of customers, said Michael J. Bellisario, a senior research analyst with the firm Robert W. Baird & Co. ‘‘There are so many more competitors out there today,’’ Bellisario said. For the Trumps to distinguish their projects from their competitors, they will need to be choosy about locations, Bellisario said. ‘‘You’ve got to be on the right street comer in the right market. You can’t open these hotels in Topeka, Kansas,’’ he said. ‘‘So when you think about that, how big can the new line get?’’ The plan is a big test for the younger Trumps. Just as Donald Trump stepped out from his father’s shadow in the 1970s to build the family real estate business into today’s worldwide collection of golf courses, hotels, condo towers, branded merchandise and other commercial holdings, now Donald Trump Jr., 39, and Eric Trump, 33, have a chance to make their mark. Along with their sister, Ivanka, who departed the company when their father entered office, the brothers have long served as executive vice presidents. Before their father ran for president, the three siblings helped expand the firm from focusing on New York to including the management of luxury hotels in top U.S. cities and seven countries, plus more than a dozen golf courses. The fruits of that work are still coming, as last month the company opened a new golf club in Dubai and, last week held a grand opening for a new hotelcondominium tower in Vancouver, B.C. A major transition for the sons is taking over a company in which the force behind every Trump company offering—whether it was selling hotel rooms, office buildings, golf outings, ties or raw steaks—was Donald Trump himself. In interviews, Trump Jr. and Eric Trump said they consider themselves protectors of the Trump brand, an effort they said is sometimes misunderstood. Critics viewed the announcement of Scion during the campaign as a move away from the Trump name. The family’s intent was the opposite; since they view the name Trump has a standard for luxury that ought to be insulated, they will use other brands for less pricey products. ‘‘We would never want to dilute the real estate brand by going into tertiary markets that can’t sustain the [luxury] properties as we build them,’’ Eric Trump said, ‘‘A lot of hotel companies have gotten this wrong.’’ Both sons worked for their father starting at young ages, doing landscaping and other labor on his projects. A University of Pennsylvania graduate, Trump Jr.’s first assignment at the company was to work with executives at New York City real estate projects. Eric Trump joined after graduating from Georgetown in 2006. He has overseen the Trump Winery near Charlottesville and worked on the Trump hotel in Las Vegas, where he developed a reputation as a hands on executive. ‘‘If there’s a property tax issue or any litigation, he flies into Las Vegas and takes care of it,’’ said Phil Ruffin, a casino mogul who is the Trumps’ partner in the Las Vegas project. ‘‘He hires the lawyer. If there are any capital improvements, he approves them. He is very energetic like his father— he will just work night and day.’’ With their father in charge, there was an informal division of labor among his three eldest children, governing which projects each swooped in to help. Ivanka Trump created her own brands of shoes, jewelry, handbags and coats. She took the lead on some of the Trump Organization’s mast prominent recent projects, such as the $212 million D.C. hotel, which had its soft opening in September. ‘‘I’m probably the most obviously like [Trump Sr.],’’ Ivanka Trump said in a 2011 company video titled ‘‘Trump: The Next Generation.’’ ‘‘In certain ways,’’ she added, ‘‘Eric is very similar to him in terms of his love of construction and building. And Don has his sense of humor.’’ The Trumps’ planned corporate expansion comes as the president has faced intense criticism from Democrats and ethics experts for his continued ownership interest. A liberal watchdog organization, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), has sued Trump, arguing that his hotel operations violate a constitutional provision barring the president from accepting gifts or payments from a foreign government. Some Democrats have argued that Trump’s international trademarks, including one longsought registration granted in February by China, also violate the Constitution’s emoluments clause. Trump has called the CREW lawsuit ‘‘totally without merit.’’ Amey, of the Project on Government Oversight, said there were ways for the Trumps to avoid potential domestic conflicts related to the hotel expansion. He said they could put the hotel business under another corporate structure, which does not involve a trust directly owned by the president himself. ‘‘There are solutions to solving this, [hut] there doesn’t seem to be a will and a desire to do that within the White House,’’ Amey said. The Trump brothers say they are taking ethics concerns seriously and are doing everything necessary to avoid distracting from their father’s work as president. ‘‘Have I used him as a sounding board in the past? One hundred percent,’’ Trump Jr. said. ‘‘Have I learned a lot from him? Couldn’t have had a better mentor. But he’s got real stuff he’s got to deal with. These are real people’s lives ....  S o  this notion that he is still running the business from the White House is just insane.’’ Trump Jr. scoffed at the idea that his father might have somehow viewed running for president—spending millions of dollars of his own money to run against more than a dozen Republican challengers and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton when few pundits gave him a chance to win—as a moneymaking endeavor. ‘‘That’s not a getrichquick scheme,’’ he said. ‘‘That doesn’t make any sense whatsoever.’’ f 
FLOOR SPEECH ON ANTISEMITISM (Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the rising wave of desecration, threats, and harassment targeting Jewish cemeteries, Jewish community centers, and religious institutions in northern New Jersey and across our country. JCCs and synagogues are bedrocks of religious and civic life for Jewish communities, housing preschools for children and a range of religious, educational, and social programs for families and seniors. Yet the safety and wellbeing of these communal spaces are the scope of extremism and anti Semitism. Recently, there have been eight bomb threats targeting six Jewish community centers in New Jersey and more than 100 across our country. Parents are pulling their children from religious schools. Others are afraid to attend religious services. It is unacceptable. In the last 24 hours alone, officials in my district have uncovered multiple swastikas defacing our public spaces. These are not cases of random hatred. They are part of a deeply disturbing national trend that requires immediate and decisive action from law enforcement and community leaders at all levels. As Elie Wiesel said: ‘‘Indifference, after all, is more dangerous than anger or hatred.’’ Leaders must stand up now against the rising trend of hatedriven terrorism against any ethnic or religious group, including Jews, Christians, Muslims, and others. Hate and intolerance have no place in the greatest democracy in the world. 
b1945 REMEMBERING DOUGLAS SELPH HENRY, JR. (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, Tennessee lost one of its most outstanding citizens, a person who loved Tennessee as deeply, if not more deeply, than anyone. Douglas Selph Henry, Jr., who served in the Tennessee State Senate in the Tennessee State House, served longer than any person ever did in the Tennessee General Assembly—44 years. Senator Douglas Henry served 24 of those years with me. He was a gentleman, a scholar, a man who said he was a State man, as distinguished from a Federal man, and he was a public man, going to more events in Nashville in his district and for his community than anybody ever has. There was not an event that Douglas Henry wasn’t there and helping to fund. He was a conservative Senator. We had differences on issues many times. But Senator Henry was a man who you could disagree with, and he was never disagreeable. He was truly a gentleman at all times and a credit to his State and a credit to politics and a credit to his family. He loved his wife, Lolly, who predeceased him, his five children, and his grandchildren. And though we differed on issues and he was prolife, he cared about children after they were born, passed the mandatory child seatbelt law, and supported all types of education endeavors and endeavors to support mothers and young children. He was just a gentleman’s gentleman. I was honored to spend time with him. It is a great loss to Tennessee. My thoughts go out to his family. 
REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to cover several very, very important points. Tomorrow is International Women’s Day, and I was going to talk about the role of women in our society, talk about my five daughters and what they have been doing in their life of service, and my wife, but events intervened. And yesterday, our good friends on the Republican side introduced a piece of legislation that will dramatically affect women, young and old; children. They introduced a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. We are still trying to figure out all of the details involved in it. It is going to be a little hard, since it was changed late in the night. But there are some things we do know. I would like to start off with what we do know about the Affordable Care Act so that when we come to debate on the floor in the days ahead the Republican repeal and replacement of the existing Affordable Care Act, we have a foundation. If you will indulge me, I will try to lay out some facts, not alternative facts, but facts. For example, 20 million Americans have gained coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act. The percentage of uninsured in America is the lowest it has ever been. Mr. Speaker, 6.1 million young adults between the age of 19 and 25 have gained insurance coverage by being able to stay on their parents’ insurance program—6.1 million. Of the Americans who have preexisting conditions, and that is 27 percent of us who have some sort of preexisting condition—heart issues, diabetes, broken legs, bad backs, whatever—27 percent of those Americans are guaranteed coverage even though they have a preexisting condition. I was insurance commissioner in California for 8 years, and I must tell you the battles—well, it would take several days to talk about the battles that I had with the insurance companies who were denying coverage because of preexisting conditions. No longer the case in America. The Affordable Care Act said no. And by the way, the lifetime limits, they are gone, also. California, which I have had the pleasure of being a citizen of, 3.7 million Californians are now insured under the MediCal program, and 1.4 million have gained coverage through the exchange, called Covered California. About 1.2 million of those have received subsidies, averaging over $300 a month. Over 5 million Californians will be directly affected by a direct repeal. And in the expansion of Medicaid, or MediCal as we call it in California, if that is eliminated, that is a $16 billion hit to the State of California, and, obviously, an enormous hit to those 3.7 million Californians who have been covered under the MediCal expansion. Secondary impacts: employment. Maybe 200,000 jobs would be lost in California. Individual stories: boy, they abound. Just this evening, I got a call from my wife, and she said: You really ought to talk about that young family in Woodland, California, whose 2yearold son was diagnosed with some sort of a medical illness. They were able to get coverage before that under the covered California program. They went back a year later, and the kid had a brain tumor. Fortunately, it was resolved because they had insurance. They were able to get the early diagnosis. And under the current law, the Affordable Care Act, they will be able to keep their coverage, even though previous to the Affordable Care Act, this young child and, quite probably, the family would be uninsurable. It is working. The Affordable Care Act is working. Are there ways to improve it? Undoubtably, there are, and we could sit down and talk about ways to improve it. But yesterday, our Republican colleagues introduced legislation that is going to have a profound negative impact on men and women all across this Nation. We will spend time in the days ahead to talk about the details, but we do know that, in general terms, there will be less coverage at a higher cost for literally everybody, except for a few special folks. And I would like to just put up a chart about that. Let’s start with this one. You see, in the repeal bill that was introduced, there are very serious tax cuts. We are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts over the next 2 years. Well, we all want a tax cut. But under the repeal, there are some very special people who are going to get a really big tax cut. Take a look at this. The top 20 percent of taxpayers will receive 74.2 percent of the multihundredbilliondollar tax cut, which is estimated to be somewhere in the range of $700 billion to maybe as much as $1 trillion, depending upon the final calculations. By the way, the Congressional Budget Office has not had time to score, that is to tell us what the cost, what the benefits are, of the Republican proposal. But we do know from earlier studies of this, 75 percent of the multihundredbilliondollar tax cuts go to the wealthy. Wow. And where does the money come from? It comes from the poor, it comes from the working families, the men and women who are struggling here in America. Maybe they are making a good living—$50,000 to $60,000 a year. They are going to see their benefit package reduced. One more way to look at this is the famous pie chart. So who gets the tax breaks? Not the top 20 percent. Let’s just focus more clearly here on the top onetenth of 1 percent. What do they get? They are not a percentage. This is not the top 1 percent. This is the top onetenth of a percent. What do they get? Well, they get nearly $200,000 a year in tax reductions. That is not bad. So the top 1 percent gets 57 percent of that 6, 7, $800billion tax cut, and everyone else will get 43 percent. So what we have here is a massive shift of wealth from the working men and women of America, from American families, to the very top—you know, the 1 percenters. That is who is getting the benefit in this massive tax cut that has been proposed. I don’t know if that is good policy. It is not in my district. I don’t think it is good policy for America. We spent a lot of this last year in the Presidential campaign talking about the shift of wealth to the superwealthy and away from the great majority of Americans. But, here we go. In the very first big legislation of this year, we see the Republicans in a massive effort to increase the wealth of the superwealthy at the expense of the rest of Americans. 
There are many, many more things to talk about here. But I want to just take a deep breath, which I need, because I guess I am getting rather excited about what is happening—or maybe angry is a better word—and turn to my colleague from the great State of Virginia to carry on while I take a deep breath and cool off a bit. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I don’t blame the gentleman. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the Affordable Care Act. As we discuss this, as he has indicated, it helps a little bit to talk about what the situation was before the Affordable Care Act passed. We knew that costs were going through the roof. We knew that those with preexisting conditions, if they could get insurance, would have to pay a lot more for that insurance. We knew that women were paying more for insurance than men. We knew that millions of people every year were losing insurance. That is what was going on before. People talk about small businesses. Well, small businesses had trouble getting insurance because if they had a person with a chronic illness, it would be unlikely that they could afford smallbusiness insurance. But now, the costs have continued to go up, but they have gone up at half the rate they were going up before. Those with preexisting conditions can now get insurance at the average rate. Women are no longer paying more than men. And 20 million more people have insurance, not millions of people losing insurance every year, 20 million more people have insurance. Now, the full name of the Affordable Care Act is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. There are certain protections, like insurance companies can’t cut you off after they have paid a certain amount. There are no more caps. They can’t rescind your policy. After you get sick, they can’t just decide not to renew your policy. There is no copay or deductible for prevention and cancer screening. We are closing the doughnut hole. The average senior has saved already about $1,000 because of the Affordable Care Act support for closing the doughnut hole. Those under age 26 can stay on their parents’ policies. Those are some of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act. Now, we didn’t solve all of the problems. There are still problems. But if we are going to change the Affordable Care Act, we ought to improve the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, the bill that was introduced in the middle of the night fails on a number of areas. Now, we would know precisely how bad a bill it is if they would wait a couple of days for the CBO to score the bill. It would point out all of the flaws. But there are just a couple. One is just a fundamental principle that it purports to cover preexisting conditions without a mandate for coverage. We know that if you allow people to wait until they get sick before they buy insurance, people will wait until they get sick before they buy insurance. The average insurance pool is sicker, more expensive. Healthy people drop out, and the thing spirals out of control. We don’t have to speculate how this works because we know. New York State tried it, and the cost went up so much that when the Affordable Care Act came in with a mandate, the cost for individual insurance dropped more than 50 percent. Washington State tried it. It got so bad that by the time it got going a couple of years, nobody could buy insurance. Nobody could buy insurance in the individual market. So we know what happens when you try to cover people with preexisting conditions without a mandate. b2000 So this plan, when it starts off with that policy, we know it is bound to fail. We also noticed another flaw: that it saves money by allowing people to purchase insurance that doesn’t cover everything. We have people buying insurance now that have to buy the basic essential benefits package. When you can start picking and choosing, you might save a little money, but things like maternity care, if that becomes an optional coverage, then anybody that wants that will not be able to afford it. It will cost whatever it costs to have a baby. They just have to pay the bill. They might as well not have insurance. So that is because, if anybody purchases maternity insurance, it is because they expect to have a baby in the coming year, and it becomes unaffordable. If everybody pays the average, everybody pays everything, then everybody can afford the maternity coverage. So allowing people to pick and choose what they want, that might help a few, but those that need that coverage won’t be able to afford it. A final flaw, as the gentleman pointed out, is massive tax cuts. Well, when you reduce the revenue available, two things happen: there is less support for Medicaid, and there is less support for people in paying their premiums. So in the fullness of time, fewer people will be insured; and so you have a plan with fewer people insured, watereddown benefits, and a plan that is ultimately going to fail. That is not an improvement. If we are going to deal with the Affordable Care Act, we ought to have an improvement; and until we have an actual improvement, we ought to leave the Affordable Care Act alone. I am delighted to be here discussing the Affordable Care Act with the gentleman, warning people that, if they go forward without a Congressional Budget Office evaluation so they know what is going on, we may have a plan that is a lot worse than even before the Affordable Care Act. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. SCOTT, thank you so very much. You bring to this discussion a very important perspective as the ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee. You have that perspective of understanding the effect of this legislation on the working men and women and families of the United States. I was just looking at some of the early comments that have come out about the bill, which is less than—well, it is almost 24 hours old now. Families USA said: ‘‘The GOP healthcare proposal would be laughable if its consequences weren’t so devastating. This bill will strip coverage for millions of people and drive up consumer costs.’’ The Catholic Health Association of the United States said: ‘‘This proposal would also take many backward steps in the continual effort to improve our healthcare system. . . .’’ It goes on and on, and as more and more people come to understand the issues that the gentleman was discussing, I think they are going to find that, no, we will take the Affordable Care Act as it presently exists, and we will make some modifications to it to improve it. The gentleman raised a very interesting point. It reminds me of another conversation I had earlier this week with my wife. She had gone to her hairstylist, who is about 29 years old, has run her own business for the last 7, 8 years, and she told me wife: It can’t be true. They can’t do it, can they? They can’t kill the Affordable Care Act, the ObamaCare? She said: For the first time in my life, I was able to get insurance; and now that I have insurance, there is this maternity benefit that is in my package, and now my husband and I, we can afford to have a child. It was directly to the point the gentleman was making. If there is an option here on maternity coverage or any coverage for women’s health, then we are going to find a situation where people will pick and choose; they will wait to get their insurance, and then the insurance pool is left with very expensive cases and the cost is not spread out. The gentleman may have some other examples that may have come along or some other comments that he would like to make. I would be delighted to have the gentleman share those on the floor, and I will yield to the gentleman. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Shortly after the Affordable Care Act passed and went into effect, a young lady approached me in a store—she was a clerk in a store—and said: Bobby, don’t let them repeal ObamaCare because my son is alive today because of ObamaCare. I said: Well, what do you mean? She said: Late last year, he was diagnosed with a fatal disease for which there is a cure, but we couldn’t afford the cure. Thankfully, he lived to January 1, when ObamaCare kicked in, and we can afford the cure. My son is alive today because of the Affordable Care Act. If it is repealed, what happens in that case? What happens in all of the other 
cases when people don’t have insurance? We have heard it represented that, well, anybody can get health care. All they have got to do is show up at the emergency room. Well, yeah, that is fine. You can show up at the emergency room with a stroke, but you can’t get blood pressure pills that could have avoided the stroke to begin with. They can stabilize you and send you home, but in terms of a cure or a surgery that may cure the problem, you don’t get that. You just get stabilized in the emergency room, and that is not health care. We need people with insurance so they can obtain the preventive care and the corrective care that will get them off on the right track. The gentleman talked about stripping coverage. When you take that kind of money out of the system, less support for Medicaid, fewer people getting Medicaid, less support for premium support so that people can actually afford it—if you look at the proposal, a lot of people can’t use the tax cut because it is insufficient to pay the premium and they don’t have the rest of the money. So we need to make sure that CBO scores this. They will highlight all of these problems. They will show that many fewer people will be insured and that it is not an improvement. We shouldn’t do anything unless we are actually improving the Affordable Care Act. Mr. GARAMENDI. The gentleman is correct on that. I was just looking at some statistics here a moment ago about the shifting of cost. Under the Affordable Care Act, there are many, many benefits for Medicare. Leaving aside the Medicaid population for a moment, the Medicare population, available to every individual 65 and older, there have been significant improvements. You mentioned the doughnut hole earlier, the drug benefit. If you run up heavy expenditures on your drugs, you would come to a point where you had to pay 100 percent. Medicare didn’t cover it. Well, that doughnut hole is collapsing, and in another 2 years, the Medicare program will cover all of the drug costs without limitation. Also, there is the free annual checkup that is available to everybody that is on Medicare. The result of these kinds of things, where drugs are available, blood pressure drugs, diabetes and the like, has led to—together with the additional taxes that the superwealthy are paying—has increased the solvency of Medicare by 11 years. Now, the fiddling that is going on with the proposal that our Republicans have put through, it is not clear exactly what the result would be; but we do know that one of the major tax cuts is the elimination of this Medicare tax that the superwealthy have been paying, and that is over—together with one other tax is almost $340 billion. So the support for Medicare and the solvency of Medicare becomes a question mark as a result of the proposals. We don’t have all of the answers to this, but we do know that a 60yearold presently getting an insurance policy from the Affordable Care Act, from ObamaCare, and making somewhere around $40,000 a year—perhaps working at Walmart—they are going to see a 57 percent reduction in the tax credit that is currently available versus what the Republican bill has. So a 60yearold making $40,000 a year under the ACA, ObamaCare, will receive somewhere around a $9,000 tax credit to support the purchase of insurance. Under the Republican bill, they are looking at $4,000—not $9,000, but $4,000—so 57 percent reduction in the support that they receive, probably leading to them not being able to afford insurance and winding up in your emergency room example. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. To add insult to injury, part of the scheme is to allow insurance companies to charge senior citizens even more. Right now they are limited to three times what they charge everybody else. Their bill allows up to five times. That is a two thirds increase in the cost. So if the tax credit wasn’t enough to begin with, it is going to get worse. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, let me make sure I understand. I was 60 a while ago, but let’s say I am 60 and I am getting a health insurance policy under ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. I may have to pay three times what a 25 yearold pays, but under the proposal that has been brought to us by the Republicans, I would pay five times? Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. That is right. When everybody pays an average, if you allow some people to pay more, some people are going to pay less, but it is a zerosum game. Every time they show somebody can pay less, then know that somebody will pay more. They have a scheme, for example—they call it association plans—where you get a group of healthy people, they come from out of the insurance pool and get a better rate because the insurance company will look at the association and say: Those are the young, healthy people, I can give them a better rate. They can save money. What happens to everybody else? They have to pay more. Last time they came up with this idea, the research showed that 80 percent of the people will pay higher premiums if you allowed people to withdraw from the pool, a healthy group. Now, actually, it will always work, because the group you pull out, if the bids come in higher than average, nobody is going to buy the insurance. They are going to go right back into the regular pool. So any time you have one of these things, it will only work if you are pulling out young, healthy people, and that leaves behind, for everybody else, higher rates. Mr. GARAMENDI. The fundamental nature of insurance is you gather a large population of healthy, notso healthy, and perhaps some very sick people into a large population, and the cost is spread across the entire population. What we may be ceding here in this particular proposal is the unravelling of that fundamental insurance concept with young people, healthy, not bothering to buy insurance, staying out of the market; and then, eventually, when they become ill, they will get back into the market, leaving everybody else to pay for it. There is another piece of this shifting of cost that did occur prior to the Affordable Care Act—significantly reduced, as a result of it—and that is the uninsured still get sick. The gentleman mentioned the emergency room a while ago, and for the most part, in America, a person can get to an emergency room with or without insurance; but if they don’t have insurance, there is still a cost associated with the visit to the emergency room and any other thing they may need. They may need to have their leg repaired, a broken leg, or maybe they need an appendectomy or whatever. That is still a cost. The question is: Who picks up that cost? That is called uncompensated care, and it was a huge problem prior to the Affordable Care Act. I had hospitals throughout my district and throughout California coming to me and saying: We can’t afford this because we are not able to cover that uncompensated care for people that didn’t have insurance that showed up at the emergency room. Now, we know that from the early analysis done of the proposed legislation by our Republican friends that the number of uninsured is likely to increase, perhaps as much as 11 million people—maybe more, maybe somewhat less. Those people will still get sick. They may have money of their own to cover their costs, but the chances are they don’t. That uncompensated cost will then be borne by the people who do buy insurance. It is a cost shift to those who have insurance. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. In fact, when we passed the Affordable Care Act, the estimated cost on a family policy was about $1,000 a year on the family policy for uncompensated costs shifted on to the insured public. In fact, in Virginia, it is estimated that approximately $15 a month is paid on everybody with insurance, $15 a month to go to the 400,000 people that would have had insurance if we had expanded Medicaid. So if you have 100 employees, you can just figure you are paying about $1,500 a month extra because we did not expand Medicaid. 400,000 people will go to the hospital, won’t pay, and when people with insurance go, they just have to pay a little extra, about $15 a month per person in the Commonwealth of Virginia because of that. Mr. GARAMENDI. There are so many pieces to this healthcare system. One thing that I want to put on the table here from my experience as insurance commissioner in California is that there are two fundamental parts 
to the healthcare system in the United States, and really around the world. One of those two parts is how we collect the money and then pay for the services. We call that insurance. It is also Medicare, Medicaid, veterans’ programs, and the like. These are the way in which we collect money and pay for the services. b2015 The other part of the healthcare system is the delivery of services; these are the doctors, the clinics, the hospitals, and other providers, mental health providers, and the like. We often get confused by putting these two things together. There has been a lot of talk about what we are doing with the Affordable Care Act. It is essentially a mechanism to pay for services. It is an insurance mechanism. Using the private insurance system, these various exchanges are set up to pool the population of people who do not have insurance from their employer, the individual people, individual coverage. It pools them so that you have that large population so that the cost is spread out across that large pool and the insurance becomes affordable. That is an insurance mechanism. That is a pooling. It has nothing to do directly with the provision of medical services. The medical services are then provided out of that pooling arrangement by the individual doctors, maybe clinics, maybe hospitals, maybe group practices. Some of that will be capitated pay, and others will be a fee forservice. We haven’t changed directly the way in which services are provided, that is, the delivery of services. And this is found in hospitals. In the Affordable Care Act, there was a penalty for hospitals that had readmissions for infections. What we have seen, as a result of that provision dealing directly with the way in which services are delivered in hospitals, is a dramatic decline in readmissions for hospitalacquired infections. What that means is some 60,000 people are still alive today because they didn’t get a hospitalacquired infection. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, well, that part of the Affordable Care Act has actually improved the quality of service. There are other things in the Affordable Care Act, such as funding for education of more providers, more doctors and nurses, and other providers because we have a lack of professionals. One area, for example, is psychiatry. If the Veterans Administration hired all the psychiatrists they need, there wouldn’t be any for anybody else. We are so far behind. And the Affordable Care Act provides for that service. As you pointed out, there is a difference between the ability to pay for the services and the services that are there. People frequently compare the singlepayer plan in Canada, which in many areas is a rural area. So you don’t have the critical mass of population to support a hightech medical system. So if you are going to have a baby, it is probably going to be delivered by a family doctor, not an obstetrician. In some areas, you have to go 200 miles to find a neurosurgeon. That doesn’t have anything to do with the fact that they can pay for the services. It is just that the services aren’t there. So when people talk about the health delivery system, as you pointed out, that is different. The fact that you can actually pay for services doesn’t diminish the opportunity to have those services there; it actually increases the possibility that those services will be there. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, that is exactly right, and I see that in my district. I have a large rural district in California. And, even today, there are areas where it is difficult to find a physician to get medical services. This is one of the things, as you so correctly pointed out, the Affordable Care Act had a part of that. One of the titles dealt with the education of medical personnel. And so what we have seen, at least in California—and I suspect across America—with the Affordable Care Act in place, we are seeing that one of the fastest growing areas for new jobs is the healthcare sector because we are adding a lot of people— we need more—and then the educational programs that you talked about, which comes under the jurisdiction, I believe, of your committee. That is an important part. One of the things that I hope the American public comes to understand is this is not just a sound bite that was used in a political campaign. We are going to repeal the ObamaCare and we are going to replace it is a nice sound bite. But we are talking about the lives of Americans, we are talking about their health, their ability to stay healthy, their ability to get medical services. When you start tinkering with something that is so personal—that is what people say in my district: This is about my ability to stay healthy, my ability to get medical care. That is what I hear. They are saying they are frightened. They are concerned that the legislation and all of the discussion in the political campaigns has been so heated that they are afraid they are going to lose what they presently have. A quick look at what has been presented to Congress just in the last 24 hours indicates that a couple of facts are clear. First of all, there is an enormous tax break for the very, very wealthy, probably to the tune of 3 to $400 billion over 10 years. That is an incredible tax break for the superwealthy and for the health insurance industry. That, we are pretty sure, is in this legislation. We don’t know the exact numbers; but we do know that early indications are that there is a shift, tax breaks for the wealthy, and cost increases for everybody else. That we know. We also know that there are certain elements of support for individuals that will be removed. As we go about debating this and understanding the full import and get the Congressional Budget Office information, I think we are going to find that Americans are going to say: Well, wait. Wait, wait, wait. You are doing what to me? What are you doing to me? You are taking away my health insurance? I suspect that will lead to a rebellion of some sort. Certainly it has agitated a lot of people in my communities about the justifiable fear of what may be coming to Americans. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman indicated, in rural areas, one of the things that we have done is funded community health centers, which provides, where there are no professionals, a community health center where you can actually go to get comprehensive primary health care and then referred to a specialist somewhere if that is needed. That funding would be obviously in jeopardy. As you pointed out, when you have tax cuts in terms of resources, that will translate into fewer people actually insured. They will have watered down benefits. And because there is no mandate to ensure that everybody is in the pool and they are trying to cover preexisting conditions, you have a prescription for disaster. That is not an improvement of the Affordable Care Act. We need to insist that CBO score the legislation before we start taking votes so that people know exactly what they are getting into. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Virginia is absolutely correct about that. Unfortunately, my understanding is that as early as tomorrow—that would be Wednesday— that the committees intend to mark up the legislation. Normally, that means the version of the legislation that will pass out of committee is completed. And, I suspect, usually it is associated with a vote that takes place in committee. We don’t know for sure if it is tomorrow or the next day, but we do know that if it is this week, we will not have the Congressional Budget Office information. The gentleman mentioned something that I probably should have jumped on immediately because of my rural district, and those are the clinics. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, there are now seven significant clinic organizations that provide services to about 23 specific sites around my district. They are providing, really for the first time in many of the communities that I represent, immediately available healthcare services to a variety of people, some of whom have had an employersponsored health plan and others of whom are on MediCal in California. 
The apparent reduction in the Medicaid, MediCal for California, support from the Federal Government that will occur over the next 2
1⁄2to 3 years will eliminate one of the principal ways in which those clinics have been able to continue to operate and, that is, the expansion of the Medicaid population in California. It appears that the legislation that is proposed will shrink the Medicaid program across the Nation and severely curtail in California the support available for people who are currently on MediCal. That will be devastating to these clinics in these rural areas. We have had discussions about this. They say: Watch carefully. If this is what happens, we are going to be out of business. We are going to shut down our doors. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the clinics will shut down. Insurance companies will stop writing insurance if people can wait until they get sick before they buy insurance. The insurance companies reacted to that system in Washington State by selling nobody any insurance. So we know what is going to happen. The CBO, when they score this, will point that out, and we will know exactly what the problems are. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) for joining us this evening. This is a fundamental part of American life, that is, our health care. It is about 18 percent of the total GDP, gross domestic product. It is extremely important in terms of the total wellbeing of our society and our economy. Changes to the Affordable Care Act that are being proposed will have a dramatic effect. And what we do know about it is that there will be a massive shift of wealth from working men, women, and families to the superwealthy. We know that from the tax proposals that have been made in the analysis of the tax. We also know that there is a very, very high probability that perhaps 11 million people will lose their insurance coverage, either in the private insurance market through the exchanges or through the Medicaid programs across the Nation. And the effect on the providers, the hospitals, the clinics will be profound. So when we have something as important as this, it is just wrong. It is wrong for the majority in this House to put this legislation before the committees without a full hearing on what the effect will be. But it appears that tomorrow, Wednesday, we will have the first markup in this process. What I want—and I think the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) does, too—is for the American public to hear the debate, to understand the implications where we are today with the Affordable Care Act and what it has brought to us in terms of quality and accessibility to health care and what it would mean with the proposed changes. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for organizing the Special Order so that we could actually discuss some of the problems with going forward without a CBO score, without knowing what we are doing. Certainly, it is not an improvement in the Affordable Care Act. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) for expressing Virginia’s view. From California, it is, whoa, wait a minute, let’s be careful. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
TOPICS OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the privilege to address you here on the floor of the House of Representatives, and I have a number of topics I would like to bring up this evening. First, I would comment that I heard the words ‘‘Affordable Care Act’’ multiple times in the previous hour, and it just caught me each time I heard that. Abraham Lincoln would have had a difficult time saying such a thing being Honest Abe, and George Washington probably couldn’t have said it at all. As we know this, it is not affordable care and that is the reason that we have to address it. We knew this was going to happen. Of all the horrible stories we have heard about ObamaCare— this thing they call the Affordable Care Act—many of them were predicted here on the floor of the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker. I predicted quite a lot of them myself, as did many of the Members who fought against that piece of legislation that was jammed down on us by hook, by crook, by legislative shenanigans. We could see what was going to happen with this. It was slammed together by trying to circumvent the majorities, by pushing some things through on reconciliation. And we ended up with a piece of legislation that was the biggest bite they could get to create socialized medicine. The worst part of ObamaCare, Mr. Speaker, was this: That it is an unconstitutional taking of Godgiven, American liberty. We are—and at least used to be and believe we are to be again— the freest people on the planet; and that our rights come from God; and that government can’t take them away. Many times here on the floor, I have said, Mr. Speaker, that the Federal Government hasn’t figured out how to nationalize or take over our soul. That is our business, and we manage that. Our souls are the most sovereign thing that we have and are. The second most sovereign thing we have and are is our skin and everything inside it. It is our health. It is the management of our health. And if Americans are not capable of managing their own health and making their own health decisions and pressing the marketplace to produce the health insurance policies that they desire, if Americans can’t make those decisions, then it would just stand to reason, if that is true—and that is what Democrats seem to think—then there aren’t any people on the planet who can manage their own health. What I am pretty sure of is that if we don’t think that regular, redblooded Americans—especially those who are out there punching the time clock, running their business, starting a business, or working on commission, whatever they might be doing, the saltof theEarth Americans—if they can’t manage it, I am really sure that a bunch of leftists who are elected to office out of the inner cities of America aren’t going to be able to do it. b2030 And we have seen the success of that, the leftist agenda of ObamaCare, imposed upon America, commanding that we buy policies that are approved by the Federal Government. They would have liked to have established the Federal Government as being the single payer plan and abolished all insurance whatsoever and simply taken care of everybody’s healthcare needs so that one size fits all, and we could drift down into the mediocrity that most the rest of the world has exhibited for a long time. This all started back in Germany in the latter part of the 19th century, when Otto von Bismarck decided that if he was going to get reelected, he had to make the Germans dependent upon him. And so he devised this plan called socialized medicine and he, more or less, trained the Germans to expect the federal government to make those decisions for them, pick up the costs for them; and, in doing so, that sense of dependency got Bismarck reelected in Germany. Well, it is not that old a country in Germany, but this idea of Marxism comes right out of there. By the way, there is a bench in Berlin that honors Karl Marx, and a number of other statutes and monuments as well. That is where this came from, and we watched as other countries adopted it. I once picked up—Mr. Speaker, I had a World War II veteran who came over to an event that I was doing in Hospers, Iowa, and he had gone up to his attic and he brought down these Collier’s magazines. They were original Collier’s magazines that started right at the end of the Second World War and went on through those years, for 2 or 3 or 4 years, and they were yellow and, of course, they were dated, and he presented them all to me. He said: I want you to have these. I want you to read down through these 
magazines and see what it was like in those days shortly at the end of World War II and in the Reconstruction era afterwards. So I actually accepted all of those magazines, copied them, and gave him back the originals. I didn’t feel right having them in my possession. But I read through them; and there were pictures there of doctors and nurses and healthcare providers in Great Britain that were haggard and tired and worn, and stories about how, because of the socialized medicine they passed in the United Kingdom, they had to see so many patients a day in order to make a living, and they couldn’t pay attention to the patients so much as they had to pay attention to their schedule and turn them through quickly through the turnstiles in the healthcare system in Great Britain because health care was rationed in that way. I have a friend who is a radio talk show host—and, actually, it is WHO Radio, one of Ronald Reagan’s original radio programs where Ronald Reagan got his start—who comes originally from Great Britain; proud American. But both of his parents are gone, and both of his parents deaths can be attributed to the failed national healthcare system, socialized medicine that the United Kingdom has. He had told me several years ago: Once socialized medicine is established, you will not be able to undo it. So, Mr. Speaker, I bring this up this way because this is our last best chance to turn this country in the right direction. It is our last best chance to throw off this mandate of socialized medicine that was established by hook, crook, and legislative shenanigan by the Democrats, and passed through in the final component in this Congress March 23, 2010. That event that took place, as I recall, I believe it was dated March 23, but it actually rolled over past midnight, but the RECORD showed March 23. I went home that night worn out from days of fighting ObamaCare and doing all that I could do to put an end to it, to kill it off before it did what it has already done to the American people. And I laid down, thinking I would sleep the sleep of the dead, but I woke up in about an hour and a half and I got up and I wrote the repeal of ObamaCare, and it turned out to be the first repeal draft that emerged after ObamaCare had passed. I certainly wrote it well before Barack Obama had signed the bill, although they hustled it out to him, I think, the next day, and that is when he signed it. The repeal bill that I have introduced here—and it has passed the floor of this House a number of times; I have lost track of how many times, Mr. Speaker—it is only 40 words. And the last words in that bill are: ‘‘As if such act had never been enacted.’’ That is, Mr. Speaker, what we need to do. We need to send the full, 100 percent, ripitoutbytherootsasifit hadneverbeenenacted repeal out of the House and over to the Senate and set it on MITCH MCCONNELL ’s desk and let MITCH MCCONNELL figure out—Majority Leader MCCONNELL , Senator MCCONNELL figure out then how to get the votes put together in the United States Senate for a full, 100 percent repeal of ObamaCare. The House will pass such a bill. It won’t be hard to put those votes together. I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a Democrat or two that was worried about their seat that would join us in such an endeavor. Then, once that bill is over through the Rotunda and over on the desk of Senator MCCONNELL , then we should start down through with the individual repairs to the healthcare system that we need to do, that we all know we need to do and that we have talked about for a long time. Some of these have been out here debated for 10 years in this Congress, Mr. Speaker, and, instead, we have got a different configuration that has been served up to us. But I submit that it is not too late to do it right. Send the full repeal over. That repeal can have an enactment clause of, say, a year from now. That is enough time for people to make their adjustments for their own health insurance and get it taken care of, especially under the provisions that I propose. I would point out that my ObamaCare—and, yes, we Members of Congress are obligated to own our own ObamaCare policies and pay a substantial portion of the premium. By the way, mine went up when ObamaCare was imposed upon me by not quite $4,300 a year additional. That was my privilege to own an ObamaCare policy, but we are compelled to own that policy. For me, I got the letter, dated last September 28, that said, as of December 31, at midnight, my ObamaCare policy was canceled. And it turned out that I would have been without insurance from New Years, from the stroke of midnight, auld lang syne, until whatever time it would take me to get that put together. So we went to work, and there was only one policy that actually qualified under ObamaCare, only one. Of all the counties in America, roughly a third of the counties there is only one choice available to the American people; compelled by law to buy a policy or be penalized by the Federal Government. And your options are not that you get to keep the policy that you like or that you get to keep the doctor that you like. You don’t even get to choose from a menu of what kind of health insurance policy you want. Instead, for a third of the counties in America, you only have one choice, and that is buy the policy that is the only option that is available to you. So there is no shopping for prices. There is no looking at the kind of options you might want covered by your health insurance policy. There is no freedom to go out there in the marketplace, and there is no marketplace that actually exists because the consumers are not making the demands for the kind of policies that they would like. Instead, it is the Federal Government dictating by mandate what the policy shall cover. And when that happens, the premiums go up—which anybody could figure out— and the coverage goes down. Now we have people that—I would just look back to shortly before the election. The Thursday before the election we had an event south of Des Moines on a farm, and there, soontobe Vice Presidentelect M IKEPENCE arrived, as did Senator TEDCRUZ, back to Iowa. I’m grateful to both of those gentlemen and friends. As I gave my speech, I pointed out that I have seen people’s health insurance premiums go from $8,000 a year to $10,000 a year. And then as I saw people in the crowd started waving their arm, and I say $12,000 a year, $14,000 a year, we had an auction going on, Mr. Speaker, and it came up to $20,000 a year. Looked to me like these were ‘‘Ma and Pa’’ family farm operations that were facing $20,000 in health insurance premiums, where not that long ago they would have been looking at 6 or 7 or $8,000 in health insurance premiums. That has swept across this countryside. I talked to a gentleman here on the floor tonight whose health insurance premiums were $24,000. That is just not sustainable. You have to finally decide: I am going to take a risk and go without health insurance with those kind of costs. That is driven by ObamaCare. It is driven by the mandates in ObamaCare. It is driven by the guaranteed issue, no consideration for preexisting conditions, and it is driven by a mandate such as you stay on your parents’ health insurance until you are 26. It goes on and on and on. OB care, maternity coverage, contraceptive coverage, you can name it, and also, no additional cost for your medical checkups. All of these things cost money, and they are built into the premium, and every time you add another bell or whistle or accessory to your health insurance policy, the premium goes up and up and up. When the insurers find out that they are losing money, they start to drop out of the marketplace. They drop out of the marketplace, and when they do, there is less competition. When there is less competition, prices go up, Mr. Speaker. This is what we have seen happen over the years since the implementation of ObamaCare. It is a calamity. It will sink ObamaCare. If we don’t touch it, it will sink and it will be gone. It will implode upon itself. It cannot be sustained. We know that on this side of the aisle from about here on over. They know it intuitively over on this side of the aisle from about there on over. But 
the difficulty is that politically they have embraced ObamaCare and they have decided they are going to hold onto it and protect it. Why? I think part of it is they want to hold on and protect the legacy of President Obama, who, if all had gone well, would have ridden off into the sunset. He doesn’t seem to be doing that, Mr. Speaker. But now we are at this place where we have the votes in the House to do a full, 100 percent repeal of ObamaCare, and that is what we should do. Tomorrow, I understand that the gentleman from Ohio, and perhaps others, will introduce legislation that will be described as a full repeal of ObamaCare. I wish it were so, but it is designed to fit within the reconciliation standards. It is a legislation that once made it to President Obama’s desk and received a veto. This time, presumably, it could go to President Trump’s desk and receive a signature. That is good. I favor that as an improvement in the right direction. But the full right thing we need to do is the 100 percent repeal. We shouldn’t be sustaining any kind of mandate whatsoever. Let the States determine what the mandates might be, but don’t let them lock people into their States and refuse to let them buy health insurance from outside of those State lines. And it looks to me that the bill, as introduced by leadership, doesn’t really allow for the facilitation of buying insurance across State lanes. So here is what I suggest we do, Mr. Speaker. Send the full, 100 percent repeal over to the Senate. Pick up the bill that was a repeal just about a year ago, send it over to the Senate, too. Then, what we have is MITCH MCCONNELL can choose from the menu on what he can get done, but the pressure for the full repeal will build if the House sends it to the Senate, and the odds of the full repeal get greater and greater. Then the House, doing its job—and we are not obligated to negotiate a deal out of the House and the Senate and the White House. It is the judgment of the House that needs to be reflected here in this Chamber. This most deliberative body that we have, the voice for the American people, we should never be trapped into thinking that we can’t pass anything out of the House if we don’t first have a handshake with the President and the majority in the Senate. That has handcuffed us for the last 8 or more years. The strategic thinking has been that we don’t even try to move anything out of the House unless we know they can take it up in the Senate and unless we know that we can get a signature from the President, because anything else is a waste of time. Well, it is not necessarily a waste of time, Mr. Speaker, not necessary at all. In fact, we need to send out of here our highest aspirations. So I say this: send the full repeal over to the Senate, and then pick up the repairs, the replacements, and the reform, those things that we know we need to do, and they can stand alone with or without the full repeal of ObamaCare. For example, we need to send PAUL GOSAR ’s bill that repeals components of the McCarranFerguson Act that allows for insurance to be bought and sold across State lines. PAUL GOSAR  has done a lot of work on that bill, and his predecessor out of Arizona, John Shadegg, pushed that bill for about 16 years here in the House of Representatives. In his last week or so here in the House, he said: I have one regret, and that regret is I should have pushed harder for the repeal of McCarranFerguson so that we could be selling and buying insurance across State lines. b2045 He should have pushed harder. I recall John Shadegg pushing very hard on that, and he just couldn’t get it there. We all couldn’t get it there. Now PAULGOSAR has that bill out of the Judiciary Committee. We passed it out a week and a half ago, and it is hanging on the calendar now, and it should come to this floor. The votes would be here to pass PAUL GOSAR ’s repeal of McCarranFerguson, and we should send that over to the Senate. Passing that piece of legislation would enable insurance to be sold across State lines, and that would set the competition up between the 50 States. I recall the debate here on the floor of the House in 2009 and 2010 when the data came out that a typical young man in New Jersey at the time, a healthy 23yearold, would pay an average of about $6,000 for his health insurance premium for the year—$500 a month, $6,000. A similarly situated healthy young man in Kentucky would be paying $1,000 a year. Now, what is the difference between those two States? The cost of providing that care and the far fewer mandates in the State of Kentucky and a lot of mandates in the State of New Jersey. So why wouldn’t we let a young man in New Jersey buy a health insurance policy in Kentucky? What are the odds that he is going to be insured if he can get a policy for $1,000 as opposed to $6,000? We know that far more Americans would be insured if they had the options and didn’t have to buy all the bells and whistles. He probably doesn’t need maternity. He probably doesn’t need contraceptive. Maybe he is not too concerned about the preexisting condition component of this. If he is 23 years old and on his own, he is not worried about a 26year slacker mandate. So that is the comparison of what could happen if we passed GOSAR ’s bill and repealed McCarranFerguson and allowed people to purchase insurance across State lines. That should be number one. Number two would be full deductibility of everyone’s health insurance premiums. Today there is something like 160 million Americans that get their health insurance from their employer. When the employer sets up a group plan as a rule and they negotiate those premiums, whatever that premium might be, let’s just say it is $10,000 a year per employee, they lay that $10,000 on the barrel head, pay that insurance premium, and that goes into the books as a business expense, and it shows up on the schedule C as a health insurance premium. But if you are a sole proprietor, if you are a partnership, if you are a ma andpa operation and you have one parttime employee, that makes you an employer. If you are an employer, you can deduct the premiums to your employees, but you can’t deduct your own premium. There are 20.9 million Americans similarly situated in that scenario, Mr. Speaker, where that 20.9 million Americans are compelled under ObamaCare to pay for health insurance premiums and meeting those standards, and maybe they have only got one choice like onethird of America’s counties; maybe they only have two choices like another third of America’s counties; or maybe they have more than two choices like the other third. But at least 1,022 counties in America have only choice: buy the insurance policy— that is your only choice—or be in violation of the law and be fined and be punished, but do it with aftertax dollars instead of beforetax dollars. That is the burden that they are carrying right now. Mr. Speaker, 20.9 million Americans are disenfranchised in that way. Yet they would be employers and they would be in the effort of trying to provide health insurance for themselves, trying to start up a business perhaps with maybe one parttime employee, with now this big disadvantage that they don’t get to deduct their health insurance premiums. Maybe they are that couple that is $20,000 or even $24,000 for a premium aftertax dollars, and by the time the Federal Government steps in and taxes the first, say, 36 percent, and the State steps in and taxes another 9 percent, now we are at 45. You can add a few more various and sundry taxes in there, but a round number is half. So your $20,000 premium takes $40,000 of earnings in order to break even with that premium. But the employer gets to write off the $20,000 as a business expense, so they have that advantage, and you are seeking to compete with an established larger employer. This is wrong. So the second bill we should pass out of this House is the full deductibility of everybody’s health insurance premiums. The McCarranFerguson repeal under P AULGOSAR , then the full deductibility of everybody’s health insurance premiums—oh, that is the King bill, by the way, Mr. Speaker, and I am hopeful that that can be passed through and become law. It is a superior approach to providing refundable tax credits. 
We need to learn some things. For example, when we hear tax credits, it really means in this discussion refundable tax credits. What is a refundable tax credit? That is when the Federal Government sends you money whether you have a tax liability or not. So that would be that if—and the range in this proposal that emerged yesterday is between $2,000, $4,000, up to $14,000 in refundable tax credits to help people pay for their insurance premiums. Well, that makes me feel good, the idea of trying to help people that can’t afford it, but in the process of doing that, we are also helping a lot of people that can afford it. Nonetheless, when you are paying people’s health insurance premium, that becomes an entitlement. If everybody is entitled to having a health insurance policy, and if you don’t have the money to do so— and I think they use the standard of $75,000 or less—then the Federal Government will subsidize your policy and conceivably buy your policy. Now we have another new entitlement that grows the Federal Government, raises taxes, and spends hundreds of billions of dollars because we don’t want to say no to people. They had a policy handed to them by ObamaCare, which the taxpayers cannot afford. We have $20 trillion in national debt right now, Mr. Speaker, and we have a debt ceiling crisis coming at us within just a matter of days or, at a maximum, weeks. This Federal Government needs to get a handle on its spending and it needs to get back to balance. We will never get there if we keep growing entitlements here on the floor of the House of Representatives. So that is two items that need to be brought through. The first is the full repeal. Item number one, the repeal of the McCarranFerguson Act, sell insurance across State lines. Item number two, pass the King bill for full deductibility of everybody’s health insurance premiums so that everybody paying for health insurance is on the same standard as employers are. Then the third thing is the medical malpractice reform, and that is the tort reform legislation that passed out of the Judiciary Committee on the same day with PAULGOSAR ’s bill, Mr. Speaker. That legislation puts a cap on medical malpractice settlements of $250,000 in noneconomic damages—a lot of us would call that pain and suffering—and pay for pain and suffering. That is a component of it, but it is not the whole picture. So we adopt language that is actually borrowed from California which passed this medical malpractice reform 40 years ago and capped it at $250,000. By the way, that is still the law in California today. The individual that signed it into law, his name is—at that time he was the Governor of California, Mr. Speaker. Maybe people don’t remember who the Governor of California was 40 years ago: Jerry Brown. The Governor of California today: Jerry Brown. Is there an effort to repeal the tort reform legislation that has been part of California’s law for 40 years? No. In fact, Texas has borrowed from those ideas and implemented that into law, and they are finding that they have got doctors and medical practitioners moving to Texas now because they are not subjected to the outrageous medical malpractice claims that they have been in multiple States across the country. So this tort reform legislation that just passed out of the Judiciary Committee a week and a half or so ago is another prime piece of legislation that should come to the floor for debate and vote, and I am confident it would pass the House and send it over to the Senate, and then give MITCH MCCONNELL  some tools to work with. That is not the end of it, Mr. Speaker. I know that under the legislation that has been proposed by leadership and just rolled out yesterday, they expand health savings accounts. I think they nearly doubled them, as I understand, $6,000some for an individual, maybe $12,000some for a couple. That is close, but I know that it is not precise, Mr. Speaker. I agree that we need to expand health savings accounts. I think we need to expand them more. My legislation expands them to $10,000 for the individual; $20,000 for the couple. But health savings accounts need to be expanded, and they need to be expanded so that people can use them and manage them. They can put money in tax free, take money out to pay their premiums, take money out to pay their healthcare costs, and grow the health savings account so that when it grows to a point where it becomes $50,000, $100,000, $400,000, $500,000, double that by the time of retirement or more. With that kind of money sitting in a health savings account, then there will be people that will negotiate a health insurance policy, but as a catastrophic policy. They will conclude that they want a policy that has got a high deductible, a fairly high copayment, and that they will take care of their own incidental healthcare costs out of pocket and try to grow their health savings account. In the process of doing that, if you have got the capital in your HSA, then you can negotiate the premium or your monthly health insurance premium down by negotiating for a catastrophic plan, taking care of the incidental costs yourself out of your health savings account. To some degree, you become your own insured for the lower dollar items while you still have catastrophic insurance for the big things. We have done the numbers on this. Even when it was down to the cap in 2003 that rolled out of here that was capped, the HSAs were capped at $5,150 for a couple. We did the math on that. If a couple started out at, say, age 20, worked for 45 years, round numbers, worked out to be age 65, Medicare eligibility, then they would conceivably be sitting there with $950,000 in their health savings account. I have well over doubled this. In fact, take it up to $10,000, $20,000 for a couple where 5,150 was the opening bid in 2003. So we are not quite four times that amount, yet healthcare costs have gone up. So I am not proposing that we end up with $4 million in the account, but maybe some number that is 2.5 or so million. Arriving at Medicare eligibility with six—well, seven figures times some number in their health savings account leaves these couples in a position where they could go out on the open market and purchase a paidup Medicare replacement policy for life, pay for that up front, and then the Federal Government wants to tax anything that comes out of the health savings account as ordinary income. But my answer to that is no, don’t do that. If they will take themselves off the entitlement roll by buying a Medicare replacement policy, then let them keep the change taxfree. Now this becomes a life management account. Not only is it a health savings account, it is a pension plan, and it is incentive to manage your health insurance premiums and your healthcare costs to get your checkups, to get your tests, to watch your weight, get your exercise, and manage your life because you are going to have a nest egg at the end of your working life that you want to be able to spend doing enjoyable things. If your health is a bad experience, then you have got the money there to cover it to make sure that you are taken care of. This is where we need to get people in this country. We are just awfully short of people willing to think outside the box and to think about what we should do here in America. We are not just some regular, ordinary, humdrum, runofthemill country, Mr. Speaker. We are the United States of America. We are the unchallenged greatest nation in the world. We didn’t become this way because we are dependent upon government. We became this way because we have a robust appetite for freedom. People have gone out and blazed their own trails. In a lot of cases, settling this country, they literally did that, blazed a trail through the timber and went out and settled the West. When our original Founding Fathers arrived here on our shores, they arrived in a land that had, as far as they knew, unlimited natural resources. They had unlimited freedom because they were a long ways away from King George. They came for their religious freedom as well. They were farmers, they were shopkeepers, they were individual entrepreneurs with a dream, and they forged the American Dream. They did it on religious faith, on free enterprise capitalism, and on Godgiven liberty. That created this robust country in this giant petri dish that was the only huge experiment that the world has ever seen: a nation that is formed on ideas and ideals. 
Here we are, the descendants, the recipients, the beneficiaries of their risk and of their dream, beneficiaries of their ideals. All we have to do is preserve them. Our Founding Fathers had to hammer them out. b2100 They had to conceive of these ideas about Godgiven rights, and then they had to articulate it. They had to write these ideas over and over again in many different configurations so that the populace began to understand what it really meant when you have rights that come from God. Then they had to sell this to the colonists. And then they had to defy King George and fight for that freedom. All of that took place with the desks that were there and those who gave their lives for our freedom and our liberty. And what is our job, Mr. Speaker? Hang on to it, maintain it. Now, in this case, with ObamaCare, we have got to restore it. That is what we are faced with. In my view, it is not that hard, if we just come together here and do that which we know is right, send the full repeal of ObamaCare across the rotunda to the Senate, pass PAUL GOSAR ’s bill selling insurance across State lines, the repeal of McCarran Ferguson, make our health insurance premiums fully deductible, and expand our health savings accounts. Do those things and pass the tort reform legislation which will diminish the malpractice premiums that our doctors and practitioners are paying. If we do that much and eliminate the mandates that tie us down in such a way that we don’t have the latitude to work any longer, we don’t need a mandate that requires every insurance policy to keep your kids on until age 26. There are a lot of other ways to manage that. If you as a family want to buy such a policy, the insurance companies will provide it. You don’t need to have the law. The preexisting condition component of this, yes, we have compassion for people who are uninsurable. In fact, 37 of the States, by my recollection, had policies before ObamaCare, Iowa included—and I helped manage that as former chairman of the Iowa Senate State Government Committee—37 States, by my recollection, had established highrisk pools. These highrisk pools used tax dollars to buy the premium down so that those who had preexisting conditions and could not be insured could have their health insurance premiums subsidized by the taxpayers. Now, some States are more generous than others. That is how it will be. But it is a far better solution than the Federal Government being involved in preexisting conditions just because they think that is the right political answer, Mr. Speaker. We will see how this unfolds as the days and few short weeks come forward here. I am hopeful that we will be able to get together in conference and the Republicans can hammer out a solution that can be signed off on by, hopefully, all of us. I am hopeful there will be some Democrats that understand you don’t want to go back home again and tell your constituents that you fought to defend ObamaCare, this thing that my colleagues, scores of times—in fact, thousands of times here on the floor— called the Affordable Care Act. We know, Mr. Speaker, it is not affordable and that the premiums are way out of sight; the coverage can’t be used, in many cases, because the deductibles are too high for most people; and that the insurance companies are bailing out one after another. And perhaps a year from now, if we don’t do something, there will be great chunks of the American people who will have no options whatsoever. So I suggest we do this the prudent way: do the full repeal and send single components of the reform rifle shot out of the House over to the Senate. Let the Senate take them up. Or, if they think it is prudent, package them up and send them back to us as a package. If the House has once passed it, and it comes back to us in a package, I think we will pass it again, Mr. Speaker. So these are intense times, and America’s destiny is being determined. It is being determined because we have elected Donald Trump as President of the United States. I think about what it would have been like if I had woken up on the morning of November 9 and we had someone other than Donald Trump elected to be President, and how the optimism that just poured forth since that day has been terrific. You can recognize, right after the election, that people had a spring in their step, and they are more optimistic and more outgoing. If you would walk into the grocery store, people would come over and start a conversation. If you walked into a restaurant, they would do the same thing. They were just more outgoing and more friendly and they wanted to engage with each other. They still want to engage with each other. The stock market has soared up over 21,000, and there has been over $3 trillion in wealth created just in the stock market alone, Mr. Speaker. So this high level of optimism that we have brings with it a high level of responsibility. It is not only to the ObamaCare change, but the pledge that was made by Donald Trump many times throughout the campaign was a full, 100 percent repeal of ObamaCare. I always say 100 percent repeal will rip it out by the roots as if it had never been enacted. The language is a little different, but the meaning is identical. The meaning is identical, Mr. Speaker: a full repeal of ObamaCare. President Trump has said many times we need to be able to sell and buy insurance across State lines. That is another Trump promise. Of course, he has got people he is working with. TOMPRICE is head of HHS. He is a good man whom I first met here on the floor of the House of Representatives when he came in as a freshman a number of years ago. I watched as he paid attention to the healthcare issues then. And the constitutional issues, I might add. My first encounter with TOMPRICE was on constitutional issues, and it was a positive one. So we are at this place with a new President that has, halfway into his first 100 days, a number of campaign promises that he has yet to live up to, but a great many that he has lived up to. It looks to me like Donald Trump has at least somebody in an office somewhere in the White House that has a list of all the campaign promises, and they are checking those off one by one as he accomplishes the promises that he has made as a candidate. That is a laudable thing, Mr. Speaker. Yet, he is being bogged down by a series of stories that have, to some degree—I don’t want to quite say handcuffed his administration—but it has made it difficult to operate in a flexible and a fluid way. This has to do with, I think, it is leakers within; people who should be loyal to the United States and, hopefully, loyal to the President of the United States, who have been leaking information out. When The New York Times is publishing that they have got inside information that has been leaked to them from the intelligence community, nobody seems to be troubled that The New York Times is going to people in the intelligence community or receiving messages from them and taking information that is about classified activities of our Federal Government and printing the stories about that classified information in their paper. It is not only The New York Times. I see Heat Street here, The Guardian, The Washington Post. That all comes to mind. McClatchy. Here is a series of things that have taken place that bring into question the integrity of some people that work within government and some of them that work within our intelligence community. Here are just a string of events, Mr. Speaker, that bring us to a conclusion about what is going on in our Federal Government. It was in the summer that Heat Street reported that the FBI applied— in June it is reported—applied for a FISA warrant wiretap to survey people in the Trump campaign who had ties to Russia. Roughly late June, this report came out. FISA is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Special warrants have to be achieved in a FISA court. These warrant requests are classified. The activity around them are classified. So, if it is classified, how is it that Heat Street reported that the FBI applied for FISA warrants to wiretap people in the Trump campaign last June? Well, that is because classified leakage went into the ears of the Heat 
Street reporters, or I suppose we could say they made it up. And if it were the only story out there, that might be the most likely, but we have a number of other stories. The Guardian reported that a FISA warrant request was made to monitor four Trump campaign staffers for conflicts or for communications with Russia and Russians. That story in The Guardian matches up with the story in Heat Street roughly last June that there was a FISA warrant request to monitor four of Trump’s campaign staffers for their communications with Russia. So there is story number one and two. Heat Street writes one; The Guardian writes another. Both of them are writing about what, if we had the real information in front of us, would be classified: the application for FISA and the results of that. The report comes back and says those applications were denied. They were not based upon a reasonable suspicion that there was, I will say, collusion with Russians. So here is item number three. McClatchy reported that the FBI and five other agencies were investigating Russian influence on the U.S. Presidential election. So we have two stories—one from Heat Street, one from The Guardian—that says that there was an application for a FISA warrant. That FISA warrant was presumably turned down, by reports, but then there is a report that there is the FBI and five other agencies that are investigating the Russian influence on the U.S. Presidential election. That is a McClatchy report. Now, this is starting to add up. I am starting to see here is a sign there is something going on and there is a leakage of classified information—a sign something is going on and leakage of classified information. Then, the report of the investigation of the FBI and five other agencies. Now, here is the next story. The New York Times reports that the FBI is investigating Russian Government communications with Trump campaign, but there is no evidence of those communications resulting in any kind of collusion, at least. That is a New York Times report. So these stories have been dropped in: Heat Street, McClatchy, The New York Times. Here is another New York Times report. The Obama administration allowed the NSA to share globally intercepted personal communications with 16 other Federal agencies without a warrant. That, I believe, refers to a January directive that came from Barack Obama that opened up the ability to communicate between the intelligence agencies so that they could share classified information among them, rather than compartmentalize and share that information on a need toknow basis. That is item number five. Item number six, the Obama administration officials tried to spread information to media showing Russian involvement to help Trump and his election. That is a story that was pushed out and perpetuated. It was pushed out by, of course, the Hillary campaign and others. So the weight of this cumulative effect of these stories is adding up. I would add, also, that on October 31 of last year, just a little over a week before the election, Hillary Clinton sent out a tweet that said—I am trying to remember the words that she used— it was communication specialists or intelligence officials. It was a reference to experts in communications and computers and that they had identified that there were investigations going on and there were communications between the Russians and the Trump campaign. It looked to me like that was an effort on the part of the Clinton campaign to spread these rumors that had been planted all the way along throughout the summer by Heat Street’s report that there was a FISA wiretap warrant that was turned down, and by The Guardian’s report of presumably the same event of a FISA warrant turned down because they didn’t show that there was any activity there that was worthy of a warrant; the McClatchy report that said the FBI and other agencies are investigating Russian influence. Then you have got the two Times’ reports. Here is the third New York Times report. They reported that General Flynn talked to Russian officials about how Trump would handle Russian sanctions. This is presumably from a wiretap of the Russian Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Speaker. Now, if that surveillance is taking place of a Russian official, a Russian Ambassador in the United States, if those activities are typical surveillance activities that would go on in most any country that had the capability, then that information is still classified. And if the conversation took place between General Flynn and the Russian Ambassador—and we all, I think, believe that it did—that conversation and the contents of it would be classified. So how did this leakage come out to The New York Times about the phone call or calls that General Flynn may have had with the Russian Ambassador? b2115 The leakage of that information would be a Federal felony because it is classified information, facing 10 years in a Federal penitentiary as a penalty. Yet America is hyperventilating about a tweet that Donald Trump sent out that said that Trump and Trump Tower had been hacked or wiretapped by the Obama administration. I know he said President Obama. He put the responsibility on President Obama. It is pretty easy to conclude he may have also just meant the Obama administration. Do we think that this wiretapping is taking place? I think so. I think the evidence, at least, of the telephone conversation between General Flynn and the Russian Ambassador is pretty strong. Since it has not been denied by General Flynn or by Vice President PENCE , I am going to assert here in this CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD that that took place, that it was surveilled, and that the information in the exchange, which they claim there is a transcript of the conversation, was leaked out to the press. The press didn’t release the specific language that had been used but wrote the general narrative about it in much the same way that a Member of Congress might if they walked into a classified briefing, listen to the briefing, and come back and talk about their general understanding of what they saw in there rather than the specific language that was used and uttered. I submit, Mr. Speaker, that we have at least one Federal felony that has taken place, that it likely is because of leak or leaks that came from the intelligence community. It is pretty clear that President Obama granted the authority—I don’t know if I can quite say ordered—granted the authority that all of our intelligence community, all 17 of them, could exchange classified information freely, and that vastly multiplied the number of people who had access to this information and dramatically increased the odds that there would be leakage about these communications that appear to be surveillance of—perhaps it looks like the Trump team, at least people who were on the Trump team, the Trump campaign perhaps, and that there was an effort that goes back as far as last June. This team of the FBI and the five other intelligence organizations, agencies that are there, did they form that team in June? It looks likely. Did they get any real information due to lack of a FISA warrant from that point on? We don’t know, but we have got a pretty good idea that there was a FISA warrant that was approved in October and that information came out of that and maybe other sources that was leaked for the purpose of hurting this Presidency and hurting the effectiveness of thenPresidentelect Trump and now President Trump. I submit that President Trump should purge from the executive branch all of the political appointees for whom there is any question about their loyalty. Any of those whose loyalty is beholden to Barack Obama, any of those who can’t embrace a conservative government that is bringing us back to constitutional principles, they should all be gone. And those civil servants whose jobs are protected, there have been a good number of Obama people who have burrowed themselves into civil service jobs in order to handcuff President Trump. I say for them, when you can identify them, get a room somewhere, put them in it, pay them 
their wages. They will get tired of their job over time, but the damage they will do if you let them have a desk will be far greater than what we get out of them for the paycheck we are giving them. I say purge as many as possible, Mr. President. Put those people in place who are loyal to you, who want to carry out your agenda. Here is another news report. The Washington Post reports that U.S. investigators examined Jeff Sessions’ contacts with Russian officials while he was a campaign adviser to Trump. This report from The Washington Post says that U.S. investigators examined Jeff Sessions’ contacts with Russia. So he was under surveillance. He was at least under investigation, it sounds like, if this story is right. Here we have a seated United States Senator, a stellar individual. If I were going to try to compare the character that I know Jeff Sessions is, and I look around this town, I ask: Who matches the character of Jeff Sessions? Not many. I would say Vice President PENCE , and then the list gets pretty short after that. Jeff Sessions has a very high degree of character, and he is imminently a constitutionalist, an adherent to the rule of law, a dedicated patriot, and one who makes his decisions within the bounds of the Constitution, of the law, of the rules that exist. He is a great respecter of the order of a civilized society and a terrific Attorney General. There was no better choice that could have been reached by Donald Trump than Jeff Sessions. But here he is, subject to this kind of—at least a report that there is an investigation, Mr. Speaker. I think if I wanted to know about Jeff Sessions’ activities, if I thought that it was my business, I would just ask him. When he answered the question from Senator FRANKEN , the question was in the context of did you have any discussions with Russians with regard to any campaign activities that you might have cooperated or colluded with? If ALFRANKEN had asked that question precisely, then the answer would have been precise as well. I can understand why Jeff Sessions’ answer came back no, that he hadn’t dealt with the Russians. I do a lot of meetings, and if I am asked a question about the context of a subject matter, I will answer within the context of that subject matter. I think that is what Jeff Sessions did. Most of the Senators—I will say all of the Senators sitting there on that committee who heard those questions asked and saw the answers of Jeff Sessions, and then they and their staff and the public, weeks went by, not a peep about anybody being concerned about the answer that Jeff Sessions gave. Why? Because all of those Senators sitting on that committee listening to his testimony and the other Senators who were watching that testimony either from in the room or around the Hill on C–SPAN, and their staff who were monitoring those hearings all understood that you have people from multiple countries come into your office on an irregular basis, and in a matter of months one might meet with the Greeks, the Russians, the French, the Germans, pick your country in South America or Asia. There is a constant flow of people coming through my office, and I know there is a constant flow of people from other countries coming through the offices of probably every United States Senator. So when Jeff Sessions said that he hadn’t met with the Russians within the context of discussing the campaign, which was the heart of the question asked by Senator FRANKEN , no Senator was concerned about his answer that he hadn’t met with the Russians because they understood the context within which he was answering that question. Had that not been the case, some Senator, like CHUCK SCHUMER , would have woken up the first day instead of after they were able to gin it up and turn it into a media story, Mr. Speaker. We have a country to save. We have an ObamaCare to repeal. We have a healthcare policy in this country that needs to be rebuilt logically by preserving our doctorpatient relationship, encouraging competition between insurance companies, letting people be in charge of the policy they want to buy, providing full deductibility, fixing the lawsuit abuse, being able to sell insurance across State lines and expand health savings accounts. All that needs to happen. I am hopeful that it can happen within the next couple of months, Mr. Speaker. While that is going on, we need to look over at the White House and encourage this President: Purge those people from your midst who owe their loyalty to Barack Obama. They are undermining your Presidency. You have to fight the moles from within, the media from without, the George Soros organized protesters who are on the streets of America every weekend with a different cause. They will continue this until the public gets tired of it. Mr. Speaker, the President needs to understand that he has a lot of enemies in this country and a great big job. His ability to take on the mainstream media has been demonstrated. Now it is a little bigger hurdle that needs to happen, too. The intelligence community from within, there are a lot of good, dedicated patriots there. They need to purge those people from their midst as well who are not loyal to the United States of America and those who are working against the foreign policy agenda of this President. We need to rebuild America. We need to make America great again. We need to restore our economy. We need to get our tax cuts done. We need to get some more regulatory reform. Let’s have this robust, growing economy kicked off and see that 3, 3
1⁄2, 4 percent growth that this country can do with the freedom that has been delivered to it, much of it by the pen of our new President, Donald Trump. I am optimistic about our future, although we have our challenges in front of us, Mr. Speaker, and I urge that my colleagues step up to this task, keep it constitutional, keep it free market. Remember the individual freedom, the Godgiven liberty, and the legacy that we are leaving for succeeding generations. Let’s get this job done and make America great again. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f 
CONCERNS OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BACON ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 17 minutes. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, thank you for your courtesies. Mr. Speaker, there are a number of topics that I choose to debate this evening, but before I do that, I would like to first raise a very important concern. I will soon draft a letter that my colleagues will join in signing to the President of the United States on the extensive crisis of starvation in Somalia and South Sudan. Just recently, we met with leadership—with my colleague KAREN BASS and a number of other colleagues—of South Sudan speaking about the extensive starvation in subSaharan Africa. I am looking forward to a response from this White House upon receipt of the letter that they will engage with the world community on providing immediate food aid and other resources to the people of subSaharan Africa, particularly Somalia and South Sudan. It is something that I am well aware of because my colleague, the late Mickey Leland, Congressman from the 18th Congressional District in 1989, and years before that as the cochair of the Select Committee on Hunger, was very concerned about starvation in that very same area because of the drought and terrible climatic conditions, huge loss of life. Congressman Leland was constantly responding with his own personal sacrifice of taking food over to that area as well as seeking to encourage others in the world family, United Nations to do so. In 1989, he, in actuality, lost his life in a plane crash in Ethiopia delivering resources to those individuals caught in a terrible condition, a valley, a desertlike atmosphere attempting to save their lives or to bring grain in. I know full well that his spirit reigns as he might have been engaged in this if he were alive in 2017 to see this terrible disaster occurring right in front of us. We need the United States to be very active in the world community. The U.N. SecretaryGeneral has now pronounced this to be a horrific disaster needing the attention of world leaders and the world community. I want to 
put that on the record because I want to offer to the people of Somalia and South Sudan my deepest sympathy. There are other issues in South Sudan that we must address, but we also need to be concerned in the area of food starvation, loss of lives of hundreds of thousands of women and children who are now suffering, and it needs to be addressed. b2130 But I really came to the floor in the backdrop of the introduction of a document that is represented to be an answer to the need of Americans for health care. Certainly the document is one that is being proposed by those who believe that there is a need. I might offer to say that there may be a need to improve some aspects of existing coverage, which has worked so well under the Affordable Care Act. And, yes, to those opponents of the Affordable Care Act, I would be pleased to debate you that, in fact, it has worked well. It has worked well because 30 million Americans have insurance. It has worked well because 150 million Americans have guaranteed health benefits. It has worked well because lowincome Americans have access if they are able to come under the expanded Medicare to health care. It has worked well because of young people being on the insurance of their families to the age of 26. That was first on the Affordable Care Act. It has worked well because we can provide for the preexisting condition, for you to be able to have insurance. We can provide for no caps on your insurance, and also payments to hospitals for uncompensated care. We can provide for that because of the mandate and the tax subsidies that go to the people to allow them to secure the insurance that they would desire. There are certainly ways that we look to improve, and it would be nice if we had bipartisan cooperation to do that. But now we have a document that it is important for the American people to know that the question of how many people will lose coverage has not been answered. How many people will be covered has not been answered by this new document that pretends to respond to the healthcare needs of Americans. There is no documentation as to what the quality of the coverage will be. And to those listening who are concerned about the financial fiscal responsibility of this country and this Congress, no one knows the cost of this insurance. So I would make the argument that we have a real problem and that there is a document that is supposed to be marked up as a healthcare bill for which the Republicans have not received any response from CBO. Let me indicate that when Democrats were seeking to work with Republicans in 2009, we had a CBO estimate before our markup began. Certainly, a request was made by Republicans about the bill; and, interestingly enough, they asked about coverage, and they asked about quality and cost. We know that it is almost certain that Americans will lose coverage under this new document. We also know that jobs will be lost. We also know that in my State of Texas, very much is dependent or concerned, if you will, with rural hospitals, that rural hospitals will suffer greatly by the loss if it happens—and we hope not—of the Affordable Care Act, because rural hospitals and the rural communities throughout Texas will be devastated. We also know that, with the mandate going away, the tax subsidies will be going not to people where they should be so that you can provide for your insurance as we understand it—this document is still a mystery—but it will be going to insurance companies. And we also know that, if you are 50 and older, it will cost some five times more than if you are younger. A heavy burden on working Americans, with no explanation. We know that the cost is going up and that you may be paying an amount that continues to go up every month. Let me be very clear. We are trying to get the answers, but it makes for a very difficult process of getting the answers for a bill that has just been released in the last 24 hours, and, in actuality, no one knows really what is in it, and it will then go to committee to be marked up. In my State of Texas, almost 2 million—1,874,000—individuals in the State who have gained coverage since the Affordable Care Act was implemented would lose their coverage if the Affordable Care Act is entirely or partially repealed. Mr. Speaker, 1,092,650 individuals stand to lose their coverage if we dismantle the exchanges which allow people to access insurance companies all over the Nation. Mr. Speaker, 913,177 individuals in the State of Texas who received financial assistance to purchase health insurance in 2016 and received an average of $271 per person would risk having coverage become unaffordable because they would not get that money anymore. That money would go to insurance companies. Let me also say that 1,107,000 individuals in the State could have insurance if the State of Texas additionally would have accepted the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion. I can tell you that States like Kentucky understand the full impact of the Medicaid expansion, and they do not want to see it go away. Mr. Speaker, 508,000 children have regained coverage since the ACA has been implemented, and they will lose their insurance. Mr. Speaker, 205,000 young adults, as I have indicated, in the State would be able to stay on their parents’ insurance. We don’t know if that is clear because we really don’t know the funding structure of this new document that has now been thrown to the American people. We know that 646,415 individuals in the State who received cost share reductions to lower outofpocket costs, such as deductibles, copays, and coinsurance, are now simply at risk. We are all at risk. We are all, frankly, at risk. So I would have to ask the question: What does this plan really do to help America? We know that 10,278,005 individuals in the State of Texas who now have private health insurance that covers preventative services without copays, coinsurance, or deductibles may lose these benefits if the Affordable Care Act goes. Women in the State who can now purchase insurance for the same price as men, eliminating the disparities that occurred before 2009 and 2010, may be at risk again for having to pay more money for their insurance—the actual disparity in health care being totally eliminated—and insurance companies being able to charge women more than their male counterparts. Roughly, 4 million individuals in the State with preexisting diseases may, in fact, not have that because what is the basis of the financial structure that can pay to ensure that those with preexisting diseases in this new document called health care, whether there will be any money to cover those individuals with preexisting diseases, we don’t even know that. I think that is something important to note. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, because this is a mysterious bill, we know that it will mostly benefit the rich. Households at the top of the U.S. income ladder would see taxes on their wages and investments drop under this bill. No one has anything against our friends that are doing quite well, but it will be on the backs of working Americans. The Republican plan to replace ObamaCare includes a tax break for insurance company executives making over half a million dollars a year. What a great gift. We are about to approach Easter, a time of sacrifice, and Passover, and isn’t it interesting that what we would be facing is a gift in this tax season of a great tax break of our friends making over $500,000 a year. Meanwhile, working Americans would lose coverage and be forced to pay more for less. According to CNN, most healthcare experts agree that millions of Americans are likely to lose their coverage under this new document that is to reflect health care. Mothers: likely to make maternity coverage, among other services, immensely expensive, if available at all. In fact, I recall certainly as a young mother that one of the most frightening things is to not have insurance or the kind of complete coverage that one needs with expectancy of the birth of a child. Not knowing what may happen to the mother during birth, what challenges the new baby may face, and to face the uncertainty of not having full maternity coverage is devastating. Seniors, pregnant women, and children on Medicaid, under the Medicaid expansion, which has been adopted in 31 States and Washington, D.C., more 
than half of the 50 States would shut down at the end of 2019. So you would get a few more years, and then hardworking Americans would be thrown off into the street in 31 States, including Washington, D.C. Women, seniors, children, in particular pregnant women, would see their health care thrown to the wind, extinguished, burned up. The bill also proposes a major overhaul of Medicaid, a Federal State program covering more than 70 million lowincome and disabled Americans. I believe that the proposal is to block grant Medicaid dollars under the pretense of letting States be creative. I want Americans and my colleagues to understand what creativity means. Creativity simply means that they will do everything they can to shorten and cheapen the health benefits that you will get. And it will be made through deals, how little money can we spend, whether we can use the Medicaid block grant dollars for some other things, a wish list that we may want in the State that we come from, the 31 States, plus Washington, D.C. Instead of the current openended Federal entitlement, States would get capped payment block grants based on the number of Medicaid enrollees. Block grants, basically. And when it runs out, you are in a whole world of trouble. Or, as we say, you are up the river without a paddle—you are up the river without a paddle. No one comes to your rescue when you are up the river without a paddle. Seniors who have worked so hard who are on Medicare will have fiscal problems themselves. It will exacerbate the fiscal problems of Medicare by hastening the exhaustion of the program’s trust fund by 4 years. Our commitment is to ensure that the Medicare trust fund clearly is strong, solid, and solvent. Whenever I meet with my seniors, I tell them my commitment— strong, solid, and solvent. But with this document called health care, we are in jeopardy. So it is clearly a problem, and it certainly is not gathering support in unanimity on the other side. Mr. Speaker, someone is complaining about it. It happens to be Republicans, so it looks like it is going to be a rough road. But my concluding remark, Mr. Speaker, is that this document that represents itself as a healthcare answer has so many problems, so many people will suffer, so much loss, that I ask my colleagues to reject this legislation as it is presently constructed, and I look forward to working to better health care for all Americans. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
b2145 TOPICS OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) until 10 p.m. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I was handed a letter by a lady when I was at one of the many events that I attended in my district. It is how I stay in touch with what is going on. This lady says: ‘‘U.S. Congressman LOUIE GOHMERT : I am a 52yearold widow. ObamaCare is a major financial problem for me. Someone needs to fix the healthcare system. Onethird of the money I get from my deceased husband’s retirement fund is given to health care. My deductible alone is $7,000.’’ She has an exclamation point. ‘‘I am angry with the government deciding how I should spend what little money I have. I had to get a parttime job just to put gas in my car. So I clean tables and I mop floors. I am physically unable to work full time. I am frustrated with the fact I had to move back in with my parents just to make ends meet. Would you like that? Fulfilling. Could or would you do something to relieve this burden?’’ That is from a 52yearold widow in my district. That is what we have done with the burden, ObamaCare. We here in Congress decided: You know what? We are going to tell people like this widow how she has to spend what little money she has left. We are going to force this woman to go clean tables and mop floors when she is physically unable to work full time because we here in Washington have decided we know better than she does. So we have every right in Congress to force people like this dear widow to get on her hands and knees to work for the United States Congress. Pay your taxes and now, that is not enough. We are going to tell you that you are being forced to spend your money on health care that will never help you a dime because you have a $7,000 deductible. Or how about hearing, 2 weeks ago, from a friend, one of those who was cut because of financial troubles. They had 100 employees. They can’t afford the ObamaCare, so they have cut their 100 to 70, and they are continuing to work to get down to 49. Why? Because of ObamaCare. So we have already had 30 breadwinners, men and women, lose their jobs because of one thing: ObamaCare. And now there are going to be 21 more who lose their jobs because of one thing: ObamaCare. They have got to get it under 50 so they don’t have to keep paying such ridiculous prices for health insurance that has such high deductibles nobody will ever benefit. Who is benefiting? Well, it can’t be all of the health insurance companies because they have dropped out. They can’t make money. So it has to be the government that is making all the money from this ObamaCare program. A single mom told me she had been working at McDonald’s making ends meet, but because of ObamaCare, they cut her hours back. Now she has to work at both McDonald’s and Burger King, and she was in tears because it is just too much. And why is she having to do it? Because people right here in this House and the other body, without one Republican vote in this body, told America: Too bad. You are not working enough at McDonald’s. We want to make your life miserable. We are going to make you work at two places part time just like this widow that we condemned to start scrubbing tables and floors because the Democrats in this body, without a single Republican vote, decided we know better what you need to do with your time and your money than you do. So it is a problem of arrogance when Washington thinks it knows so much better than people across the country. And yes, I know, I represent the 26 percent that didn’t vote for me. I understand that. And I have heard from them, and I don’t need a townhall to know they are for keeping this albatross of a healthcare system. The ACA is not affordable, though. It is ridiculous to call it affordable care. One of the problems is, when you have to take precious healthcare dollars that used to go to providing care in a hospital, in a clinic, for a patient, now it goes to government navigators. Why? Because there were union officials that decided: We have lost too many union members. The unions that are growing are the government unions, the very ones that Franklin Roosevelt said you should never have a union composed of government workers. Think about it. You are working for the people of the United States of America. Why would you need a union to organize against the people? Sounds unAmerican. But those are the ones that are growing. And union leaders, without concern for their members, decided: Let’s embrace as many aliens as we can get into the country, legally or otherwise, because they will join the union and that will grow our ranks; and we as union leaders will be better off, but our members’ wages will continue to go down, our members will continue to lose jobs. But, gee, we may have more people in our union. We know that there was supposed to be thousands of new IRS agents hired so that they could help enforce ObamaCare. It is a travesty. The bill that has been filed is not going to do it, but, hopefully, our Republican leadership will be willing to work things out and not prevent good amendments that will make it palatable so enough of us can vote for it. I have gotten to know President Trump a bit, and I feel like he wants the best deal he can get for America. If this bill were the best he could get, he would probably have to live with that, but we can do a whole lot better. Some of us are determined we are not going to vote for one that doesn’t. In the meantime, there is so much talk by President Obama and all of his minions that are still out there trying to undermine the Trump administration. We have a crisis here in Congress 
that people are not talking about. I keep bringing it up. Doesn’t seem to be a lot of folks who want to talk about it. There was a time when we had mainstream media that actually did research, asked questions, dug to the bottom of things. But there are IT—information technology, mainly working with computers—employees, shared employees for several Democrats that are under investigation. Imran Awan was the company owner. Abid Awan, Jamal Awan, Hina Alvi—the wife of Imran Awan—and Natalia Sova, wife of Abid Awan, each made $160,000 a year as ITshared employees working on computers for various Democrats in the House of Representatives. The Awan brothers are of Pakistani descent, but their immigration status is unclear. There are a lot of things that are unknown about the Awan brothers. But they worked for our former DNC chair, DEBBIE WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ —that is Imran Awan. These people are under investigation for stealing material, potentially accessing material they shouldn’t have, for taking material off of Capitol Hill and stealing it, using it in other places. We are told, oh, not to worry, they didn’t access classified intelligence information in the SCIF; but other IT people tell me, once someone is in the congressional system, the calendar, email for one Member of Congress, if they are good, it is not that hard to break into lots of other Members of Congress’ email and calendars. What country that hates America— some that like America—wouldn’t love to know who people are meeting, especially on the Intelligence Committee like some of the people that have employed these? Some of them, very fine members of things like the Ethics Committee, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence Committee. Let’s see, ANDRE´CARSON , SANDY LEVIN, JACKIE SPEIER —a lot of people, good people—TIMRYAN. A lot of these folks, they employed these folks. They were very trusting, kind people. And these people didn’t have a background check, and now they are under investigation. I heard some have been told that Imran Awan, the lead guy, went back to Pakistan. Well, if this guy set up and was working on computer systems, is it possible he could have—and this is what a normal mainstream reporter, 30, 40 years ago back in the seventies would have asked: Well, did he set up the DNC computer system that got hacked, that was supposedly hacked by Russians or others, did he set that up so it could be hacked? I mean, there is a lot here going on that we don’t know the answers to, and we deserve to know the answers. There were mortgage transfers, debt evading bankruptcies. Imran Awan, Jamal Awan were known to be the ringleaders of the group, had been providing services since 2005; has convictions for driving offenses which were serious enough to become criminal misdemeanors, used an illegal radar detector, drove an unregistered vehicle; some say, after masterminding the family’s finances, was running the business completely by 2010 and instructed Abid not to even speak to anyone. The wives of Imran and Abid also began receiving paychecks from the House of Representatives. They purchased two homes in Lorton in 2008, one of which was associated with all three brothers at one time. Alvi sold that home in 2016 to the younger brother Jamal for $620,000. Imran owned a home and put it in his father’s name in 2008 in Springfield. Abid later claimed, in bankruptcy, that the house was his. Jamal Awan was placed on the House payroll at age 20, making $160,000. Imran is also a real estate agent. Despite making $160,000 in congressional salaries, debts went unpaid by the Awan brothers, including debts to the Congressional Federal Credit Union. $100,000 was taken from a known Hezbollahconnected fugitive, a fugitive from the FBI; and they are associated with this Hezbollahconnected agent, and there is no press out there getting to the bottom of it? What happened to the Washington press, the proud press of Washington of the 1970s? Well, they are in the bag for one party. They are not interested in getting to the bottom of the news. They are all about advocating. God not just bless America, God help America. We have got to have people wake up before we do much more damage to ourselves. It is time to turn this country around, and one of the things we should start with is getting to the bottom of this investigation; find out how much damage these alleged criminals did from Pakistan to our Congress, and also start undoing the damage ObamaCare has done so people can get jobs again they have lost, so people can have health care that has deductibles they can afford. It is time to make America great again. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was called to order by the Honorable BEN SASSE, a Senator from the State of Nebraska. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer: Let us pray. O Lord, in whose hands is the life of every living thing, we depend upon Your strength and might. Manifest Yourself to our Senators, directing their steps and bringing them to Your chosen destination. Without Your leading, they will be like ships without rudders, but with You directing, they cannot fail to fulfill Your purposes. Take them in the direction that will enable them to positively affect the lives of the heavy laden, the sorrowful, and the suffering. Fill their hearts with the deep compassion needed to enable Your Kingdom to come and Your will to be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Lord, use them to hasten the coming of Your Kingdom of justice and truth. We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
