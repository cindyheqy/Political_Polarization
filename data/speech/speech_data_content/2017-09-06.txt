Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the cruel and indefensible termination of the DACA program. Since its launch in 2012, DACA has helped hundreds of thousands of young people come out of the shadows without the fear of being separated from 
their loved ones and sent away from the only country they call home. Many of these children came as infants, growing up in the same playgrounds, schools, and neighborhoods as our own kids. The President’s decision targets millions of young people who contribute to our society, economy, and national identity every day. In New Jersey alone, there are over 22,000 DACA recipients who pay $66 million in State and local taxes every year. The emotional and economic impact of their deportation will be devastating, and New Jersey could lose $1.58 billion annually in GDP. America was built on the hard work of immigrants and our diversity is part of the foundation of our Nation. It is long past due for Congress to step up and protect the millions of families that will be torn apart because of this inhumane decision. We must protect DACA and pass legislation to fix our broken immigration system. 
RECOGNIZING MINNESOTA’S FEMALE TRACK AND FIELD ATHLETE OF THE YEAR BY GATORADE (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding athlete from my district who was recently named Minnesota’s Female Track and Field Athlete of the Year by Gatorade. Anna Keefer, a 2017 graduate of St. MichaelAlbertville High School, was chosen for this award due to her impressive ability on the track and the excellence she exudes in every aspect of her life. Anna is a sprinter and jumper. Her accolades include three individual State titles at the Minnesota State High School League AA State Championship meet. She holds the alltime State record in the long jump. Anna also helped bring home the track team championship title to St. Michael Albertville at the 2017 State meet. In addition to recognizing Anna with this award, Gatorade also donated a $1,000 grant in Anna’s name to a nonprofit of her choice. It gave the grant to the STMA Stallions, a local Special Olympics team, because of her friendships with some of the members on the team. Anna is attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill this fall and plans to compete on the track team. We can’t wait to see what she accomplishes next. Anna, all of us in Minnesota are so proud of you, and we wish you all the best in your future. 
RETURN TO CHAOS (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, we return to Capitol Hill amidst chaos— wildfires in the West, choking smoke in my community, the cruelty of 800,000 young people having their lives turned upside down unnecessarily by Trump yesterday, and we are dancing with the debt ceiling chaos with the world economy. All are made unnecessarily worse. Even Harvey was predictable due to government action and inaction. Congress should stop pretending these things are beyond our control. A majority of Congress would treat young DREAMers, fairly if given a right to vote for it on the floor of the House. We should fund disaster prevention, including forest fires, and stop subsidizing more floods, and not play unnecessary games with the world economy, pretending we won’t pay for money we have already spent. In the end, we will probably spend the next 3 weeks setting up the next crisis later in the year. Isn’t it time that Congress stop playing the victim and take charge? f 
RECOGNIZING CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the outstanding performance of Pennsylvania’s critical access hospitals. Before I was elected to serve in the House of Representatives, I spent nearly 30 years in the healthcare field. I am most proud to see Pennsylvania recognized in the top 10 States by the Health Resources and Services Administration for quality performance. With the help of funding from the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy, Pennsylvania’s critical access hospitals are able to invest in quality improvement projects and new technical assistance resources to better care for their patients. Pennsylvania is home to 15 critical access hospitals that provide service to the most rural areas in our State. Since 1991, the Pennsylvania Office of Rural Health has dedicated its efforts to ensure that these hospitals constantly improve the quality of care they provide to their patients. Rural hospitals are critically important to our communities. They may be limited in resources, but they are committed to providing the best care possible to patients. I am proud of our Pennsylvania critical access hospitals, and I congratulate them on this national recognition. 
PROTECT DACA (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the DACA program. Since the announcement of the end of this important program, I have heard from countless DREAMers who, in a word, are terrified. These are young people who are brought to our country as children and are now living, studying, and working in our communities. One constituent’s story, in particular, has stayed with me. This young woman was brought to our country at the age of 5. America is the only home she has ever known. She was raised in San Diego, educated in San Diego, and now works in San Diego helping other immigrants transition more seamlessly into our society. The administration’s decision to end DACA is a broken promise to her, the 40,000 DREAMers in San Diego, and the 800,000 DREAMers across the country. But even in the face of this betrayal, she called on us to ‘‘act with love and lead with inclusion.’’ With this call to action in mind, I hope my colleagues commit to protecting the DACA program and DREAMers. f 
REMEMBERING SERGEANT STEVE PEREZ (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as Hurricane Harvey rampaged across Texas, the heavens opened up and 50 inches of rain hammered down on the Houston area. After 2 days of hard rain, on August 27, 60yearold Houston Police Officer Sergeant Steve Perez got up, as he does every morning, put on the badge, the shield over his heart, and began to drive to work to help rescue flood victims. It was dangerous. The floodwaters were high and constantly rising. People’s homes and businesses were flooding. Perez’s wife even asked him not to go that day. But, Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Perez knew the people of Houston were counting on him. He made a wrong turn when he was headed to work, fighting the flooded streets. Because of that, the 34year veteran of the force, Sergeant Perez, died in the floodwaters. He gave his life for the thin blue line, the line that protects and serves the rest of us. Officers like Sergeant Perez are just a cut above the rest of us. They willingly put themselves into harm’s way for their communities, and their motto is to protect and to serve. Houston will remember Texas lawman Sergeant Perez as one of their own, putting his life on the line during one of the worst natural disasters in Texas history. Next week, as hundreds of officers from all over the State of Texas and other States stand in silence, taps will be played for the end of watch for Sergeant Perez. Sergeant Perez is one of the rare breed—the Texas breed of law officers that sacrifice for the rest of us. 
While we mourn the loss of Sergeant Perez, we thank the good Lord that such men ever lived. And that is just the way it is. 
NATIONAL AUCTIONEERS DAY (Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, first off, I want the folks in Texas and Louisiana to know that South Carolina continues to pray for the folks that live in the affected areas, and all of the States that are facing a potential hurricane. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express support for designation of the first Saturday of May as National Auctioneers Day and the preceding week as National Auctioneers Week. Auctioneering is one of history’s oldest professions. I was an auctioneer for 16plus years before coming to Congress. As an auctioneer, I saw firsthand the purest form of buying and selling. Auctions bring buyers and sellers together where the highest price is established through competitive bidding. Auctions continue to be the fairest, most transparent and effective means of establishing fair market value. The National Auctioneers Association and its members strive to advance the auction method of marketing and uphold the highest standards of professionalism in serving the American public. These professionals are proud businessowners who support their communities. For more than 40 years, National Auctioneers Day has been observed by State and local governments and private organizations across the U.S. The designation of National Auctioneers Day and National Auctioneers Week will heighten the public awareness of the contributions made by auction professionals to our Nation’s history and economy. Mr. Speaker, I call upon the House of Representatives to support this designation and America’s auctioneers. 
b1015 GROWING OUR NAVY (Mr. GALLAGHER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to once again emphasize the urgent imperative of growing our Navy to 355 ships. This body is now on record in support of a 355ship Navy, and the recent tragedies at sea only serve to reinforce the inadequate capacity of our current fleet. While the size of our Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships at the end of the Cold War to less than 280 ships today, the demand for deployed ships has remained relatively constant between 85 and 100. This steady demand on the fleet, coupled with tight budgets and habitually underfunded maintenance counts, has taken a serious toll on our sailors. Growing the fleet is no easy task. It will take constant leadership and attention. In his confirmation hearing, Secretary Spencer rightly spoke about creative levers the Navy could pull to get to 355, including bringing ships out of the ready reserve, yet we need more urgency, we need that sense of urgency that Secretary Spencer talked about in his mission, vision, and priorities document. This must extend to growing the fleet as quickly as is practical. Every day, month, and budget year that goes by without significant progress towards 355 makes this urgent requirement that much less likely to materialize. Mr. Speaker, there is not a moment to lose. We must make growing the fleet our number one priority. f 
RECOGNIZING GIANA ZAMBELLI AND OLIVIA CAMERON (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Giana Zambelli and Olivia Cameron. These two 9year old girls from Bensalem, Pennsylvania, spend their free time running a local KoolAid stand which they call Kool Aid for Kenny. The proceeds from their sales benefit the Kenneth Hopkins Memorial Scholarship Fund created in 2016, to award students currently pursuing a career in emergency services. Mr. Speaker, Ken Hopkins was an emergency medical technician with the Bucks County Rescue Squad and a volunteer firefighter with the Croydon Fire Department. He passed away in June 2016, after struggling with post traumatic stress disorder from his time serving our community and saving lives as a first responder. Mr. Speaker, the selfless acts of Giana and Olivia are truly inspiring to all of us. Their remarkable work continues to make Ken’s dream a reality in the hopes that others continue to save lives and help those in need, just as Ken Hopkins did his entire life. Ken, Giana, and Olivia are an inspiration to our entire community. 
FREEDOM IN EASTERN EUROPE (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as a lifelong cold warrior promoting victory over communism, it was a dream come true to lead a bipartisan delegation to Eastern Europe in early August reaffirming America’s commitment to our new NATO allies in the European Reassurance Initiative. We know that peace through strength will be successful. The vision of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan has been achieved. Visiting with military and government leaders in Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Georgia, and Poland, we saw dynamic and prospering American allies achieving worldclass defensive capabilities with their professional military fully equipped with the latest technologies. In both Warsaw and Tbilisi, President Donald Trump and Vice President MIKEPENCE made it clear America will protect these new democracies. I was inspired as an election observer in Bulgaria in 1990, and have seen this country evolve from totalitarianism to the now dedicated democracy led by Prime Minister Boyko Borissov. I was grateful to be accompanied by my youngest son, Hunter, an Afghanistan veteran, as we witnessed freedom in these countries in stark contrast to the year Hunter was born in 1987, when all six countries were enemies to the United States and were suffering under communist dictatorships. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
EMERGENCY FUNDING FOR HURRICANE HARVEY (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the hundreds of thousands of victims of Hurricane Harvey in Houston and Harris County and throughout Texas and call on Congress to immediately pass emergency funding to help victims with this unprecedented disaster. Our district in east side, north side, and southeast side Houston, Harris County, is familiar with hurricanes and tropical storms. We were hit hard by Allison in 2001, again by Hurricane Ike in 2008. Harvey’s destruction is beyond anything witnessed in living memory in Texas, flooding over 100,000 homes in Harris County alone, killing at least 60 people, 12 innocent victims in our own district. Countless lives in Houston and along the Gulf Coast have been on hold: families who cannot return to their flooded homes, children whose schools are damaged, mothers and fathers who can’t get back to work. I urge my colleagues to vote for this critical emergency funding bill today that will help the people of Houston and Harris County and Texas on the road to recovery. 
RECOGNIZING GEORGIA MJARTAN (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Georgia Mjartan of Little Rock. She is the executive director of Our House and is stepping down after 12 years. 
During her 12 years at Our House, Georgia was named ‘‘Nonprofit Executive of the Year’’ in 2011 and Our House was named ‘‘Nonprofit Organization of the Year’’ in 2015. Under her leadership, Our House has seen extraordinary growth and plays an important role in our community, serving those who find themselves homeless or near homeless, while providing life skills, resources, and services to overcome their situation. Our House empowers residents to succeed in the workforce, in school, and in life through hard work, smart choices, and community involvement. Our House will continue to thrive. Georgia is a pillar of the community. She is a loving wife, mom, foster and adoptive parent of three beautiful children. I am proud to call her friend, and I wish her the best of luck as she relocates from Arkansas to South Carolina. 
THE NATIONAL MEDIA HAS LOST OUR TRUST (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the American people have lost faith in the liberal national media, and we know why. They tell the American people what to think rather than report the facts in an unbiased manner. A new NBC Marist Poll revealed that twothirds of Americans trust the media not very much or not at all. A Morning Consult/Politico poll found that 41 percent of registered voters have more trust in their local news outlets than the national media to report the truth, compared to only 27 percent who said the national media. And a Quinnipiac poll showed that an astounding 55 percent of Americans disapprove of the way the news media covers President Trump. The national media’s endless drumbeat of negative coverage of the Trump administration has come with a cost: the loss of trust of the American people. If the media want to improve their credibility, they should report the news fairly and without bias. 
HONORING PETTY OFFICER LOGAN PALMER (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Petty Officer Logan Palmer from Decatur, Illinois. Logan knew early on that he wanted to serve his country. He was an Eagle Scout and an active member of Life Foursquare Church. After he graduated from Sangamon Valley High School and Richland Community College, he enlisted in the Navy as an interior communications electrician. In the Navy, Logan earned the National Defense Service Medal. Although I never had the honor of meeting Petty Officer Logan Palmer, his family remembers him as a committed sailor, a loving son, and a brother. Petty Officer Logan Palmer died serving and protecting our country, and for that, we remain eternally grateful. This accident is a grave reminder of the risks our servicemembers and their families take on each day. I continue to pray for Logan’s parents, Theresa and Sid, his brothers Austin and Kaleb, his sister Mattie, and all those who knew and loved Logan. f 
TRIBUTE TO BOB REDFORD (Mr. ESTES of Kansas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in tribute to Bob Redford, who founded the Walnut Valley Festival in the Fourth District of Kansas back in 1972, and served more than 40 years as its president. Bob Redford passed away in December of last year. Bob Redford’s dedication to live music resulted in this legendary event, which is one of the longest running music festivals in U.S. history. For 46 years, pickers and music lovers have journeyed to this special place on the Kansas plains to celebrate life with music. Bob Redford gave so much to the community in Cowley County and dedicated years of service to leading and promoting this iconic festival that has become known as Pickers Paradise. There is no place on earth like the Walnut Valley Festival, which is home to national and international instrument championship contests and where thousands return year after year to experience outstanding live music, in the grandstands, performed by world famous musicians, along with legendary campground jams. Bob Redford’s legacy lives in the community of musicians and music lovers from around the world, who will gather next weekend in the pecan grove along the Walnut River in Winfield, Kansas, for the 46th Annual Walnut Valley Festival. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas) laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 502) providing for the concurrence by the House in the Senate amendments to H.R. 601, with an amendment. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H. Res. 502. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present H. Res. 502, a resolution making emergency appropriations to allow the Federal Government to continue the vital response and recovery efforts that are helping the hundreds of thousands of victims of Hurricane Harvey. Our thoughts go out to all the people of Texas and Louisiana who are coping with the aftermath of this storm and its catastrophic flooding. As one of the Nation’s greatest national disasters continues to unfold before our eyes, this Congress must ensure that our Federal Government is able to meet the short and longterm needs of disaster victims. I believe that every type of resource ought to be utilized to support rescue, relief, and recovery efforts. I want to reassure the people of Texas and Louisiana that we are there for them in their time of greatest need. The House Appropriations Committee has already approved a $1 billion reprogramming request for FEMA last week, which has allowed the agency to continue to meet the most immediate needs in the region. It has become clear that, in the face of a disaster of such magnitude, much more is needed to assist these states and local communities as they recover and rebuild. Last Friday, we received the administration’s initial request for supplemental funding for Hurricane Harvey. We are grateful for the speed of this request, and, recognizing the urgency of the situation, we brought this resolution to the floor today. H. Res. 502 contains $7.4 billion for FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, which will allow FEMA to continue its efforts related to Harvey as well as any additional disasters that may strike. H. Res. 502 also includes $450 million to support the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program that will help small businesses and homeowners come back from the disasters. Working closely with the Texas and Louisiana members, the Appropriations Committee has done its due diligence to guarantee that this funding will make best use of taxpayers’ dollars. b1030 I want to thank all of our Federal agencies, first responders from around the Nation, the thousands of volunteers who immediately responded, and all those who have been working tirelessly to make sure that we meet the needs of the people of Texas and Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the devastation in Texas and Louisiana from Hurricane Harvey warrants swift congressional action. I am pleased we are here today to ensure that FEMA can continue to support the States affected by this disaster. The $7.4 billion for FEMA and $450 million for the Small Business Administration in H. Res. 502 are only a first step in a long process that will require a longterm Federal presence. I represent areas, Mr. Speaker, affected by Superstorm Sandy and understand, firsthand, the need for Federal intervention when storms overwhelm State and local capacity. Following Sandy, the last administration requested and Congress approved funding for resiliency to ensure that future generations can mitigate the damage from storms that have grown in intensity. We can argue about the effects of climate change on storms, but we must all agree that our communities must receive muchneeded mitigation funding to protect lives and livelihoods in future storms and to prevent more costly damage. Despite the fact that some of the Representatives for areas affected by Hurricane Harvey heavily criticized and voted against the assistance provided in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, I wholeheartedly support the funding in this resolution and expect a much larger request from the administration, including funding to mitigate damage from future storms. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CARTER ), the chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the supplemental funding for Hurricane Harvey relief. H. Res. 502 totals $7.85 billion in emergency funding, including $7.4 billion for FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund. This supplemental funding is a necessary first step toward assisting our communities in immediate need. However, rebuilding and recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Harvey will continue to require further resources and really hard work. I will continue to work closely alongside my colleagues in the Texas delegation, the Louisiana delegation, and the Appropriations Committee to meet the needs of our neighbors in the southeastern part of our State. My thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this devastating storm. Colleagues, I encourage each and every one of you to vote for this. H. Res. 502 is focused on addressing the immediate needs of those affected by Hurricane Harvey. It sends them a powerful message: that we are here and we are here for them, and we will be working hard for them throughout this recovery. Just this morning, I saw another newsman standing waistdeep in water in Houston as it continues to recede. Let’s cast our vote properly and start the recovery for the southeastern part of Texas and the western part of Louisiana. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR ), a member of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank the ranking member for yielding her time, for her leadership, and for all the work she has done, and also our chairman, Mr. FRELING HUYSEN , for his leadership, and Chairman JOHNCARTER , one of our Texans, for bringing this important resolution to the floor. This funding will help FEMA, which is running out of money, provide the immediate recovery and relief that we need in Texas and Louisiana. It is only a downpayment. Normally, in rain events, we measure water in inches; during Hurricane Harvey, we measured it in feet. At the end, there were over 19 trillion gallons of water on the ground. Hurricane Harvey killed at least 60 people, including Alonso Guillen, a DREAMer who drove over 100 miles to help rescue by boat those who first responders couldn’t reach. 
Those who were evacuated will soon come home to find their homes and their memories left behind in ruin by the floodwaters. The cost of the total damages will be in the billions. Many losses, however, will be priceless: pictures of family weddings, kids’ soccer games, children’s favorite toy, a daughter’s prom dress, or an antique that has been passed through generations. Yet, many heroes stepped up to open up their homes, their churches, and their businesses to house those evacuees. Those efforts highlight the fact that this is not a natural disaster, but it is a national disaster, and it requires a response. I quickly want to thank the first responders and others at the local, State, and Federal levels who bravely and selflessly provided assistance, including our friends to the south, Mexico, that are sending over trucks and trucks of assistance. Today, we stand together not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans. We speak in one voice, and we stand with Houston, east Texas, and Louisiana as we continue to do the rescue and the recovery. And as Hurricane Irma comes over to Florida and the Southeast, we, again, stand together as Americans, one team. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ). Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, in light of this unprecedented natural disaster in Houston and Louisiana, along the Gulf Coast, I want to urge my colleagues to provide the resources necessary to help them recover. We need to move quickly and we need to move responsibly, and I just urge my colleagues to act, and act now. I am very proud of my fellow Texans for the way they have responded. I am proud of the leadership at the local level, at the State level, and I am proud, mostly, of the overwhelming, loving response of reaching out, neighbor helping neighbor, friends and folks in their community taking this responsibility headon, not waiting on the Federal Government. We have a role, and the Federal Government ought to do all that we can to help those. Texas is a special place, Mr. Speaker. As you know, these folks are very self reliant. They are committed to their communities, and they are committed to loving thy neighbor. It is not just a memory verse, it is a way of life in Texas. So, again, our thoughts and prayers are with our friends back home. I know my colleagues and neighbors in west Texas, in District 19, have sent first responder vehicles and personnel, food, and supplies. Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Texas, has sent, for example, 12 tons of supplies and food. So we are with you guys. We love you. As Trump said, ‘‘Texans can handle anything.’’ He is right. God bless Texas, and God bless America. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our ranking member not only for yielding to me, but also for her call a couple of weeks ago. And I want to thank our colleague from Lubbock, Texas. We have a lot of water we can send to west Texas, but appreciate the support not just from Texas, but all across the country. People are coming in everywhere. And I see me colleague, BRIAN BABIN, who is my neighbor. We are not Democrats and Republicans; we are Americans. And that is what we are seeing. And our Speaker pro tempore of the House, also, is neighbor to both of us. But I rise in support of the hundreds of thousands of victims of Hurricane Harvey in Houston and Harris County and throughout Texas, and I call on Congress to immediately pass emergency funding to help victims from this unprecedented disaster. Our district is in northeast and southeast Houston and Harris County. We are familiar with hurricanes and tropical storms. We were hit by Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, hit by Hurricane Ike in 2008. Harvey’s disaster and destruction is beyond anything witnessed in living memory in Texas, flooding over 100,000 homes in Harris County alone and killing at least 60 people, including 12 innocent victims in our district. Countless lives in Houston and along the Gulf Coast have been put on hold: families who cannot return to their flooded homes, children whose schools were damaged, mothers and fathers who cannot go back to work. I have a school district in northeast Harris County, Sheldon ISD. They have eight schools. Four of those schools are so damaged they can’t be reopened. Houstonians and Texans are proud and independent people. We take pride in our cando attitude, as witnessed by our brave first responders and countless volunteers who rescued neighbors during the worst of the flooding. I urge all my colleagues to vote for this critical emergency funding that will help the people of Houston and Texas on the road to recovery. But this is not the only time we will need this emergency funding. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  an article in Monday’s Houston Chronicle on the dedication of our doctors and public health workers at the Texas Medical Center in Houston during the worst of Harvey. 
[From the Houston Chronicle] MY60H OURSHIFT IN THE ER D URING  HURRICANE HARVEY  (By Benjamin Gold) I was on call at St. Luke’s when the major flooding began. I decided to stay in the hospital, along with many other residents, attendings, nurses and support staff. It turns out that a hospital is a fantastic place to be in a crisis—it has food, water, electricity, even WiFi. I ended up staying there until Monday, taking shifts with other residents as we watched over our patients. We even saw some new ones who somehow managed to make their way through floodwaters to the emergency room. Here are some of the things I saw during those 60 hours. I saw nurses working for almost 20 hours straight and managing way more patients than usual, refusing to leave them—they didn’t know when the next nurses would arrive. I saw the cafeteria transformed into a support station with roundtheclock free meals. The lunch tables transformed into war rooms as the various medical departments strategized about how to staff the hospital despite being desperately under capacity. I got meals from the same cafeteria worker— Anne—on Friday night, Saturday morning, Saturday evening, Sunday morning, Sunday evening and Monday morning. I saw patients placed in impossible circumstances. One, a young man with a son in the ICU at Texas Children’s, recently heard that his house had flooded. He was having high fevers and coughing up yellow sputum. His chest Xray showed he had developed a lobar pneumonia. He was pale and clammy, with bloodshot eyes. ‘‘Doc, I need go,’’ he told me. ‘‘I have to see my son. I have to call my wife and make sure she’s safe. I can’t stay here.’’ I was in the ICU when an impromptu meeting was held to discuss the fact that no relief would be able to come in for the foreseeable future. There were only two attendings, each taking 12hour shifts so the other could sleep. They’d already been working for 48 hours. Midway through one of the shifts, one of the sleeping ICU doctors woke up and asked the active doctor if he was OK. ‘‘I’m cruising,’’ he said, smiling. He was blearyeyed and weary, but it didn’t matter. ‘‘I’m rolling,’’ he said and gave a thumbsup. ‘‘I’m good to go.’’ My fiance´e, who also is a doctor, told me that one of her patients wanted to meet me after they found out that their doctor had a significant other in the hospital. ‘‘Sure,’’ I said, and went over to the room. They were so appreciative of her care that they invited us to go fishing with them in Corpus Christi when this was all over. ‘‘I’m telling you, you’ve never seen a more beautiful place to fish your entire life. You’ll stay with us, of course! It won’t cost you a penny.’’ The man took out his iPhone and showed us pictures of a gorgeous coastline, Texas sized sunsets and smiling nephews proudly holding up fish as big as they were. ‘‘We’ll make it down there,’’ he said. ‘‘We’ll get through this.’’ Finally, on Monday morning, the first wave of relief arrived, and those whose houses hadn’t flooded and had clear streets were able to go home. Others weren’t so lucky. The Texas Medical Center is what brought me to Houston. It has more medical schools, hospitals and nursing facilities per square foot than any other place on earth. It was incredible to see the resiliency, camaraderie and selflessness of those who work there in a crisis. Learning about what to do in a crisis is standard in medical education. But to see it in action, to see people refusing to leave until they knew their patients would be cared for, is something else entirely. It’s been a grim few days, and the worst is not over. We don’t know how many more casualties there might be. Untold billions in property damage has already been done. But Houstonians showed their true colors over this past weekend. I’ve never been prouder to be a Texan. 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN). Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to echo what everyone has said, especially my colleagues, Mr. GREEN and others, from Texas who have mentioned how we have pulled together. But I want to rise in strong support of this disaster relief funding for those who have been impacted by this terrible storm. My district is in Texas 36, and it was totally devastated. All nine counties have been declared Federal disaster areas. The entire district was underwater, a vast lake, from Houston over to the Louisiana border. The devastation is truly heartbreaking. I have traveled to each county and assisted in the recovery efforts, and I have met with the victims. H. Res. 502 provides desperately needed resources to help our fellow Americans put their lives back together again and provides a hand up, not a handout. Texans don’t want a handout, but we do need the help and the hand up. In the midst of this devastation, the entire world has seen the resiliency, compassion, and determination of the people of Texas, and I am truly inspired by the incredible stories of goodness. We have had multiple disasters, especially in my district—multiple—even three disaster declarations for some of my counties over the past 3 years. I have met and talked to some of my constituents who had just gotten back into their homes 2, 3 months ago from a flood that impacted us last year. One has told me she still had the price tags on their furniture when she woke up during the night to see water in her house. These are the kinds of things that we are seeing. But in the midst, as I have said, our churches, our first responders, our private citizens, businesses, people from out of State—and I want to especially commend the State of Louisiana, who came over and provided hundreds of boat teams for us—all around the district, people are helping one another. I just want to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very, very muchneeded funding and showing our fellow Americans that we stand with them in this terrible, terrible time. I have been around a long time. I have seen storms—Hurricane Audrey in the 1950s—and this storm, Hurricane Harvey, I have never seen one like this before. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE), who we know was struggling with her fellow Texans and trying to be as helpful as she could during this horrible, horrible disaster. b1045 Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the Speaker, and I thank the gentlewoman from New York. Having known the devastation of hurricanes just a couple of years ago, I thank her, and along with her as the ranking minority member, the chairman as well, both coming from the region where they faced the same devastation. We come together united. We come bipartisan. We come as friends. As I said at the NRG shelter just a few days ago, we have hope. We have hope. We are grateful that we are beginning the process of recovery with the over $7 billion now being allotted for disaster recovery, $450 million of that being for small businesses. The need is great. Twelve days ago, on August 25, Hurricane Harvey hit this coast, and it hit Texas in a very hard way. To put in perspective the devastation brought by Hurricane Harvey, the volume of water that fell on Houston and other affected areas of Texas and Louisiana could fill more than 24,000 Astrodomes. Hurricane Harvey was a thousandyear storm. It claimed many, many lives. Twentyone trillion gallons of rainfall fell in Texas. Sustained winds exceeded 130 miles an hour. I cannot thank, enough, those who gathered and helped, from the local officials, from Mayor Sylvester Turner and Judge Emmett, to Mayor Aaron in Humble, to Mayor Diaz in Jacinto City—cities in my congressional district—to the many volunteers, the Cajun Navy. And might I thank the Texas National Guard—they were standing up—the Marines, the Navy, and, of course, the Army. We traveled with them. I thank the Military Museum of Armed Forces that traveled with me to give out food. We are still in need. Thousands of people without apartments who have been evicted have been told to go. As I walked the streets of Humble, Texas, in my district, piles and piles and piles of rubbish, people’s homes and possessions, even though they had their family and lives, all of their possessions out on the front. This is a time for us to rise without obstacles. This is a time for us to ensure that all people can be protected. I would like to highlight the DREAMer that died, Alonso Guillen, who came all the way from Lufkin, Texas, just be able to save those who he saw were in need. We need to be able to ensure that he is not discriminated against or my constituents in certain parts of my district who are afraid to seek help simply because they are unstatused. My friends, I know we can find a pathway forward. I know that we can find a pathway to reauthorize DACA and to do it as soon as possible in tribute to Alonso Guillen, who died with friends when he brought his boat, of his own accord, to be able to come and save those. Let me tell you what we need. We need housing resources. We need to ensure that we have housing resources to make sure that the people who were evicted can make sure that they have a way to have a home. We need small business resources. I want to thank the gentlewoman for her time, and I know that we will be working together and making a difference for those who were impacted by Hurricane Harvey. My prayers for those who are impacted by Hurricane Irma. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3672, which provides $7.85 billion in supplemental appropriations as the Congress’s initial response to the massive damaged inflicted on Southeast Texas and Louisiana by Hurricane Harvey. The speed with which the bipartisan leadership drafted and shepherded this legislation to the floor bodes well for the major challenges that must be met and overcome if Congress if the victims of Hurricane Harvey are to recover from the storm’s awful wrath and rebuild their decimated communities. I thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member LOWEY , and Speaker R YAN and Democratic Leader PELOSI , for bringing this initial supplemental funding bill to the floor in a timely manner and which lets the people of Texas and Louisiana know that the American people stand in solidarity with them in their moment of heartbreak and anguish. Mr. Speaker, just 12 days, on August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall for the first time in the state of Texas, just north of the city of Corpus Christi. Before it was finished, Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons of rainfall on Texas and Louisiana, most of it on the Houston Metroplex. To put in perspective the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey, the volume of water that fell on Houston and other affected areas of Texas and Louisiana could fill more than 24,000 Astrodomes or supply the water for the raging Niagara Falls for 15 days. Whole sections of Houston, Beaumont, Bayou City, Port Arthur, and other cities were underwater for days. Hurricane Harvey was a 1,000 year storm that has to date claimed the lives of at least 30 persons, including a 34year veteran of the Houston Police Department and a family of six who perished in Greens Bayou while trying to evacuate their flooded home and community. It also claimed the life of a Dreamer, Alonso Guillen, a young Houstonian who came to Texas from Mexico as a teenager, and who died when his boat capsized while he was rescuing survivors of the flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey. Neither Houston nor any city in the nation has ever experienced flooding of the magnitude caused by Hurricane Harvey. The statistics are staggering. 21 trillion gallons of rainfall fell in Texas and Louisiana in the first five days of the storm. The estimated maximum sustained winds exceeded 130 miles per hour as the hurricane made landfall near Rockport, Texas on August 25. A record 4,323 days, which is nearly 12 years, elapsed since a major hurricane (Category 3 or above) made landfall in the United States prior to Hurricane Harvey; the last Category 3 hurricane to hit the United States was Hurricane Wilma in 2005, the same year Hurricane Katrina destroyed much of New Orleans. The city of Cedar Bayou received 51.88 inches of rainfall, breaking the record for rainfall from a single storm in the continental United States; my city of Houston received more than 5o inches of rainfall. More than 13,000 people have been rescued in the Houston area and more than 
30,000 persons are expected to be forced out of their homes due to the storm. More than 8,800 federal personnel were staff deployed to help respond to Hurricane Harvey, supplying approximately 2.9 million meals, 2.8 million liters of water, 37,000 tarps, and 130 generators. In the first three days of the storm, more than 49,000 homes that had suffered flood damage and more than 1,000 homes were completely destroyed in the storm. Mr. Speaker, valiant emergency responders are overextended and citizen rescues have become a critical source of assistance in saving lives. Local authorities closed major freeways, airports, and schools. Emergency shelters are filled to capacity and efforts to rescue residents continue around the clock. The anticipated cost of removing debris is expected to dwarf the $70 million spent by Houston removing debris after Hurricane Ike in 2008. We do not yet know the full cost in human lives exacted by Hurricane Harvey. But what we do know is that the costs of recovery and reconstruction will far exceed any natural disaster in memory; best estimates place the cost in the range of $150–$200 billion. Mr. Speaker, there is much work to be done in my city of Houston, and across the areas affected by the terrible, awesome storm that will be forever known simply as Hurricane Harvey. That is why I strongly support the legislation pending before us appropriating $7.85 billion as the initial response of the Congress to the damage caused by an epic storm. I must emphasize that what we are considering here is the initial response because much more funding will be needed for Houston—the nation’s fourth largest city—and Southeast Texas to recover and rebuild. For that reason, I urge all Members to join me in support of H.R. 3672 and to commit to providing our fellow Americans in Texas and Louisiana all of the help and support they need to restore their communities to their previous greatness. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CULBERSON ), from the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee. Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, to everyone in Texas and Louisiana who has suffered the loss of a loved one or the loss of everything they own in this catastrophic flood, we are here today to tell you that help is on the way and to say thank you. Help is on the way because today, in the Congress, there are no Republicans, there are no Democrats. We are all Americans here today, unified in our determination to move swiftly to help all those poor people who have suffered so much as a result of this catastrophic storm. It is an unparalleled disaster in our Nation’s history. My district suffered. We all suffered, all of us in southeast Texas, southwest Louisiana. My brother and his wife lost everything. Their home is still underwater. My inlaws lost everything. Their home was destroyed, everything they owned and loved, but they are just personal possessions. No one lost their lives. I can’t imagine if you lost a loved one in this catastrophe. But help is on the way. We are all unified here today. We are all working together to make sure that we get this immediate infusion of cash into the Disaster Relief Fund to help these people who have suffered so much and been displaced so abruptly and so catastrophically. I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for bringing this to the floor so quickly, thank our leadership for working together to get this done. I want to thank President Trump and his wife for personally donating $1 million to the relief fund for the victims of Hurricane Harvey. I want to thank, also, all of the first responders who sacrificed so much to save so many lives. I want to thank especially the people of America who stepped up to help the people of Houston. I spent all of last week out in neighborhoods in boats and on trucks and in waders helping pull people and their property and their pets out of their homes. Last Saturday, I ran into a group of guys, four guys, with a bass boat that drove all the way from Florida. They saw the catastrophe on television and said, ‘‘We can either sit here and watch this or we can go help our fellow Americans,’’ and they jumped in their truck and they drove that bass boat all the way to Texas to help us. A guy from Michigan showed up in our neighborhoods just to help. I want to thank my friend and my colleague, Congressman GARRET  GRAVES of Louisiana, who called me on the second day of the disaster and said: The Cajun Navy is on the way. I said: What? I didn’t know there was such a thing as the Cajun Navy. GARRET said: 110 trucks are on the way to Texas towing 100 boats loaded with thousands of meals of jambalaya and red beans and rice and diapers and water and radios and everything that you need to recover from a storm. They just did it, our neighbors. I have never been prouder to be an American, never been prouder to be a Texan or a Houstonian, to see people step up and help each other out of the goodness of their hearts, because we are Americans and we are the greatest nation in the history of civilization, and it is because we are all selfreliant. It is because we all look after each other as a community. We all love each other. We love our family, our God. We respect the law. This great Nation that was founded on the rule of law is a bond that connects all of us, and we saw it in this disaster, and we thank you all from the bottom of our heart. Help is on the way. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to our next speaker, I would just thank Mr. CULBERSON . I just want to thank you, Mr. CULBERSON , because, of course, we are all totally supportive of this aid package, but I remember that you were the only Member from the majority in Texas who supported our Sandy package. I just wanted to, at this time, thank you again for your generosity and your warm heart for every American. Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentlewoman yield? Mrs. LOWEY. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. CULBERSON. Today, we are all Americans, arm in arm. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ). Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I also thank the ranking member for her kind words. I would like to thank the chairperson for bringing this to the floor, both of them. Mr. Speaker, this is a seminal moment in time, a moment in time that can shape the rest of our time. This is an opportunity for those of us who contend that we are our brother’s keeper to, in fact, become our brother’s keeper. You see, you can’t be your brother’s keeper without keeping your brother. This is a chance to be your brother’s keeper. This is a chance for the unity that we express when we are before the cameras to manifest itself in the votes that we cast here in Congress. This is a seminal moment in time. This is a moment in time for us to care not only about those who live in the suites of life, but also those who dwell in the streets of life, those who live on benches, those who sleep under bridges. It is an opportunity for us to cast a vote that will send aid, send assistance to those in Houston, Texas, and all across the area that has been devastated by this monster. It is a chance for us to help them. But this is only a downpayment, only a downpayment. There must be much more. We need help in Houston posthaste, as is the case with other places around the country that have been devastated. We need help for housing, not only for those who had homes before the monster hit, but also for those who didn’t have homes who need to transition to a place that they can call home. If home is where the heart is, where is the heart of the homeless, people who sleep under bridges? Where is the heart of the homeless? They have to be given a place that they can call home as well, which means, at some point, we have got to have dollars appropriated for the organizations that help those who live in the streets of life: the homeless. We have got to help them, too. If we can help those in the suites, we can help those in the streets. I would also say to my colleagues: Please understand, people who are here and undocumented have needs, too. They live in places that are horrible. I have been in their homes. I have smelled the mold. I know what it is 
like to see the conditions that they dwell in. It is time for us to put aside the politics that divide us from people who need help and help those people, too. Let’s send some more money to the organizations that help them. This is a moment in time. This is a seminal moment in time. It is time for us to step up and help everyone that is harmed, not be selective. If you are in this country and you are hurting, we ought to help you. God bless you. I thank you, Madam Leader on my side, the ranking member. I thank you again, Mr. Chairman, and I beg that we do what we can to make sure every person in this country receives the help he or she deserves.

Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ) for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, my Houston area has suffered a historic hurricane, one that really changed the lives of all the people who were affected. My district was hammered by this flood. To put it in perspective, 27 trillion gallons of rain fell over Texas and parts of Louisiana in the 6 days of the flood. That is enough water to file the Houston Astrodome 85,000 times. At the height of the flood, 70 percent of Harris County, which is the Houston area, was flooded, 70 percent was underwater. The devastation in Texas equalled, Mr. Speaker, the size of New Jersey. You place New Jersey in southeast Texas, that is how much of the area was affected by this flood and the rain. People had anywhere between 36 and 52 inches of rain. The Weather Service had to create a new color, purple, on their maps to show how much rain had fallen. Nothing like this has ever happened in North America. 72,000 people were rescued by first responders and volunteers from high water. This is the largest civilian water evacuation since Dunkirk. Thousands of civilian volunteers worked along with city and county first responders to save countless lives. The heroes came from all walks of life, from all parts of the country. The attitude of the people of Texas was one of inspiration. Flooded victims who didn’t know each other, their homes were flooded, but they were helping other flooded victims get to safety and get what property they could recover. This heroism reminded me what it means to be a Texan and an American. Mr. Speaker, Harvey will not defeat the human spirit. There were two men in Brownwood. Now, you know where Brownwood, Texas, is. Probably nobody else ever heard of it. That is in way west Texas. They decided they wanted to help. They got in their pickup trucks. They drove to Austin, Texas, which is still 200 miles away from Houston. They went to a sports place there and bought a bass boat, a trailer, a motor, and filled it up with all kinds 
of stuff, drove to Houston, Texas, and kept working for others. That is one of many stories. So this supplemental is important to southeast Texas. Let this vote show that we will vote not for politics, but for people. And that is just the way it is. b1100 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ROYBALALLARD ), a very distinguished ranking member from the Homeland Security Subcommittee on the Appropriations Committee. Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Speaker, there is no question that this supplemental funding is needed, and needed quickly. When the response to Harvey began in late August, the major disaster account of the disaster relief fund had approximately $2 billion available. The response to this catastrophe, however, is costing close to $200 million per day. This means that despite the recent $1 billion increase into this account, FEMA could run out of money at any time. Therefore, the enactment of the additional $7.4 billion for the disaster relief fund in this supplemental is critical to help meet FEMA’s immediate operational needs for Hurricane Harvey, and to allow for the resumption of recovery payments for prior disasters such as Sandy. The supplemental would also provide a small reserve to ensure that FEMA can begin responding to Hurricane Irma, or any other new disaster that occurs between now and September 30, 2017. It is important to note, however, that if there is significant damage from Irma, FEMA will quickly need either an additional reprogramming of money, a second supplemental appropriation, or both. I applaud the majority for quickly bringing the supplemental package to the floor with the emergency designations. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ). Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to ask my colleagues to support funding for Hurricane Harvey disaster relief. Often, the TV news goes around taking their cameras seeking the worst damage to create the most dramatic story. In the case of Hurricane Harvey in the district I represent, you could drop a camera almost anywhere in towns like Rockport, Port Aransas, Aransas Pass, Ingleside, Refugio, Tivoli, Port Lavaca, and Victoria, and have that dramatic heartwrenching shot of devastation. My friends’ and neighbors’ homes were completely flattened by hurricane winds. Businesses were destroyed and much of towns were under water, like in Wharton, following the unprecedented flooding left behind by this storm. It is the worst we have seen in decades. Many people, including the town mayor of Port Aransas, suffered and lost everything. He was walking around the emergency operation center when the mayor of Corpus Christi went up to him and said: I am jealous. You get to work in shorts, a Hawaiian shirt, and flipflops. The Port Aransas mayor looked at him and said: It is all I have left. You know, the good news for our communities is that we came together during this disaster. Groups from around the State and around the country donated to help, and many assisted the rescue and cleanup and came down and cooked food for evacuees and survivors. People opened their homes and their hearts to strangers. But the victims of the storms also need FEMA’s help as well, with things such as emergency assistance and housing. Our cities and counties need help clearing brush and debris, and we will need to make major infrastructure repairs to areas decimated by Harvey. With people registering for assistance at record rates using their smartphones, going to disasterassistance.gov, or using the FEMA app, FEMA will be out of money in just 2 or 3 days if we don’t pass this. I urge my colleagues to open their hearts, the way so many Americans have, and pass H. Res. 502. I want to say a special thankyou to those who donated, those who came and volunteered, and to everybody who helped out. Mr. Speaker, we are not only Texas strong, we are America strong. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ), who understands the impact of a disaster of this kind not only in her district, but in other areas where there has been so much suffering. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the time. Mr. Speaker, at the end of this summer the people in the Virgin Islands, in every place of worship, say the hurricane prayer at the end of their service. And part of that prayer says at the end: But, Lord, if a hurricane should come, and You loosen the gale and the winds open on us, Your will be done. Right now, the people of the Virgin Islands, and the people of Puerto Rico are fervently saying that prayer because God’s will is being done on those islands as Hurricane Irma is impacting and crashing against the shores of St. Thomas, St. John, St. Croix, and Water Island. This $7.8 billion in emergency supplemental funds is a crucial initial installment to address the effects of not only Hurricane Harvey, but the effect expected in my district of the Virgin Islands today as we stand in the potentially catastrophic path of Hurricane Irma, which is currently, at worstcase scenario, a Category 5 hurricane, the worst hurricane in the Atlantic’s history. This will need assistance from FEMA to perform emergency protective measures, the removal of debris, activities performed by other Federal agencies as assigned by FEMA, and to aid small businesses and homeowners in rebuilding their lives. Right now, the people of the Virgin Islands are praying for the lives of themselves, their families, and especially for the roof over their head. This funding for initial response efforts is critical, and I thank my colleagues for the expeditious manner in which this legislation was brought to us for swift passage. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to approve this muchneeded lifeline, and we are covetous for your prayers right now. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ), my colleague, and I thank him for his assistance many years ago addressing the needs of the residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut during Superstorm Sandy. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this measure to allocate critical funds to urgent rescue and recovery operations currently underway in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. The destruction of Hurricane Harvey is horrific, and the loss of life is heartbreaking. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is helping to lead the disaster response. FEMA needs immediate resources from Congress. Natural disasters can strike any part of the Nation at any time. No State is immune from the forces of nature, and States and localities should never have to question if aid is on the way. Our excellent Federal officials have the resources and experience to mitigate harm. They need to continue putting that experience to use, helping our neighbors in need, protect critical infrastructure, contain hazardous sites, and save lives. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for his leadership in assembling this immediate assistance for those in need. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY ), the chairman of the Democratic Caucus. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I look at the pictures of Houston, Galveston, and parts of Texas, and Louisiana, and elsewhere, and I harken back to the same images I saw in New Jersey, New York, throughout New England, and other parts of the Northeast after Sandy. I want to also note that the NYPD and the FDNY were amongst the first responders to head down to Texas to help our fellow Americans at a time of crisis and need. I also would like to point out that I have no clue where the town is that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) mentioned, and I may never ever go there. I may never go to that town, but I will 
tell you, Mr. Speaker, I don’t need to go to that town to help those people. They are Americans, and I will help them at any opportunity I get when they have a storm like this that hits them. I don’t ask questions. I never asked you if you knew where Edgewater in the Bronx was. I was prepared to vote immediately to help my constituents on Sandy. I wasn’t going to have to wait until next week or 30 days from now, or 60 days from now, or 90 days from now. And I think it is important we have to point out the hypocrisy. We are not going to stop this funding from going through. We need to point out that 20 members of the Republican caucus, some from Texas, all but one, Mr. CULBERSON , voted against Sandy relief. It must be understood that we are all Americans, and I will stand to help every American who needs help. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ). Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, and I want to pick up where Mr. CROWLEYleft off. I am for this aid. I am for this aid 100 percent. We should help these people. As Americans, we should help people all over our country. But it really hurts that those of us in New York and New Jersey, when Superstorm Sandy came and we were begging for help, we had to wait 2 months for help, and our friends in Texas on the Republican side of the aisle, except for one, voted against aid for New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. And now they are asking for aid for Texas, which I support. But it just goes to show, we never know where these disasters are going to fall. It is incumbent on all of us that we support our fellow Americans no matter where they are. So I say to the people of Texas, my heart goes out for you. My vote will be there. As much money as you need, you will have. Mr. Speaker, but I wanted to say to my Republican friends from Texas: What you did to us during Superstorm Sandy should not stand, should not be done to any other people, anyplace in the country. We are one country. We are Americans. We need to help those that need help. I am for this 100 percent. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), who has been right there helping, reaching out to all of those families who are in desperate need. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, to the distinguished gentlewoman, I come now to just stand on behalf of our delegation to be able to say, as I said earlier, I acknowledge the pain of Sandy. But I now come to make sure that we all understand that this first crunch is only the beginning. We are going to put in legislation that asks for $180 billion, recognizing the hard work of appropriators, and letting you know that people’s lives, as we walk through the debris that is in front of every house—it is painful. It is long lasting. So I just wanted to come to give my thanks and to ask: Will you please stand with me for the long journey that is going to be needed for the infrastructure we build; new dams that are 30 years old; and housing issues that will not end today; and the massive eviction of people in apartments? Not cruelly, I hope, but they are getting eviction notices with no place to go. Mr. Speaker, so I ask that we as Americans join for the long haul, the long destiny, with prayers for all. I thank Mrs. LOWEY for yielding to me so that we can talk about the long haul. God bless America. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1115 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. First of all, this morning we salute the courage of all Texans and people from Louisiana. We salute their courage and their resilience. Once again, I want to thank all of our Federal agencies and, obviously, the Governor of Texas, the Governor of Louisiana, and all those agencies that have been meeting the needs of the people; and, again, the thousands of volunteers who immediately responded and who have been working tirelessly day in and day out to help hundreds of thousands of people affected by this storm and saved, I may say, countless lives. They have fed and housed the displaced, met critical medical needs, provided transportation, and, most importantly, gave faith to those who have lost literally everything. These are American heroes who are showing the best side of our Nation, and we are grateful for their service. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Let’s get the money out the door and help the people of Texas and Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, our country is reeling from a natural disaster that has left dozens dead, caused billions of dollars in damage, and forced thousands out of their homes. Hurricane Harvey has wrought a level of devastation and suffering that is nearly unparalleled in our country. It is now our duty as America’s representatives to live up to our role and help our neighbors when they are in need. This body cannot afford to delay providing disaster assistance in the wake of this storm, as Congress did when my own state was recovering from Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Month after month, funding was withheld from our cities by political quarrels that came at New Jersey’s expense. For five months, our communities were forced to wait for the federal assistance they needed to rebuild critical infrastructure. Cleaning up the damage caused by Hurricane Harvey is a task that is beyond any single state’s resources and I will not stand by quietly if Congress fails to provide swift relief for Harvey’s victims. I hope that this body has learned from its mistakes, will stand together, set aside its differences, and immediately provide the communities affected by Hurricane Harvey with the necessary assistance to recover and rebuild. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 502. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
SAFELY ENSURING LIVES FUTURE DEPLOYMENT AND RESEARCH IN VEHICLE EVOLUTION ACT Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3388) to provide for information on highly automated driving systems to be made available to prospective buyers, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3388 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
The purpose of this Act is to memorialize the Federal role in ensuring the safety of highly automated vehicles as it relates to design, construction, and performance, by encouraging the testing and deployment of such vehicles. 
Section 30103 of title 49, United States Code, is amended— 
this section and shall only apply to highly automated vehicles, vehicles that perform partial driving automation, or automated driving systems first introduced after the effective date of this section. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA ) and the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN ), who is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I would like to thank him for all the work he has done on this bill. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have put enormous work into that, all the members of the committee, and especially Mr. LATTA for his great leadership. Today marks a really important milestone in the pursuit to make our roadways safer and support American leadership in selfdriving innovation. So the SELF DRIVE Act, H.R. 3388, is something we can all support. Simply put, the rapidly advancing technology behind highly autonomous vehicles is stunning. I speak from some experience because a few months ago I got the opportunity to ride in a self driving car with engineers and experienced a vehicle perform without any need for human intervention. Though we can look to a future that fulfills the promise of these innovations, we cannot ignore the current troubling trend in the number of lives that are lost on our roadways in America. Given the latest roadway fatality numbers, this technology is especially needed today. Almost 40,000 people lost their lives on our roads last year. That represents another yearly increase in trafficrelated fatalities. In my own State of Oregon, traffic fatalities were the highest they have seen in 14 years—up 20 percent from the prior year. Statistics tell us 94 percent of accidents relate to human behavior. During our morning commute into work, just look around. We see folks on their phones in the cars next to us doing other things. While the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration can’t write a safety standard to make us all perfect drivers, it can work to avoid lifesaving technologies to avoid collisions. That is part of what this bipartisan legislation will put in place. This bill is also about ensuring America stays a global leader in the development of selfdriving technology. After all, the auto industry is responsible for more than 7 million American jobs nationwide and drives more than $900 billion into the economy each year. We want to see these numbers grow, we want this innovation to occur here, and we want to bring greater traffic safety to our roadways. Additionally, selfdriving cars hold the promise of better access to transportation for our Nation’s 47 million senior citizens, 27 million Americans with severe disabilities, and the many communities across the country underserved by public transportation. For Americans to enjoy all these benefits, we needed to put together a framework that is national and will drive it, and that is what this bill does. I want to commend Mr. LATTA , Ms. SCHAKOWSKY , Mr. U PTON , Mrs. D INGELL , and my friend, FRANK PALLONE , the ranking member on the committee, for all their great work on this legislation. We can be proud of the product the Energy and Commerce Committee has brought to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I urge people to support H.R. 3388. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bipartisan approach to autonomous vehicles reflected in the SELF DRIVE Act. As ranking member of the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, I have been so pleased to be able to work with Chairman LATTA to reach agreements on the legislation before the House today. It is not the bill I think that either one of us would have written on our own, but it does reflect a bipartisan agreement that we reached after months of negotiation, and I appreciate that very much. Autonomous vehicles have great potential to improve safety on our roads by reducing accidents caused by human error, which most accidents are. My goal throughout this process has been to make sure that this technology is deployed safely and that we also advance existing safety technologies. The SELF DRIVE Act lays out a framework for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, 
to promote safe adoption of AVs. Mandatory safety assessment certifications will ensure that NHTSA receives the data that it needs to evaluate safety as autonomous vehicles appear on our roads. Within a year of enactment, NHTSA will lay out a priority plan for what new safety standards need to be written and which existing standards must be updated. In addition, the bill requires manufacturers to write cybersecurity and consumer privacy plans as they develop AV technology. The legislation allows for exemptions to existing vehicle safety standards. For example, there may be some vehicles that really don’t need a steering wheel. It is hard to imagine now. But we ensure that NHTSA explains its process for granting any safety exemptions. The maximum number of exemptions per automobile will scale up incrementally. To receive an exemption, a manufacturer must show equivalent safety, a manufacturer must report crashes involving exempted vehicles, and exempted vehicles must be listed in a public database. This bill also has safety improvements that go beyond autonomous vehicles. NHTSA will work to improve the performance of headlamps. In 2 years, NHTSA will issue a rule requiring an alert system to warn drivers if a child or pet is left in the backseat. Already this year, 37 children have died from heatstroke after being left in hot cars. This hot cars provision, which Congressman TIMRYAN, Congressman PETER KING, and I introduced as a standalone bill, will save lives. A broad range of stakeholders have been involved and will be involved in the future of selfdriving workers. That is why we set up an advisory council which will include industry, academics, labor, State and local government, consumer advocates, and environmental experts. As selfdriving cars are developed, we must examine critical issues. Will seniors and people with disabilities share in the benefits of autonomous vehicles? Ensuring accessibility may require further policy changes. We also need to grapple with the disruption selfdriving cars may cause in employment. Even though this legislation generally excludes commercial vehicles—and additional clarity may be needed—selfdriving cars may displace workers who make their livelihoods behind the wheel. Once the House passes this bill, I look forward to working with stakeholders and our Senate colleagues to send consensus legislation to the President’s desk. I believe we could go further to improve consumer safety and strengthen protections to put consumers in control of their data. We must also keep working to refine the Federal, State, and local roles in ensuring safe roads and protecting access to courts when necessary. Mr. Speaker, today’s vote is the next step in that process. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the SELF DRIVE Act, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, first, let me just thank the gentlewoman from Illinois, the ranking member on the subcommittee, for her hard work on the legislation. I really appreciate it. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 3388, the SELF DRIVE Act, which we advanced out of the Energy and Commerce Committee on a unanimous, bipartisan vote of 54–0 in July. This compromise legislation aims to improve consumer safety by reducing trafficrelated fatalities and injuries, clarify the Federal and State roles, and stimulate job growth and economic opportunities. Many of you have heard these roadway safety statistics, but they again bear repeating. Each year, approximately 6 million Americans are involved in car accidents resulting in nearly 2 million injuries. Ninetyfour percent of the accidents are attributed to human errors or decisions. In 2016 approximately 40,000 people lost their lives on U.S. highways. Sadly, in my home State of Ohio, traffic deaths have been on the rise over the last few years. We have an opportunity today to support and promote the safe testing and deploying of this lifesaving technology. U.S. companies are investing major resources in the research and development of this technology and should not be held up by regulatory barriers that were created when self driving cars were science fiction. We must act, and we must act now. The SELF DRIVE Act establishes a streamlined path for the testing, development, and deployment of selfdriving cars in the United States. While this technology is currently being tested in certain parts of the country, there are limits to who can test and what technology can be used in cars today. Federal motor vehicle safety standards need to be updated because selfdriving cars may not have the traditional steering wheels and brake pedals that all cars have today. Additionally, this legislation maximizes opportunities for research and development here in the United States to create jobs and grow economic opportunities so that the United States can remain a global leader in this industry. With this legislation, innovation can flourish without the heavy hand of government. Finally, this legislation will enhance the ability of our senior citizens, the disability community, and individuals in underserved communities enjoy more mobility and live more independently. This legislation is the first of its kind, focused on the car of the future that is more of a supercomputer on wheels. This issue started with our good friend and colleague, Dr. BURGESS, who held the first disrupter series hearing on selfdriving cars last Congress. Again, we would also not be where we are today if it weren’t for the leadership of Chairperson WALDEN and the great working relationship and cooperation of Ranking Member PALLONE , Ranking Member S CHAKOWSKY , and Ranking Member DINGELL , as well as our many cosponsors. I appreciate their comments, suggestions, and input. We have held multiple hearings, technology showcases, and reallife demonstrations for our committee’s members to learn about the opportunities and challenges presented by self driving cars. I also want to acknowledge the stakeholders who have been willing to work with us. The automotive industry is a competitive and vibrant marketplace and touches every congressional district in the country. b1130 In the process of drafting and marking up this legislation, we had over 300 meetings with automakers, tech companies, suppliers, trade associations, the disability community, senior State transportation leaders, and, last but not least, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Safety should and always will be our number one priority. We have said and will continue to say: Safety first, safety last, safety always. I truly believe this bill will make a real difference for everyday Americans. In closing, I want to thank our great staff for their hard work late nights and weekends to get us where we are to this historic vote. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE ), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I thank him for his support. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3388, the SELF DRIVE Act. I want to start by thanking Chairmen WALDEN and L ATTA , Ranking Member SCHAKOWSKY , and the other members of the Energy and Commerce Committee for all their work to reach a bipartisan agreement on this bill. Selfdriving cars have the potential in the future to reduce deaths and injuries from car crashes, particularly those that result from driver distraction. This bill allows for testing and deployment of selfdriving cars to help the United States reach that potential sooner. This legislation also includes important provisions that ensure safety is the top priority as selfdriving cars are developed. For example, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will be required to issue rules and new safety standards for highly automated vehicles. The auto industry will be required to submit safety assessment certifications that detail how their vehicles 
are tested and function on the road. We also insist that any manufacturer entering this market must have cybersecurity and privacy practices in place before their cars are sold. Selfdriving cars will not come all at once. Human drivers will be on the roads for the foreseeable future. So this bill also contains legislative initiatives geared toward protecting drivers and passengers, including requirements to ensure kids are not forgotten in hot cars and that all new cars have the latest technology in their headlamps. It also ensures NHTSA is able to consider whether a car functions as intended, not just whether it meets a specific standard. We also encourage NHTSA to come up with a plan on how it can alter testing using ranges so that cars cannot be built just to meet a particular test. This bill is not perfect. It is a bipartisan compromise and a product of what we can accomplish when we work together. As this bill moves to the Senate, I remain committed to continuing bipartisan efforts to address any issues and to ensure that safety is not compromised. I want to thank, again, all of the key leaders on both the Democratic and Republican side for making this happen today. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ), chairman of the Energy Subcommittee on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, H.R. 3388, the SELF DRIVE Act. This legislation and technology is, indeed, going to play a very important role in improving motor vehicle safety and addressing the rising number of trafficrelated fatalities. As the birthplace of the automobile industry, my home State of Michigan is a wellknown home to innovative suppliers and manufacturers that make our cars and trucks safer, more efficient, and, yes, more affordable. It is also a nexus of engineering and research talent, which makes it perfect for the development of the next phase of vehicular mobility: autonomous vehicles. It is here. In 2015, more than 35,000 folks lost their lives on U.S. highways. Early estimates indicate that number may have increased to more than 40,000 last year. In Michigan, there were 1,064 traffic facilities, a 7 percent increase over the previous year. NHTSA has found that 94 percent of these fatalities are related to human error. This legislation on autonomous vehicles, which includes the PAVE Act, authored by myself and my good friend from Michigan, DEBBIE DINGELL , will go a long way to taking human error out of driving and making roads safer for every American. Forget about ‘‘The Jetsons.’’ It is over. The future of the automobile is here, and this bill will give the automotive industry the tools it needs to completely revolutionize how we are going to get around for generations to come. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MATSUI ), a member of the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee and a major contributor to this legislation. Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the SELF DRIVE Act. With this legislation, we have the opportunity to unlock autonomous vehicle innovation and help improve the quality of life for millions. Today, so many of our neighbors, friends, and family face mobility challenges. Many seniors and people with disabilities are not able to use a car to do errands, go to doctor appointments, and visit loved ones. For millions of people who travel our roads, this technology has the potential to prevent accidents and save lives. That is why we must act to put policies in place that allow AVs to be tested and deployed, with an emphasis on consumer protections. In my home district of Sacramento and across California, we recognize the promise of AV technology and are developing a pathway for its safe testing and deployment. Sacramento’s ATOS lab aims to foster a publicprivate consortium of government agencies and AV companies by leveraging Sacramento’s 5G network, an ideal location. The legislation we are considering today allows California to continue to lead, while protecting roadway safety. With the SELF DRIVE Act, we are preserving the important AV deployment work happening at the State level and also creating the foundation for a strong Federal framework to build on our progress and protect drivers and pedestrians. I am also pleased that this bill contains language on legislation I introduced, the MORE Act, which ensures technology companies, auto manufacturers, and new market entrants are on a level playing field for testing AVs. Just as the development of the personal computer has revolutionized our daily lives, so, too, will the employment of autonomous vehicle technology. This legislation, which passed the Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously, puts us on a path towards innovation that, up until recently, seemed unimaginable. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we work together to move this legislation forward. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS ), chairman of the Health Subcommittee on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, the country has stood, first, in awe of the power that was unleashed on the TexasLouisiana coast, and then in admiration of constituents up and down the Texas and Louisiana coast as they face this difficulty and work together to get through it. This bill today is also a product of people working together. Through at least two sessions of Congress we have now come with selfdriving vehicle legislation that is going to change our economy. This bill will allow developers room to grow, while making certain that the technology is safe for consumers. This act will create jobs and ensure that we remain the global leader in innovation. Most importantly, the selfdriving vehicle legislation has the ability to save lives. Throughout my life, I have seen the lifesaving effects of advancements in vehicle technology, starting with the seat belt, to the air bag, to antilock brakes. Selfdriving vehicles are the next step in this trajectory. The Energy and Commerce Committee has dedicated a lot to this technology and its ability to save lives, and, certainly, the last term of Congress, the Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade Subcommittee that Mr. LATTA now chairs. I am proud to see the product of our work come to the floor. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ESHOO ), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for yielding and for her leadership and work on the great Energy and Commerce Committee in the House. My congressional district is home to the engineers, innovators, and developers who are pioneering the technologies that are transitioning us to a driverless world. That is why I support H.R. 3388, and it is my hope that the regulatory framework established by this bill is going to ensure that the United States of America is the leader in the world’s next great revolution in transportation. I believe that we are, that we will be, and that this bill boosts the effort. Throughout committee consideration of this bill, I stressed the need for bipartisanship on this issue so that the American people would have confidence in the steps that we were taking. And so it is. It is, I think, in the spirit of the original Federal automotive safety standards that passed Congress nearly unanimously in 1966. This bill was improved significantly in the committee, and the final bill, very importantly, preserves the role that States have played to regulate matters such as vehicle registration, licensing, insurance, and liability, while, at the Federal level, ensuring that manufacturers submit safety certifications to NHTSA, placing the agency on the path toward issuing full safety standards for autonomous vehicles. The bill also includes my language to require a study of the environmental impacts of autonomous vehicles, as well as the intersection between autonomous and electric vehicles. The AV 
revolution is happening on top of the ongoing electrification revolution, and I think the AV advisory council can provide important insight to Congress, States, and localities about how to support growing these fleets. For all these reasons and more, Mr. Speaker, I urge all House Members to support H.R. 3388. I think it deserves unanimous support, as it did in our committee, and that this will be good for America and keep us in a leadership position on the allimportant issues that are established by this bill. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. HARPER ), vice chairman of the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3388, the SELF DRIVE Act. The bipartisan bill we are considering today is vital not only to all Americans, but especially individuals with disabilities. My wife, Sidney, and I have an adult son, Livingston, who has special needs. He wants to go everywhere. He has a job Monday through Friday, but he can’t drive, so he is dependent on his family and friends to get him around. In the disability community, the lack of transportation is the number one obstacle to employment and security in society. I previously introduced the Disability Mobility Advisory Council Act, which creates a forum for individuals with disabilities to work with manufacturers, suppliers, and regulators to identify impediments and ways in which the needs of this community can best be met by selfdriving car technology. I appreciate the chairman including the general intent of my bill in the SELF DRIVE Act. Selfdriving vehicles can open the door for the disability community to access new job markets and opportunities and to have an even more active role in our society. I urge support of this bill. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL ), a member of the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee and someone who has put in a lot of time and effort on this legislation. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman JAN SCHAKOWSKY , for yielding and for her leadership on making this happen, as well as thanking Chairman LATTA , Chairman WALDEN , Ranking Member PALLONE , and my good friend F RED UPTON from Michigan. The hard work here has gotten us to the point where we are today. The SELF DRIVE Act is going to improve our economy and save lives on the road. Passing this bill today means we are one step closer to signing a responsible framework for the deployment of highly automated vehicles into law. It means we are going to improve mobility for seniors and people with disabilities, reduce congestion on the road, improve energy consumption, and, as everyone has said, actually improve safety on the road. b1145 More than 35,000 people died on our roadways. And as you heard Mr. UPTON  say, we are hearing 40,000 selfdriving cars has the promise to save lives when 90 percent of those are by human error, but only if we get it right. And that is why it is so important that we study these issues and do this the right way. Our legislation ensures that safety is at the forefront by requiring manufacturers to submit safety assessment certifications before one selfdriving vehicle hits the road. It also requires that manufacturers, for the very first time, submit a plan for how we will address both cybersecurity and data privacy. It is moving the needle forward on safety while providing a reactive and flexible framework for the regulation of self driving cars. Today we are one step closer to reshaping American innovation for generations to come. We cannot let this opportunity slip by us. It is essential to ensure the future of American innovation because this is fundamentally an issue of American competitiveness. Automated vehicles are going to be developed, whether we want it or not, and it is a question about whether we are going to remain in the driver’s seat and not secede it to China or India or Western Europe. The SELF DRIVE Act steers us in the right direction on these important issues. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ). Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the SELF DRIVE Act. This groundbreaking work of the Energy and Commerce Committee is the first major step toward establishing a clear legal and regulatory framework for autonomous vehicle deployment. Selfdriving cars are going to transform many aspects of American life and our economy. Autonomous vehicle technology will spur job creation while increasing productivity, accessibility, and safety for consumers across the country. The potential benefits are tremendous. Those with limited mobility will have new transportation options, and selfdriving cars can reverse the rising trend of distracted and impaired drivers, road accidents, and highway fatalities. Autonomous vehicles can help turn the tide. Innovators are waiting to jump into this exciting new market. We need to be their partners in this 21st century groundbreaking achievement. I thank Chairman LATTA and Ranking Member SCHAKOWSKY for leading this bipartisan effort through the U.S. House. Let’s drive into the future. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the great State of New York (Ms. CLARKE ), a member of our subcommittee. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3388, the SELF DRIVE Act. As you may know, autonomous vehicles are the wave of the future, and they are here now. As innovative technology for these vehicles develop, our Nation’s transportation system will be transformed, decreasing the number of traffic collisions, enhancing mobility for the elderly, disabled, and poor, and lowering fuel consumption. My constituents in the Ninth Congressional District of New York will benefit greatly from autonomous vehicles, which will allow for smarter, faster, and more fuelefficient travel. I am pleased that proper cybersecurity protections are included in the legislation. As you may know, cybersecurity protections for selfdriving vehicles is of great interest, particularly in today’s environment, to ensure that these vehicles not only meet technological challenges, but there is a plan in place to meet public safety standards and prevent and tackle potential hacks and/or terrorism. I am so pleased that H.R. 3407, the legislation I introduced with Congressman ADAM KINZINGER is included in H.R. 3388. The cybersecurity portion of the bill requires manufacturers to develop a written cybersecurity policy. Within the cybersecurity policy, manufacturers would address the following: one, a process for identifying, assessing, and mitigating reasonable foreseeable vulnerabilities from cyber attacks or unauthorized intrusions; and two, a process for taking preventive and corrective action to mitigate against these vulnerabilities, including incident response plans, intrusion detection, and prevention systems that safeguard key controls, systems, and procedures through testing and/or monitoring. This legislation requires companies to develop a more comprehensive cybersecurity plan, which can mitigate, correct, intersect, and identify imminent threats. Fostering consumer confidence will include ensuring an established system built to protect sensitive information in our technological age. I am pleased to be a Member of this committee. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS ). Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the SELF DRIVE Act, which will improve transportation safety, stimulate economic growth, and ensure we are embracing the full potential of technological advances in the automotive industry with respect to autonomous vehicles. I am especially proud that my bill, the ACCESS Act, has been included in this important legislative package, which ensures that selfdriving cars are 
developed with seniors and the underserved in mind. Approximately 20 percent of Floridians are over the age of 65, and many struggle with simple tasks most of us take for granted, such as getting to work, going to the doctor, taking a trip to the grocery store or across town to visit family. Selfdriving cars hold the power to safely put seniors and our constituents back in the driver’s seat of their lives, providing them with greater independence and mobility. I urge all my colleagues to support the passage of this very important bill. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCNERNEY ), my colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, this has been a bipartisan effort. It has been good. We made some progress. I want to say a few things, though. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the SELF DRIVE Act. This legislation puts us on a path towards safely deploying autonomous vehicles. I am glad to see that it has strong bipartisan support. Autonomous vehicles offer many benefits, including tremendous lifesaving potential. Approximately 40,000 people are killed on our highways every year in deadly automobile accidents. About 3,600 of those accidents took place in my home State of California. AVs can also transform mobility for millions of people who otherwise face difficulty driving, such as seniors and those with disabilities, including 3.8 million veterans in our country living with serviceconnected disabilities. That is more than 17 percent of veterans in this country. AVs can help connect underserved communities, as well as reduce traffic congestion on our roads, and increase our Nation’s productivity and competitiveness in the global economy. While I am glad that we are taking these steps for this legislation today, our work cannot stop here. As the technology evolves, we must ensure that the benefits are being maximized for consumers. This means making sure that the vehicles are safely and appropriately tested, that strong consumer privacy and cybersecurity protections are in place, and that we are fully preparing Americans for the new employment opportunities that this industry will create. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Illinois has 3
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON ). Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, self driving cars, once a providence of science fiction, are quickly becoming a reality. Selfdriving vehicle technology has the potential to increase access to transportation in our rural communities, freedom for those unable to drive today, and improved safety for thousands of Hoosiers and other citizens across the country. Furthermore, development of this innovative technology maintains America’s technological leadership in the world and presents new economic opportunities for our citizens. The SELF DRIVE Act creates a regulatory framework to allow for selfdriving vehicle technology to continue moving forward while also ensuring consumers are protected. I ask my colleagues to join me today and vote in favor of this bipartisan package. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the Congressman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues on the floor of the House dealing with autonomous vehicles. I think this is one of the most important issues that nobody is really focused on. I wish it were not on the suspension calendar and we had a chance to spend several hours discussing it here. What you have done is forge a bipartisan coalition to be able to leapfrog going forward, to be able to not just focus on safety, but how autonomous vehicles have the opportunity to reshape the American landscape dealing with recovering rightofway and being able to have new economic opportunities. But this must be done right. The fact that ‘‘Driver’’ is the number 1 category of employment for men without a college education, means there could be some problems here. If we don’t do it right, we can actually increase congestion rather than decrease it. But I think you have established the framework to allow us to go forward, to be able to capitalize on this innovation, to be able to accelerate American leadership and avoid the problem we had with drones where the FAA was not really capable of dealing with drones which were more like flying cell phones than dealing with jets. You are trying to lay a foundation that I think is going to help us avoid that problem, and it is going to pay dividends for years to come. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. MULLIN ). Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, the House today will vote on an important piece of Federal legislation regarding self driving vehicles that many on this body on both sides of the aisle have worked on. This legislation promises to make roads safer by reducing trafficrelated fatalities and unlock new economic opportunities and jobs in the U.S. It is also vital in our efforts to promote innovation. Industry is driving the development of selfdriving vehicles, but in certain situations, companies building and testing the car of the future may need some flexibility or certainty. With this legislation, I hope the research, development, and testing that is unleashed will stimulate additional knowledge and innovation for passenger motor safety. We, as the government, need to make sure that safety is first and foremost in our consideration. Passing this legislation will help get lifesaving technology to the public, perhaps preventing deaths in the notsonear future. I strongly support this bipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON), the ranking member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the majority and minority of the Energy and Commerce Committee for bringing this unanimous legislation to the floor on selfdriving vehicles, which are revolutionizing the way we conceptualize travel. Selfdriving cars have the potential to lower our infrastructure and mobility costs, enhance safety on our roads, and enhance mobility in our cities. However, like any complex technology, selfdriving cars pose new challenges for the regulatory landscape and our labor markets. That is why I am pleased to support H.R. 3388, the SELF DRIVE Act, which seeks to foster innovation in this space while offering protection for consumers. The SELF DRIVE Act is one of the many important bills that will need to be considered by Congress in order to define Federal and State regulatory roles, provide the U.S. Department of Transportation the tools it needs to update safety standards, and ensure that the American people are not left behind as we transition to a 21st century workforce. Particularly, I am pleased to see that H.R. 3388 allows the creation of the Highly Automated Vehicle Advisory Council.

The SELF DRIVE Act is one of many important bills that will need to be considered by Congress in order to define federal and state regulatory roles, provide the U.S. Department of Transportation the tools it needs to update safety standards, and ensure that the American people are not left behind as we transition to a 21st Century workforce. In particular, I am pleased to see that H.R. 3388 allows for the creation of a Highly Automated Vehicle Advisory Council, which can properly consider the labor and employment issues that may be affected by the deployment of highly automated vehicles. 
I have been working on separate legislation to create a new retraining program for workers who are displaced from their jobs due to the adoption of autonomous vehicle technology. I am very grateful for Representative JOEBARTON and Representative B OBLATTA’Sstaff for working with my office to craft and refine that legislation. I believe that we are getting closer to a final product, which will ultimately recognize the inevitable changes to the labor market that this country will experience in the face of automated technologies. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 3388. I know that members of the Energy & Commerce Committee have worked tirelessly to bring this measure to the floor after hundreds of meetings with relevant stakeholders. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and look forward to working cooperatively with members on other bills that will address other aspects of selfdriving vehicles and the ramifications that will have on our economy and our country. b1200 Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. MIMIWALTERS ). Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3388, the SELF DRIVE Act, which will help advance the deployment of selfdriving vehicles by allowing testing of this lifechanging technology. Back home in Orange County, long commutes and congestion are a way of life. Sadly, traffic accidents, often fatal, are also a daily occurrence in my district and across the country. Some predict selfdriving vehicles could save 300,000 lives each decade. In Orange County alone, the deployment of this technology could save the lives of 150 people every year. I am especially proud that a piece of legislation I drafted, the MORE Act, is included in the SELF DRIVE Act. The MORE Act will help advance selfdriving vehicle technology because it allows new entrants to the automobile industry, such as tech and ridehailing companies, to test this lifesaving technology on public roads. The SELFDRIVE Act has the potential to make our roads safer, alleviate congestion, and improve mobility for seniors and individuals with disabilities. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN), the sponsor and my partner on the HOT CARS Act, included in this legislation. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I also thank the chairman from Bowling Green, Ohio, home of the Harvard of the Midwest, Bowling Green State University, and Ranking Member SCHAKOWSKY for including the language, as she said, for the HOT CARS Act. We lose about 37 children a year who accidentally get left in the backseat of a car when a parent or grandparent accidentally forgets that they are there, they change their routine, and 37 kids a year pass away. It is one of the most tragic circumstances we have to deal with in this country. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY  and I, along with PETER KINGfrom New York, have championed this bill. I just want to say thank you for including it in here. These cars get hot fast, up to 125 degrees. This allows the companies now to put sensors in there. When we leave our keys in the car or when we leave our lights on, we get a ding or a bell. Now we will know if someone is in the backseat. There will be an alert that the car companies will put into the cars to allow us to recognize and prevent 37 deaths a year. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for working in a bipartisan way, and thank Ranking Member SCHAKOWSKY  for her leadership. She has been championing this a long time, and I appreciate it. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. COSTELLO ). Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the SELF DRIVE Act. With over 127,000 vehicle crashes in Pennsylvania in 2015, advances in deploying selfdriving technology are critical to helping make our roads safer. Importantly, selfdriving cars can also increase mobility for seniors and individuals with disabilities and can reduce carbon emissions. As with many innovations, we must recognize the importance of safety, including cybersecurity vulnerabilities, when it comes to selfdriving cars. Provisions of my cybersecurity legislation, which were included as part of the bill we are voting on today, directs the Secretary of Transportation to create a Federal advisory council on cybersecurity. The council will be responsible for gathering information and providing advice related to the cybersecurity of selfdriving vehicles, and it will ensure both public and private sector stakeholders are communicating about cybersecurity concerns before they become a crisis. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman WALDEN, Chairman L ATTA , and staff for their work to bring this bill to the floor. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me just say some thank yous. I thank the chairman of our subcommittee, Chairman LATTA , for his great work. I also thank Chairman WALDEN , and, of course, all of the staff on his side of the aisle for their work to help us reach this bipartisan agreement. I especially want to thank them for the inclusion of the HOT CARS legislation. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member PALLONE on our side and also thank Michelle Ash, Lisa Goldman, Caroline ParisBehr, and my staff, Matt Hayward, for their great work on the subcommittee on this legislation. We will continue working together to send consensus legislation. I appreciate the opportunity to work with Chairman LATTA and to get this to the floor today as a suspension bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman, the ranking member on the subcommittee, for all of her hard work on this legislation. Again, we wouldn’t be here without the bipartisanship that we had on this piece of legislation. Also, again, I want to thank our staff. There were a lot of weekends and nights that they put in to make sure that we got this bill to where we are today. But, again, as has been mentioned today, we have been talking about what this legislation is going to do. We have been looking at safety, cybersecurity, privacy, making sure that some folks in the community right now who aren’t able to get out, some of our senior population, and those with disabilities, have the ability to be able to get around to go to jobs and go to the grocery store. The legislation has been a culmination of a lot of work over two sessions. Again, I want to thank Dr. BURGESS for his hard work that he did in the last Congress as the chairman of the subcommittee. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3388, the SELF DRIVE Act. Connected and automated vehicles are a rapidly evolving technology that are novel today, but will be a reality tomorrow. This legislation will provide the auto industry, consumers, and policymakers with the certainty they need to advance automated vehicle technology. Automated vehicles have the potential to increase safety, improve mobility, and decrease congestion while improving the efficiency of our transportation network. As the cochairman of the Congressional Unmanned Systems Caucus and an engineer, I have for the past three years been convening automated vehicle stakeholders to discuss the policy issues related to the development and deployment of these new technologies. In addition, I authored the Future TRIP Act during the 114th Congress. Key provisions of that bill, including the establishment of a regional transportation center to study automated vehicles were passed into law in the FAST Act. It is imperative that we maintain the United States’ manufacturing. I commend my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for their bipartisan work on this important legislation. The SELF DRIVE Act includes language will promote industry growth by preventing a potentially stifling patchwork of differing local regulations. By asserting the authority of the federal government to regulate these vehicles and corresponding safety standards, the Committee has struck the right balance by allowing states to retain their traditional roles in driver licensing, insurance, and vehicle registration in a way that does not impede innovation. In addition, I am pleased that the bill enables the Department of Transportation to review the vehicle systems through the Safety Assessment Letter process. 
Automated vehicles are highly complex, and present a number of equally complex policy considerations. While this bill is a significant step forward in defining the federal government’s role in this emerging technology, I believe there is more work to be done with respect to ensuring that NHTSA has appropriate resources to carry out the federal role in oversight and regulation, and to ensuring the privacy of consumers’ data. Data sharing between government and industry holds the possibility of improving safety operations and performance, but must be a collaborative partnership, and must protect consumers’ personally identifiable data. For that reason, I have an amendment that has been made in order to the Fiscal Year 2018 Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development appropriations bill, that we will consider later today. The amendment will provide the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration with an additional $9 million for the Salaries and Expenses account. These funds will enable the agency to expand its workforce, define new testing protocols as the technology emerges, and better partner with industry and state and local governments to conduct adequate oversight. In addition, I continue to have concerns about the collection, use, and privacy of consumers’ data. A recent report issued at the direction of myself and my colleague, Congresswoman Comstock, the Government Accountability Office found while nearly all of the major auto manufacturers now offer vehicles with connected technologies, NHTSA has not clearly defined its roles and responsibilities as they relate to the privacy of vehicle data, making it difficult for NHTSA to coordinate with other federal agencies to effectively oversee these emerging technologies. We still have important issues to consider, including insurance, cybersecurity, and data sharing. I look forward to continuing to collaborate with my colleagues to examine this evolving industry, and defining the federal government’s role in promoting industry while protecting the public. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3388, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, regarding the authority of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over highly automated vehicles, to provide safety measures for such vehicles, and for other purposes.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
MAKING SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR DISASTER RELIEF The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, the unfinished business is the vote on the motion to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H.

Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘Yea’’ on rollcall vote No. 441. Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, due to a delayed flight I was unable to return to D.C. in time for the first round of voting. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 441 (H. Res. 502). 
Ms. D EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, today I missed rollcall vote No. 441 due to family commitments. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘aye’’ to provide necessary relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey. 
b1415 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. KATKO ) at 2 o’clock and 15 minutes p.m. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of H.R. 3354, the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, also known as the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act of 2018. The rule provides for 2 hours of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us is the second installment of the House’s effort to pass all 12 appropriations bills on the floor for the first time since 2006. The overall package will consider the remaining eight bills, covering $416.3 billion in total spending. It represents many months of work by the Appropriations Committee. Today’s rule covers four divisions of the bill: the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act; the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act; the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act; and the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. Together, these four divisions encompass $168.2 billion of discretionary Federal spending. This represents a decrease of $7.8 billion from fiscal year 2017, as Congress seeks to fulfill its obligation to the American people to be fiscally responsible stewards of the taxpayers’ hard earned money. Most importantly, it represents the next step in fulfilling the greatest responsibility we have as legislators: to fund the Federal Government and keep it open each year to provide our constituents the services they deserve while ensuring that we appropriately prioritize where and how to spend taxpayer dollars. Mr. Speaker, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies division will provide approximately $20 billion in appropriations, a decrease of $870 
million from fiscal year 2017. The division will fund critical programs for farmers and ranchers, which is of critical importance to my home State of Oklahoma. The bill also supports conservative priorities, including language rolling back regulations that harm businesses, industries, farming and ranching operations, and rural and urban communities alike. In particular, the bill includes language allowing schools to get waivers from particularly problematic Obama administration regulations governing school lunches, and prevents the Commodities Futures Trading Commission from imposing harmful de minimis levels of trading activity that would force thousands of end users to comply with onerous regulatory requirements. The bill also includes language changing the Food and Drug Administration’s predicate date rules for premium cigars, ecigarettes, and vaping products, thereby preventing the FDA from regulating these industries out of existence. There is much to like in the Agriculture Appropriations division, and I look forward to considering the bill on the floor. On the security side of the ledger, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations division provides $44.3 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion over fiscal year 2017. Of importance, the bill provides $7 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an increase of $620 million. These funds will be used to enforce immigration laws and combat illegal immigration, which our constituents have repeatedly told us they oppose. The bill provides $13.8 billion for Customs and Border Patrol, an increase of $1.6 billion, to ensure the continued security of our border. It also provides $1.6 billion for physical barrier construction on the Southern border, thus fulfilling the first step of one of President Trump’s key promises. It provides $10.5 billion for the Coast Guard and supports FEMA’s disaster relief fund at $7.3 billion. As with the earlier security appropriations package the House passed at the end of July, the funds in this division will help ensure America’s national security and go a long way towards funding key Member priorities. The State and Foreign Operations Appropriations division provides $47.4 billion, a decrease of $10 billion from fiscal year 2017. Even with this decrease, the committee has funded key priorities. Security assistance is funded at $8.8 billion, and full funding is provided for battling international organized crime, antiterrorism programs, and combating cybercrime. The bill also fully funds the $3.1 billion Memorandum of Understanding with Israel. The Appropriations Committee has prioritized programs of importance and deprioritized programs that are not in the best interests of the United States, such as reducing funding for the U.N. by $939 million, eliminating all funding for UNESCO, and eliminating funding for the Global Climate Change Initiative. In producing this division, the Appropriations Committee made difficult choices about the Nation’s priorities, and made them well, and ensured that taxpayer dollars are going to the most important, critical, and efficient programs. Finally, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations division provides $56.5 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion over fiscal year 2017. That number does not include $45 billion also authorized to be spent by the highway trust fund for America’s highways. Of note, the bill provides $16.6 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration, an increase of $153 million, to maintain and promote air travel and security. This sum includes $1 billion for so called NextGen for more efficient air traffic control, and $162 million for the contract tower program, a crucial safety net that covers many districts across the country, including facilities like Westheimer Airport in Norman, Oklahoma, as well as towers in Lawton and Ardmore in my own home district. It provides $38.3 billion in net discretionary funding to Housing and Urban Development. Critically, it sustains Section 8 and Public and Native American housing programs at $27.5 billion. It also includes increases in funding for programs benefiting vulnerable citizens, including $573 million for housing for the elderly, an increase of $70.6 million over fiscal year 2017, and $47 million for housing for Persons with Disabilities, an increase of $800,000 over fiscal year 2017. In all, THUD Appropriations covers important priorities and ensures that our Nation’s housing and transportation infrastructure will be adequately funded to meet our needs. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill. The package before us represents a fulfillment of our most important responsibility as Members of Congress, and provides appropriate funding in four areas: Agriculture; State and Foreign Operations, Homeland Security, and Transportation and Urban Development. I applaud my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their months of work in making this bill a reality, and I cheer their efforts on moving forward to the completion of the fiscal year 2018 appropriations process. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1430 Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have nothing but the highest respect for my colleague from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), and I know he wants this House to run better. But the fact of the matter is, I feel bad that he has to defend this lousy, restrictive, indefensible process. As I said last night in the Rules Committee, regular order in this House is dead. The current Republican leadership has made it very clear that they have nothing but contempt for regular order, and today’s appropriations package is only another example of that fact. Instead of considering bills one by one, and allowing thoughtful debate and Member input, Republican leaders decided to call up eight appropriation bills all at once this week, and even set amendment deadlines while Members were back in their districts for the August work period. Last night, in the Rules Committee, Republicans blocked 229 amendments from even coming to the floor on the four bills we are talking about today alone. Those are Democratic and Republican ideas that won’t be heard and won’t be debated. Who knows how many more they will block on the next set of appropriation bills? That is not the open process that we were promised by Speaker RYAN. That is not regular order, my friends. What is even worse than this terrible process is the substance of the bills that are being brought before us. They are filled with funding cuts and poison pill riders that attack women’s health, attack poor people, attack healthcare rights; repeal important financial reforms that protect our constituents and our economy; undermine the Affordable Care Act; make our land, air, and water dirtier; make our roads less safe; and undermine important civil rights protections. I could go on and on and on and on. These bills are political documents, Mr. Speaker. They are red meat for the Republican base which, I think, is at around 15 percent of the American people the last time I checked. That is right, Mr. Speaker, the majority’s ideas are so unpopular that over three quarters of the American people disapprove of what they are doing here today. That is not coming from any liberal or leftwing source. That poll was released last week by FOX News, you know, the network that you guys always watch. We all know we will need a continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown on October 1, so why are we wasting the House’s time on this partisan exercise when we should be dealing with the CR? And oh, yes, we need to raise the debt ceiling, pass a budget, continue to fund hurricane relief, and so much more we need to do. Mr. Speaker, I am sick and tired of playing to the extremes. I am sick and tired of this President picking a fight with a different group of people every week, constantly trying to divide 
Americans, rather than unite us for the common good. And the latest target are the DREAMers. The DREAMers are our coworkers, our relatives, our neighbors, and our children’s classmates. They have lived nearly their entire lives in America. They are part of the very fabric of our country. The decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, is a cruel betrayal of their trust in the United States. It needlessly and stupidly robs us of the enormous talents, hard work, and ingenuity of these 800,000 young people. Ending DACA is a loselose proposition for America and for us all. President Trump vowed to show great heart in his decision and declared that DREAMers could rest easy. That is a lie, and that is a betrayal. And shame on the Republican leadership of this House that has avoided making DACA a permanent program for nearly 7 years. Shame on the Republican Party for voting against the DREAM Act in 2010, even though it ultimately passed the House. Shame on the Republicans in the Senate for blocking cloture in 2010, when it was clear that there were plenty of votes to pass the DREAM Act then. Shame on the Republican leadership of this House for not making DACA a permanent law when President Obama first initiated the program in 2012. Shame on the House Republican leadership for failing to take up the Senatepassed comprehensive immigration bill for the past 4 years, which included DACA and a pathway to permanent residency and citizenship for the DREAMers and so many other immigrants caught in legal limbo in our country. Shame on the Republican leadership for being such political cowards that they have failed time and time again to actually demonstrate leadership and resolve these problems. 800,000 young people, who are totally American in every way that matters, put their trust in the United States Government and in us here in this Congress, not just to protect them, but to be proud of them. They have been cruelly betrayed. The memo issued yesterday by the Department of Homeland Security even says that they should be prepared to pack their bags and be deported to their countries of origin. But, Mr. Speaker, the simple truth is, America is their home. It is unconscionable that the President pardoned radical racist Sheriff Arpaio, who actually is a criminal, while punishing 800,000 lawabiding, hardworking DREAMers. I stand with the CEO of Microsoft and hundreds of other business leaders who said to the President: ‘‘To deport a DREAMer, you’ll have to go through us.’’ I stand with the thousands of religious leaders, college and university presidents, mayors, State attorneys general, and civic leaders who demand that we reject the President’s decision and have Congress pass the DREAM Act immediately. This Congress cannot and must not continue to fail these 800,000 young people. This morning, this House passed emergency aid for Hurricane Harvey. A DREAMer died in Houston attempting to rescue victims of the floodwaters. Another DREAMer, who is a Houston paramedic, and who worked night and day in rescue and relief efforts, just found out yesterday that his country, the only country he has ever known, has turned its back on him. Well, I refuse to turn my back. Mr. Speaker, we all know that the DREAMers need a permanent legislative fix. We can do that this very day. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative ROYBAL  ALLARD ’s bipartisan, bicameral bill, the DREAM Act. It is time to do what is right. You know, earlier today, Speaker RYANsaid: Well, we have time to work this out. Really? The Speaker seems totally content to have 800,000 people continue to live with uncertainty and fear. I think that that is sad and that is cruel. He also said: We need to develop some sort of compromise. I don’t know what he is thinking about. Maybe he is thinking about trying to add more border security money or add this stupid wall that the President keeps on talking about. Well, here’s the deal. There is nothing to compromise on. You either support the DREAMers or you don’t. They are not political pawns. They are people like you and me and our kids. They deserve better from us. Stop screwing around with their lives. Defeat the previous question. We can pass the DREAM Act today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to begin by discussing process with my good friend from Massachusetts, where I think he makes some good points, but I think he fails to recognize the progress that this bill represents. My good friend knows, because we have the privilege of working together on the Rules Committee, I have thought for many years, frankly, that we needed to get back to regular order. I remind this House the last time we actually operated under it in an appropriations process was in 2006. My friends were actually in the majority when we got rid of open rules on appropriations bills. My friends never brought all 12 appropriations bills to the floor and where they were subject to amendments by various Members. I would agree with my friend, this is not a perfect process that we have. If I had my way, we would go back to the way we operated in 2006, before the last Democratic majority, actually bring the bills down individually and, frankly, give every Member an open shot at amendment. I think that is the appropriate way to proceed. Again, my friends thought differently when they were in the majority and never made a move to restore regular order—quite the opposite. We have actually fought to do that. We did have a period of open rules on appropriations bills. We didn’t get every bill down here, I regret to say, but we got quite a few of them down. But my friends decided they would engage in poison pill tactics. I regret, honestly, personally, that my conference gave into that; were more worried about casting tough votes. I think you are sent here to cast tough votes. So I will make this commitment to my friend. I will continue to work with him and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who would like to return to that process. However, I do recognize this is significant progress toward doing that. This is the first time, since 2006, that all 12 bills, in one form or another, will reach this floor, and, frankly, every single Member has been free to offer amendments on any portion of those 12 bills that they care to. Now, not all of them were made in order by the Rules Committee, and I would hope we get past that again some day. But, again, before my friends decry that too much, they need to remember the role they played in actually getting us out of that process. I also would like to talk just briefly with my friend about his thoughts about DACA, and I am sure we will have a good discussion on that in the course of the day, and, honestly, I think the discussion is helpful. But I think the President of the United States did the right thing when, number one, he recognized that he does not have the constitutional authority, something even his predecessor wondered about, to actually engage in law and put this issue back in the hands of the Congress. The Congress now has 6 months to deal with it. The Speaker has assured us that we will do that. I think the appropriate way to proceed is to have the committee of jurisdiction actually hold hearings and move forward, but we will see which way we go. But I think there is a better chance for a longterm solution, as even my friend agrees, if we have a legislative fix to the problem. I think that will involve some giveandtake, but my hope is we will end up at a place where all parties are satisfied. But we will see. That is what the legislative process is all about. Final point to make, Mr. Speaker, I think we need to recognize that what we are debating on here today, in terms of these four appropriations 
bills, and we will have another tranche of appropriations bills down here later, is actually a process. What we are really doing today is defining the position of the majority party as to where it stands on funding the government. I don’t expect my friends to agree with that. There will be elements of these bills that they agree with without a doubt. I don’t think they will oppose a lot of things that we do in regard to THUD, or in regard to some of these other various programs that we will deal with. But at the end of the day—and my side needs to recognize this—we are going to end up in a negotiation with the United States Senate and the administration some time probably after the 1st of October, and that negotiation has to be bipartisan. As my friends know, the other body requires 60 votes, and that would mean there has to be Democratic participation. And quite frankly, the appropriations bills that have moved across the floor here in fiscal year 2015, fiscal year 2016, fiscal year 2017, have all been bipartisan. They have all been the product of negotiations. At the end of the day—and I remind my friends, in May, a majority of them actually voted in favor of the omnibus spending bill for FY 2017 in the House and in the Senate, as did, by the way, a majority of Republicans in the House and Senate, and President Trump signed it. So we know how this process ends, and we know how to make it work appropriately. This is simply another step in the process. It is my hope that, at the end of the day, we arrive at a bicameral, bipartisan process that actually funds the government, and we are able to accomplish, in concert with one another, things that we think are important to the American people. I have a great deal of confidence we will get there because that is what we have done the last 3 years. We are actually doing it a little better this year. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say to my good friend from Oklahoma, who I respect a great deal, that if he wants to defend this process, he can go right ahead and do so. But I think most people watching this, the fact that two thirds of all discretionary Federal spending is going to be decided in, like, a week’s time, I don’t think is a good process, and I don’t think it is one that the American people have much confidence in. I don’t think it is reasonable to expect that any Member, really, has read all 1,305 pages of the eight bills that my friend is bringing to the floor, and I am not sure everybody has had time to read all the 970 amendments that were proposed—many of them that were not made in order by the Rules Committee. So this is not a process I think anybody wants to defend. The final point I want to make with regard to the President’s decision on DACA, as the gentleman knows, this Congress and the previous Congresses could have acted on this any time they wanted to. When the Democrats were in control here in the House, we did. We passed the DREAM Act. Unfortunately, many of you wouldn’t support it, but it actually passed the House, and we had Republican obstructionism in the Senate. Now, if you want a legislative fix, we have the solution for you. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question, and we will bring up Ms. ROYBAL ALLARD ’s bill to pass the DREAM Act. We will get this done today. We will actually have a day of consequence where we are doing something to help people in this country. So, Mr. Speaker, as I said, I am going to ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question. We will then offer Representative ROYBAL ALLARD ’s bipartisan, bicameral bill, H.R. 3440, the DREAM Act. b1445 The legislation would help thousands of young people like the ones whose heroic stories my colleagues will highlight today and who are Americans in every way except on paper. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ROYBAL ALLARD ), the ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Speaker, the President’s decision to rescind DACA brings heartbreak and fear to hundreds of thousands of young DREAMers who, regardless of their immigration status, are American in every way. The President’s senseless and cruel action is upending their lives and the lives of their families, and it is sending a chilling message to our immigrant communities. It is unbelievable that we first introduced legislation to help DREAMers in 2001. That is 16 years ago. The fight to protect DREAMers has gone on for far too long. Defeating the previous question will enable us, today, to vote on the DREAM Act of 2017, which is a bipartisan, bicameral bill that will protect our Nation’s DREAMers once and for all. The fact is this is our chance, as Members of Congress, to fulfill our responsibility on this serious issue. For those of my colleagues who say they support the DREAMers but that they believe that DACA is unconstitutional, this is your opportunity to help the DREAMers through the legislative process. The DREAMers did not choose to circumvent American immigration laws, and they should not be punished for something they are not responsible for. Today, my Republican colleagues can provide relief to these young people by voting to bring the DREAM Act for a vote. Protecting DREAMers is not only a moral issue, it is also an economic issue. The President’s decision to end DACA strikes a vicious blow to our economy. Forcing hundreds of thousands of young people out of the workforce will disrupt businesses across our Nation. California, alone, stands to lose $11.6 billion annually, and the U.S. stands to lose a cumulative $460 billion in GDP over the next decade if DREAMers are removed from our economy. As Members of Congress, we represent the American people, and the vast majority of Americans, regardless of their political affiliation, support our Nation’s DREAMers. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question so we can pass the bipartisan, bicameral DREAM Act today to enable our DREAMers to continue contributing to our Nation without fear of deportation from the only country they know as home.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Time will be deducted from the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from 18 evangelical religious leaders and other religious leaders in opposition to President Trump’s decision to end DACA. 
SEPTEMBER 4, 2017. A LETTER FROM FAITH LEADERS AND  EVANGELICALS FOR BIBLICAL IMMIGRATION  (.COM) President DONALD J. T RUMP , The White House, Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL , Speaker of the House PAULRYAN. HONORABLE PRESIDENT TRUMP , M AJORITY  LEADER MCCONNELL AND SPEAKER RYAN: We agree that immigration reform and DACA are difficult subjects. God loves the foreigner. Indeed, God loves us all. It takes time to discern the balance of mercy and justice by which a nation thrives. It is easier to speak publically of mercy, as we, and many, do. And, while loving mercy, who will also stand for justice to those citizens who cannot find a job due to cheaper foreign labor? Who will speak of the real cost of illegal immigration to our states? And while many noncitizens are good neighbors, who will stand for justice for Americans victimized by people here illegally who do not uphold our values and laws? And who will prevent more needless crime and death? The Church is called to serve all people, and our Government leaders are elected to defend and uphold the Constitution and the rule of law. Though there are tragic stories on every side of illegal migration, for our elected officials, responsibility to oaths must prevail. Law and order sustain stability and peace. A nation of wise rule grows strong enough to sustain care for the vulnerable in our midst. While some faith groups use selective Bible words for open borders and amnesty, we consider the whole counsel of Scripture. We find that the Bible does not teach open borders, but wise welcome. We are to welcome the lawful foreigner, who, like a convert, comes as a blessing (eg.s Ruth and Rahab) We also find Nehemiah building walls to protect citizens from harm. In Isaiah 1, we see God condemning the destruction of borders and indigenous culture. All lives matter. The lives of North, Central and South Americans matter. The lives of Africans, Asians, Europeans and people from the Middle East matter. In Scripture, we learn that God placed us each in a family, a land, an epic story of creation, the fall and redemption. The Bible envisions a world of beautiful and unique nations, not a stateless ‘‘open society’’ run by global oligarchs. Each of us is called to be a blessing where God has placed us in the world. In policy decisions ahead, while treating undocumented people kindly, we ask that you would first and foremost honor often forgotten American citizens whose families have served our nation for many generations, and the patient people who have applied lawfully to come here and to become citizens of the United States. These lives also matter. These people also dream. Gratefully Yours, Names are listed alphabetically and for identification purposes only.

Challenges have been brought against the original DACA program, including in the Fifth Circuit, but none have succeeded. On the other hand, in a case relating to Arizona’s efforts to deny drivers’ licenses to DACA recipients, the Ninth Circuit stated that it is ‘‘well settled that the [DHS] Secretary can exercise deferred action.’’ Ariz Dream Act Coalition v Brewer, 855 F.3d 957, 967–968 (9th Cir. 2017). The court also observed that ‘‘several prior administrations have adopted programs, like DACA, to prioritize which noncitizens to remove.’’ Id. at 976. As the Fifth Circuit was careful to point out in its ruling in the Texas case, the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (‘‘DAPA’’) initiative that was struck down is ‘‘similar’’ but ‘‘not identical’’ to DACA. Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 174 (5th Cir. 2015). Indeed, as DHS Secretary Kelly pointed out in a press conference the day after his June 15 memorandum explaining that DACA would continue, DACA and DAPA are ‘‘two separate issues,’’ appropriately noting the different populations addressed by each program. Notably, only a fraction of the 25 states which joined with Texas in the DAPA case before the Supreme Court chose to co sign the letter threatening to challenge DACA. Among other significant differences, DACA has been operative since 2012 while DAPA never went into effect. More than three quarters of a million young people, and their employers, among others, have concretely benefitted from DACA, for up to five years. The interests of these young people in continuing to participate in DACA and retain the benefits that flow from DACA raise particular concerns not implicated in the pre implementation challenge to DAPA. Further, the Fifth Circuit placed legal significance on the ‘‘economic and political magnitude’’ of the large number of immigrants who were affected by DAPA, Texas, 809 F.3d at 181; thus, it is notable that many fewer people have received DACA (about 800,000) than would have been eligible for DAPA (up to 4.3 million). One additional, but related, issue concerns DHS’s current practices regarding DACA recipients. A number of troubling incidents in recent months raise serious concerns over whether DHS agents are adhering to DACA guidelines and your repeated public assurances that DACAeligible individuals are not targets for arrest and deportation. We urge you to ensure compliance with DACA and consistent enforcement practices towards Dreamers. Mr. President, now is the time to affirm the commitment you made, both to the ‘‘incredible kids’’ who benefit from DACA and to their families and our communities, to handle this issue ‘‘with heart.’’ You said Dreamers should ‘‘rest easy.’’ We urge you to affirm America’s values and tradition as a nation of immigrants and make clear that you will not only continue DACA, but that you will defend it. The cost of not doing so would be too high for America, the economy, and for these young people. For these reasons, we urge you to maintain and defend DACA, and we stand in support of the effort to defend DACA by all appropriate means. Sincerely, Xavier Becerra, California Attorney General; George Jepsen, Connecticut Attorney General; Matthew Denn, Delaware Attorney General; Karl A. Racine, District of Columbia Attorney General; Douglas S. Chin, Hawaii Attorney General; Lisa Madigan, Illinois Attorney General; Tom Miller, Iowa Attorney General; Janet T.

Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ). Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, how did we get here? In December of 2010, the House passed the DREAM Act right here on this floor. Almost all of the Democrats voted for it, and a handful of Republicans, too. The goal was to legalize immigrants who had grown up in the U.S., achieved education, and had no way of getting legalization status unless Congress took action. Way back in 2001, I had introduced the first bill to legalize immigrant youth. So it took almost 10 years until it passed in the House in 2010. And later that same week, there was a vote in the Senate. Fiftyfive out of 100 Senators voted for cloture on the DREAM Act to legalize the status of undocumented immigrant youth. We know you need 60 votes in the Senate to move something forward, so the DREAM Act was blocked, even though it had a majority of the votes of the Senators because of a filibuster led by Republicans. b1515 Not just any Republican led the filibuster, but the leader of the opposition to the DREAM Act was none other than the Attorney General of the United States, Jeff Sessions. So yesterday the President, unwilling to go out to the cameras and announce he was killing the DACA program himself, sent Jeff Sessions out to tell 800,000 immigrants: We don’t want you here anymore. Included in that announcement was a halfhearted sales pitch for Congress to pass legislation. But remember, when Sessions had a chance to do exactly that, he led the fight to stop it. That is hypocrisy on steroids. So President Obama finally took the only action he could take 2 years later and crafted a narrowly defined program call DACA that has never been successfully challenged in court. DACA recipients are teachers, nurses, and one is even a Chicago policeman who straps on his gun and badge to protect people every day in my city of Chicago. During Hurricane Harvey, DREAMers with DACA were first responders and volunteers and those who gave their lives to save others, like Alonso Guillen of Lufkin, Texas. Look, we want a clean DREAM Act, an up or down vote. Democrats, let’s be clear. This is a crisis that requires swift passage of legislation to fix it, as big a priority as anything else we need to pass this month. Our votes are needed on the debt ceiling, Democrats, and on this bill and on the CR. What are we getting for our votes, Democrats? When the CEO of Microsoft says that you can only take my DREAMers with DACA by coming first through me, that is a challenge to every policymaker in this Chamber and especially to my Democratic colleagues. When will we throw down and say: No, you cannot have our votes unless you give us the DREAM Act? When, Democrats? When will we say: You cannot have our vote unless we can bring 800,000 young lives along with us? When, Democrats? Let’s demand a vote on the DREAM Act. We can pass it right here, right now, and give our young people, the future of our Nation, the safety and security they need and deserve to contribute to the United States of America. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. It is the only country they have known. They are American in everything but a piece of paper, and we should all be ashamed of ourselves by not allowing a vote. 800,000 young people, once, twice, three times registered with the government, and what do they get? Six months. Pack your bags and leave. They have pledged allegiance to only one flag, the United States of America and this country. This cowardly action turns its back on them. I say no CR. I say no debt ceiling. Let’s have a vote first on the DREAM Act. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I don’t think my colleague is confused about where he is on this issue, and I don’t think any amount of talking on the floor is going to change his mind on this issue. I would say that the underlying bill, which makes in order over 140 amendments so that we can have a conversation about different ideas and different outcomes and lets the people’s voice be heard, is the right way to craft legislation. With the support of this body and this bill, we will move on to that underlying debate, and we will have that voice heard. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the gentleman neglected to mention that there were 227 amendments, Democratic and Republican amendments, that were denied yesterday. The frustration that we have over here is that we are going through an exercise with these appropriations bills knowing that they are going nowhere and that we are going to have to deal with a shortterm continuing resolution, 
and there will probably be a big omnibus that will be passed at the end and which might not reflect any of the deliberations that we are doing on the appropriations matters in the next couple of days. It is a little bit frustrating because we have other things to do. What we are saying is let’s make this week a week of consequence, and let us bring up the DREAM Act. President Trump did something horrible yesterday. He basically pulled the rug right from underneath 800,000 good, decent, and lawabiding people, citizens in this country, good people who are American in every way except they don’t have a piece of paper. They were brought here, in many instances, when they were infants. They now have businesses, are leading relief efforts in Texas, and serve in our military. And he pulled the rug right from underneath them all. It is a cruel, awful, and nasty thing to do. Listening to the rationale of this White House, this kind of schizophrenic tirade that we have seen unfold where 1 minute he is against the DREAMers, then he loves the DREAMers, then he is against the DREAMers, then he loves them, all of this kind of rambling that we have seen out of the White House hasn’t changed the fact that he has thrown 800,000 lives in turmoil. People now have to live in fear and in uncertainty, and it is just a rotten thing to do. What we are saying is let’s fix it. My friends say they didn’t like what President Obama did through executive order. We tried to legislate. We did, in 2010, pass the DREAM Act here in the House. Republicans did their best to make sure we couldn’t bring it to the floor in the Senate, but we tried that way. Then President Obama, thank goodness, stepped up to the plate and put forward an executive order which has protected 800,000 people. My friends say that they like the DREAMers and they want to help them. Well, let’s help them. You guys are in charge. You can do anything you want. All we are asking for is a vote— that is it, a vote. The way we can ensure a vote is to defeat the previous question so we can bring up the DREAM Act. If you don’t have the courage to bring it up yourself, then vote to defeat the previous question and we will bring it to the floor. We will have the debate, and you can vote any way you want. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President, and to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to thank you for that admonition. Mr. Speaker, these are very serious issues that my friends on the other side were trying to have a debate on the appropriations bills. My friends have a very legitimate concern about an immigration issue, characterized with terms like ‘‘cruel’’ and ‘‘nasty’’ and ‘‘rotten’’ and ‘‘no courage.’’ I would say to my friends we can try to belittle each other into a compromise. I have not seen that work before. We can try to insult each other into a solution. I have not seen that work before. I have seen my colleagues coming down the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, one after the other to tell a compelling story about a man or a woman they know who they believe would make an amazing United States citizen, who they believe would add value to our communities, and who they believe is serving admirably in our church and is working admirably in our community. They have a story to tell, and they should tell it. Guess what? I have got a few of those stories to tell myself. But I would say to my friends, I don’t believe, Mr. Speaker, that the insults and the acrimony are going to get us where any of us wants to be. For my friends who believe differently, I would tell you I think we have tried that path before, and it didn’t take us where we want to go. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that my friend doesn’t like words like ‘‘cruel’’ when it comes to the President’s actions with regard to the DREAMers. A man named Jesus Contreras, a Houston paramedic, helped rescue flood victims after the storm, Harvey, hit Texas. Now he faces deportation if stripped of his DACA protections. I don’t know what you call that. I call it cruel. I can’t imagine why anybody would want to take away this man’s ability to be able to live his life in the only country he knows, a man who is saving lives. This is just one of many stories. We are telling these stories because we are hoping that maybe it might move some of my friends on the other side of the aisle. Maybe it might move the leadership to allow us to schedule a vote and actually fix this and remove the level of uncertainty and fear that, now, 800,000 people have to deal with because of what the President did yesterday and because of the inaction, over the years, of this Congress. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 3440, the DREAM Act, to protect DREAMers like Laura Flores, who are just as American as you and me. The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous consent request cannot be entertained. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the RECORD a letter of support for revoking President Trump’s threat to deny 800,000 DREAMers legal status in this country and to support his executive order affirming DACA for so many young people across this Nation—4,400 in Ohio, for example—who are following the rules, who came here as children, who are Americans as apple pie and only want a chance to succeed in our country like Linda who was brought here from Palestine when she was 8 years old. She is studying now in our area in a very difficult STEM program and is working her way through college through WorkStudy in order to make a firm contribution to our Nation in the future and to the future of whatever family she establishes. Why should they be denied this opportunity and made to feel so put upon by the Government of the United States? 
AUGUST 14, 2017. President DONALD J. T RUMP , The White House, Washington, DC. DEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP : As immigration law teachers and scholars, we write to express our position that the executive branch has legal authority to implement Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA 2012). This letter provides legal analysis about DACA 2012. In our view, there is no question that DACA 2012 is a lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Our conclusions are based on years of experience in the field and a close study of the U.S. Constitution, administrative law, immigration statutes, federal regulations and case law. As the administration determines the future of DACA 2012, understanding its legal foundation and history is critical. DACA 2012 was announced by the President, and implemented in a memorandum by the Secretary of Homeland Security, on June 15, 2012. It enables qualifying individuals to request a temporary reprieve from removal known as ‘‘deferred action.’’ Deferred action is one form of prosecutorial discretion in immigration law and has been used for decades by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (and formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)) and over several administrations. Whether a requesting individual receives deferred action under DACA 2012 is at the discretion of DHS. Qualifying individuals may request DACA 2012 if they came to the United States before the age of sixteen; are currently in school or have graduated; have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007; have not been convicted of a felony, ‘‘significant misdemeanor,’’ or three or more nonsignificant misdemeanors; do not otherwise pose a threat to public safety or national security; and otherwise warrant protection as a matter of discretion. Individuals who are granted DACA 2012 receive a twoyear period in deferred action and also gain eligibility to apply for employment authorization. The legal authority for DACA 2012 originates from the U.S. Constitution. Article II, Section Three (the Take Care Clause) states in part that the President ‘‘shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’’ Inherent in the function of the ‘‘Take Care Clause’’ is the ability of the President to target some immigration cases for removal and to use prosecutorial discretion favorably in others.

Ms. KAPTUR. So with this unanimous consent request, I stand on behalf of those 4,400 Ohioans as well as 800,000 young Americans who are DREAMers and will inject new energy and new possibility into our country, help to fund programs like Social Security which they are paying into if they are working, and make their contribution to our country’s future. It is really an honor to rise on her behalf and ask for Congress to act immediately to pass legislation to protect these young people whose economic and cultural contributions will only make our Nation stronger. They will not displace anyone—any person—who has an application currently pending before our immigration service, but they will wait in line like everyone else because they are fair people and they deserve to be treated fairly by the Government of the United States. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the materials will be included in the RECORD . There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Time will be deducted from the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD an article about Alonso Guillen, a DREAMer who died trying to rescue Harvey flood victims. 
[From the LA Times, Sept. 4, 2017] ‘DREAMER ’ DIESTRYING TORESCUE HARVEY  FLOOD VICTIMS  (By Molly HennessyFiske) Alonso Guillen drove more than 100 miles south from his home in Lukfin, Texas, last week, determined to help those trapped by Hurricane Harvey flooding in the Houston area. But he and another man disappeared after their boat capsized in a floodswollen creek Wednesday, and relatives began searching for their bodies. On Friday, searchers found the body of Tomas Carreon, 25, of Lufkin. On Sunday, relatives spotted Guillen’s body. ‘‘He was floating in the water,’’ his brother Jesus Guillen, 36, a Lufkin truck driver, said in Spanish during a phone interview. Luis Ortega, 22, of Lufkin, who survived the boat accident, told searchers the men had been swept away by a powerful current. Ortega barely escaped by grabbing a floating gas tank, then a tree. Relatives said Guillen, a Mexican national, was a ‘‘Dreamer’’ enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which President Trump is said to be poised to scrap, though he may leave it intact for six months to give Congress time to find a legislative solution. (Ortega is a U.S. citizen, as was Carreon, Guillen’s brother said.) Guillen moved to Lufkin at age 14 from just across the border in Piedras Negras, Mexico. He later graduated from Lufkin High School, attended St. Patrick’s Catholic Church, worked in construction and at a local club, Rodeo Disko, and radio station, SuperMix 101.9 FM. He was known as ‘‘DJ Ocho,’’ who mixed country and hiphop, followed Texans football and the Houston Astros, played softball and soccer, sported Cowboy hats and red, white and blue sunglasses. He used the station to organize fundraisers for those in need. ‘‘It didn’t matter what situation it was,’’ said friend Linda Alvarez. Guillen masterminded the rescue trip to the Houston area just like one of his radio station fundraisers: on the fly, with friends’ help. After the storm hit, they borrowed a boat and drove south to save strangers. Like many in Texas, Guillen’s family has mixed immigration status and is divided by the border. His mother, a Mexican national, still lives in Piedras Negras, Mexico, with one of his brothers. His father is a legal resident, and his brother Jesus is a U.S. citizen. Alonso Guillen applied for DACA, an Obamaera program that protected from deportation about 800,000 immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. He applied because so many of his family and friends were in the U.S., and that’s where he saw his future, his brother said. ‘‘His dream was to open a restaurant, something the whole family could enjoy and where they could come together,’’ his brother said. ‘‘He was trying; he was always updated with the news about the Dreamer program. 
He was ready to get it fixed and done,’’ friend Manny Muniz said of Guillen’s immigration status. Muniz, a fellow disc jockey, met Guillen a few years ago in the midst of a more minor crisis: He had booked a gig and didn’t have any speakers. Guillen lent him some, and they started working together. After the storm struck, Guillen started posting weather reports on Facebook. Early last week Guillen told Muniz he was headed to Houston, ‘‘to go save lives, go help people, volunteer his time.’’ Muniz said part of the reason Guillen applied for DACA and wanted to become a legal resident was that he longed to be able to cross the border legally to visit Mexico, especially his hometown. Instead, Guillen will be buried this week in Lufkin. He is survived by an 8yearold daughter, Mariana, who lives in Guanajuato, Mexico, his brother said. Guillen’s family is planning his funeral at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church. Guillen’s mother may not be allowed to attend. The U.S. government has not granted her permission to cross the border for the service, relatives said. ‘‘We hope that she can come, that they allow her to come,’’ said Jesus Guillen’s 14 yearold daughter, Zorayda. U.S. Customs and Border Protection tweeted condolences to Guillen’s family Monday, calling him ‘‘a rescue volunteer who died during Hurricane Harvey’’ and promising to allow Guillen’s mother to cross the border to attend his funeral. Jesus Guillen said he hopes the DACA program will not be dismantled. ‘‘It gives people like my brother opportunities to be better, to have strength and believe in themselves and become what they want to be,’’ he said. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the RECORD a letter to Members of Congress from The United States Conference of Mayors strongly objecting to what the President did. 
THEUNITED STATES  CONFERENCE OF MAYORS , Washington, DC, September 5, 2017. An Open Letter to the Congress on Dreamers from America’s Mayors DEARMEMBERS OF THE U.S. H OUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE U.S. S ENATE : We write on behalf of the nation’s mayors to urge you to quickly pass bipartisan legislation that would enable Dreamers—people who have lived in America since they were children and built their lives here—to earn lawful permanent residence and eventually American citizenship if they meet certain criteria. We pledge to work with you in this effort and to do whatever we can to assist you in seeing it enacted into law. This June at the 85th Annual Meeting of The United States Conference of Mayors, we adopted strong policy supporting permanent legal status for Dreamers and extension of the DACA program We did this because it is the right thing to do—for Dreamers, for our communities and for our country. DACA has benefitted nearly 800,000 undocumented youth since it began in 2012. With work authorization and without the fear of deportation, these young people, who have done nothing illegal, have been able to participate in and contribute to our country, our cities and the nation’s economy: Eightyseven percent of DACA recipients are employed by American businesses, and six percent have started their own businesses, leading to higher wages and better economic outcomes. DACA recipients contribute 15.3 percent of their wages to taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare, and DACA recipients are investing in assets like houses, and starting new businesses, bringing significant tax revenue to cities and states. It is expected that DACA recipients will contribute $9.9 billion in tax contributions over the next four years, and at least $433.4 billion to our gross domestic product (GDP) over the next decade. There is broad public support for Dreamers: Sixtyfour percent of Americans support letting ‘‘Dreamers’’ remain in the U.S. Seventyone percent of Americans feel undocumented immigrants working in the U.S. should be offered a chance to apply for legal status. Seventyfive percent of Americans who voted for the President support Dreamers. Because of the Trump Administration’s decision to terminate DACA in six months, this legislation must be passed as quickly as possible so that the benefits to Dreamers, to our cities, and to our nation can continue. It would remove Dreamers’ fears of deportation and allow them to contribute even more to the country they love, which for many is the only country they have known. They would be able to reach their full potential in many ways, including serving in the military. The U.S. Conference of Mayors pledges to work with you to make this happen. Sincerely, MITCHELL J. L ANDRIEU , Mayor of New Orleans, President. ERICGARCETTI , Mayor of Los Angeles, Chair, USCM Latino Alliance. JORGE ELORZA , Mayor of Providence, CoChair, Immigration Reform Task Force. TOMTAIT, Mayor of Anaheim, CoChair, Immigration Reform Task Force. JOHNGILES, Mayor of Mesa, Trustee. TOMCOCHRAN , CEO and Executive Director. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, next, I include in the RECORD an article that appeared on the National Public Radio web page, entitled, ‘‘Microsoft President to Trump: To Deport a DREAMer, You’ll Have to Go Through Us.’’ 
[From NPR, Sept. 5, 2017] MICROSOFT PRESIDENT TO TRUMP : TODEPORT  A DREAMER, YOU’LLHAVETOGOTHROUGH  US America’s business leaders are speaking out against President Trump’s move to end DACA. The president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, took a notable stand. He said not only will his company lobby for a legislative solution but also that Microsoft is calling on Congress to make immigration the top priority, before tax reform. And he is calling on other business leaders to follow suit. ‘‘There is nothing that we will be pushing on more strongly for Congress to act on,’’ Smith said in an interview with NPR. ‘‘We put a stake in the ground. We care about a tax reform bill. The entire business community cares about a tax reform. And yet it is very clear today a tax reform bill needs to be set aside until the DREAMers are taken care of. They have a deadline that expires in six months. Tax reform can wait.’’ Smith also said if the government moves to deport DREAMers who are Microsoft employees, ‘‘it’s going to have to go through us to get that person.’’ This is the second time in a week that Smith has spoken out. Last Thursday, Smith and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella both issued statements calling on the administration to preserve DACA. Nadella, a firstgeneration immigrant from India, struck a personal note: ‘‘I am a product of two uniquely American attributes: the ingenuity of American technology reaching me where I was growing up, fueling my dreams, and the enlightened immigration policy that allowed me to pursue my dreams.’’ Meanwhile, in a letter to employees this morning, Apple CEO Tim Cook said more than 250 Apple workers are affected by the DACA repeal and that he has been hearing from them all weekend. ‘‘I want to assure you that Apple will work with members of Congress from both parties to advocate for a legislative solution that provides permanent protections for all the Dreamers in our country,’’ Cook said. Dozens of CEOs including Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Reed Hastings from Netflix, Randall Stephenson from AT&T and Tim Sloan of Wells Fargo wrote a letter addressed to the president asking him to preserve the program. The leaders argued that all DACA recipients grew up in America and give back to the community and pay income taxes. They said: ‘‘More than 97 percent are in school or in the workforce, 5 percent started their own business, 65 percent have purchased a vehicle, and 16 percent have purchased their first home. At least 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies count DACA recipients among their employees.’’ In a public post, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said about Trump’s announcement: ‘‘This is a sad day for our country’’ and that he and his immigration advocacy vehicle at Fwd.US will be ‘‘doing even more in the weeks ahead to make sure Dreamers have the protections they deserve.’’ Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google (an arm of Alphabet), did not make quite the same commitment on Twitter. But he took a moral stand, writing, ‘‘Dreamers are our neighbors, our friends and our coworkers. This is their home. Congress needs to act now to #DefendDACA. #WithDreamers.’’ When President Trump was first elected, leaders in the tech industry were reluctant to criticize campaign pledges of his that went against their values and interests. They took a waitandsee approach and grappled with how to be a successful multinational in an increasingly nationalistic world. Tuesday morning’s outpouring illustrates a clear shift in business leaders’ willingness to speak out against decisions by the administration. Microsoft’s Smith says in the beginning of 2017, business leaders looked around and wondered how they would navigate this new unpredictable environment. They feared being attacked by the commander in chief on social media. Now, Smith says, ‘‘I don’t think people get up in the morning worrying about tweets. We have much bigger problems to worry about than that.’’ 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from over 500 business leaders in support of DACA who oppose what the President did yesterday and who are upset at Congress for its inaction. 
OPENLETTER FROMLEADERS OF AMERICAN  INDUSTRY ON DACA August 31, 2017 To: President Donald J Trump To: Speaker Paul Ryan; Leader Nancy Pelosi; Leader Mitch McConnell; and Leader Charles E. Schumer As entrepreneurs and business leaders, we are concerned about new developments in immigration policy that threaten the future of young undocumented immigrants brought to America as children. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows nearly 800,000 Dreamers the basic opportunity to work and study without the threat of deportation, is in jeopardy. All DACA recipients grew up in America, registered with our government, submitted to extensive background checks, and are diligently giving back to our communities and paying income taxes. More than 97 percent are in school or in the workforce, 5 percent started their own business, 65 percent have purchased a vehicle, and 16 percent have purchased their first home. At least 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies count DACA recipients among their employees. Unless we act now to preserve the DACA program, all 780,000 hardworking young people will lose their ability to work legally in this country, and every one of them will be at immediate risk of deportation. Our economy would lose $460.3 billion from the national GDP and $24.6 billion in Social Security and Medicare tax contributions. Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our economy. With them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of why we will continue to have a global competitive advantage. We call on President Trump to preserve the DACA program. We call on Congress to pass the bipartisan DREAM Act or legislation that provides these young people raised in our country the permanent solution they deserve. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I also include in the RECORD a statement signed by over 1,300 Catholic educators who call on President Trump and his administration to save DACA and protect the DREAMers. 
[From Faith in Public Life, Ignatian Solidarity Network, and the Jesuits] OVER 1,300 C ATHOLIC EDUCATORS CALL ON  TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO SAVEDACA AND PROTECT DREAMERS  DEARGEN. KELLY : As educators at Catholic institutions, we write to convey profound concern for our vulnerable immigrant students. In your new position as Chief of Staff, you are now one of the most prominent Catholics in the Administration. Your direct line to President Trump and recent experience as Secretary of Homeland Security provides an opportunity for you to be an influential champion for the children and youth who are the next generation of American leaders. We ask that you protect the dignity of our nation’s immigrant youth by advocating for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program until Congress passes the Dream Act. We stand with our students who are DACA beneficiaries. Their perseverance, hard work and hopefulness is an example to us as teachers. We witness the obstacles they overcome each day as they pursue their dream of a better life for themselves and their families. In facing adversity and uncertainty with grace and hope, they embody the best of our schools, our country and the Catholic tradition. It is a moral and policy failure when our government targets children and young adults who simply aspire to live the American dream. Breaking up families and communities undermines the best values of our nation. Bishop Joe S. Vasquez, Chair of the Migration Committee at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and Bishop of Austin, Texas, said recently in a statement. ‘‘These young people entered the U.S. as children and know America as their only home. The dignity of every human being, particularly that of our children and youth, must be protected.’’ We join Bishop Vasquez in urging you to uphold the DACA program. On several occasions, you have expressed that you would not make changes to DACA. We strongly encourage you to maintain DACA as an essential program for the wellbeing of young people and our communities. Please know we are praying that you use your power prudently and that we remain committed to constructive dialogue. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend from Massachusetts I am prepared to close when he is. I have no further speakers remaining. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. May I inquire how much time I have remaining, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 7
1⁄2 minutes remaining. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. First of all, with regard to the underlying bill that is being brought before the House today, a whole bunch of appropriations bills bunched together in an unprecedented way and, I would say, in an undemocratic way as well—nobody has had a chance to read these bills, over 1,300 pages—I don’t think anybody in this Chamber has read them all. Close to 1,000 amendments were submitted. They were all asked to be submitted before we came back into session while people were still on work recess. I don’t think Members have had a chance to review all of the amendments. As I said, hundreds of good amendments have already been rejected. Last night in the Rules Committee, I invoked Senator JOHNMCCAIN’s name. He recently wrote a piece in which he called upon Congress to go back to regular order. I agree with him. We ought to go back to regular order. That is what the Speaker of the House promised when he took the gavel, we would have regular order. This is not regular order. This is not the way we should decide spending matters. I will tell you right now that there will be lots of mistakes in this legislation that is being rushed through—if it even goes anywhere—because we are now being told we are going to have to do a continuing resolution, and chances are we are going to end up having to do a longterm spending bill. But process matters, and when you bunch things together and when you rush things like this, mistakes are made. As I said in my opening, we are going to ask for people to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. If you vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question, I will offer an amendment to bring up Representative ROYBAL ALLARD ’s bill, which is the DREAM Act, which would actually solve the dilemma that we face. It would solve the dilemma that 800,000 good people in this country are now facing as a result of President Trump’s cruel decision yesterday to repeal DACA, to end DACA. These are people who, as you have heard from all my colleagues as they have told their stories, are working in this country. They are leading efforts to rescue people in hurricaneravaged Texas. They are paramedics and they serve in our military. b1530 These are good people. This is their country. They were brought here as infants. This is the only country they know. The fact that we are treating these good people in such a terrible way, every one of us should be ashamed. That is not who we are. We keep on saying that every time the White House does something else that we find offensive. We keep on saying: That is not who we are; that is not who we are. Well, at some point, we have to prove it. We have to show it. If we believe DREAMers are a valuable part of our community, then we need to protect them. This is a way to do it today. There is no need for compromise and more discussion. It is very simple: you either support the DREAMers or you don’t. That is it. That is the only question at hand. If you want to load it up with all kinds of other extraneous materials, that is not a fair thing to do. That is not what these people deserve. Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are hearing from their constituents. I know they are hearing from their churches, synagogues, and mosques that we need to protect these people. Well, let’s do it. The DREAMers don’t need your words. They don’t need your sympathies. They don’t need your empathy. They need your vote. We have an opportunity today, by voting ‘‘no’’ on the previous question, to have a vote today on whether to protect the DREAMers. It is that simple. Some of my colleagues on the Republican side have spoken very eloquently about the DREAMers. If you mean it, then give us your vote. If you mean it, do less talking and give us the vote. That is what we are asking for today. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. Let us help these great people. Let us help these people who have been such a valuable part of our community. Let us treat them with the dignity and respect that they deserve. Let us recognize that they view this country as their home. We should view this country as their home as well. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. If that doesn’t work, then vote ‘‘no’’ on this lousy rule. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I fear you are going to have to use that admonition a great deal in the coming days, and I regret that. I regret that folks have begun to confuse civility with weakness. My experience is, when you are strong, you don’t have to insult the people around you. When you are strong, you don’t have to call folks around you names. Civility and weakness are confused. In fact, more often than not, there is a loss of civility when folks feel at their weakest. My friends on the other side of the aisle right now, Mr. Speaker, with good reason, feel very restricted. Being in the minority in the House of Representatives is a hard place to be. For my friend from Massachusetts, Mr. Speaker, being in the minority on the Rules Committee is among one of the hardest places to be. So I don’t fault him for his frustration one little bit. If I was in his shoes, I would be frustrated as well. Let me be clear: we are in this position with DACA today for one reason and one reason only, and that is because instead of leading the Congress and leading the Nation, President Obama chose to act alone in a way that he knew would not be permanent. The instability that you see today is the result of folks acting in a way that was not stable. The confusion that you see today is the result of an administration that committed itself to that confusion instead of committing itself to consensus. I have been in this Congress for 7 years, Mr. Speaker. That is 7 years. For 4 of those 7 years, the United States Senate was led by the Democratic Party. Not once in those 7 years has an immigration bill come to my desk from the United States. Not once. I know, as we sit here right now, the House Judiciary Committee has acted on immigration bill after immigration bill after immigration bill. Let’s be clear, Mr. Speaker: the situation that the DREAMers find themselves in today is the symptom of a Nation that does not have the security of its borders. Had America had security for its borders, we would not have allowed these families to put their children in these positions. Today, we have an amazing opportunity to have this debate. I tell you that our President is in a unique position to lead us. It frustrates me so much, Mr. Speaker, that folks want to assume the worst about one another and that the media is all too anxious to report the worst about one another. The President could have just canceled the DACA program. He could have instructed DHS to start proceedings today. He didn’t. It wouldn’t have been the right thing. It wouldn’t have been the prudent thing to do. He didn’t do it. What did he do? He said: I have read this thing called the United States Constitution. It turns out that only one group in the land has the opportunity to write the laws. It is me and my friend from Massachusetts. It is the majority leader from Kentucky and the minority leader from New York across the way. He said: Congress, there is only one way this should have even been done. It should have been done in the Halls of Congress. That is not the way President Obama chose to do it. He should have done better. He didn’t. We can do better. Let’s do. Now, to the skyisfalling reports that came out one right after the other almost with glee from the fourth estate, the President spoke again to say: Listen, you know what? If Congress doesn’t get it right, I may have to act myself. I hope he doesn’t. I think that folks have too little confidence in what we can do together when we set our minds to it, but we do have to ask ourselves, watching the display here on the floor today, watching the displays we have had here on the floor in the past: Do we have a serious group of men and women here who want to work together on solutions? Or do we have a group of men and women here who want to just get the next headline, who want to just send out that next tweet, who just want to just make that next front page story of hysteria? I believe the former is true. I know the men and women on this floor, Mr. Speaker, not the caricature of the men and women that you read in the newspaper, but the real men and women on this floor, who each come here every single day to diligently serve the almost 700,000 men and women that they report to back home. And I am proud to do it. I plea, Mr. Speaker, for you to use your leadership to not allow us to devolve into the name calling and the acrimony that the fourth estate would like to suggest characterizes this Chamber, but to lead us to the sincere debate of caring about people, caring about the rule of law, caring about families. Let me just say, the best part of this job is the casework that each one of us does back home. You all know it. People think the job happens in Washington, D.C. It doesn’t. It happens one family at a time back home. You have heard the comments on the floor of the House today, Mr. Speaker. I have families in my district separated from one another. You want to talk about uniting families? I have families separated from one another standing in line to come to this country legally. I ask you, Mr. Speaker: How many folks have you heard standing up for my constituents whose families have been separated because they have been standing in line to get here for more than a year? How many folks have stood up for them? Not one. What about those families standing in line 2 years, Mr. Speaker? I have got them in my district, too. What about those families who have been separated for 3 years and standing in line trying to get to America the right way? Who is standing up for them? I don’t hear those calls on the floor of the House. I have got them in my district, too. What about 4 years, Mr. Speaker; 5 years, Mr. Speaker; 6 years, Mr. Speaker? If you wanted to bring your adult child in from Mexico, you had to file in the 1990s for their number to be coming up today. That is crazy. It is crazy. Where is the conversation about reforming the system that got us here to begin with? I applaud my friend for trying to solve the symptom. I beg my friend to work with me to cure the disease. We have a President who can lead us in that direction, Mr. Speaker. He has the credibility of being tough on borders and he has the heart of someone who wants to keep families united. We have an opportunity, Mr. Speaker. We can take it or we can reject it. I believe we are going to take it. But that is not for the business today. The business today is an appropriations process. My friend from Massachusetts called it unprecedented. He is right. I take no small amount of pleasure in talking about how right he is. I have been in this body for 7 years and we don’t generally get the appropriations bills done before the end of the year, Mr. Speaker. Deadlines don’t tend to mean anything to us. We are about to make that happen. Mr. Speaker, 1997 was the last time Congress funded the government ahead of schedule, before the deadline. It has taken a continuing resolution every other year since 1997. We have an opportunity this year to do it. I don’t know if we will take it or not. I hope that we will. We can’t solve everything every day, but we can solve something every day. We can make something better for someone every day. If you support this rule, we will bring to the floor four appropriations bills and 119 amendments, give or take. We are up in the Rules Committee right now making even more amendments in order, Mr. Speaker, to have even more voices be heard, to have even more opportunity to make a difference for the families that we all represent back home. Support this rule. Be proud of this rule. Be proud of the work the Appropriations Committee did. Mr. Speaker, you don’t hear it on the floor of the House, but it so frustrates me. If you had been in the Rules Committee last night, you would have seen Democrats and Republicans sitting side by side talking about the amazing work they did together on the appropriations 
process in the Appropriations Committee, talking about the great admiration and respect that they had for one another because of the work they do together on the Appropriations Committee. We don’t hear that here on the floor of the House, and we should. We should hear more of that. We should hear more about the good work we are doing together. If we support this rule, Mr. Speaker, we will get a chance not to hear about it, but to experience it, to do it. I know my colleague from Massachusetts and I have another 6, 7, 8 hours of Rules Committee work to do together tonight. I know my colleague is going to challenge us to do even better than what we are doing. I am prepared to accept that challenge. But for today, Mr. Speaker, for this moment, I urge my colleagues to come to this floor; support this rule; move the appropriations process forward; finish the appropriations process before the September 30 deadline; and serve your constituents back home, like I know every man and woman in this Chamber does. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and support for the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on ordering the previous question will be followed by 5 minute votes on adopting the resolution, if ordered, and agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 233, nays 187, not voting 13, as follows:

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material in the consideration of H.R. 3354, and that I may include tabular material on the same. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 500 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 3354. The Chair appoints the gentleman from New York (Mr. COLLINS ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1625 IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 3354) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, with Mr. COLLINS of New York in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) each will control 1 hour. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I rise today to present H.R. 3354, the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act. This legislation moves Congress one step closer to completing its critical work on our fiscal year 2018 appropriations bills ahead of the end of the fiscal year on September 30. Our bill respects the American people, their priorities for our Nation, and their hardearned tax dollars, and it will help move our great country forward to a more stable and prosperous future. This funding, totaling $1.2 trillion, supports important domestic and international programs that keep our people safe and help our economy grow and thrive, protects us from terrorists and those who want to do us harm, and assures that America has a critical role across the globe both militarily and diplomatically. Most importantly, this bill continues the work started with the national security funding package that passed the House in July, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, and it prioritizes the safety of the American people, targeting funding towards critical law enforcement programs, securing our borders and our cyber networks, fighting terrorism, combating opioid abuse, and stemming the flow of illegal drugs and goods. Other funds are directed to programs that provide the greatest national benefit, including those that keep our food and drug supplies safe, that support public health preparedness, fight devastating wildfires, invest in critical infrastructure, and otherwise protect and support our economy and economic freedom. All of these investments are made responsibly. In each of our bills within this package, we have found savings, gotten rid of waste, fraud, and duplication, and increased oversight to ensure that no taxpayer dollar is misspent, but we still have more work to do. This is the next step in the process, but it is not the end. We must also address new needs arising from terrible flooding and damage 
inflicted by Hurricane Harvey, which is affecting hundreds of thousands of people across Texas and Louisiana, as well as continue all government operations until the final appropriations package can be conferenced with the Senate and signed into law. b1630 This legislation today represents the House priorities and shows the American people that this Chamber is moving forward, governing effectively, and getting things done here in Washington. Before I close, I would like to thank the members of the Appropriations Committee for their hard work over the past few months, and the staff that allows us to consider this bill today, especially the 12 chairs of the subcommittees. The committee drafted, considered, and marked up all 12 appropriations bills in under 2 months, a recordbreaking pace, and as a result, we have a fine package of solid bills on the floor this afternoon. I particularly would like to thank the chairs and ranking members of the committee of the bills we are considering today, as well as the ranking member of the full committee, Mrs. LOWEY , for her partnership and friendship throughout this process. I would also like to extend my personal thanks to our staff on both sides of the aisle for their efforts on these bills. This package is a product not only of the committee’s work, but also of the contribution of all Members of this body. While drafting these bills that compose this package, we took Members’ submissions very seriously, creating a more representative bill that reflects the will of the American people. In July, the House took the first responsible step of providing funding for critical national security priorities. With this bill, we complete our work on all 12 of our appropriations bills for the fiscal year. This morning, the House came together on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis to pass desperately needed emergency funding for the victims in Texas and Louisiana whose lives were destroyed by Hurricane Harvey. Funding these important responsibilities of the Federal Government is our constitutional duty to the people we serve. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 8 minutes. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this bill, which would turn back the clock on American excellence, following President Trump’s lead on divesting from education, health, foreign assistance, science, and infrastructure. The process for this bill has been outrageous, and this debate, frankly, is an utter waste of time. Just hours ago, Congressional leadership and the President agreed to pass a package including Hurricane Harvey assistance as well as a debt limit extension and a continuing resolution to keep government running until December 15. We should be working to pass that measure now so that we can work toward a bipartisan budget agreement instead of wasting days on a bill that undercuts economic growth and priorities on which families rely, and is so hyperpartisan it will never earn the Democratic support needed to be enacted. Breaking from longstanding tradition that enables Members to advance amendments in an open process, the Rules Committee required amendments be submitted 12 days ago during the District work period and reported a restrictive, structured rule for relatively few of them so far. The majority denied consideration of many amendments that would address timely, highprofile challenges, some of which cut to the core of our democracy, and would have been allowed under an open rule. In one of the most egregious examples, the majority blocked an amendment to provide safeguards to ensure the integrity of government reports on violent domestic extremism, the likes of which erupted in Charlottesville in recent weeks, resulting in the death of a young woman exercising her right to freedom of speech. Not only were amendments to address the President’s revocation of DACA deemed out of order, in an affront to the Appropriations Committee and to this institution, the majority removed a bipartisan amendment passed in committee that would have allowed DREAMers to work for the Federal Government. My friends, we have a responsibility to pass the DREAM Act now. It is absurd that, after years of receiving bipartisan majority support, Republican leadership has refused to allow a vote. The Rules Committee should make in order amendments to protect the integrity of our elections and the independence of the special counsel’s Russia investigation. This bill also fails on the merits. The nondefense bills are below sequestration levels set in law, slashing funding for teacher training, apprenticeship grants to help young adults train for good jobs, law enforcement grants that help keep our communities safe, environmental protections that ensure we drink clean water, breathe clean air, highway and transit grants that improve the quality of life for our constituents, and a number of scientific and research programs that are important for global competitiveness. This bill is littered with riders with deeprooted opposition, like cutting funding for Planned Parenthood. If the majority is serious about governing, loading mustpass spending bills with these policy riders is a surefire way to fail. Turning to the State and Foreign Operations division of the bill, I want to thank Steve Marchese, Erin Kolodjeski, and Matt Washington with the subcommittee; Liz Leibowitz and Dean Fischer from my office; Craig Higgins, Susan Adams, Clelia Alvarado, David Bortnick, Winnie Chang, Lacy Kilraine, Megan O’Donnell, and Alex Pinson with the majority. Diplomacy and development efforts are critical to protecting our country’s national security and building stronger and more stable communities around the world. That is why cuts in this division are so deeply troubling. As demonstrated through both the President’s unworkable request and the subcommittee’s unsustainable allocation, the majority does not fully embrace the vital role diplomatic and development activities add to our national security and economic interests abroad. On the positive side, the bill sustains our bipartisan and unwavering support for our close ally and partner Israel, as well as Jordan. And I do appreciate Chairman ROGERS protecting resources for basic education, water, sanitation, democracy, and some vital women’s programs, which provide communities the foundations for inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction. While he rejected the most extreme proposals in the President’s budget, the allocation is insufficient to respond to global challenges. We must reverse dangerous and shortsighted cuts for programs such as multilateral cooperation, international family planning, and climate change, as well as the expansion of the Global Gag Rule to all global health programs, and the prohibition on U.S. contributions to UNFPA. The Rules Committee should have made in order amendments I submitted to strike the expansion of the Global Gag Rule and the ban on funding for the United Nations Population Fund, and to restore essential funding for international development and diplomacy. Despite the administration’s professed hope that other nations will fill the gaps created by cuts in this bill, we are at risk of that void being filled by those who oppose our values and interests, leaving the world far different from what we want for our children and grandchildren. It is time for the majority to set aside its most extreme proposals, including the border wall and interior immigration enforcement, and work with Democrats to write bipartisan legislation that could actually be enacted. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS ), the chairman of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee, my predecessor as full chairman. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the fiscal year 2018 appropriations measure before us today. The committee, as the chairman said, has worked at a historic pace to produce a bill that reflects the priorities of the American people. Chairman FRELING HUYSEN should be recognized for his leadership in bringing this legislation through committee and before the House in record time. While the entirety of the package should be supported, I want to highlight, Mr. Chairman, the funding provided for the Department of State and Foreign Operations. This portion of the bill reduces international diplomatic and development programs by $10 billion, a 17 percent reduction from fiscal year ’17. In a tough budget environment, the bill strikes a delicate balance between fiscal responsibility and support for continued U.S. leadership and foreign aid. First and foremost, over $6 billion is allocated for embassy security, which will enable the State Department to safeguard American diplomatic facilities overseas, in line with the recommendations of the Benghazi Accountability Review Board. Second, the bill contains $8.4 billion for security assistance to support key U.S. allies and partners. The U.S. Israel Memorandum of Understanding is fully funded at $3.1 billion. The bill also maintains foreign military financing for Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia; and it increases security assistance for Ukraine, and provides extra support for other countries facing Russian aggression. In our own hemisphere, the bill will help counter transnational criminal organizations and the flow of illegal drugs by supporting our partnerships with Colombia, Central America, and Mexico. Third, the bill promotes American values around the world by maintaining funding for key democracy programs. Fourth, the bill continues our country’s strong tradition of helping the most vulnerable, providing $8.3 billion for global health programs and over $5.9 billion for humanitarian assistance. At the same time, the bill protects and preserves life by embracing an expanded Mexico City policy, prohibiting funding for the U.N. Population Fund, and continuing all prolife riders carried in prior House bills. Finally, at a time when we must remain focused on balancing Federal spending, this bill eliminates many programs, aims to improve oversight 
and management, and makes our government more accountable. No funds are provided for President Obama’s Global Climate Change Initiative. Funding for the U.N. is reduced by $900 million, and international banks and financial institutions are cut by over $800 million. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman, this legislation advances both our national security and economic interests. I urge support for the bill. b1645 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SERRANO ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member LOWEY . I wish we could be here under other circumstances. The process to consider the CJS portion of this bill as part of an omnibus package is not in keeping with how the appropriations process should work. Each bill should be given individual consideration under an open rule. Some on the other side are cheering this floor process, which is ironic given their years of opposition to such a lumpedtogether package. I am not sure what has changed their minds today, and at this point we don’t even know if Members will be allowed to offer amendments that are necessary to improve half of the bill and rein in this outofcontrol administration because the Rules Committee has not yet provided us with that information. I also wish that the substance of what we are considering this week were better. As the ranking member of the CJS Subcommittee, I can say that the CJS portion of this bill received an inadequate allocation. After scorekeeping adjustments, the bill includes an approximately 1 percent cut below fiscal year 2017. This is far below the level needed to adequately fund the programs in this bill which are crucial to economic development, scientific innovation, and protecting our Nation’s cherished constitutional values. Before we touch upon these serious problems, let me mention some areas where both sides agree. I do want to commend Chairman CULBERSON for rejecting several of the worst ideas in the Trump administration’s budget. This includes rebuffing proposals that would have reduced research funding at the National Science Foundation and eliminated the Minority Business Development Agency. This bill also rejects cuts to educational efforts in the NSF, NASA, and a proposed cut for the FBI. Unfortunately, far too many of the President’s terrible proposals are given credence by this legislation. The Legal Services Corporation, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, and the Economic Development Administration all absorb significant cuts below the current funding level. The Census Bureau is greatly underfunded and will be unable to complete the important and necessary work that must be done now to prepare for the 2020 Census. A number of other programs are shortchanged, including climate change research programs at NSF and NOAA, several National Weather Service initiatives, and a number of DOJ grant programs, like the COPS Hiring Program and several police reform grant programs. Democrats and Republicans, alike, support most, if not all, of these programs, but we simply cannot fix these problems under this allocation. I am also troubled that this bill allows many of the administration’s most disturbing priorities and initiatives related to immigration and civil rights to move forward without the necessary congressional oversight. In the wake of Charlottesville and Tuesday’s DACA decision, there are many in this country who are justifiably questioning the President’s commitment to tolerance, fairness, and inclusiveness. The Trump administration’s budget request for the Department of Justice raises those questions as well. A proposal to harm immigrants by increasing criminal enforcement is funded in this bill. There is no attempt to limit the Department’s actions to undermine affirmative action, support voter restriction that disproportionally hurts minority populations, and ignore LGBT protections. Many of these ideas have long been rejected by the American people, but the President and the Attorney General continue to give them credibility. Democrats and Republicans have offered amendments to limit the reach of these drastic policy changes, but at this point, it is unclear whether any of these amendments will be made in order. I hope we will have a serious opportunity to make changes to this bill, but that seems unlikely. In its current form, I cannot support this portion of the bill or the bill as a whole. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ADERHOLT ), chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, it is my distinct honor to bring the fiscal year 2018 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies bill before you today as part of the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act. I do want to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for his commitment to the annual appropriations process. Under his steadfast leadership, the House is scheduled to vote on all 12 appropriations bills, which is an extraordinary achievement. I would also like to thank Ranking Member LOWEY and Ranking Member BISHOP for their cooperative spirit. Mr. BISHOP is the new ranking member for the Agriculture Subcommittee, and I have enjoyed working with him over the past several months as we have moved forward to try to help rural America and rural communities. The Agriculture Appropriations bill responsibly targets funds to national programs that provide the most benefit to the American people and to the United States economy. The bill received bipartisan support throughout the process, even though much of the funding and policies reflect a conservative policy. The overall total for both discretionary and mandatory spending in the bill equals $144.9 billion. That is $4.1 billion above the President’s request and $8.6 billion below the FY17 enacted level. The bill includes $20 billion in discretionary budget authority, which is $1.1 billion below the FY17 enacted level when adjusting for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The mandatory funds in this bill support USDA’s farm production, conservation, crop insurance, and nutrition programs. I would like to thank all the Members who have submitted requests and gave input as we have moved forward and crafted this legislation. Knowing what programs Members are interested in has helped us direct funding to support rural communities across the country and also combat animal and plant pests and disease threats, promote U.S. agricultural exports, support food safety and medical product safety, provide U.S. commodities to those in need overseas, and address the critical needs of research. We protected our most vulnerable populations in this bill by providing funding for all of USDA’s nutrition programs at levels that ensure all eligible participants will receive the nutrition assistance that they need. We made sure that the farm loan programs will meet current estimates of demand during the current economic downturn in several areas of the farm economy. Furthermore, the bill provides $5.2 billion to the Food and Drug Administration, including the preservation of nearly $2.8 billion in discretionary resources to assist the FDA in protecting and promoting public health. The bill continues to support the food safety activities associated with the Food Safety Modernization Act and provides $60 million in new funds to the 21st Century Cures Act. In closing, I would like to especially thank the staff on the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, my personal staff, the minority staff, and Mr. BISHOP ’s staff. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman to thank the staff. Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, I appreciate, again, the bipartisan cooperation that went into crafting this bill. It is very important. Mr. Chair, I would ask my colleagues to support this legislation. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR ), who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Ranking Member LOWEY for yielding me time. Thank you to all members of the committee for the long hours you have dedicated to these bills, certainly our chairman, RODNEY  FRELINGHUYSEN . The artificially low allocations you were given have resulted in a package that I cannot support, but I want to note your efforts to find compromise where it was possible. Though the House passed the Energy and Water bill as part of July’s Christmas tree minibus, I am back down here today because the Republican majority has harmed the Department of Energy’s funding for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, or, as they call it, the ATVM. It has been gutted as a payfor to cover another shortsighted Republican cut to a Federal Emergency Management program. Today’s rule allowed this boneheaded Republican action, plotted just weeks ago before Mother Nature’s catastrophic fury hit Texas with Hurricane Harvey. It doesn’t look good to the American people when the majority cuts programs that are desperately needed. It doesn’t serve America’s future if money is pulled from developing engine technologies to increase fuel economy of cars, expand domestic manufacturing, and create goodpaying American jobs. Unless you live under a rock, you know these initiatives are both popular and effective and necessary: 61 percent of Republicans in Ohio support the requirement of getting to an average of 40 miles per gallon in new cars by 2025, with 73 percent of the public, overall, supporting that. The Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle program supported Ford’s development of the EcoBoost engine, which is built in Ohio at Brook Park, in my own district. Advanced Vehicle Research supported the development of allelectric vehicles, from Nissan’s Leaf in Tennessee to Tesla’s Model S in California. It supports America’s competitiveness in a fiercely competitive and tough global marketplace that is, many times, not on the level. We should support innovation and collaboration, not eliminate jobcreating programs. I will fight to preserve this program in the final spending package. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, thus, I encourage all my colleagues to oppose this sort of backward maneuver and oppose the final bill. In closing, I would like to say, and to acknowledge publicly, a very big thank you and congratulations to Taunja Berquam on her upcoming retirement from Congress. I know she will have a bright future ahead. After her distinguished and exemplary service with the Army Corps of Engineers, including in Iraq, she dedicated over a decade of her brilliant life and mind to the important task of managing the Appropriation’s Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee accounts during my tenure as ranking member, as well as for Representative PETER VISCLOSKY before me. Taunja’s highminded commitment to democratic principles is unyielding. Our committee is losing a trusted and honorable adviser. Her expertise and nononsense approach served our members, the staff, and the American people extraordinarily well. Taunja, you will be missed, and you can leave knowing that you made a positive difference for America’s future in nuclear readiness, in our energy future security, and in vital Army Corps development from coast to coast. We thank you. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, let me associate myself with the remarks of Ms. KAPTUR . Taunja, thank you for your service to our Nation, your help to both Republicans and Democrats, and to the Nation. We are indebted to you. Good luck to you. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CULBERSON ), the chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, who spoke so eloquently this morning. Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to thank everyone here in the House for their kind words and their prayers and their support this morning for the Hurricane Harvey relief bill. I want to thank you in particular, Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , for your hard work, along with the Speaker, to get that legislation passed through the House in record time to get relief to the people of Texas and Lousiana, and know that we are praying for the people of Puerto Rico and Florida who are facing this terrible hurricane right now. Today, I am pleased to present the fiscal year 2018 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. I want to particularly thank my ranking member, JOSE´SERRANO , who has been a good partner to work with and for his support when it comes to science, and NASA has deeply appreciated it. His input has improved the bill significantly. I am also very grateful to Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member LOWEY for their help in writing this bill, and the superb staff work on both sides of the aisle in putting it together. b1700 This Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies bill provides $54 billion in discretionary funding this year, which is $2.6 billion below fiscal year 2017. We have done our best to be good stewards of our constituents’ hard earned and very precious tax dollars. We fund critical programs in this bill while cutting or freezing lower priority programs. One of the main priorities of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies bill is to fund both Federal and local law enforcement agencies. Our bill provides the FBI with $8.8 billion, which is a $92 million increase over the budget request. The FBI has done a superb job in protecting this Nation against espionage, cybercrime, terrorism, and hate crimes. The threats against our security are real and evolving. We have done our best in this bill to make sure that the FBI has the resources it needs to continue to protect this great Nation. The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies bill also provides increases across all other Federal law enforcement agencies, Mr. Chairman, to enhance their capabilities, to combat illegal immigration, violent crime, and go after human and opioid traffickers. Unfortunately, Houston, Texas, is a center of human trafficking. And our legislation makes sure that all Federal agencies have the resources they need to combat these modern human slavers. We have provided funding for 65 new immigration judge teams to reduce the 500,000 immigration case backlog; we have got a $22 million increase in here, Mr. Chairman, for U.S. attorneys, an $88 million increase for U.S. marshals, a $98 million increase for the DEA, and a $35 million increase for ATF. We have also provided strong funding for priority State and local law enforcement programs that protect women and children and help support our local police officers. I am especially grateful, and I want to say a special thank you, to all of the first responders who saved so many lives in Houston and across southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana. Our first responders have been absolutely magnificent in helping protect the people of Texas, and I know they will be there for the people of Puerto Rico and Florida. Our legislation includes $527 million to fight human trafficking and protect women against violence. We have provided $72.5 million to help protect missing and exploited children. We have provided $500 million for the Byrne JAG program to help local law enforcement agencies and $220 million to help 
reimburse State and local agencies for housing criminal aliens. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chair, the bill also provides $19.9 billion for NASA, which is a $218 million increase, and the bill advances space exploration and ensures America will remain the world leader in space exploration and technology. The bill makes sure that the human spaceflight program is fully funded and that we will have Americans launched back into space on Americanbuilt rockets as soon as humanly possible. The bill does not adopt the proposed cut to the National Science Foundation, and we have continued to fund basic scientific research. We have included numerous oversight provisions, Mr. Chairman, to protect hardearned taxpayer dollars, and we have also continued provisions included in previous year bills to protect our Second Amendment rights. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for the time and urge all Members to support the CJS bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the distinguished Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Initially, I want to say that I hope that very soon, in a bipartisan way, we will bring a DACA bill to this floor. Let me quote what President Trump said last night. Trump tweeted that he wanted to ‘‘legalize DACA,’’ another call to action, and further muddled where the administration stood and what it would do. He said: We need to come together and do this, and we really have no choice. Now, I want to speak about this bill. As the chairman knows, and as the ranking member knows, I served on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years, so I have taken leave of absence because I am one of the leaders on our side of the aisle. For most of those years, we worked in a bipartisan fashion. This is a partisan bill. It is sad, and it is not regular order at all. Regular order is doing one bill after another until you have passed the 12 bills. In fact, I don’t think I have ever seen this process done in this fashion. When I was the majority leader, the first year we passed all 12 bills individually, discretely, separately, and sent them to the Senate before the August break. HALROGERS , the former chairman of this committee, said of the President’s budget: ‘‘While we have a responsibility to reduce our Federal deficit, I am disappointed that many of the reductions and eliminations proposed in the President’s skinny budget are draconian, careless and counterproductive.’’ I think the same could be applied to the budget that is before us. The omnibus appropriations package the House is considering this week is, as all of us here recognize—all of us recognize—the chairman, I have great respect for, and I am not going to ask him publicly whether he thinks the Senate is going to adopt any one of these bills, but I know his answer. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, let me say to my colleagues, this is not the way to do it. JOHNMCCAINgave a compelling speech on the floor of the United States Senate as he was challenged with a brain tumor and thinking deeply about what we ought to do. And he said: We need to act together. We need to be bipartisan. We need to do the people’s work in a way they expect us to do it: together. Mr. Chairman, this bill is not going to get a Democratic vote. That is sad. It is sad for the House; it is sad for the country; and it is sad for the people who will be shortchanged by this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I urge the majority party to return to the table, as surely we will, to work in a bipartisan fashion to construct bills that we can all be proud of. There will be compromises. We won’t get all that we want, but they will be bills that the American people can be proud of and that this House can be proud of. Let us return to the bipartisan comity and respect for one another that so long prevailed in the Appropriations Committee. How sad we have fallen to this place. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CARTER ), the chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations. As I learned this morning, he is a true son of Houston, whose eloquence and compassion we heard this morning. Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Mr. FRELING HUYSEN and Mrs. L OWEY for all the work that we did together on this bill. The whole bill is a good bill. It deserves this House’s support. But I am here to present the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018, which, in turn, deserves your support. This is a good bill that is essentially for the security of our Nation. It not only funds vital security and law enforcement capabilities, but it also restores funding for critical Federal assistance grant programs and disaster relief. As importantly, it provides the oversight essential to ensure the Department’s actions are in accordance with congressional intent. Let’s look at it. For CBP, $1.6 billion for 74 miles of border wall construction that was previously included in the Make America Secure Appropriations Act that was passed in July. In addition to the funding for the wall construction, this bill will fund additional border patrol agents and virtually all of the technology, infrastructure, and assets needed for the security of our borders. For ICE, this bill funds 44,000 detention beds; 10,000 more beds than were funded in 2016; almost 4,700 more than the number funded in 2017. This bill will strengthen ICE’s ability to enforce immigration laws and conduct investigations into human trafficking, child exploitation, and transnational crime. For TSA, although the bill does not include the proposed increase in aviation security fees, it fully funds required transportation security screeners. For the Coast Guard, all major acquisition programs are funded at the required level: the polar icebreaker, the offshore patrol cutter, and the fast response cutter. For FEMA, the bill fully funds the request for disaster assistance. It restores nearly $940 million to the Federal assistance for first responder grants and education training exercises. Additionally, the bill fully funds all cybersecurity acquisition requirements at the requested levels, fully funds the Secret Service, and fully funds EVerify. In conclusion, my colleagues, this bill strengthens the security of our Nation. It also sends a powerful message that if you break our Nation’s laws and cross the border illegally, you will suffer the consequences: apprehension and a guaranteed stay in detention. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), the ranking member of the Committee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank our ranking member for yielding, and I thank her and our chairman for their good work. I must still rise, however, in opposition to the fiscal 2018 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies bill, and the Republican Omnibus bill. I want to stress, Mr. Chairman, that I am heartened, as I imagine every Member of this body is heartened, by the bipartisan cooperation we have been able to muster to reach out to our neighbors in Texas and Louisiana who have been so devastated. It is the same kind of solidarity and cooperation that I know we will muster, whatever the need is after Irma reaches our shores. We anticipate that storm with a great deal of concern and apprehension. We have a history in this body of pulling together when it matters for our neighbors whenever disasters strike. That kind of cooperation is absolutely essential to who we are as a country and who we are as an institution. Mr. Chair, I want to urge that we bring that same spirit of cooperation, 
that same understanding of the historic cooperation that has characterized appropriations, to our larger appropriations challenge. After all, this is the power of the purse. This is our main constitutional power, and history shows it works best when it is exercised cooperatively, no matter who the President is or what the party division is. We need to work in a cooperative fashion to make sure that this power is just as effectively and responsibly exercised as possible. This eightbill exercise in which we are engaged today is a deeply flawed process. We need to overcome this, and I believe eventually we will, with a bipartisan budget agreement such as we have had each of the last 4 years. This will let us cooperatively write appropriations bills that address our country’s needs. But that is not where we are today, Mr. Chairman. I do want to give the chairman of our subcommittee, MARIO DIAZBALART of Florida, credit for an open and collaborative process, but he and the subcommittee have been dealt an inadequate hand. We simply can’t do what needs to be done with this allocation. In the case of the THUD bill, we have only appropriated $56.5 billion for vital transportation, housing and community development programs, and that is $1.1 billion less than the enacted level. We have got to do better than this. We have got to do right by our country’s infrastructure needs. One of the most egregious omissions in this bill is funding for the TIGER program. This is a program that has addressed infrastructure needs across our country. Estimates are that we are addressing only 5 percent of the meritorious projects put forward under TIGER. I can tell you about one project we are funding. I visited it last week: Union Station in Raleigh, North Carolina, a beautiful multimodal facility that is going to facilitate passenger rail, transit, buses, intermodal transportation, and it is going to revitalize a landmark downtown district. b1715 That is an ideal use of TIGER funds. Communities all over this country need that sort of investment, yet this bill zeros that program out completely. It also cuts New Starts for transit— Capital Investment Grants—by $659 million. Now, I give the chairman credit for including bill language to ensure that the FTA continues to rate and review projects in the New Starts pipeline, but at this funding level, only a few of those projects can actually be funded. Our cities across this country are eager to institute transit programs. They have gone through all the steps to do this responsibly. We need to keep faith with those communities by improving on this aspect of our bill. Over at HUD, the Choice Neighborhoods program—formerly called HOPE VI—that has transformed dozens of public housing developments into thriving, mixedincome communities, receives only $20 million in this bill compared to $137 million in the fiscal ’17 bill. Now, I recognize this is a placeholder amount, and I look forward to working to improve this number moving forward. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Additionally, the Community Development Block Grant and HOME programs are each cut by $100 million in this bill despite bipartisan calls from local elected officials across the country to preserve those funding streams. We are in the midst of a housing crisis nationally. Only one in four people eligible for Federal rental assistance can receive it. We have a huge public housing capital backlog, and our infrastructure continues to crumble, resulting in decaying highways and bridges and congested roads. We should be increasing our commitment to meet these housing and transportation needs, not shortchanging them. We have done this for far too long already. We have returned again and again to appropriations, especially domestic appropriations, to bear the whole brunt of deficit reduction. The results are a disaster for our economy and for the work of our appropriations committees. It is truly the worst of both worlds. We are not really addressing the main drivers of the deficit, yet we are doing untold damage to critical national investments. I strongly object also to several policy riders in this bill. They unnecessarily attack highspeed rail, they roll back transportation safety, and they harm labor rights. No number of amendments offered today can fix this bill. I remain hopeful that ultimately we can get a serious budget agreement. In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to reject this omnibus bill. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ), who is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee’s Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, it is my distinct honor to bring to the House floor the fiscal year 2018 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Before I go into the details of the bill, I would like to commend Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for his commitment to the appropriations process. Under Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN ’s leadership, the committee has moved its bills through the full committee and is now bringing all 12 fiscal year 2018 bills to the House floor. As reported by the Appropriations Committee, the fiscal year 2018 Interior and Environment bill is funded at $31.456 billion, which is $824 million below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $4.3 billion above the budget request. This legislation makes a concerted effort to prioritize critical needs within our allocation while also addressing specific interests and concerns brought to our attention through more than 5,000 individual Member requests. In the interest of time, I won’t outline all of the programs and activities funded in this bill, but I would like to point out a few highlights. The committee has provided robust wildland fire funding in this bill. Fire suppression accounts are again fully funded at the 10year average level, and the bill increases funding for hazardous fuels reduction. The bill funds the Payments in Lieu of Taxes, PILT, program at the fiscal year 2017 enacted level. Rural counties in 49 of the 50 States rely on these funds to make up for lost tax revenue. Overall, funding for the EPA is reduced by $534 million, or 6.5 percent, from last year. This legislation provides $5 billion worth of investment in water infrastructure through funding in the WIFIA program and the Clean Water and Drinking Water revolving loan funds. This bill also provides increases to accelerate the cleanup of contaminated Superfund and Brownfield sites. These programs help create jobs and spur economic development in communities across the country. The bill provides $2.9 billion for the National Park Service. It increases the construction account by $10 million and maintains increases provided last year to address longstanding park operations and deferred maintenance needs. We have also addressed a number of concerns within the Fish and Wildlife Service accounts. The bill restores core programs and popular grant programs to fiscal year 2017 enacted levels. It also restores funds to combat international wildlife trafficking, protects fish hatcheries from cuts and closures, continues funding to fight invasive mussels and Asian carp, and reduces the backlog of species that are recovered but not yet delisted. The bill provides $275 million for Land and Water Conservation Fund programs that enjoy bipartisan support. The West Coast, and my home State of California in particular, is counting on the expertise of the USGS to make earthquake early warning systems operational. This bill provides $10.2 million for this public safety program that will protect millions of lives and critical infrastructure. The bill also makes critical investments in Indian Country—a top priority of the committee. It honors our commitment to Native Americans with particular emphasis on Indian health, law enforcement, education, and water settlements. 
In closing, I would like to thank the staff on both sides of the aisle who have worked long hours on this legislation. On the minority side, I would like to thank Rita Culp, Jocelyn Hunn, and Rebecca Taylor. On the majority side, I would like to thank Darren Benjamin, Betsy Bina, Jason Gray, Jackie Kilroy, Kristin Richmond, and Dave LesStrang, our chief clerk from the committee staff; as well as on my personal staff, Ian Foley, Rebecca Keightley, Tricia Evans, and Dave Kennett for a job well done. Lastly, I would like to thank my good friend and ranking member, BETTY MCCOLLUM , for working with me to address a number of critical needs throughout the bill. While we may disagree on some issues, we are never disagreeable with each other and we continue to work well together. Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill, and I urge its adoption. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ), who is the outstanding ranking member of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill. While I am glad to see the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies bill on the floor, this is the first time it has been considered with amendments since the 2010 appropriations cycle. But even with that, I cannot support the underlying bill. I will be blunt. This process is a sham. The combined omnibus would violate the Budget Control Act caps. It triggers a sequester of $72 billion from the Department of Defense. I am troubled to see the LaborHHS bill, once again, bearing the brunt of Republican budget cuts. The overall cuts to nondefense discretionary spending is $8 billion, and the LaborHHS bill is cut by more than $5 billion. This cut, by the way, is completely unnecessary because the allocations that we approved are approximately $5 billion below what they have said we need for nondefense spending, which is allowed under the Budget Control Act. We have the resources available, yet the majority refuses to allocate them to the essential programs funded through this bill. I will also note that when adjusting for inflation, the LaborHHS bill is approximately $30 billion below what it was in 2010. Instead of moving this bill, we ought to be negotiating a bipartisan budget deal to lift the sequestration caps on both defense and nondefense programs, then we could begin working on a bipartisan basis to draft a reasonable LaborHHS bill that adequately funds the programs that support the middle class. The biggest economic challenge of our time is that too many people are in jobs that just don’t pay them enough to live on. The programs in this bill provide opportunities for hardworking Americans to improve themselves and for our economy to grow. We need a country that works for the middle class and the vulnerable, not just the wealthy and those with the most lobbyists. Right now, we grow jobs, but not incomes. The Federal Government has long played a key role in helping American workers learn and grow through workforce development and connecting businesses with talent. But the programs that help grow our economy, educate our students, and protect our women and seniors cannot operate if the LaborHHS bill is starved for funding, which is why I oppose the underlying bill. I admit that there are a few bright spots. I strongly support the increases for NIH research, emergency preparedness, special education, and the TRIO and GEAR UP programs. Unfortunately, the modest increases in this bill are far outweighed by decimating cuts to programs that ought to be seeing increases. This bill fails our students and is fundamentally antiteacher. It fails to make new investments in Title I. It eliminates $2 billion for supporting effective instruction grants—what that is is teacher training. This bill’s approach to women’s health pushes a dangerous and harmful ideological agenda and eliminates funding for Title X Family Planning. It also eliminates the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, and it includes ideological riders that would block funding for Planned Parenthood and effectively block lifesaving research that use stem cells from fetal tissue. The bill cuts access to the Mental Health Block Grant and the Substance Abuse Prevention Program. It cuts nurse training, tobacco prevention, and it completely eliminates the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative. It hurts workers by eliminating the Employment Service, which helped nearly 6 million unemployed workers, including veterans, find jobs in 2015. It eliminates grants expanding the highly effective Registered Apprenticeship model that connects jobseekers with goodpaying jobs that employers are desperate to fill. It also cuts funding for other job training programs like Job Corps and the Dislocated Workers Program. Why would we eliminate programs that for so long have been about economic opportunity and a ladder to the middle class? There are the riders, which I mentioned. This bill blocks funding for the Affordable Care Act. It continues to prohibit funding for gun violence prevention, which has had a chilling effect on gun violence research. Finally, it prohibits the Department of Labor from ensuring that financial advisers act in the best interests of their clients. This week we expect to see several more harmful riders added to the bill. At full committee markup, we proposed more than 40 amendments to strengthen and improve this bill, but the majority rejected all of them. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this minibus because the funding in this bill fails to meet our country’s needs, and it breaks our promises to women, to seniors, to students, and to our workforce. While I am strongly opposed to this bill, I do want to thank the committee staff—majority and minority—the ranking member; the chair of the committee; and the chair of the subcommittee, Mr. COLE. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ). Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON ) for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN  and Interior Subcommittee Chairman CALVERT for their strong leadership and good work on this legislation and to thank them for this opportunity to speak today. I rise to advocate on behalf of the U.S. national forests and their upkeep, specifically through the capital improvements and maintenance program. This program provides funding to pave our national forest roads, such as those within the Uwharrie National Forest located in my district. Each year, the U.S. Forest Service is given funding to maintain roadways across our Nation. While they do their best to sustain roadways and trail access points, they can only do so much with the resources they are given. These roadways are an integral part of ensuring critical public access to our U.S. forestlands. Unfortunately, many of our national forest roadways have become severely eroded from travel, age, and the elements. The erosion has created problems for those who visit the Uwharrie National Forest as well as those who access these roads to travel to and from their homes. First responders have also not been able to reach residents in emergencies due to road conditions in recent years, causing major safety risks for people who live along these roads. I emphasize this is more than just a headache for these residents, it is a real safety issue. I have seen roads firsthand after storms, and there is no way fire trucks and ambulances can access these roads in their current condition, and I believe it is completely unacceptable. I have been advocating on behalf of the Uwharrie National Forest since my first term in Congress, and I will continue to engage with local, State, and Federal stakeholders on this issue. b1730 I appreciate Chairman CALVERT ’s attention to this issue and his support for 
the Capital Improvement and Maintenance program. I look forward to working together with the chairman to find a longterm solution to this issue. Mr. CALVERT. Reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for drawing the House’s attention to the road construction and maintenance needs of the Forest Service. I would be pleased to work with him and anyone else interested in our national forests as we move through the FY 2018 spending process. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. VISCLOSKY ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Defense. (Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I extend my gratitude to Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , Ranking Member LOWEY , Chairman D IAZBALART , Ranking Member PRICE, and all of our staff for their very hard work in crafting the transportation portion of the underlying bill. I am pleased that, in comparison to the President’s budget, this bill includes a $500 million increase for the Capital Investment Grant program. This program provides critical funding to transit projects throughout our Nation. While this funding increase is encouraging, it is my hope that a higher number can be agreed to in conference. The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved a funding level of $2.1 billion, and I strongly believe that the chairs and ranking members have demonstrated a commitment to providing robust funding for transportation investments to grow jobs and our economy. I am particularly grateful for the inclusion of report language that protects those in the queue for CIG projects and that the Senate Appropriations Committee has also approved similar language. I was alarmed that the President’s budget sought to eliminate funding for projects that had not yet received full funding grant agreements. I would emphasize that 23 States currently have CIG projects, and this language would undermine the millions of dollars and years’ worth of human capital these communities have invested. These projects are an investment in our national economy. These projects connect people in our communities to educational and job opportunities and allow businesses to grow and thrive. It is absolutely critical that we prioritize these investments in transportation infrastructure. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking the chairman of the full committee, the ranking member of the full committee, certainly the ranking member of the subcommittee, and the staff for the tremendous assistance they provided in putting together this rather large and complex piece of legislation. It is fair to note for the record that the allocation we received of $156 billion is $5 billion less than we had last year. While our lower allocation this year forced us to make some difficult decisions, I want to remind my colleagues that the cuts we are making today amount to barely 3 percent of what we spent last year and is essentially what we spent in fiscal year 2016. The bill before us today focuses on key national priorities: investing in biomedical research to find cures for diseases like Alzheimer’s and cancer; ensuring our country is fully prepared and able to protect our citizens from disease outbreaks or bioterrorism; continuing to support early childhood education, particularly for those at risk; helping firstgeneration college students prepare for, access, and complete a postsecondary education; and continuing to support people living with disabilities. The bill also preserves funds for popular programs like career and technical education, support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, programs to help Native Americans, the AmeriCorps program, LIHEAP, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The National Institutes of Health, our Nation’s premier biomedical research agency, is funded at $1.1 billion above last year. NIH is working to find cures for Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, and develop the next generation of medical treatment through the use of precision medicine techniques. We need to continue to build upon the $2 billion increase provided in the omnibus last year. I view this proposal as a floor, not a ceiling, for biomedical research funding. I am hopeful that this number can increase as the process moves forward. Biodefense and preparedness programs, including new funding to prevent a pandemic flu from occurring, are increased across the bill. We are all aware of the terrible toll prescription drugs and opioid abuse is taking on our Nation. I am proud to say this bill includes another $500 million to continue comprehensive grant programs to enable States, localities, and tribes to develop antiopioid initiatives focused on prevention, education, and treatment and recovery services. Head Start receives a $22 million increase in this bill. Preschool programs are continued at $250 million. Childcare programs receive a $4 million increase. Special education programs for students with disabilities are increased by $200 million, which will help local school districts ease the financial burden of providing specialized educational services. TRIO and GEAR UP, which help disadvantaged students prepare for and complete college, receive increases of $60 million and $10 million, respectively, over last year. The bill also includes $500 million for the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grant program. These funds can be used flexibly by school districts across the country, whether the need is in the area of counseling, computer science instruction, or teacher training and arts programming. Pell grants are maintained at a maximum of $5,920. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. COLE. I will also note that this is an initial allocation and the beginning of the congressional funding process. As always, I look forward to working with our counterparts in the Senate and my friends across the aisle to see if there are additional areas where we can cooperate. Finally, I want to note that the bill protects human life by continuing longstanding prohibitions against Federal tax dollars being used to pay for abortions, including new provisions to ensure that no tax dollars are used for research on human fetal tissue obtained by an abortion. This bill represents a balanced approach that will benefit every American and maintain the appropriate stewardship of taxpayer dollars that we have been entrusted with as Members of Congress. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. ROYBAL ALLARD ), ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. Ms. ROYBALALLARD. Mr. Chairman, the FY 2018 Department of Homeland Security funding bill addresses many bipartisan priorities, including maintaining funding for first responder and antiterrorism grants and the Emergency Food and Shelter Program. It provides increases above the request for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, Nonprofit Security grants, new Coast Guard assets, and ICE child exploitation investigations. It also restores funding for Science and Technology Centers of Excellence. The bill restores funding for flood mapping grants, which the administration proposed to eliminate, and funding for predisaster mitigation grants, for which the administration proposed a 60 percent cut. These grants support precisely the kinds of programs that help communities mitigate and prepare for the impacts of natural disasters like Hurricane Harvey, and we should be investing in them even more. The bill also provides the President’s request for the Disaster Relief Fund. We will, however, need to appropriate more money beyond that approved by the House earlier today in order to address the damage caused by Harvey and, potentially, Irma. While there is much in this bill Democrats can support, unfortunately, for several reasons, we cannot support this bill. For example, we cannot support the bill’s $705 million increase for 
Interior immigration enforcement. This includes an increase of 4,676 detention beds, which is 10,000 above fiscal year 2016, and the hiring of 1,000 additional ICE officers and agents. The administration says its more aggressive enforcement approach is critical to national security and public safety. In fact, ICE is now arresting people with no criminal infractions who have lived, worked, and paid taxes in this country for years—and even decades. These arrests are not required for national security or public safety. They have tragic consequences for families and communities all over this country. The trauma being inflicted on them cannot be overstated. Mr. Chairman, we are dealing with a moral question as much as a legal one. ICE has the discretion to enforce our immigration laws fairly and justly, and Congress has the discretion to prioritize how we spend taxpayer dollars. Instead of overly aggressive immigration enforcement, we should be investing more in real security vulnerabilities. These include cybersecurity, human trafficking investigations, Coast Guard vessels and aircraft, flood mapping, and predisaster mitigation. We should invest in more Customs officers. We should restore funding for research and laboratory facilities at the Science and Technology Directorate and for TSA’s Law Enforcement Officer Reimbursement Program. Unfortunately, we are not doing any of this. However, before concluding, I want to take a moment to talk about the Trump administration’s announcement yesterday on ending the DACA program. An amendment I offered in committee to clarify the basic authority of DHS to continue the program failed on a partyline vote. It would have given Congress time to enact a more formal authorization and given DREAMers the peace of mind of knowing they would not have to go back into the shadows. With the administration’s announcement yesterday, that peace of mind has been cruelly snatched away. We shouldn’t wait 6 months to fix this problem. The majority should bring my bipartisan, bicameral bill, the DREAM Act, to the floor as soon as possible so that DREAMers can continue to contribute to this country free of the fear of being deported from the only home they know. In closing, Mr. Chairman, I want to extend my appreciation for the efforts of the subcommittee chairman, Chairman CARTER , and his staff, who worked with the minority throughout the development of this bill. Consistent with prior years, Chairman CARTER has carried out his responsibilities honorably, fairly, and collaboratively. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DIAZ BALART ), chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations. Mr. DIAZBALART. Mr. Chairman, before I begin, I want to thank the chairman, our members, colleagues, and the leadership for being so understanding. Tomorrow, I will be heading back to south Florida to be there in case this horrible storm does head our way. Again, everyone has been incredibly supportive and shown great solidarity. I am exceedingly grateful for that. I rise today to express the strongest possible support for this bill. I applaud the leadership of Chairman FRELING HUYSEN for making it possible to consider it on the floor today. I would like to highlight some of the vital issues in this bill. The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies division provides $56.5 billion in discretionary budget authority. That is $1.1 billion below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level, but it is $8.6 billion above the budget request. We have targeted transportation and housing funding to essential investments in safety, infrastructure, and assistance for our most vulnerable citizens: the elderly; the disabled; and, yes, America’s heroes, our veterans. We also had to prioritize by reducing or eliminating nonessential programs and scaling back administrative accounts. For the Department of Transportation, the bill includes $17.8 billion in discretionary appropriations and $76.7 billion in total resources. That includes support for the FAST Act obligation limitations. The Federal Aviation Administration is funded at $16.6 billion, Mr. Chairman. We provide this increase to keep advancing NextGen programs with over $1 billion and to continue to operate the safest, most complex, most advanced air traffic control system in the world. The bill reflects FAST Act priorities for highways, rail, and transit. It includes $45 billion in road and bridge funding from the highway trust fund, which is almost $1 billion above fiscal year 2017 levels. This funding will provide muchneeded improvements to America’s highways and bridges. The bill provides $2.2 billion to the Federal Railroad Administration to continue our commitment to rail safety and to make critical infrastructure investments. This includes FAST Act rail infrastructure investments to address the state of good repair backlog, which we really need to address. As a reflection of tough choices, Mr. Chairman, our funding level for transit Capital Investment Grants is $600 million below the 2017 level. b1745 But we have, and this is important, included funding and direction to keep upcoming projects in the pipeline. For housing programs, we work to ensure that we continue assistance to our most vulnerable population. The bill includes $38.3 billion for Department of Housing and Urban Development. The bill also includes significant increases to keep pace with inflation, almost $1 billion above last year, for direct rental assistance to maintain, again, housing for those who are currently served. Homeless assistance remains a top priority in this bill. We included funding at the enacted level and well above the budget request. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida. Mr. DIAZBALART. Mr. Chairman, the bill restores a number of programs that Members, frankly, from both sides of the aisle made sure that we were aware of. The bill restores a number of community development programs that were proposed for elimination in the budget request, including CDBG and HOME. Again, we listened to Members from both sides of the aisle, and we made sure that that was a priority in this bill. These programs, again, support decisionmaking at the local level where it should be. Before I close, I want to thank the hardworking and talented staff who helped put this together, the subcommittee staff. I was going to read their names, and again, I know I am running out of time, but I think this is the best staff anywhere in Congress. I also want to thank my personal staff, my chief of staff, Miguel Mendoza, who is the deputy chief of staff as well, and from the minority staff, Joe Carlile and Angela, and so many others who have worked handinhand with my committee staff. And I would be remiss if I did not, in particular, thank Mr. PRICE, the ranking member. He has been great to work with, work cooperatively. I ask for your favorable support of this bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, let me just say I believe that we are missing out on the opportunity to effectively do our jobs. As elected Members of Congress, we are here to fight for what is right, what is fair, and what is just. When presented with the administration’s budget, it is Congress that is charged to serve as the first line of defense for the needs of the American people. And the agriculture bill before us, as a part of this omnibus, is our attempt at doing just that. However, the progress made in the agriculture bill will end here because we do not have a budget resolution to conference, and it is entangled with other very contentious bills, and that is most unfortunate. 
financial freedom for all Americans. Now, I believe this bill will make America prosperous again. So I want to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , all the subcommittee chairs, the full committee staff, the minority staff, and ranking members. This whole team has been great to work with, but it is important to thank my subcommittee. They have been through a lot of hard work with me, Mr. Chairman, and they have done a great job working with me and the many hours of hard work and weekends that they put in. Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge every Member to support this bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM ), ranking member of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. (Ms. MCCOLLUM asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I would like to just take a brief second and thank the full committee chair and the full committee ranking member for their support as we move forward in this progress, and a special thank you to all the great staff on both sides of the aisle, the Democratic and Republican staff. But my very special thanks to Chairman CALVERT , and once again, for his staff and our staff, for their work in an open and collaborative approach. This committee has a challenging portfolio of issues, and I commend the chairman’s efforts to find solutions in yet another difficult budget year. Unfortunately, the fiscal year 2018 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee allocation is $824 million less than last year’s enacted level. b1800 This devastating cut to the allocation shortchanges the protection of our Nation’s natural and cultural resources and has real consequences for American families and communities. Adequate funding for the Interior, Environment division is critical at a time when the Trump administration is attacking the science behind climate change and rolling back regulations that protect the water we drink and the air we breathe. We are at a defining moment in history. Our lack of action to combat climate change now will impact the world we pass on to our children and grandchildren. We can no longer afford to disregard the overwhelming scientific evidence that the planet is warming, sea levels are rising, and glaciers are melting. We have all seen the destruction inflicted by Hurricane Harvey. As the waters recede, the Environmental Protection Agency is playing a key role in keeping Americans safe. Once again, we are reminded of the importance of agencies like the EPA both during times of crisis and on a daily basis. Unfortunately, EPA receives the most significant programmatic cuts to this division. Slashing the Environmental Protection Agency by $534 million will severely impact the Agency’s ability to protect human health and safety and ensure clean air and clean water for all Americans. The Agency’s budget is already $2.2 billion below FY10 levels. It is irresponsible to cut the EPA even further. The bill also cuts programs critical to managing public lands and reduces funding necessary for endangered species listing protection. The American people expect us to be good stewards of our public lands and wildlife, but this bill falls short on that commitment. Despite the bill’s shortcomings in environmental protection and resource conservation, I want to express how proud I am of this subcommittee’s nonpartisan approach to addressing issues facing our Native American brothers and sisters. I am pleased that the bill recommends an increase of $108 million over the fiscal year 2017 enacted level for programs critical to Indian Country. The health, education, and safety of tribal communities is a Federal responsibility that our subcommittee takes very seriously. That is one bright spot in this bill. Unfortunately, this bill falls far short in too many other areas, both as a result of our low allocation and as a result of wildfire suppression costs that are burning a hole in this bill. Since the start of this year, more than 1.1 million acres have burned. As a result, the U.S. Forest Service does not have adequate funding in the current fiscal year to combat these disasters. They will need to borrow funds from nonfire accounts, making it harder for the Service to conduct preparedness activities to reduce the severity of wildfires. That is why every member of the Interior Subcommittee is a cosponsor of Chairman SIMPSON ’s Wildfire Disaster Funding Act. I am very disappointed that the majority’s leadership missed an opportunity to include those commonsense reforms in this legislation. That is why I have called for emergency funding for wildfire suppression activities in the next disaster supplemental. Finally, in addition to the irresponsible cuts to the EPA and natural resource programs, I must express my concern and disappointment with the partisan riders in this bill that pander to special interests at the expense of the public good. These riders jeopardize protection and recovery for vulnerable species, restrict protection of our oceans, undermine clean water and clean air safeguards, and even prevent the development of renewable energy. Mr. Chairman, this bill is not sufficient to meet the needs of the American people. I know that we can do better than this. Congress needs a bipartisan budget agreement that increases nondefense discretionary spending levels. Despite my current opposition, I want to be clear that I will continue to work with Chairman CALVERT through this year’s appropriations process to produce a responsible bill that both parties can support. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH), the chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the gentleman from New Jersey, for yielding me time. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to support H.R. 3354, the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act of 2018, which includes the CommerceJusticeScience funding bill that provides appropriations for many of the programs within the Science, Space, and Technology Committee’s jurisdiction. Chairman CULBERSON has worked closely with us on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee to include responsible, proscience funding levels for NASA, the National Science Foundation, NOAA, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. His consultation and cooperation are much appreciated. I thank Chairman CULBER SON and his clerk, John Martens, for their leadership in passing this legislation that sets America on a path to remain the world’s leader in innovation. The appropriations included in this legislation are consistent with the NASA Transition Authorization Act, the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act, and the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act, all three of which were enacted into law earlier this year. The CJS bill fully funds the planetary science and exploration programs at NASA, implements a national interest standard for every NSF grant, and increases weather research and commercial data use to improve forecasting to save lives and property, which is especially timely today. Later, I will offer an amendment, with Chairman CULBERSON ’s support, to increase basic research in the physical and biological sciences at the National Science Foundation. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this proscience, fiscally responsible appropriations bill. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY ), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government. Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding. I want to thank Mrs. LOWEY and the chairman for their leadership throughout the appropriations process. Mr. Chairman, as ranking member of the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee, I also thank Chairman GRAVES , whom I have gotten to know and work more closely with over the last few months. Our discussions have been both passionate and 
productive, and I thank Chairman GRAVES for his willingness to compromise on shared priorities. Of course, I would like to thank Dena, Kelly, Ariana, Marybeth, and Brad on the majority staff and our talented staff director, Lisa, on the minority staff for all of the time and effort they spent working together to putting the FSGG portion of the bill together. And to my own staff, Doug, who writes these things and doesn’t put his own name on there, I want to thank him anyway. Unfortunately, the FSGG portion of the bill before us will make it more difficult for us to grow small businesses, enforce consumer protections, and promote good governance. With $1.6 billion in cuts from fiscal year 2017, many successful and established programs will suffer. The Small Business Administration is cut by $39 million, with most coming from reductions to entrepreneurial programs that assist millions of small business owners. The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund is cut by $58 million, or 28 percent, which means fewer resources to spur economic growth and revitalize our most underserved and neglected communities. GSA has zero funds to start new construction and completely rescinds the money provided in the FY17 omnibus for the new FBI headquarters, compromising our national security. And the IRS, which has already lost over a billion dollars in funding and 18,000 staff over the past 7 years, is further weakened by additional cuts that weaken the agency’s ability to close the tax gap, catch tax cheats, and provide sufficient services for honest taxpayers. In addition, the FSGG bill contains a long list of policy riders that will undermine enforcement of the Affordable Care Act, restrict the ability for a woman to make personal healthcare decisions, and block the District of Columbia from using local funds to make local decisions. Furthermore, this bill contains 88 pages of authorizing text to repeal key provisions of DoddFrank and weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Less than a decade ago, a financial crisis sparked the biggest global recession since the Great Depression and pushed our economy to the brink of collapse. No serious person would argue that the status quo, which almost crippled our economy, was working before the crisis. We need to make our financial markets safer, more transparent, and more accountable, and that is exactly what DoddFrank did. Lastly, as I mentioned in my testimony before the Rules Committee, it is worth mentioning again how disappointed I am that the Rules Committee decided to unilaterally strip a provision agreed to by the committee. Congressman AGUILAR ’s language, which passed by voice vote in the course of committee markup, was adopted according to regular order. The provision is straightforward. It simply clarifies that DACA recipients be eligible for Federal employment. Yet, without any explanation, this section has disappeared as if it never existed. Given the administration’s shameful decision to rescind the DACA program, I anticipate that we will rigorously debate this issue over the next couple days. Again, while I cannot support this bill, I remain committed to working with my colleagues on the majority side to strengthen funding and remove harmful and unnecessary riders. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE) for the purpose of three colloquies. Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS), my colleague, for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have become increasingly aware of the problem with hospitalacquired pressure ulcers. Research shows millions of people suffer from this condition and that 60,000 hospital patients a year die because of this painful ailment. Eleven percent of those affected are our veterans. Their suffering is tremendous, and the cost of this condition to our health system could be as high as $25 billion. However, with proper commonsense prevention and better management of these infections, the number of those suffering and the cost of treatment can be greatly reduced. I have reached out to CMS about doing a pilot program that promotes better prevention and management methods, and I have discussed the problem with innovative Georgia companies. I rise today to make other Members aware of this issue and ask for your continued support in this process. Mr. COLE. I thank the gentleman for raising this issue. Along with Congressman WOODALL and Congresswoman HANDEL , you have been leaders in this effort. I appreciate what you are doing and will stay in touch as progress is made. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. As always, the gentleman is gracious, and I do appreciate it. Mr. Chairman, I will work with the administration. Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM ) for the purpose of a colloquy. Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your work on this bill providing funding to critical programs. I appreciate the opportunity to speak about the importance of the Community Services Block Grant. This program funds community action agencies that address poverty and assist seniors and other vulnerable populations in becoming selfsufficient. I have seen, in my district, the valuable services these groups provide helping people find jobs. Mr. COLE. I thank my colleague from Minnesota for speaking about the importance of this program in her district. I agree that Community Services Block Grant provides important services to help people escape poverty. The program has broad bipartisan support. As the gentlewoman knows, several challenging decisions have to be made to meet overall spending priorities and allocation. I take to heart the concern expressed by the gentlewoman and, as we move forward, I will work to ensure funding for the Community Services Block Grant reflects the priority of our Members. Ms. MCCOLLUM. I thank the chairman, my friend, for his response and commitment to robustly funding the Community Services Block Grant. I know this program, as I said, helps people across the Nation and brings great value to the communities it serves. Mr. COLE. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN ), my colleague, for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your work on this bill which provides funding to critical programs within a difficult but fiscally responsible allocation. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify on the RECORD a question I have on funding for the National Emergency Grant program. The National Emergency Grant program provides critical job training and reemployment funding for workers who have lost their jobs as a result of plant closures or mass layoffs. Does this bill fully fund the National Emergency Grant program? Mr. COLE. I thank my colleague from South Carolina for raising this important question. I agree that the National Emergency Grant program is an important bipartisan program to train workers and help them find new careers. Current year funds for the Dislocated Workers National Reserve are increased by $109 million and advance appropriations for fiscal year 2019 are eliminated, for a total of $130 million. Within that total, the National Emergency Grant program is approximately $70 million each year. It is expected that, after fully funding the National Emergency Grants, the Department of Labor will use additional funds from the Dislocated Workers National Reserve for other authorized purposes, such as technical assistance and grants to help workers dislocated from the coal industry find new employment. So the short answer to the question is, yes, the National Emergency Grant program is fully funded in this bill. Mr. NORMAN. I thank the chairman for his response and commitment to the National Emergency Grant program. I have seen firsthand the importance of this program in my district, including the recent layoffs at the VC Summer power plant and throughout the country. 
b1815 Getting people who are laid off from their jobs back to work as quickly as possible is critically important for affected communities and for the economy. I fully support this program and this bill. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CALVERT ). Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. KILMER ) for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman CALVERT and Ranking Member MCCOLLUM for supporting important policies and programs protecting the unique landscapes you find in the Pacific Northwest. Our region values Federal lands, and, likewise, we are proud to host all branches of the United States military. People come from all over to hike and travel through our forests and waterways, and we want to make sure sensitive areas are protected. The goals of protecting our environment, the economy that relies upon it, and ensuring the readiness of those serving in uniform are not mutually exclusive. For the past several years, I have been working with the Park Service, the Navy, and many other agencies to understand their missions, concerns, and interests with regard to the impact of local military jet noise. At the same time, I have worked to ensure that they can go the extra mile when it comes to public outreach on their plans. Through this effort, I have learned that the Park Service and the Navy measure noise differently. This has led to difficulty in understanding the impact of the noise on the missions of other agencies, local communities, and protected lands, such as Olympic National Park. Moreover, it complicates any basis to examine possible solutions. In order to support a factbased conversation regarding the impact of this noise, I wrote to the Council on Environmental Quality in March asking that they work with both agencies to find an agreeable method of measuring and reporting the sound of military aviation. While I have recently been notified that the CEQ is looking into the matter, I look to Chairman CALVERT for his support to ensure that the relevant parties cooperate and resolve this issue. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for drawing attention to the issue. It is my hope that we can move forward with the fiscal year 2018 process, and my colleague and I can continue to work together with the relevant agencies to address this issue so that his constituents and others around the Nation can continue to enjoy all that the Park Service and other Interior lands have to offer without compromising military readiness. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chair, I appreciate Chairman CALVERT ’s willingness to work with me on this effort. Having grown up on the Olympic Peninsula, I understand our responsibility to be stewards of the environment and to make sure that the Navy is a good neighbor. I look forward to working with the chairman, CEQ, the Park Service, and the Navy to address this issue. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ), the ranking member on the Financial Services Committee. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose H.R. 3354, a bill that not only fails to make critical investments in our Nation’s future, but also eliminates important protections for everyday Americans. As ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, I am particularly concerned that H.R. 3354 imposes such severe cuts on the Department of Housing and Urban Development that it will result in families losing their housing assistance and putting them at risk for homelessness. The bill also takes some of the worst provisions from the Republican’s ‘‘Wrong’’ CHOICE Act that would return our economy to the reckless practices that caused the financial crisis. One provision takes away the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop abusive practices by banks like Wells Fargo, which ripped off more than 3.5 million of its customers. Another provision repeals the Labor Department’s commonsense rule that protects seniors from conflicted retirement advice from unscrupulous financial advisers. There are so many gifts to Wall Street, one would think Christmas came early. But it isn’t Christmas, Mr. Chair. It is September, and we are in the middle of hurricane season. Our cities are literally under water, yet the Republican leadership has done nothing to prevent the National Flood Insurance Program from expiring at the end of the month. Republicans have also let us come dangerously close to defaulting on our debt and the obligations owed to servicemembers, veterans, seniors, and the most vulnerable among us. Just yesterday, 800,000 young Democrats were told by our President that their future is in the hands of a hostile Congress. We must oppose this bill so we can get to work on what Congress should really be doing. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CARTER ). Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. PITTENGER ), my colleague, for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chairman, earlier today the House passed a critical $8 billion disaster relief package that is intended to fund the immediate needs for Federal disaster relief. Similar to Hurricane Harvey, a year ago, eastern North Carolina was devastated by Hurricane Matthew. Our State suffered $4.8 billion in damage, including 98,000 homes and 19,000 businesses. 82,000 people have made applications to FEMA. Mr. Chairman, although the package passed by the House this morning was for Hurricane Harvey relief, can you please explain how it will be also helpful for Hurricane Matthew victims? I would like to be able to assure my constituents that Congress will continue to support their longterm disaster relief needs. Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for bringing up this issue. Last week, FEMA was forced to restrict obligations for past disasters to prioritize funding for immediate lifesaving efforts in response to Hurricane Harvey. The supplemental funding bill that passed the House this morning will enable FEMA to lift these restrictions and resume funding for longterm recovery efforts, such as those in North Carolina and other parts of our Nation. Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chair, if the gentleman will continue to yield, as we consider the great plight in Texas of Hurricane Harvey, I also want to offer my sincere thanks for the outpouring of support that my State continues to receive, that they need after the devastation of Hurricane Matthew. Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN , who has offered my State great support, and Chairman CARTER . Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ADERHOLT ). Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. YOUNG ) for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my support for REAP, the Rural Energy for America Program; the Biomass Crop Assistance Program; the Biorefinery Assistance Program as well; and for improving the changes in mandatory spending for these energy programs when this bill is conferenced with the Senate. These programs are very important to my State, other States as well. They have been used to help farmers reduce their overall operating costs and make their farming businesses more competitive. These programs have also enabled rural businesses to obtain financing assistance, ensuring rural Iowa has similar opportunities to thrive and develop. Now, I know that we have budget constraints, we are facing them, and I know the chairman had to make some tough decisions. I believe he took a very thoughtful approach to the overall agriculture appropriations bill, and I am very thankful to be on that subcommittee. 
During the full committee markup, I was pleased that the subcommittee chairman committed to working with me to find alternative offsets to reduce these spending changes. Mr. Chair, I appreciate Chairman ADERHOLT ’s attention, and I appreciate Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN ’s attention to this matter, too. Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I am very sympathetic to the gentleman from Iowa’s concerns regarding the reduction in the bill’s mandatory energy programs in the farm bill, in particular, the Rural Energy for America Program. The gentleman from Iowa is indeed a valued member of our subcommittee, and he was very instrumental in developing many parts of the overall bill, and I appreciate his input greatly. A number of factors went into our decision for which programs to reduce in order to achieve the $1.1 billion reduction in the bill’s funding level over this last year. As I did mention, as he noted, in our full committee markup, I committed to working with the gentleman from Iowa to see where we could find alternative offsets, and we will continue to do that as we move forward. So I thank the gentleman for bringing this to our attention again here on the floor of the House. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO). Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN for the work he has done with the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Chair, I rise to speak about two important sections of the funding bill: the Agriculture and the State, Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. I am pleased to support the committee’s work in addressing several crucial issues facing America’s agricultural community. I commend the committee for encouraging expansion of the foot and mouth disease vaccine supply through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at the USDA. I am also pleased to support the committee’s recognition for the critical contributions the National Animal Health Laboratory Network makes in responding to emergency threats to American Agriculture, funding the National Veterinary Stockpile, and for supporting pest management and disease research. I also want to recognize the committee’s support for citrus greening research and response, which is vital to the State of Florida’s economy. This vital program we are supporting today will provide valuable protection for our agricultural system from pests and disease, and will encourage innovative solutions to agricultural issues to the future. In regards to the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations budget, I want to first thank the committee for including language that will make the international broadcasting funds available at levels no lower than the previous year. This will ensure the administration has the ability to increase the transmissions of information into North Korea, which is critical for eroding support for Kim Jongun’s brutal regime, breaking the dictator’s stronghold on information. Finally, I want to mention foreign assistance and development. Today, America is confronting unprecedented instability and growing humanitarian crises around the world, all of which have a direct impact on our national security and economic interests at home. The U.S. Government must use each and every dollar more efficiently and effectively. This appropriations bill takes important steps in making it more effective. This investment in foreign aid can yield great returns and can help increase trade, trade that is vital not only to my State of Florida, where it supports over 2.5 million jobs, but to the entire United States. Eleven of the 15 largest importers of U.S. goods and services are countries that graduated from U.S. foreign assistance, and 12 of the 15 fastest growing markets for U.S. exports are former recipients of our aid. The State Department and U.S. development agencies work to advance America’s economic interests by promoting exports that today make up almost 13 percent of America’s $18 trillion economy and supports about one in five American jobs. We must look to cut the duplicative and ineffective programs while empowering the parts of our foreign assistance that work to become even more effective. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining on each side? I am prepared to yield back, if the gentlewoman is prepared. The ACTING CHAIR (Mr. BISHOP of Utah). The gentleman from New Jersey has 8
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from New York has 8 minutes remaining. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to engage in a colloquy with you on an important issue related to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This Congress should act swiftly and establish a fivemember, bipartisan commission at the CFPB. A commission structure will bring much needed certainty and stability to consumers and small businesses who are the most deeply impacted by regulation that reduces access to banking products and drives up costs. According to FDIC data, financial institutions of all sizes provide more than $4 trillion in consumer loans to help America’s consumers achieve their dreams of purchasing a car, buying their first home, or even providing an education for their children. Financial institutions also provide more than $600 billion in small business loans to help entrepreneurs start or grow their businesses and create jobs. The ability of banks and credit unions to continue to serve their communities by providing access to credit is critical to making these dreams a reality. Therefore, it is important that the agencies that regulate our nation’s depository institutions are stable, transparent, and provide long term certainty. A fivemember, bipartisan commission at the CFPB will help achieve just that. Right now, a sole director at the CFPB over politicizes what should be an impartial regulatory body. With every new Director there could be a dramatic regulatory whipsaw effect. This volatility will leave financial institutions limited in their ability to properly serve customers because of an inability to plan for the longterm. Protecting consumers and increasing access to wellregulated financial products should be a top priority of the CFPB. A bipartisan board will ensure consumers best interests are always first by increasing transparency and stability in the rulemaking process and allowing for more robust debate with many different viewpoints considered. On multiple occasions, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to create a bipartisan commission, and most importantly, the American people have made clear that they believe a bipartisan commission is a better form of leadership at the CFPB. In fact, a recent Morning Consult poll showed that registered voters support a bipartisan commission at the CFPB by a 3 to 1 margin, and that just 14 percent of voters believe the CFPB structure should be left the way it is now. Congress must implement structural changes at the CFPB. The future of consumer and small business lending is too vital to have uncertainty at the Bureau. Mr. Chairman, do you agree that the regulatory agencies that oversee banks and credit unions should take into account the impact to all stakeholders and bring certainty to the regulatory framework? Will you commit to working with me to depoliticize the CFPB once and for all, and bring a stable form of leadership to the Bureau that is in keeping with most other financial service regulators? Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman’s comments and all the ideas of others with regard to this out of control agency and I share his passion for bringing the CFPB under Appropriations oversight as soon as possible. This is one idea of many, and I look forward to working with the gentleman from Nevada and others in the near future as we work to protect consumers from this rogue agency in some form or fashion. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chair, I would like to extend my gratitude to Chairman FRELING HUYSEN , Ranking Member L OWEY , Chairman DIAZBALART , Ranking Member P RICE, and all of the staff for their hard work in crafting the transportation portion of this bill. It is an extremely difficult year to be tasked with funding the federal government, and I understand that tough decisions had to be made. I am pleased that in comparison to the President’s budget, this bill includes a $500 million increase for the Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program. This program provides critical funding to transit projects throughout the nation. While this funding increase is encouraging, it is my hope that a higher number 
can be agreed upon in conference. The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved a funding level of $2.1 billion, and I strongly believe that the Chairs and Ranking Members have demonstrated a commitment to providing robust funding for transportation investments to grow jobs and our economy. I also am particularly grateful for the inclusion of report language that protects the pipeline for CIG projects, and that the Senate Appropriations Committee has also approved similar language. I was alarmed that the President’s budget sought to eliminate funding for projects that had not yet received Full Funding Grant Agreements. 23 states currently have CIG projects and this language would undermine the millions of dollars and years’ worth of human capital they have invested. This language is a responsible step that provides much needed certainty to communities and shows the President that Congress is committed to keeping its word to localities that were promised matching federal funds. Funding CIG projects is an investment in national economic development. These projects connect people in our communities to educational and job opportunities and allow businesses to grow and thrive. It is absolutely critical that we prioritize these investments in transportation infrastructure. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Chair I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3354—‘‘Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, 2018’’. I am particularly concerned with Section 134 of Division H which prohibits states from setting meal break, rest break, and wage standards to protect truck drivers. On July 9, 2014, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that trucking operators in California must abide by California labor law and allow for a 30minute meal break after 5 hours of work and a 10minute rest break after 4 hours of work. This meal and rest break standard is very reasonable when you consider that truck drivers can be subject to 14 hours of onduty time. Section 134 overturns the Circuit Court’s decision and prohibits California from addressing truck driving safety with these regulations. Section 134 goes further than just overturning California’s laws, it also preempts laws in 21 states and territories that guarantee meal and rest breaks. These states include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Guam, and Puerto Rico States should be allowed to set meal and rest break standards as they see fit for the health and safety of their workers. Section 134 is additionally harmful because it attacks the wages of truck drivers. Section 134 allows trucking companies to pay truck drivers on a per load basis even if their routes are delayed for no fault of their own. This is a major problem is Southern California where truck drivers are delayed by overcrowding at the ports, by traffic on our freeways, and by delays at warehouses. A truck driver in Southern California can set out to haul 5 loads per day but only end up hauling 2 loads. California sets standards to make sure that truck drivers make at least the minimum wage and are paid for sick time. Section 134 would overturn state based wage laws and allow trucking companies to pay drivers less than the minimum wage. Section 134 should have no place in this appropriations bill because this is a legislative rider in the jurisdiction of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The Transportation Committee debated this provision during consideration of the Fast Act and it was wisely rejected by the FAST Act Conference Committee. Mr. Chair, Section 134 is opposed by the State of California, the Teamsters, truck safety groups, and the OwnerOperated Independent Truck Drivers which represent over 90 percent of the companies in the trucking industry. Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose section 134 and urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. The ACTING CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–31, modified by Rules Committee Print 115–32 and the amendment printed in part A of House Report 115–295, shall be considered as adopted, and the bill, as amended, shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of further amendment under the 5minute rule and shall be considered as read.
