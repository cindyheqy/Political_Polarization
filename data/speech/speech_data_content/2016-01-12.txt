Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed more light on President Obama’s reckless refugee resettlement agenda and the danger that it poses to Americans. In my office, we are getting many calls about this as you hear about the new plans that he has and also as our constituents watch the news of what is happening in Germany and what is happening in other communities. Let me cite just a couple of examples. 
Last week, according to The Wall Street Journal and numerous media outlets, two refugees from Iraq were arrested for making false statements involving terrorism. These arrests took place one in California and one in Texas. In the California arrest, one refugee came to the U.S. in 2012 and subsequently traveled to Syria in November 2013. He bragged in social media posts about fighting alongside terrorist groups such as Ansar alIslam. This refugee returned to the U.S. a few months later. When interviewed by the FBI in October 2014, he denied being a part of any extremist group and denied providing materiel support to terrorists. What we found in Texas is this. The refugee was charged on three counts: attempting to provide materiel support to the Islamic State, procuring citizenship or naturalization unlawfully, and making false statements. This is precisely why President Obama’s plan to admit thousands of additional Syrian refugees into the country at a time of heightened jihadist threats and the San Bernardino massacre is beyond reckless and is dangerous to our communities. There is no way to vet the refugees that are coming from Syria and Iraq and verify that they are the person represented on the documents that they carry. Are the documents false, or is the person who they say they are or someone else? It proves what many have been saying for months about Islamic extremists: they can and will exploit the refugee program. These arrests showcase what is so painfully obvious to the American people: the President’s agenda is endangering our national security, and it is costing our hardworking taxpayers millions of dollars. Let me ask you a few questions: Do you feel more or less safe than you did 8 years ago? Do you fear the attack of terrorism in your community? Do you question your safety when you go to a public event? How does the President’s foreign policy and our national security affect where you work and where you live? How can the administration be so naive? How can the administration continue to put partisan politics over the safety of the American people? How can the administration continually refuse to name our enemy? Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic extremism. We must confront the danger of radical extremism and check the President’s irresponsible resettlement agenda. I want to mention H.R. 4218. It is legislation that I drafted and introduced with Representatives BARLETTA , DESJARLAIS , and L AMAR SMITH. Under the bill, no funding would be made available for refugee resettlement operations until four conditions are met: Number one, Congress passes a joint resolution approving of the President’s refugee resettlement plan; Number two, CBO provides a report to Congress scoring the longterm cost of the program; Number three, DHS submits a report identifying all terrorists and criminal activity connected to refugees since 2001; And number four, the President submits a report to Congress on the prior year’s cost of admitting refugees and proposes offset spending cuts to pay for the resettlement program. We must halt the President’s refugee resettlement operations. It is simply too dangerous, and we cannot afford the risk to our Nation’s security. f 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS) for 5 minutes. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, January is Human Trafficking Month, and I rise today to continue to be a voice for the countless victims of human trafficking in the United States. If we, as Members of Congress, want to truly address the sex trafficking epidemic, we must face the facts. We must acknowledge and address the direct link between children in the foster care system and children who become victims of sex trafficking. For far too many children, the foster care system is an unwitting gateway to sex trafficking. This is a nationwide issue that requires a Federal response. In 2010, 59 percent of the children arrested on prostitutionrelated charges in L.A. County were in the foster care system. A 2007 report from the U.S. Department of Justice found that 85 percent of identified child sex trafficking victims in New York State also had contact with the child welfare system. Further, according to the FBI, an estimated 70 percent of child sex trafficking victims in Florida had histories with the child welfare system. Children in the foster care system are our children. When they fall victim to trafficking, it means that all of us have failed. To help all victims of trafficking, including foster youth, we must change our mindset on how we address this horrific crime. A child who cannot consent to sex should never be called a prostitute. The men who prey on them are not johns; they are child molesters. ‘‘T’’ Ortiz Walker Pettigrew is a former foster care youth who became a sex trafficking victim. When she was 15 and still in foster care, ‘‘T,’’ as she is called, was arrested for prostitution. While serving time in juvenile hall, she discovered that more than half of the girls serving with her were also charged with solicitation and, like her, forced to sell themselves. She described her treatment in juvenile hall as how you would treat a dog in a kennel. She was put in a box and kept waiting. She was treated like a criminal and did not receive any counseling or support services. Because she was punished and not helped, she was arrested again when she was 16 years old, and she spent her 17th birthday in juvenile hall. I am grateful that she found the strength and support to escape from her pimp. She now uses her voice to advocate for sex trafficking victims and to urge policymakers at all levels of government to do our jobs to prevent young girls from becoming sex trafficking victims. Because of actions from women like ‘‘T,’’ local officials in Los Angeles have changed their approach to addressing this issue. They haven’t realized that arresting the victims won’t solve the problem. Last year, L.A. County Sheriff Jim McDonell announced that his department will immediately stop arresting children on prostitution charges. This announcement was coupled by the L.A. County Board of Supervisors adopting a countywide effort to ensure that child victims of sex trafficking are truly treated as victims and receive the support services they need instead of punishment. Last year, this Congress came together as Democrats and Republicans to pass comprehensive human trafficking legislation, but our work does not end when the bill is signed. We must also use our positions to urge local officials in our districts to follow the best practices used around the country. To truly make a difference this Human Trafficking Awareness Month, I urge all Members to reach out to their local sheriffs and local elected officials and urge them to learn from Los Angeles and begin treating sex trafficking victims as victims. Although the legislation is a great step forward, we should also use the power of our voices and our positions to ensure that more girls get the help they need instead of being treated as criminals. 
CUBA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as we get further away from December 17, 2014, the date that President Obama announced his change in U.S. policy toward Cuba, it has become apparent that there could be no abusive or provocative act committed by the tyrannical Castro regime that the Obama administration is not willing to overlook or willing to excuse. Even after the Cuban regime was caught redhanded shipping surfaceto air missiles, two MiG aircraft, and tons of Cubanmade weapons and munitions to North Korea in violation of several U.N. Security Council resolutions, it could not stop President Obama’s desire to placate the Castros. This and the most recent revelation that the United States Government found out in June of 2014 that Cuba managed to come into possession of a 
U.S. Hellfire missile and continues, to this day, to turn over that sensitive military technology are not isolated events. Both incidents underscore exactly how egregiously the administration has erred and the extraordinary lengths to which the President will go in order to hide these transgressions from Congress and from the American people. b1015 You see, Mr. Speaker, after the President made his December 17, 2014, announcement, it has been revealed that not only did the administration keep Congress uninformed of the negotiations, but the negotiations had been taking place for over a year and a half. If we follow the timeline, that means that these secret negotiations were taking place after the administration was already made aware that the Castros were in possession of a U.S. Hellfire missile and after Havana sent the illicit shipment of arms to Pyongyang. Even after the administration offered concession after concession to the Castros—the loosening of restrictions on travel, the opening of Embassies—the list goes on and on—the President refused to make the returning of sensitive missile technology a precondition to the negotiations or to the implementation of this misguided policy. Let’s stop and think about this for a second, Mr. Speaker. The President has given the Castro regime almost everything it could have asked for. What did we ask for in return? Did we demand free and fair elections? Of course not. Did we demand the end of the persecution of dissidents and the release of political prisoners? You have got to be kidding. Of course not. Did we demand the regime stop the long list of human rights abuses? No. In fact, just this past Sunday, over 200 people were arrested in Cuba because they were calling for religious tolerance. But never mind that. Let’s look at the cool, classic Chevys that are all through the streets of Havana. That is what we are supposed to be talking about. The President didn’t even demand that the Communist regime, with known and close military ties to Russia, China, and North Korea, turn over to the U.S. the Hellfire missile it had been in possession of since June of 2014. I don’t need to remind my colleagues of how incredibly dangerous it is for the Castros to be in possession of this sensitive military technology or how incredibly damaging it could be to our own national security interests when, not if, the regime turns that technology over to one of our adversaries. Last year both the Russian Minister of Defense and China’s top military official visited Havana to discuss ways to strengthen their military cooperation efforts with Cuba, and a senior Castro regime official traveled to North Korea for military talks. Mr. Speaker, not only has the President’s Cuban policy been a disaster for the people of Cuba, it has been a disaster for our own safety and security. There should be—there must be—a full and thorough investigation into this Hellfire missile incident. If this administration won’t do what is necessary to hold the Cuban regime accountable, then we in Congress must use every available tool in order to do so. We cannot allow the administration’s endless train of concessions to the tyrannical Cuban regime to continue while it turns its back on those who are suffering under the regime’s oppression. This is not what America stands for, and we should not allow President Obama’s misguided foreign policy objectives to ever change that. 
SERGEANT MATTHEW M CCLINTOCK The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington (Mr. MCDERMOTT ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MCDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, on the wall outside my office are the faces of 149 men and women from Washington State who were killed in action over the past 14 years in Afghanistan and in Iraq. Today it is with reverence that I will add the 150th face: Sergeant Matthew McClintock’s. Matthew was killed in Helmand Province in Afghanistan on the 5th of January. Sergeant McClintock was a Green Beret, an engineer, a National Guardsman, as well as a dedicated friend, son, husband, and father. He joined the Army in 2006 and served in both Iraq and Afghanistan over the course of three tours. On one of his tours, his best friend was killed. So you can imagine what was in his mind when he was now leading a group in Afghanistan and one of his men was on the ground, hit. He knew the danger, but he went out to try and save his teammate. He epitomized everything we admire about our warriors: their skill, their mettle, their commitment to their teammates, to their families, and to us as a nation. The loss of a promising, smart, steadfast young man, whose devotion to family and country was freely given, should not and will not be accepted without sorrow and respect. I had the chance to meet Matthew’s wife, Alexandra, and their 3monthold son, Declan, on Friday, when Matthew came back to Dover Air Force Base. Everything his family said about him speaks of a man I would like to have known. It is said that the true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him but because he loves what is behind him. Matthew leaves behind a proud and beautiful family. His wife asked that she have a chance to go up to Walter Reed to see the man her husband went out to save, who is still alive. That is the kind of family this is. We, as a nation, should be forever grateful that someone of his caliber—and his family—continues to choose to fight. Mr. Speaker, we have entered the 15th year of this war, and it is easy to forget what is still going on in Iraq and Afghanistan and in other places where our soldiers are. I became aware of this because somebody in my district was Matthew’s fatherinlaw. He called me up and asked if I would be of help. I was glad to do it, but I realized I had not been aware of what had happened to him. So I asked the Army press people: Was this reported in the press? They said, yes, that it was on television for 45 seconds. The American people are being allowed not to see and not to hear about Matthew McClintock. They are not being told what is going on. We sent him there. We gave him the gun. We gave him the bullets. We gave him the body armor. We gave him everything and sent him over there and asked him to do this for us. He did it. He was willing to lay down his life for us. We deserve more time with people like Matthew and like many of the soldiers who went before him. But for those who survive them—Matthew’s teammates, his family—Alexandra and especially Declan—when this war finally ends, they deserve long and happy lives in peace. 
WASP ARLINGTON INURNMENT RESTORATION ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the contributions the WASPs have made to our great country. These are the Women Airforce Service Pilots, and they represent an elite group of female pilots. They flew combat missions during World War II. These women displayed courage, valor, and a willingness to serve, and they made invaluable contributions to our Nation’s efforts to battle on the world stage. There were fewer than 1,100 WASPs, and 38 of them died during their service. But because the unit was created in 1942, the WASP group was never granted full military status. In 1977, Congress retroactively granted ActiveDuty status to these brave pilots to ensure that all VA policies, laws, and services would apply to them; yet, the Army recently denied the request of WASPs who were seeking a place in Arlington National Cemetery. They say they are running out of space. This decision flies in the face of our Nation’s efforts to recognize, reward, and treat honorably the contributions of all of our veterans. These women deserve the same honor that is bestowed upon hundreds of thousands of their fellow servicemembers. So I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring and supporting the bill. 
I say this to the VA: Find the space. 
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN SCIENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, universities are supposed to be in the business of illumination, but as we have seen in recent cases at Cal Tech and at UC Berkeley, that is not always the case. At UC, worldrenowned astronomer Geoff Marcy sexually harassed students for years with no consequences. The light of knowledge can cast some dark shadows. Brave women recently alerted my office to still more harassment in astronomy, now at the University of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I include for the RECORD this report from the University of Arizona regarding Dr. Timothy Slater. This report was sealed for over a decade while Dr. Slater went on with his career. His example shows why so few women continue careers in science and in engineering. 
INVESTIGATIVE REPORT  Complaint No: 04–06A–MKM Complainant: Administrative Review Respondent: Dr. Timothy Slater Department: Department of Astronomy, Steward Observatory Date Complaint Received: August 2004 Report Date: March 31, 2005 
BACKGROUND  Prior to July 2004, several individuals approached the EOAAO to discuss sexually charged conduct they were experiencing in the College of Astronomy, and Steward Observatory. They stated that the conduct was occurring across ranks; some indicated the conduct was creating a sexually hostile work environment. Some indicated retaliation might be occurring. These individuals refused to file complaints against the department because they feared workrelated repercussions, including unlawful retaliation. Consequently the EOAAO met with administrators in the Department of Astronomy and Steward Observatory to discuss initiating an investigation into sexual harassment, sexually hostile work environment. The department, in turn, formalized a request for investigation, such that this Administrative Review began in August 2004. Responsive to evidence obtained in the early stages of investigation, the EOAAO named Dr. Tim Slater as a respondent in this case, on September 24, 2004. The EOAAO notified Dr. Slater of his respondent status in accordance with EOAAO procedures, identifying sexual harassment and retaliation as the relevant issues. Dr. Slater was hired by the University of Arizona on August 6, 2001, as an Associate Professor of Astronomy. He received tenure standing in May 2004. He has a variety of duties at the university, including his post as the Conceptual Astronomy and Physics Education Research (CAPER) team leader. 
INFORMATION FROM RESPONDENT  On September 30, 2004 Dr, Tim Slater provided the following information: He stated that he recalled two occasions on which individuals complained directly to him about his personal conduct. In [redacted] talking about a bachelor party at a strip club, such that a graduate student commented, ‘‘That really creeps me out when you talk that way in front of me,’’ or words to that affect. He recalled apologizing. A graduate student and former CAPER team member telling him that it had made her uncomfortable when he massaged her shoulders publicly, while hosting a teacher workshop. Dr. Slater recalled that she was concerned others might misinterpret the nature of their relationship, were they to observe his gesture. Dr. Slater characterized himself as a ‘‘touchy’’ person who often hugs people. He stated that he is a ‘‘flirtatious’’ person, and defined that as ‘‘friendly,’’ and ‘‘flattering.’’ He stated this is mostly with the CAPER group, since CAPER constitutes his primary professional and social interaction. Dr. Slater stated that he hugs males as well as females, and that he brought many people on the team [CAPER] from Montana and Kansas [universities there.] Many had lived in his house with him and his wife from time to time, and some of the relationships were of 10–12 years’ duration. He added they had been in each other’s weddings. He stated that they all socialize together at someone’s house (often his) on 2–3 occasions per month. Dr. Slater stated that he and Witness J run the CAPER group, and that within the group they have a joke that he, Slater, is the ‘‘mom,’’ and Witness J is the ‘‘dad.’’ He stated that some of the CAPER team members were more like family than others; he listed the two groups. Regarding reports that he had given out ‘‘sex toys’’ at social events; he recalled that 
he had given one female graduate student a pickle or cucumbershaped vibrator at a ‘‘premarriage’’ party. He could not recall having given out chocolate handcuffs, as specifically alleged. Regarding the vibrator, he recalled that the recipient was a collector of the vegetable it represented, and that he was certain she was not offended by it. He recalled there were pickle or cucumber jokes going around the office for several days, thereafter. Dr. Slater did not recall making the comment that he would have to install cameras in his home, as alleged, and referential to the alleged comment that everyone [in CAPER] had engaged in sexual activity in his home. Dr. Slater reiterated that many of the CAPER team members had, in fact, lived with him at his house over the years. Regarding allegations that he stopped to look at women, and commented on their appearance, he stated this was common practice for him, and that he might have done it anywhere from ‘‘onetotentoahundred times.’’ He denied that he had a rating system, but recalled saying things like, ‘‘You’re going to have to say that again, because that’s too distracting.’’ He confirmed he had made such comments to women in the department and often Witness J, who joked with him in a similar fashion. Regarding allegations that he told a colleague he had a prohibition against ‘‘blue balls’’ in the office (referencing an exercise ball,) he stated he did not recall making the comment, but that it was ‘‘consistent’’ with the kinds of comments he would make. He believed he had not told a colleague he would have invited her to swim over the weekend but for the likelihood she would wear her swim suit. He stated he doubted that comment because he is not exclusionary by nature. He did not recall telling a [subordinate female] colleague that she would teach better were she to stop wearing underwear, and did not recall snapping her underwear [through her Tshirt dress, as alleged.] However, he stated, he did tend to say a lot of sexual things. Dr. Slater confirmed that he took a visiting female graduate student, as well as a male and a female [subordinate] colleague to lunch at a local strip club. He did not recall that specific event, but stated that he [and the accompanying male] usually purchase lap dances when they go. He usually offers to purchase lap dances for others, as well. He stated they go about once per month, and that it’s usually a mixed group (male and female.) Dr. Slater recalled that a group of department women had gone to a male club in honor of a wedding or birthday, and reported having a terrible time. Somehow, as an offshoot to that situation, one of the women [Witness B] thought she might like female clubs better, and decided to join the men. He could not recall how many times she attended, but thought probably several. He stated that he has gone with his wife, and several of the graduate students and/or colleagues. He stated the tab is always collected for ‘‘Dutch’’ treat: departmental funds are never used. For complete report go to http:// speier.house.gov. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, January 11, 2016. CATHERINE E. L HAMON , Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, Office of Civil Rights, Department of Education, Washington, DC. DEAR ASSISTANT SECRETARY LHAMON : Thank you for your leadership and commitment to eradicating sexual harassment and assault on college campuses. Knowing your interest in this area, I wanted to bring the attached report to your attention, which details disturbing sexual harassment by a former faculty member at the University of Arizona. Despite finding that Dr. Timothy Slater committed a policy violation in the matter of ‘‘sexual harassment, hostile work environment,’’ the report and its incriminatory revelation were sealed, and Dr. Slater moved to a new job at the University of Wyoming, where he continues to supervise students and teach workshops. In light of this, I ask that the Office of Civil Rights clarify whether universities that find a Title IX violation by faculty or staff are required to disclose the results of their investigation to other educational institutions. The incidents described in the report are alarming. One complainant said that Dr. Slater told her on a regular basis that ‘‘she would teach better if she did not wear underwear’’ and ‘‘grabbed her underwear through her dress, stretched it and snapped it, and said ‘You’d look a whole lot better without these on,’ or words to that effect.’’ He asked another complainant ‘‘if she knew anything about or was any good at giving blow jobs, because (name deleted) does not like to give or received them—maybe you could give her some pointers.’’ Dr. Slater himself admitted that he gave an employee a vegetableshaped vibrator, that he frequently commented to his employees and students about the appearance of passing women, and that he told one person ‘‘that his personal sexual record was four women in 24 hours.’’ Staff spoke directly to a witness who recounted several inappropriate interactions. She observed Dr. Slater instructing an undergraduate student to ‘‘touch your elbows behind your back for me’’ in order to scrutinize the student’s breasts, and touching graduate students on the leg while making inappropriate statements. At a lab social event at the Slaters’ residence, video pornography was shown before dinner. She recounted hearing Dr. Slater tell male colleagues on more than one occasion that he enjoyed teaching large lectures in rooms with stadium seating because the female students in Arizona wear short skirts and often forget to cross their legs. Dr. Slater once required the witness to attend a lunch at a fully nude strip club with him in order to discuss her academic work, with the implied consequence that he would not discuss her work with her if she refused to go. While she was there, she was pressured to attend future lunches at the strip club. According to the witness, it was made clear to her, though never explicitly stated, that if she wanted to function in the lab that she had to take part in this sexualized culture. Because of these incidents, the witness left the field of astronomy. Staff spoke directly to another witness, who experienced inappropriate comments and unwanted physical contact from Dr. Slater. At a oneonone work meeting, he told her that all the other graduate students had sex at his house, that he had video cameras, and asked when she would also have sex at his house. During a lab social, she witnessed Dr. Slater and another lab supervisor stating that at this party, lab members were going to use the Slaters’ hot tub naked. Dr. Slater also touched her shoulders and stroked her back while she was teaching, until she sent him a formal email requesting that he stop. Due to the hostile work environment, the witness transferred out of Dr. Slater’s group, losing years of progress towards her graduate degree. A third witness separately confirmed that Dr. Slater led laboratory outings to strip clubs. The Slater report is disturbingly similar to the recent case at the University of California, Berkeley, in which Dr. Geoff Marcy, a prominent astronomer, violated campus sexual harassment policies with minimal consequences for 9 years until his story was publicized through the media. As the University of Arizona did with the Slater case, UC Berkeley kept the final report on Dr. Marcy’s behavior confidential, perhaps because, as Science Magazine put it, ‘‘[t]he details of UC Berkeley’s inquiry into Marcy’s conduct does not reflect well on the institution, with the process stretching for more than 4 years and Marcy given only weak sanctions after repeated promises to reform.’’ The final report from UC Berkeley contained a sentence that could be applied equally to Dr. Marcy and Dr. Slater: ‘‘[i]t cannot be overstated how Respondent’s inherent influence and authority over the complainants, real or perceived, heightened the impact of his behavior on those experiencing or witnessing it.’’ The Slater case, while lurid, is just a symptom of a much larger problem—how to prevent harassment, and effectively deal with it when it occurs. Dr. Slater states that he is now reformed, but there are still few consequences for faculty members who sexually harass students. In some ways, the situation is reminiscent of the Catholic Church’s coddling of childmolesting priests. As in the Church, universities protect perpetuators with slaponthewrist punishment and secrecy, while victims are left alone to try to put their academic careers and lives back together. One peerreviewed study found that over a quarter of women surveyed (and 6% of men) have been sexually assaulted while conducting scientific fieldwork, and 71% of women and 41% of men also reported that they were sexually harassed. The profound effect of this dynamic on the participation of women in science cannot be overstated. From 2002 through 2012, women received onethird or fewer of the doctorates awarded in physical sciences, mathematics, engineering, and computer science, and as of 2013 onethird or fewer of all tenure or tenure track faculty positions in core STEM fields were held by women. Indeed, all of the victims we talked to suffered career consequences as a direct result of the harassment, including losing years of graduate work, forgoing professional opportunities, and changing fields of study. In the Marcy case, one of the victims, who had aspired to work at NASA, left astrophysics entirely as a direct result of being harassed. When students found to have violated university policy through the Title IX disciplinary process transfer to another institution, the university that found the violation may inform the other institution, but is not obligated to do so. While this policy is vastly insufficient, it at least allows universities to have the option to inform other universities of the final results of a disciplinary proceeding. However, no similar guidance exists for faculty or staff. I ask that the Office of Civil Rights issue a clarification on the FERPA or Title IX disclosure requirements when faculty or staff whose conduct violated Title IX transfer to another institution. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely, JACKIE SPEIER . 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, some universities protect predatory professors with slaps on the wrist and secrecy, just like the Catholic Church sheltered childmolesting priests for many decades. The incidents described in this report are lurid and disturbing. One graduate student was told regularly by Dr. 
Slater that she would teach better if she did not wear underwear. He asked another graduate student to give women pointers on oral sex techniques. Dr. Slater himself admitted that he gave an employee a vegetableshaped vibrator and that he frequently commented to his employees and students about the appearance of women. My staff spoke with one female grad student who was required to attend a strip club in order to discuss her academic work with Dr. Slater. The woman has since left the field of astronomy. The second female grad student told us that, during a oneonone work meeting with Dr. Slater, he told her that all of the other graduate students had had sex at his house, that he had video cameras, and asked when she would join him to have sex there. She transferred out of Dr. Slater’s lab, losing years of work. This is a significant reason as to why women hold fewer than onethird of the faculty positions in science and engineering. Dr. Slater has said he is now reformed, which may be the case, but his actions, however lurid, are just symptoms of a larger problem of how to effectively deal with sexual harassment in academia. I agree with Dr. Meg Urry, the president of the American Astronomical Society, who said: ‘‘In my view, this is what it would take to move the needle: severe and visible consequences for violating policies on harassment—and they do have to be visible.’’ That is why I plan to introduce legislation to require universities to inform other universities of the final results of a disciplinary proceeding. When students, faculty, or staff whose conduct has violated title IX transfer to another institution, the universities to which they are moving should be aware of their past conduct. I encourage anyone who has experienced sexual harassment in science, whether it is related to this incident or another, to call my office. Students enter astronomy to study the stars, not their professors’ sex lives. It is time to stop pretending sexual harassment in science happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. 
BARBARA STOCKTON PERRY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. HOLDING ) for 5 minutes. Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, on New Year’s Day, we mourned the loss of a great lady, Barbara Stockton Perry. Today I rise to celebrate Barbara’s 89 years of life that she devoted to her Christian faith, to her family, and to her community. Barbara was born on November 3, 1926, in the town of Franklin, which is a small North Carolina mountain community that is tucked away under the Great Smoky Mountains. Though the population was very small, Barbara had a large personality and a keen mind. She was the valedictorian of Franklin High School in 1943, and she graduated cum laude from Brenau College in 1947. b1030 She then went on to the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill School of Law. She was the only woman in the class of 1950, and she was a member of the law review as well. This was classic Barbara, distinguishing herself as a highly intelligent woman who was not afraid to break glass ceilings. Barbara’s first position out of law school was as assistant legal counsel to the Belk Stores Corporation in Charlotte. Then, after marrying Warren Perry in June of 1951, she moved to Kinston, North Carolina, with him and became a partner at Perry, Perry and Perry law firm. There, she became involved in the State bar and the local bar and was named to the Board of Governors of the North Carolina Bar Association. Community service was important to Barbara. So throughout her life, she donated her time and efforts to a long list of organizations, including the United Way, the North Carolina Symphony, the Kinston Arts Council, the KinstonLenoir County Bicentennial Commission, and the Pride of Kinston organization. A lifelong educational advocate, Barbara also served on the Board of Trustees of Parrot Academy, Lenoir Community College, Brenau University, and UNCChapel Hill, where she was elected to two terms on the Board of Governors of the entire 16 university UNC system. In recognition of her contributions to North Carolina, she was honored by two North Carolina Governors, Jim Holshouser and Pat McCrory. Both of these Governors awarded her the Order of the Long Leaf Pine. If ever anyone instilled and fostered pride in the great State of North Carolina, certainly it was Barbara Stockton Perry. Ever devoted to faith, Barbara served for many years on the board of Angel Ministries. She was a longtime member of the Gordon Street Christian Church and more recently joined the Faith Fellowship Church. While her contributions to her community are beyond measure, Barbara’s true joy was her family. She lost the love of her life, Warren, in 2003, but theirs was a life filled with adventure. By all accounts, they traveled the world together and shared a dance on all seven continents. At home, this extraordinary lady was known to her family simply as Mama Perry. She was happiest when she was surrounded by her children, grandchildren, and extended family. Mr. Speaker, it is impossible to condense the life of this truly remarkable woman into a few short minutes. I will close in saying that I was honored and privileged to know her, and I give thanks to Barbara Perry for devoting her life to her family, her community, and her faith. She will be missed beyond measure. May God always bless her. f 
STATE OF THE ECONOMY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. M ALONEY ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the monthly jobs report for December. It was another in a long, uninterrupted string of good reports. The report showed that the economy gained 292,000 private sector jobs last month and that the unemployment rate fell to 5 percent. During 2015, the economy added nearly 2.7 million jobs. Nevertheless, many of my colleagues across the aisle continue to talk as if the recovery under President Obama has been lackluster. They seem to forget the economic meltdown that occurred under the leadership of the prior administration. But the millions of Americans who lost their homes, their jobs, they haven’t forgotten. Let’s look at how far we have come in the period after President Bush left office. The truth is, the record is pretty impressive. First, a reminder of where we started. Back in January of 2009, when President Bush left office and President Obama was sworn in, the economy shed nearly 820,000 private sector jobs in January in 1 month alone. As former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke described it, we were facing the worst financial crisis in global history, including the Great Depression. Between the end of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, real GDP fell by 4.2 percent. Around $17 trillion in household wealth evaporated during the Great Recession. To put that number in some perspective, $17 trillion is about equal to our entire gross domestic product, the sum total of all the goods and services produced by the entire economy of the United States for all of 2014. That is a great deal of money to lose. In fact, it would be almost enough to pay off our entire national debt. In July of 2009, there were about seven unemployed workers for every single job opening in the country, meaning that no matter how hard most unemployed people tried to get a job, six out of every seven of them were going to be just out of luck. You may recall that back then our colleagues across the aisle were adamantly opposed to extending jobless benefits. By October of 2009, the unemployment rate had reached 10 percent. Housing prices were falling. Lending was frozen. The stock market had cratered. Businesses were failing. People all over the country were losing their jobs, their homes, their savings, and their hopes. It was a pretty terrible time for millions of Americans. 
Now, much has changed. 2014 and 2015 were the strongest 2 years of job creation since 1998 to 2000, when Bill Clinton was President. The private sector is powering the economy forward. Our businesses have added 14 million jobs over a record 70 consecutive months of job growth. Wages have finally begun to rise. Nominal average hourly earnings for all private employees have now risen 2.5 percent over the past year. The ratio of unemployment seekers to job openings has fallen from 7 to 1 to 1.5 to 1. That is about the lowest this ratio has been since early 2007. Since the start of the Obama administration, our real GDP has increased by 14 percent. The U.S. auto industry, which was on death’s door when President Obama took office, is now healthy, thriving, and enjoyed record sales in 2015. Our auto industry is now exporting and creating even more jobs. Oil and gas prices are low. Mortgage rates remain low. Inflation is simply not a factor. The dollar is strong, and housing prices are back up to where they were in 2007. All of this recovery was not an accident, not a stroke of good luck. Things certainly would have been quite different if we had only listened to the counsel of our colleagues across the aisle. They vehemently opposed efforts taken by the Obama administration to stimulate the economy, and they opposed actions by the Federal Reserve that turned out to be very critically important. What would have happened without these actions by the Federal Reserve and the Democrats in Congress? The recession would have lasted twice as long, according to a recent study by highly respected economists Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi. The Blinder Zandi study found that without these actions, the unemployment rate would have reached nearly 16 percent, and we would have lost twice as many jobs, more than 17 million. It is a bit scary to even think about. So the facts show that we have had a very strong recovery. Are we done? Absolutely not. There is much more work to do to ensure the recovery reaches everyone. Big challenges remain. Many families are struggling to make ends meet, to make the mortgage payment, to save for their children’s education. We need faster wage growth, accessible child care, and higher education that is affordable to all families. It is time to pass comprehensive immigration reform and to protect Americans from gun violence. I am excited about the opportunity to make real progress on these issues this year, and I look forward to working in a bipartisan way to continue to focus on the challenges facing middle class families. 
PROLIFE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. RATCLIFFE ) for 5 minutes. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, the Declaration of Independence contains a passage that every student in America learns at an early age. It explains that each of us are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, chief among them the right to life. This highlights and reminds us just how much our Founders valued the right to life. As an elected Representative, the words in our Declaration that follow are equally compelling: To secure these rights, governments are instituted among men. How often we forget that government exists first and foremost to secure the right to life. Now, this is an immense responsibility, one that I take very seriously, because one of the highest honors I have in representing the Fourth Congressional District of Texas is defending the most vulnerable among us, our unborn children. I am proud to have a voting record that reflects my unwavering commitment to protecting unborn life and ending taxpayer funding of abortion. I will also be the first to tell you that legislators represent only one piece of the puzzle in the ongoing and vital effort to promote a culture of life. There are literally thousands of unsung pro life heroes in the Fourth Congressional District of Texas, whose effort to promote a culture of life are not about gaining recognition or notoriety, but are simply rooted in an abiding sense of protecting the inalienable right to life, which our Founding Fathers spoke of. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize a few of these prolife heroes in my district, people like Melanie Grammar and Deborah Butts with the Texas Federation of Republican Women; Michelle Smith and Ann Hettinger in Rockwall, Texas; Chip Adami at the True Options Pregnancy Center in Sherman; Mason Randall and Robin Stevenson at Lake Pointe Church Adoption Ministry; Kristie Wright at the First Choice Pregnancy Resource Center in Texarkana; Threesa Sadler and Tim Stainback at the Raffa Center in Greenville; Joanne Vuckovic at the Rockwall Pregnancy Resource Center; and the great folks at both the Paris and Fannin Pregnancy Care Centers. The dedication of individuals like these and thousands of others across the Fourth Congressional District of Texas is appreciated, it is necessary, and it certainly does not go unnoticed. Thank you all for your commitment to protecting the incredibly important cause of life. f 
BILL TO COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESS COMPACT IMPACT IN AFFECTED JURISDICTIONS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. BORDALLO ) for 5 minutes. Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, today I introduced legislation that will help address the impact of the Compact of Free Association—these are the Pacific Islands—on affected jurisdictions like Guam and the State of Hawaii. I continue to support the intent of the Compact, and I do understand the benefits that these agreements have for our Nation and our security. However, the costs borne by our local governments amount to millions of dollars for providing social services to Compact migrants are unsustainable, and Congress must act to provide relief for affected jurisdictions who have spent millions of local funds to support the Compact and the migrants. COFA migrants make positive contributions to our community, but insufficient support from the Federal Government causes a significant socioeconomic strain on our island communities. This strain only increases, especially with uncertain economic conditions in the Freely Associated States, as well as the impact climate change is having on Pacific Island nations. The bill I am introducing, as well as proposals that I have made in the past, will provide relief and empower local jurisdictions with solutions to reduce the burden of the Compact. The best solution to Compact impact would be an increase in annual mandatory funding from the current $30 million to the $185 million recommended by the GAO. However, the current budget environment makes appropriating this very difficult. Nonetheless, I am proud to also cosponsor another bill, a bill introduced by Congressman TAKAI of the State of Hawaii, that would increase this annual appropriation, and I hope that we can at least have a debate on this measure. However, as we work to find long term solutions to Compact impact, I believe that there are important and innovative fixes that would provide muchneeded relief to our local governments without much cost to taxpayers. Now, this approach is a more budget friendly way to address this challenge. The bill’s provisions address four areas to reduce the burden. b1045 First, my bill would permit the affected jurisdictions to use the amount that they have spent to provide social services to COFA migrants toward the nonFederal portion of providing Medicaid to their local residents. The bill proposes a new formula that would increase the Federal medical assistance percentage for each of the affected jurisdictions, and this would go a long way toward alleviating the burden on affected jurisdictions by increasing the percentage assistance provided by the Federal Government for Medicaid. Secondly, the bill would categorize elementary and secondary education aged COFA students as federally connected students and make them eligible for Impact Aid. I understand the fiscal challenges that the Impact Aid community faces, and I am committed 
to working with them to address the effect this bill may have on them. The bill attempts to offset this effect by increasing funding authorization and ensures that we are not taking from one group just to pay another. Thirdly, this legislation would clarify Congress’ intent when we extended eligibility for housing assistance programs to the COFA migrants. This bill ensures that U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents are not displaced and are given priority when applying for housing benefits. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, this bill would commission independent research on the viability of the current compacts and make recommendations on policy alternatives moving forward. I do hope that this research will provide strategic guidance as we move toward renewal of the compacts in 2023 and ensure that we are administering these agreements in the best way. I am so very pleased to count the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. TAKAI) as an original cosponsor of my bill. As this Congress discusses solutions for the crisis in Puerto Rico, it is important that we also discuss challenges that the other territories face, especially the challenge of supporting the Compact of Free Association. While the challenges facing affected jurisdictions are nowhere near as serious as Puerto Rico, Mr. Speaker, doing nothing would only welcome economic and security challenges down the road. I do look forward to this bill becoming law and it being a tremendous help to jurisdictions affected by the Compact impact. 
INDEPENDENCE PLAZA HONORS AMERICA’S SPACE PROGRAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. OLSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, in the summer of 1972, my dad was transferred from northwest Alabama to southeast Texas. I remember the first time I got off the Gulf Freeway, headed east down NASA Road 1, and saw the Johnson Space Center and the Nassau Bay resort hotel with an NBC studio on top. Right then, it hit me: my neighbors were astronauts, Moon walkers. My life was changed forever. The next 9 years were rather dull. Three missions of Skylab and one handshake with the Russians on ApolloSoyuz. The excitement came back in 1981. The Space Shuttle Columbia flew for the first time. The space shuttle was the heart and soul of human spaceflight until July 21, 2011, when three words ended the program: ‘‘Houston, wheels stop.’’ Those words were heard in the dark, 4:57 a.m. Texas time. My home was dark for 4
1⁄2years. That darkness will end on January 23 when Space Center Houston opens Independence Plaza right by the Johnson Space Center. Independence Plaza will have the Space Shuttle Independence atop the 747 transport carrier. Our space shuttles flew 133 successful flights, with crews as small as two or as large as seven, with 55,000 pounds of payload. Our shuttles carried astronauts from 17 nations: Belgium, Canada, France, Israel, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, and America. Our shuttle built the International Space Station, which has had a human being on board since November 2, 2000. Scott Kelly has been on board the ISS since March 27, 2015. Scott must love the view because he will come home after 1 year in orbit. The Hubble Space Telescope would have been the biggest piece of space junk ever without the space shuttle. When it was launched in 1990, it was a telescope that needed glasses. Its vision was blurry. Five shuttle missions followed, fixed its vision, gave it decades of new life, and changed history. But Independence Plaza will do more than remind us of the achievements of our space shuttle. This exhibit will ensure we never forget the two crews we lost on space shuttles. Dick, Michael, Judy, Ron, Ellison, Greg, and Christa touched the face of God when Challenger exploded after 73 seconds of flight on January 28, 1986. Eighteen years later, on February 1, 2003, we lost Rick, Willie, Michael, Kalpana, David, Laurel, and Ilan when Columbia returned mortally wounded and broke up over their home, my home State of Texas. Independence Plaza will ensure that these 14 heroes will always be revered, and a new, young generation of Americans will follow their lead and soar into the heavens. f 
PRESIDENT OBAMA’S FINAL STATE OF THE UNION MESSAGE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, one recalls the state of the Union that President Obama inherited upon taking office: overwhelming problems occasioned by the near collapse of the economy, 700,000 jobs lost before he was even in office half a month. It would take many months more to arrest the slide. There were fierce battles, arguments about whether we should spend money to try to help people and industries. His work was complicated by the announcement early on by the Republican leader in the Senate that his number one goal was not to fix the economy or deal with health care or the environment or national security; it was to prevent President Obama from being reelected to a second term. Time has shown that the money that was spent was critical, and most independent experts agree that we should have invested more heavily in things like rebuilding and renewing America. Even so, our performance has been better than any of the other developed economies. Those results were achieved with divisions and arguments that continue to be played out today on the national political stage as there are people seeking the Presidency later this year. But my hope is that, as the President addresses this Chamber tonight, there might be an opportunity to move past some of the divisions and controversy. My hope is, as the President looks up in the gallery and sees the First Lady, that he might pause and acknowledge her important work in health and nutrition; that he might spend just 3 minutes on a topic that can bring people together; that he would admit that we as a government still pay too much to the wrong people to grow the wrong crops in the wrong places, that we would be far better off if we weren’t subsidizing people to grow food that actually makes Americans sick. I would hope that he would propose that the Federal Government help more farmers and ranchers with research and market access at home and abroad. Let’s pay those farmers and ranchers to protect water quality and water quantity. I would hope that he would propose that we subsidize more healthy food in our schools and for senior citizens and lowincome people. I would hope that he would acknowledge the revolution that is taking place in food and agricultural thought and policy in this country, as documented in the recent PBS special, ‘‘In Defense of Food,’’ with Michael Pollan. There is an exciting national movement promoting valueadded agriculture, healthy food, animal welfare, and environmental protection that will strengthen rural and small town America and provide more satisfaction for the men and women who work in agriculture. It would only take 3 minutes, but it would be an important milestone for this revolution of food and farm policy that cannot happen soon enough. 
RECOGNIZING COACH FRANK BEAMER ON HIS RETIREMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Coach Frank Beamer on the occasion of his retirement as the head football coach at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University—more commonly known and fondly known as Virginia Tech—located in Blacksburg, Virginia, as Coach Beamer concludes his highly successful career. For almost three decades, Coach Beamer has been a tremendous leader in Virginia and a mentor to hundreds of student athletes. In 29 seasons under Coach Beamer’s leadership, Virginia Tech football has enjoyed unprecedented success, notching 237 wins, three Big East championships, four Atlantic Coast Conference 
championships, and the opportunity to play for a national championship. His ‘‘Beamer Ball’’ style of play has led Virginia Tech to become one of the Nation’s most respected college football programs. In 1999, Coach Beamer was named the consensus Associated Press College Football Coach of the Year. Coach Beamer’s first postseason berth as head coach at Virginia Tech was a trip to the 1993 Independence Bowl game, which resulted in a victory for the Hokies. It was only fitting that Coach Beamer ended his coaching career with a 55–52 victory over the University of Tulsa in the 2015 Independence Bowl, capping off a school record 23 straight postseason bowl games. Raised a short drive from Blacksburg, in Hillsville, Virginia, Coach Beamer graduated from Hillsville High School, where he earned 11 varsity letters as a threesport athlete in football, basketball, and baseball. He went on to attend Virginia Tech as an undergraduate and started 3 years as a cornerback, playing on the Hokies’ 1966 and 1968 Liberty Bowl teams. While attending Radford University to receive his master’s degree in guidance, he began his coaching career in 1969 as an assistant at southwest Virginia’s Radford High School. b1100 From there, he went on to work as a graduate assistant at Maryland for 1 year, followed by the Citadel for five seasons, where he was defensive coordinator for two of those. In 1979, Coach Beamer joined Murray State University as defensive coordinator and was named head coach in 1981. In 1987, he made his way back to his native southwest Virginia to take the reins at Virginia Tech. He has brought honor to southwest Virginia and Virginia Tech by always being the consummate Virginia gentleman and a darn good football coach to boot. He has devoted his time and passion to the teams he has coached as well as the greater southwest Virginia community. In fact, in 2004, he was presented with a Humanitarian Award by the National Conference of Community and Justice for his contributions to fostering justice, equity, and community in the Roanoke Valley. As evidenced by his incredible success, Coach Beamer has much to be proud of and can look back on an honest and accomplished career. His passion for coaching led him to achieve what many coaches only dream of. He has positively shaped the futures and touched the lives of the Virginia boys and girls that he has dealt with— particularly, the boys on his football team—and has made us a better State. This is truly the great measure of a great coach. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to help commemorate the career of a remarkable man. After 29 years of dedicated leadership to Virginia Tech and the greater community, I would like to thank Coach Beamer for his service. I wish him and his family all of the best in his retirement. 
TRIBUTE TO OTIS CLAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. D AVIS) for 5 minutes. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Otis Clay, an outstanding international artist who lived, worked, and was intimately involved in the North Lawndale community of Chicago, which I am proud to represent. Otis Clay was born in Waxhaw, Mississippi, and ultimately made his way to the west side of Chicago, where he made his home. Otis began his musical career as a gospel singer and, like many other artists, switched over to rhythm and blues and recorded his first hit in 1967, ‘‘That’s How it is When You’re in Love,’’ which reached number 34 on the national charts. Otis performed and recorded in Europe, Japan, and Switzerland. Although Otis Clay reached national acclaim, he continued to live in the North Lawndale community, was a regular at local churches, festivals, and community events. He established his own recording studio, owned a local cleaners, and was known as a regular in the community. I was fortunate to have Otis Clay attend and perform at many events that I sponsored over the years, and it was indeed an honor to be able to call him my personal friend. Otis was involved with the Tobacco Road Project and was instrumental, along with Alderman Dorothy Tillman, in establishing the Harold Washington Cultural Center in the Third Ward on the south side of Chicago. My neighborhood and our world community has lost a great artist and entertainer, but also a great human being. I extend condolences to his family. I know that, when the gates swing open, Otis Clay will come walking in. 
EFREE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to tell the story of Sabrina Fregoso of Diamond Springs, California. Sabrina is one of the tens of thousands of women harmed by the permanent sterilization device Essure. In August of 2012, Sabrina welcomed her fourth child, at which time she discussed permanent sterilization with her physician. Her doctor recommended Essure and assured her that the procedure was safe. Immediately following the Essure procedure, Sabrina began to notice a consistent and substantial decline in her health, including losing control of her bowels, extensive weight gain, severe bloating, hair loss, and sores covering her body. Her lower back, hips, and leg joints became painful. She experienced numbness in her feet and sharp heel pain that made it difficult to walk. Mr. Speaker, today I rise again as their voice to tell this Chamber that their stories are real, their pain is real, and their fight is real. My bill, the EFree Act, can halt this tragedy by removing this dangerous device from the market. I urge my colleagues to join in this fight because stories like Sabrina’s are too important to ignore. f 
KEMP FORUM: ANTIPOVERTY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DOLD) for 5 minutes. Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, this past weekend brought together a group of innovators at the Kemp Forum on Expanding Opportunity in South Carolina. This important forum highlighted new and creative ideas to address the stubborn problem of poverty in America. The Federal Government spends more than half a trillion dollars each and every year on antipoverty measures. That is a significant devotion of resources. Yet, while some progress has been made in the last 50 years, today there are still nearly 50 million Americans living in poverty. Nobody would deny that the results fall far short from where they need to be. This is because, at the end of the day, success in the war on poverty is measured not at the program level, but on the individual level. Success isn’t about how many programs exist, but how many people can improve their lives by moving up and out of poverty. Mr. Speaker, one of the fundamental principles of this great Nation is the idea of freedom of opportunity, the opportunity to find work, to support yourself, and to support your family. By working with local community groups like YouthBuild and leaders like Bob Woodson, I have been able to see numerous success stories, like my guest for tonight’s State of the Union address, Lavell Brown. This young man has successfully worked with community groups in North Chicago to grow as an individual and to get on a path to a sustainable career, and he is now giving back to others at YouthBuild Lake County. This model of empowering the individual and helping them develop the skills needed to escape poverty is what we need to replicate millions of times over. If we can combine the focus on individuals with a relentless drive to innovate, I am confident that, in the next 50 years, our efforts to end poverty and provide greater opportunities will be a success. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana) at noon. 
PRAYER Reverend Nathaniel Demosthene, First Timothy Christian Church, Spring Valley, New York, offered the following prayer: Dear Heavenly Father, it is with thanksgiving and a mournful heart that we approach this day as we remember the lives lost and tragically affected by the earthquake in Haiti 6 years ago this day. Today we are grateful, God, for the lives rescued by the actions of our President as well as the bipartisan endeavors of the Members of this Congress and the heroic men and women in the armed services. We pray for our elected Representatives in this assembly and ask that You imbue them with wisdom as they face everincreasing difficult and complex decisions concerning the direction of this country. Enable them to act responsibly and selflessly in the fulfillment of their oaths of office. Bless our Nation and teach us to leverage our resources to ameliorate the lives of our global citizens, especially the most vulnerable among them, both domestic and abroad. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Washington (Mr. KILMER) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. KILMER led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING REVEREND NATHANIEL DEMOSTHENE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Reverend Nathaniel ‘‘Nate’’ Demosthene of Nyack, New York, for offering today’s opening prayer. A graduate of Spring Valley High School and of Yale University, Pastor Nate teaches in the East Ramapo Central School District and at Rockland Community College. For the last 5 years, he has led First Timothy Christian Church, which, under his guidance, has been a source of support for Haitian Americans in our community following the devastating earthquake in Haiti. Together we will continue to work toward our shared goals of democracy, prosperity, and success for the Haitian people. Again I thank Pastor Nate for his excellent work and for being here today. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Matthew McClintock, a fallen hero who answered the call to serve his country. Last week I had the solemn honor of joining his family—his wife, Ali, his 3 monthold son, Declan, his parents, and others—at Dover Air Force Base for Sergeant McClintock’s final trip home. It was an experience I will never forget. It is important that his service and the sacrifice that he and his family have made be acknowledged here in the House of Representatives. Sergeant McClintock joined the Army in 2006, and he served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. On his most recent deployment, he was serving as a citizen soldier in a National Guard Special Forces unit. Not only will he be remembered as a Green Beret and as a hero, he will be remembered as a loving son, husband, and father who was so proud to welcome his son into the world. That world is stronger and better because of his service. Nothing we can say can ease his family’s pain, but I can promise that the service of this hero and his sacrifice will not be forgotten. It will live on in the memories of those he called comrades and in the memories of his commanders, who routinely cite the example he set. It will live on in the gratitude of this Nation. Most importantly, it will live on with his wife, son, and other family members, who knew better than anyone else his love for his country and for the people in his life. 
THE PRESIDENT’S PUSH ON GUN CONTROL (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the President’s proposed executive actions on gun control. And you will probably hear more about this tonight, right here in this Chamber. The Second Amendment has been engrained in American life since 1791, and, since then, Congress has been committed to preserving those constitutional rights. However, the President has a different agenda. His proposed plan on gun control is yet another example of his unconstitutional legislative strategy, using executive orders and circumventing Congress to get his way. Recent events have shown us that Americans deserve the right to protect 
themselves, and stripping lawabiding citizens of their right to bear arms will not accomplish that. The American people do not want to see their Second Amendment rights limited, and neither do I. I will do everything in my power to fight against this administration’s gun grab. For 225 years, Americans have had the right to bear arms, and I am not about to see this right be compromised for the sake of a political legacy. The Constitution is not merely a significance. It is the law of the land. 
END THE OVERPRESCRIPTION OF PAIN KILLERS (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, last month the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines that urge primary care physicians to think twice before prescribing opioids for pain relief. I strongly support their call. Last year I asked the Federation of State Medical Boards to encourage stronger guidelines as well. New research suggests that the over prescription of opioids may be widespread across the medical community. Pain management is an important part of a physician’s practice, but it is critical that prescribers understand when options other than these highly addictive drugs are available. Mr. Speaker, last year the number of fatal overdoses from prescription painkillers increased by 16 percent and, from heroin, 28 percent. There are 19,000 Americans who lost their lives, and more die every day. I thank the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for their work on this issue, and I urge the administration, Congress, and the medical community to end the overprescription of painkillers. 
THE PRESIDENT’S LEGACY OF FAILURE (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this evening the President will address Congress and the American people and will defend his legacy of failure in jobs, national defense, and more gun control. The President’s legacy has destroyed jobs and has increased regulations that cripple small business. He should change course to support creating jobs and reducing unnecessary regulations, and he should repeal ObamaCare. The President’s legacy overseas— abandoning Iraq, not upholding the red line in Syria, and opposing a NATO training force in Libya—allowed ISIS to grow, with children fleeing, drowning at sea. The President should change course to actually destroy ISIS. American families need a positive plan for victory in the global war on terrorism. The President’s legacy of more gun control would not have stopped any of the mass attacks. The President should change course to reform mental health and to stop terrorists from attacking American families. I join the rest of America in hoping the President offers a positive agenda for the American people tonight, not more Big Government failure. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. f 
2015 NCAA FOOTBALL NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP VICTORY (Ms. SEWELL of Alabama asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with Congressman ROBERTADERHOLT , as well as with the rest of the Alabama delegation, to congratulate Coach Nick Saban and the Crimson Tide for a tremendous victory last night in the NCAA National Football Championship. What can I say? Roll Tide. The win represents the 16th National Football Championship for the Crimson Tide and the fourth national title in 7 years under the leadership of Coach Nick Saban. What an awesome record. The State of Alabama and its delegation are extremely proud of the talented football players, coaches, students, and fans. From Heisman Trophy winner Derrick Henry, quarterback Jake Coker, and the tremendous 95 yard run of Kenyan Drake, all of the players—the entire 2015 team—deserve our applause and congratulations. This team will join the annals of Tide history as one of the 16 national championship teams. What an honor. We also acknowledge the Clemson University Tigers for a great season and a great championship game last night. I want to personally acknowledge Representative JEFF DUNCAN and his staff for the friendly wager and the spirited banter on social media. I know that Congressman DUNCAN will look great on the Capitol steps in the Bear Bryant houndstooth hat and in the University of Alabama tie. Now bring on that South Carolina barbecue. Once again, we, the Alabama delegation, stand here today with slight humility and great pride to congratulate the Crimson Tide of the University of Alabama as the 2015 National Football Champion. What do we say collectively? Roll Tide. 
SERVICEMEMBERS RETIREMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT (Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, most of America’s Guard and Reserve forces also hold civilian jobs in addition to their military service; but, unfortunately, the IRS doesn’t treat these heroes fairly when it comes to their retirement savings. Right now, if a Guard or a Reserve servicemember decides to benefit from a Thrift Savings Plan, or TSP, match, then the IRS may limit the member’s ability to save for retirement simply because he also has a civilian career. This is wrong, which is why I will be introducing the Servicemembers Retirement Improvement Act. I am pleased that the bill is supported by a wide range of military and veteran advocacy groups. Just because they happen to be serving our country, our servicemembers shouldn’t be penalized when it comes to saving for their retirements. We are working hard to right this wrong. f 
THE STATE OF THE UNION’S EMPTY SEAT (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, tonight, for the first time, there will be one empty seat in our First Lady’s box for the State of the Union Address. One seat will be left open next to Ryan Reyes, whose boyfriend, Daniel Kaufman, was shot and killed in the recent terrorist attack in San Bernardino. That open seat will represent Daniel and all of the Americans who have lost their lives to gun violence. Tonight, when I look at that empty chair, I am going to be thinking about Mary Matsumoto, a 72yearold woman who was shot and killed in San Pedro last January; Armando Bejar, a 15 yearold boy who was shot and killed in Compton in September; Lucille Wills, a 74yearold woman who was shot and killed in Carson in April; Emmanuel Sosa, an 18yearold young man who was shot and killed in Wilmington, California, in June. That seat will represent the 436 people who have been shot and killed in just Los Angeles County alone since the last State of the Union. Heartbreakingly, if we were to save empty seats for each one of those victims, every seat on the House floor tonight would be empty. 
b1215 HONORING THE LIFE OF HOWARD GAMBLE (Mr. GOSAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory of Dr. Richard Howard Gamble of Sheffield, Alabama, who passed away on Christmas Day. Howard served as a giant in the field of dentistry where he held numerous 
leadership positions, including the president of the Academy of General Dentistry, president of the Alabama AGD chapter, and president of the Alabama Dental Association. Additionally, Howard devoted 17 years of public service to the State of Alabama serving as mayor of Sheffield, police and fire commissioner, city councilman, and Colbert County commissioner. However, I am sure that Howard would be most proud of his record serving our country in the United States Air Force. Despite these impressive accomplishments, Howard didn’t live to rack up titles or positions. He lived to fulfill his mission of making a difference in the lives of his patients and his community. In that regard, Howard was a huge success. On a personal note, I am incredibly proud to follow in Howard Gamble’s footsteps as a dentist who answered the call of public service and to call Howard a personal friend. His lifelong contributions to advancing the field of dentistry will not be forgotten. Finally, I would like to honor Howard, a graduate of the University of Alabama School of Dentistry, by saying two words that Howard would want to hear more than anything else: ‘‘Roll Tide.’’ Thanks for all the smiles, Howard. You will be missed. 
IN HONOR OF JOSEPH JACKSON, JR. (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Joseph Jackson, Jr., a resident of my hometown of Anaheim, California. Mr. Jackson was born on April 14, 1937, to a domestic worker and a janitor in Memphis, Tennessee, during the height of segregation. His tremendous civil rights contributions date back to 1960 when he was elected as the Youth Council president of the NAACP at Tougaloo College, Mississippi. On March 27, 1961, as a young college student, Mr. Jackson participated in a peaceful civil rights movement with eight others. You see, he wanted to be able to go into the Jackson, Mississippi, Municipal Library. They did a sit in—a ‘‘read in,’’ they called it. These nine civil rights students were recognized as the Tougaloo Nine. Mr. Jackson’s desegregation movement started small, but his efforts led our Nation to ultimately desegregate public institutions. As we celebrate Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Day, he has had an incredible impact, but let us not forget the Tougaloo Nine. We honor Mr. Joseph Jackson, Jr., and the Tougaloo Nine for their historic achievements, nonviolent activism, and their courage to advocate for a civil society. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN BENTLEY (Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dear friend and compatriot, John Bentley of League City. John lost his fight to cancer on December 20. He was a mere 73 years old. John and his beloved Geri, his wife, moved to League City in 1999 where they immersed themselves into the community by getting involved in local politics, nonprofits, and the local church. John served on the Galveston County Health District’s United Board of Health and served as a chair for precinct 152 for the county Republican Party. He also helped form the Bay Area Pachyderm Club where he was the club’s vice president this year. John was very passionate about local politics and became a very influential figure in our county. Along with his wife Geri, they established the Clear Lake Tea Party in 2009 where John served as the group’s chairman in 2010. It is with great sadness I must say goodbye to my friend, but it is important that we celebrate his life and be comforted in the fact that he is now with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. 
MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY (Ms. GRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in advance of Martin Luther King Day to recognize Dr. King and the advocates of peace, equality, and social justice who continue his work today. Dr. King spoke of a dream: that his children would grow up in a world where they would not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. Thanks to his work and sacrifice, I have had the benefit of growing up in a changing world where our content is more important than the color of our skin. We still have more work to do. I want my children to grow up in a changed world where, regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation, we can all be treated equally. I hope this Congress will remember Dr. King and will continue to work to ensure that all Americans have the right to vote, equality under the law, and the opportunity to succeed. 
SANCTITY AND DIGNITY OF EVERY HUMAN LIFE (Mr. POMPEO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Speaker, during his visit this September, less than 20 feet from where I stand, Pope Francis stood before this Congress and encouraged us ‘‘to protect, by means of the law, the image and likeness fashioned by God on every human face.’’ Throughout my time representing the people of Kansas, I have fought to defend the sanctity and dignity of every human life and to honor this Papal admonition. Next week, on January 22, the anniversary of the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade, hundreds of young people from all across Kansas will come together at the March for Life, united in their mission to advocate for the unborn. They will come from Kapaun Mt. Carmel High School, from Bishop Carroll High School, from Conaway Springs, from Colwich, from Chanute, and from all across the Fourth District of Kansas. I am proud that despite the millions of abortions that have been performed in the United States since Roe, that these young people remain steadfast in their efforts to end this unspeakable violence which has acted as a scourge against the unborn for far too long. As these young people march on America’s front lawn, the National Mall, I am encouraged that together we can secure the right for the life of the unborn and end a practice that runs contrary to the most sacred principles on which this Nation was founded. f 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF GEORGE MACOMBER (Ms. KUSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, as chair of the Congressional Ski and Snowboard Caucus, I rise today to recognize the life of George Macomber, an accomplished New England business leader, a mentor, and a very dear friend who passed away in December. Throughout his career, George was stalwart in his business, his athletic prowess, and his philanthropy. He was an Olympic ski racer on the U.S. ski team in 1948 and 1952, an official for the Eastern Amateur Ski Association, and a leader in business and philanthropy as president of the George B.H. Macomber Corporation. He loved the challenge and thrill of downhill ski racing, and he was a founder in 1957 of Wildcat Mountain Ski Area in my district in Pinkham, New Hampshire. Yet, as George found such extraordinary success, he never forgot to give back to his community. Over the years, he was a fierce supporter and advocate for many important causes in Boston and throughout New England. He was the father of three extraordinary ski racers and the grandfather of several more. He and his wife Andy masterfully balanced their ski racing careers, their successful business career, and their generous philanthropy. 
George Macomber will be missed by many, but his legacy of generosity, entrepreneurship, and extraordinary athleticism will live on for years to come. He will be sadly missed. 
EVERY LIFE IS PRECIOUS (Mr. EMMER of Minnesota asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I stand today in defense of innocent life. My wife Jacquie and I are blessed with seven wonderful children, each with their own unique gifts that they bring to the world. I am and always have been prolife. I am also opposed to Federal funding of abortion. On January 6, the House sent the Restoring Americans’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act to the President’s desk. This bill would have made Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in the United States, ineligible for much of the Federal funding it receives, instead reallocating those funds to provide for other women’s health centers. Unfortunately, the President put politics ahead of policy and vetoed the bill. The fight is far from over. This year on the 43rd anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I join many Americans in mourning the death of the more than 56 million babies who have been lost. The bill passed by Congress is proof the American public is determined now more than ever to maintain the standard and principle that every life is precious and must be protected. 
CALIFORNIA WATER LEGISLATION (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to inform that even if the El Nino rains and snows continue, the drought crisis in California is not over. The need to get California water legislation passed and signed into law in Washington and Sacramento is more urgent now than ever. While the people I represent are hurting and over 1 million acres of some of the most productive farmland in the world goes unplanted, people in our country and around the world, sadly, go hungry. If this El Nino effect continues, there will be an opportunity to move water to arguably the driest part of California, which I represent a part of. Therefore, Congress must pass legislation that can provide shortterm relief so water can be delivered to the San Joaquin Valley, because the livelihood of our farmers, farm workers, and farm communities depend on it. There still is time. We have a broken water system in California. It is time we fix it. Failing to pass legislation to fix our broken water system is irresponsible and a disservice to all Californians, including the people who I represent. TERRORISTS ATTEMPTING TO COMMIT GENOCIDE AGAINST CHRISTIAN BELIEVERS (Mr. PITTS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, the most ancient Christian communities of all are in the Middle East where faith has been handed down in unbroken succession since the Apostles. It is there that terrorists are attempting to commit genocide against Christian believers. To an alarming extent, they are succeeding. For the first time in 16 centuries, there is no Catholic Mass offered in Mosul. Christians were once 15 percent of the population in Syria. Now, they are less than 5 percent. The percent in Egypt has been cut in half. ISIS has over 100 Christians captive, even as we speak. Christian refugees are often afraid to stay at United Nations camps due to the threats of violence even there. As a result, there are disproportionately few Christians among those granted refugee status by the United States. Only about 3 percent of Syrian refugees admitted into the United States are Christians. While Christians are perhaps the most threatened group of all in Syria, the United States must not allow another genocide to happen on our watch, and we must ensure that we are helping those who are most vulnerable. f 
SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF HAITI EARTHQUAKE (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the devastating earthquake that struck the nation of Haiti on January 12, 2010. Today marks 6 years since the magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck some 15 miles south of PortauPrince, which is Haiti’s population center and the seat of its government. The aftermath of the quake was unimaginable. It is estimated that as many as 316,000 people perished and nearly 1.3 million were displaced. This tragedy struck in a nation already hobbled by grinding poverty, health disparities, and food insecurity. Today, there remain approximately 147,000 internally displaced people in Haiti with countless others remaining displaced outside of IDP camps. The world and the American people, though, responded to the earthquake with compassion and generosity. To date, the U.S. has contributed billions to recovery efforts, along with donors from around the world. The Assessing Progress in Haiti Act, which I introduced in the House—it was a bipartisan effort with Congresswoman ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN —which President Obama signed into law 2 years ago, provides critical oversight and reporting to ensure that aid be delivered in the most effective way possible. Unfortunately, more work needs to be done. f 
b1230 PAYING RESPECTS TO NEIL RATCHFORD (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay respects to Neil Ratchford, who passed away peacefully on Sunday at the age of 87. Mr. Ratchford was born on November 1, 1928. He grew up and lived his entire 87 years in Guyton, Georgia. He will be remembered as the sausage man because he made hot meat sausage, a family tradition since 1898. He continued this family tradition until 1999, when he passed along the business to his soninlaw. Throughout his life, he stayed community and familyminded, believing that the best committee meetings were those with three members and two absent. For over 50 years, along with his friend Lawton Nease, he spearheaded the 5th Sunday Men’s Breakfast, which brings fathers and their sons together for a morning of faithful worship at the Guyton United Methodist Church. He was a man of few words but believed you should make your words count. In the end, he joins his wife, Mary Olive, having lived a long, fruitful life raising four children and two grandsons, who now attend my alma mater, the University of Georgia. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family. 
A BANNER YEAR FOR THE LAS VEGAS VALLEY (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, 2015 was a banner year for the Las Vegas Valley. We broke records by welcoming more than 42 million visitors from around the globe to enjoy all that Las Vegas has to offer, and that is thanks to the hardworking men and women at our hotels, our restaurants, shops, casinos, and the supporting industries and agencies. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Rossi Ralenkotter and his team at the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. The LVCVA has made Las Vegas not just a great place to live and work and visit, but also a brand that is recognizable worldwide. Last week I had the pleasure of hosting Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx in my district for a tour of the Consumer Electronics Show and a roundtable with local government transportation, tourism, and economic development leaders. We discussed the 
intersection of transportation policy and the tourism industry, and we shared exciting new plans about how to revitalize our aging infrastructure. With the passage of the FAST Act and provisions I helped secure to ensure travel and tourism are part of our transportation planning, we have in place a longterm bill that will help bring this vision to life. Mr. Speaker, 2016 promises to be an even bigger and better year for Las Vegas. Come and see and enjoy it for yourself. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE THUNDERING HERD (Mr. CRAMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, if it seems like I stand here every year around this same time giving the same speech congratulating the same football team on winning the same national championship, it is because I do. I am here again to congratulate the North Dakota State University Bison on making football history by winning their unprecedented fifth FCS national championship, defeating Jacksonville State of, yes, Alabama, 37–10 in Frisco, Texas, last Saturday. Mr. Speaker, Bismarck’s own Carson Wentz, our quarterback, earned MVP status for the second year in a row, an accomplishment made more remarkable by the fact that he missed the last eight games with a broken wrist on his throwing arm. His backup, freshman Easton Stick, deserves credit for leading the Thundering Herd to eight consecutive victories en route to Frisco. Excellence is never accidental, Mr. Speaker. The coaching staff and the athletes at Bison Nation earned their place in history through hard work and exceptional preparation. These are to be admired by our Nation and aspired to by our Nation. I look forward to standing here next year to celebrate the green and gold on winning an FCS sixpack. Go Bison. 
WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES (Mrs. ROBY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, this week we are again taking important and longawaited action on behalf of farmers, foresters, and anyone who owns land by sending to the President’s desk a joint resolution ending the aggressive overreach by the Environmental Protection Agency into private lands. S.J. Res. 22 is a joint resolution with the U.S. Senate to end the EPA’s ridiculous waters of the United States rule seeking to expand the definition of ‘‘navigable waters’’ to include puddles, ditches, and other small bodies of water, making them subject to inspection. Of course, we all want to ensure that rules are followed to keep our waters clean, but making puddles and ditches subject to inspection just to expand the reach of Federal regulators has nothing to do with clean water. Mr. Speaker, you might recall that the House voted to put a stop to the waters of the U.S. rule last year, and the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals granted a nationwide stay on the rule. However, this joint resolution is the measure we needed to finally send this bill to the President and put the responsibility for this harmful rule on him. I will continue to fight against this radical environmental agenda being forced on Americans by this administration through executive overreach. The Congress is right to take steps to stop it. f 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, recently the Harris County, Texas, Precinct 4 Constable’s Office received a phone call from Alaska. The Anchorage Police Department was looking for a missing teenage girl. They knew that she had met some bad people on social media and believed she was in Houston. They were correct. Human sex traffickers targeted her on social media because slave traders are on the prowl for young, impressionable girls at the mall and online. They act like a friend or a boyfriend until they trap the victim. Then they enslave and force these young girls to sell their bodies over and over again. Mr. Speaker, our kids are sold at the marketplace of sex slavery. Why was this teenager trafficked from Alaska to Texas? Because of demand. People, sex deviants are willing to buy and force other humans into bondage. We cannot end human trafficking without ending demand. As we recognize Human Trafficking Awareness Month, Americans must fight for our kids and combat this modernday slavery. That includes sending the sellers and the buyers of kidnapped young girls to prison and rescuing the victims. And that is just the way it is. 
WELCOME TO HUNTINGTON, DR. GILBERT (Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome Dr. Jerome ‘‘Jerry’’ Gilbert as the 37th president of Marshall University in my hometown of Huntington, West Virginia. Dr. Gilbert has decades of experience in higher education. He comes to Marshall from Mississippi State University, where he served as provost and executive vice president for 6 years. I have no doubt that Dr. Gilbert will carry on the legacy of the beloved late Dr. Stephen J. Kopp, whose vision for Marshall University has helped transform it into the tremendous institution that it is today. He will also build upon the work of interim president Gary White, who has faithfully guided Marshall through a difficult time in the institution’s history. I am sure Dr. Gilbert and his wife, Leigh, and his family will see the Huntington community is one that they will be proud to call home. As the university continues to capitalize on recent successes, including the new Arthur Weisberg Family Applied Engineering Complex, I look forward to working with Dr. Gilbert during this exciting new chapter for Marshall University. Welcome to Huntington. Welcome to Marshall University, Dr. Gilbert. Go Herd. f 
WE MUST SOLVE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROBLEM (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is an exciting day as the President presents to us his vision for the Nation. In addition, over the weekend, Speaker RYAN indicated his vision and the opportunity for Members of Congress to pass serious legislation, which includes criminal justice reform. How exciting it is to be the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations and to work with my colleagues Mr. GOODLATTE and Mr. CONYERS and all of my colleagues on that committee to talk about important issues. Just today, we passed a bill dealing with mental health programs. A DOJ report found that 64 percent of those in jail, 54 percent of State prisoners, and 45 percent of Federal prisoners have some form of mental illness. Jails and prisons now house more than three times the number of mentally ill individuals than do mental health facilities and hospitals. It is clear that part of criminal justice reform deals with mental health, but it also deals with rehabilitation and reentry, which we are discussing in the Committee on the Judiciary. In addition, we are working on reforming the juvenile justice system. My message, Mr. Speaker, is, as the President speaks, as the Speaker has spoken, it is time now that we come collaboratively, Republicans and Democrats, and truly end mass incarceration and find a way to solve the criminal justice problem both by reducing gun violence, reducing crime, and helping the people who need the help. 
CRISIS IN MADAYA, SYRIA (Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to turn your attention to the crisis in Madaya, Syria. Since July 2015, this town has been under siege by the evil regime of Bashar alAssad. It has deprived the citizens; it has starved them; and in the last month, at least 31 have died. Those who try to flee face indiscriminate barrel bombs and targets by the Assad regime. Bill Clinton once said that the greatest regret of his Presidency was inaction in Rwanda. Mr. Speaker, I fear that our greatest regret, both of this President and of this House, will be inaction in Syria. There are over 250,000 dead men, women, and children by the evil regime of Assad because they believed that to target women and children puts more collective pain than to target just fighters. Mr. Speaker, if we are going to destroy ISIS—and we all want to destroy ISIS—you cannot destroy ISIS with the existence of Assad. Assad is the greatest recruiter to ISIS that has ever existed. Whether it is ISIS today or the next iteration tomorrow, Assad must go for the sake of a free Syria. 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
ISIS AND THE EXTREMIST SHIITE CABAL (Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I just want to further the remarks of the gentleman from Illinois who just spoke. There are those who think we can just go after ISIS. Keep in mind, the Shiite extremist alliance of Tehran, of Assad, of Hezbollah has killed far more Americans than ISIS has, starting with our marines in the 1980s, and including hundreds of our servicepeople in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have killed far more civilians than ISIS ever aspired to, over 200,000 in Syria alone. Finally, as long as Assad is in power in Syria, the Sunni community will be rising up in rebellion. Assad doesn’t fight ISIS; but he did, in effect, by his policies, create ISIS. In addition, the extremist Shiites around Maliki in Baghdad did the same in Iraq by oppressing the Sunni community of Iraq and giving rise to this ISIS scourge. Let us remember, we have got to go after ISIS and the extremist Shiite cabal. f 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington? There was no objection. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1644, SUPPORTING TRANSPARENT REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIONS IN MINING ACT; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF S.J. RES. 22, PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY; PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3662, IRAN TERROR FINANCE TRANSPARENCY ACT; AND PROVIDING FOR PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY 14, 2016, THROUGH JANUARY 22, 2016 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 583 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
b1245 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington? There was no objection. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 583, providing for consideration of three important pieces of legislation. Those are H.R. 1644, the STREAM Act; H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act; and S.J. Res. 22, a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers’ rule relating to the definition of waters of the United States under the Clean Water Act. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1644 under a structured rule, making four amendments in order, three from the Democrats and one from the Republicans, H.R. 3662 under a closed rule and S.J. Res 22 also under a closed rule. Mr. Speaker, like many Americans, I have grave concerns about the administration’s nuclear agreement with Iran. Since the agreement’s adoption in July, Iran has shown no goodwill or intention of improving its relationship with the West. In many ways, the Iranian regime has increased its aggressive attitude toward the United States and our allies. Against U.N. Security Council resolutions, the rogue nation has expanded its ballistic missile program, testing two missiles as recently as last fall. Just on December 26 an Iranian military ship fired a rocket near U.S. and French military vessels in the Persian Gulf. These incidents occurred just months before crippling international sanctions against the country are scheduled to be lifted. Further, Iran continues to be a state sponsor of terrorism, a direct threat to our closest ally in the region, Israel, continues rampant human rights abuses, and continues the wrongful imprisonment of five American citizens. President Obama and senior administration officials have claimed that the nuclear agreement and lifting of economic sanctions, which could return as much as $100 billion in frozen assets to Tehran, will help Iran down a more moderate path. However, reality appears to show the contrary is occurring. Just weeks after the deal was signed, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated that: We won’t allow American political, economic, or cultural influence in Iran. And just last week the Supreme Leader told a gathering of prayer leaders that: Americans have set their eyes covetously on elections, but the great and vigilant nation of Iran will act contrary to the enemies’ will, whether it be in elections or on other issues, and, as before, will punch them in the mouth. While President Obama may find something positive in Iran’s actions and statements, I believe Congress owes it to the American people to view Iran with skepticism and concern. H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act, requires the President to certify that those individuals and entities receiving sanctions relief under the Iranian nuclear deal are not involved in Iran’s support for terrorism, its human rights abuses, or its ballistic missile program. By passing this legislation, Mr. Speaker, Congress can help ensure that the U.S. will continue to sanction and deter terrorism and illegal ballistic missile tests within the state of Iran. In arguing for the nuclear deal’s adoption, the President committed to Congress and to the American people that our ‘‘sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, its human rights abuses, its ballistic missile program, will continue to be fully enforced.’’ This legislation gives us the opportunity to hold the President to his word and conduct the necessary oversight to ensure that sanctions are enforced. Additionally, this rule will provide for consideration of two other very critical measures that will help protect American businesses and families from the administration’s regulatory overreach. Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1644, legislation that was drafted in response to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement’s ongoing rulemaking process that seeks to govern the interaction between surface mining operations and streams. It is commonly referred to as the stream buffer zone rule. In December 2008, the outgoing Bush administration published its final stream buffer zone rule. This rule was the product of over 5 years of deliberation, extensive scientific research, environmental analyses, public comment, and a concurrence from the Environmental Protection Agency. Put simply, this rule was developed the right way, with transparency, unbiased research, scientific integrity, stakeholder engagement, and, most importantly, public involvement. However, shortly after the final 2008 rule was released, several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the OSM, ultimately leading to a settlement agreement between OSM and the environmental groups. After numerous missed deadlines, the environmental organizations renewed the litigation, the administration agreed with the complaint. As a result, the court vacated the 2008 rule and OSM subsequently restarted the rulemaking process. Since that time, the entire process has lacked transparency. Oversight conducted by the House Committee on Natural Resources, of which I am a member, revealed that the settlement agreement’s expedited timeframe, coupled with an inexperienced contractor and gross mismanagement of the rulemaking process, resulted in major issues with the administration’s rule. Now, this may sound just a little familiar. It is the very same sue and settle practice that the House addressed just last week with the passage of H.R. 712, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act. The outcome is another example of why sue and settle leads to poor rulemakings and onerous regulations that significantly harm the people, businesses, and jobs they are supposed to be supporting. Backroom deals between environmental groups and Federal agencies do not lead to sound regulations, but instead circumvent the rulemaking process to serve the interest of a select few, namely, special interests and environmental groups. For 6 years, OSM has been rewriting this rule, and the ongoing process has now cost the taxpayers over $10 million, though this is only a small fraction of the cost it will have on businesses and hardworking American families. The stream protection rule will drastically reduce our access to coal, which accounts for nearly half of our country’s electricity, leading to higher electricity costs and significant job losses. According to a study from the National Mining Association, the number of direct mining jobs that could be lost is between 40,000 and 77,000 and the total job losses is between 112,000 and 280,000, a fact that is underscored by the Nation’s second largest oil company, Arch Coal, filing for bankruptcy, largely due to the increased cost of Federal regulations. That happened just this week, Mr. Speaker. For these reasons, it is imperative that we pass H.R. 1644, legislation that delays the rule’s implementation, increases scientific transparency for rulemakings affecting mining, directs a transparent third party to evaluate the existing stream buffer zone rule, and reduces duplicative regulation. This rule also makes in order legislation dealing with an issue that I hear about very often in my congressional district. It strikes the controversial waters of the United States, or WOTUS rule. S.J. Res. 22 is a resolution of disapproval of the President’s WOTUS rule that was passed by the Senate in bipartisan fashion, and it is now time for the House to consider and pass this important measure. 
This legislation was crafted in response to the WOTUS rule promulgated by the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers, which redefines and vastly expands the scope of water subject to Federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. By issuing this rule, these agencies have given themselves broad new power over water and land across the United States. Like many of my constituents, I am very concerned with this massive Federal overreach. It goes far beyond the agencies’ statutory authority and could impose significant costs not only on American farmers and small businesses, but on States and local governments. The rule is another Federal power grab that has more to do with controlling land use decisions than protecting access to clean water. Mr. Speaker, S.J. Res. 22 utilizes the Congressional Review Act to block this harmful regulation, and it is time to send this critical measure to the President’s desk. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation and the rule providing for its consideration. Mr. Speaker, the rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of three bills that are critically important for the future of this country. b1300 We must pass H.R. 1644 and S.J. Res. 22 to protect American families and businesses from the rampant executive overreach that will be the defining achievement of the Obama administration. Furthermore, the United States must stand with our allies in the Middle East, as well as around the world, in the face of growing Iranian aggression, which threatens not only the stability of the region, but the strength of U.S. alliances and standing in the world. I stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that the Obama administration’s shortsighted nuclear agreement does not unravel decades of work by the U.S. and our allies to impose meaningful sanctions on the country of Iran. These sanctions have restricted Iran’s ability to spread its radical beliefs and inflict unknown damage on its neighbors in the region, and I urge my colleagues to support this rule, as well as the underlying legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong opposition to this rule and the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of three pieces of legislation, and two of these bills are under a completely closed process. In fact, these are the 49th and 50th closed rules in this Congress. Last year was the most closed session in the history of our country, and I think this year will probably beat last year. I don’t think that is anything to be proud of. This is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the world, but the problem is, we don’t deliberate very much anymore. We don’t pass legislation. Instead, we pass sound bites, and that is what we are doing here today. This Chamber has become an echo chamber, if you will, for the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee and its priorities, and the people’s business gets tossed to the side. When Speaker RYAN took the gavel, he promised openness and a return to serious legislating. And my colleagues on the Rules Committee, we give them many opportunities to be more generous with granting more opportunities for Members of both sides to be able to offer amendments. And every time we do that, they vote ‘‘no.’’ And every time we bring up an open rule, they vote ‘‘no.’’ Here we are, with two more bills that will be debated under a completely closed process this week. Things have to change here, and I hope my colleagues in the leadership on the other side will reflect on what the purpose of all of us being here is supposed to be. I would say it is about trying to find ways to come together and to pass things that will help improve the quality of life for all the people of this country, as well as to ensure our security in this dangerous world. Mr. Speaker, let me say a few words about H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act. My Republican friends would have us believe that this bill is a serious effort to increase congressional oversight of sanctions relief under the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran deal. I wish that were true, Mr. Speaker. Such a bill could bring together a substantial number of Members from both parties. I would be even more confident about such a bill if it were crafted with input from the administration about how Congress could be most helpful and effective in monitoring the Iran nuclear deal. Regrettably, what is coming before the House is another ultrapartisan bill that would shut down the ability of the United States to carry out its own obligations under the Iran deal. Rather than the world closely monitoring Iran’s compliance, this bill would make the United States a target of condemnation for failing to fulfill its commitments. In fact, it would be the United States that is the nation in noncompliance with the Iran nuclear deal. Now, many of my colleagues who are critics of the Iran nuclear deal have already signaled that they cannot support this bill. House Republicans made no attempt whatsoever to make this bill a bipartisan bill. They made no attempt to draft a bill that might actually be signed by the President and worth the American taxpayers’ time. This is political theater at its worst, plain and simple. This latest House Republican bill is even more dangerous because it plays politics with our national security. No one here wants to see Iran freed from its commitment not to develop a nuclear weapon, but that is exactly what this bill would do if it ever became law. It would make sure that the United States could not fulfill its part of the bargain, thus killing the nuclear agreement, and Iran would once again be free to pursue building nuclear weapons. That is insane. How can my Republican friends possibly think that this is a good idea? I believe that there are Members of Congress in both parties who want to work together with the administration in a bipartisan manner to build on the progress that they have made to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. I do believe there are Democrats and Republicans in Congress who genuinely want to strengthen the ability of the U.S. and the international community to respond effectively to Iran’s recent testing of ballistic missiles, hold Iran accountable for their support of militant and terrorist organizations in the Middle East, and secure the freedom of Americans currently imprisoned in Iran. I also believe that achieving these goals may not require legislation, but strong bipartisan actions that increase U.S. leverage with our international partners and with Iran. But playing dangerous political games with our national security by bringing legislation like this to the floor, legislation that would undermine and perhaps even kill the nuclear deal with Iran, is not the answer. Now, luckily for the American people, this bill is not going to go anywhere. Even if it were actually passed by both Chambers of Congress and made its way to the President’s desk, it would be vetoed, and I strongly doubt that the Congress would be able to overturn a Presidential veto in support of such a clearly partisan bill. Last week, Congress voted for the 62nd time to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and soon afterward, that bill was vetoed by the President. That is 62 times that Republicans wasted the American people’s time and taxpayer dollars trying to take health care away from millions of families, all to make a political point. Congress has already voted on the Iran deal. My colleagues who opposed the deal tried to kill it, and they failed. It is now official policy. Are House Republicans going to take us down the same path they did with the Affordable Care Act? Are we also going to vote on this bill 62 times, a bill that we know the President will veto, just so the Republicans can make a political point? 
Let’s stop wasting the American people’s time on such bills. Let’s put politics aside and actually work together to responsibly monitor implementation of the Iran deal and find ways to strengthen U.S. leverage in other areas of concern on Iran. So I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 3662 and reject this rule. Mr. Speaker, today, the House is also taking up two Republican bills that would have devastating effects on the environment and our Nation’s public health. The first piece of legislation, S.J. Res. 22, is the Republican majority’s fifth attempt to get rid of the Clean Water Rule. Here we are, having the same discussion once again, wasting the American taxpayers’ time and money. The Clean Water Rule was created in response to the Supreme Court declaring that the Clean Water Act needed to be narrowed and more clearly defined. So the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers did just that—they narrowed the scope and provided for muchneeded clarification. With the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers doing exactly what they were supposed to do, you would think that would be the end of it. The EPA’s ability to protect our water from pollution has been narrowed and the industry received the clarification that they wanted. Unfortunately, my Republican friends are pushing new legislation to further weaken vital environmental protections. The final bill before us, H.R. 1644, the STREAM Act, is a bill that is going nowhere and is the same bill that Republicans brought up last year, with the only difference being—and this is a major difference, I guess—but the only difference is that they changed the name. Otherwise, it is the same thing. Mr. Speaker, the sole purpose of this Republican bill is to reverse the rule that the Department of the Interior released last year that regulates the destructive practice of mountaintop removal mining. It has long been known that mountaintop removal mining heavily pollutes drinking water, destroys wildlife habitats, and puts local communities at greater risk of contracting life threatening diseases. Keeping the American people healthy and safe should always be our first priority in Congress. Yet, this bill is more focused on making it easier for big energy companies to continue the destructive and dangerous practice of mountaintop removal and gives no thought whatsoever to the risks it poses to the American families nearby. Before the recent rule released by the Department of the Interior in July 2015, parts of the regulations for mountaintop mining were more than 30 years old. Updates were clearly long overdue, and the fact that House Republicans are now actively working against the safeguards established by the rule is astounding. Are Republicans so beholden to big coal companies that they would put the health and safety of our country’s families at risk? This bill clearly suggests that the answer is yes. Mr. Speaker, we are only 2 weeks into the new year, and instead of House Republicans starting the year by working in a bipartisan way to bring serious legislation to the floor, we are, once again, debating political messaging bills that fail to address the most pressing issues we face in a constructive way. There is so much we need to do, and I believe that there is so much that we can agree on and actually move forward that will get through both Chambers and go to the White House and be signed and become law and actually improve things for the people of this country. That is what we are supposed to be doing here. Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve a lot better than this. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I have got several colleagues here that would like to weigh in on all three of these issues. But before I turn the floor over to them, I just wanted to make a comment about the fact that there are two closed rule bills in this. All of these issues before us today have been thoroughly vetted. They have been through the committee process. They have had ample opportunity for people to weigh in. In fact, one of the bills is in a structured rule. Actually, we are allowing four amendments. Three of those amendments are from the Democratic side. So I think that there is ample opportunity for all people to make their feelings known on this legislation in front of us. I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that transparency, public involvement, and anything that the administration, that this government does, is not a waste of time. In fact, it is our duty to make sure that the public has the ability to see what its government is doing, to make sure it is done in the light of day. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH), my good friend. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and, certainly, the underlying legislation. Despite abundantly clear congressional intent to limit Federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act to only navigable waters, the waters of the United States rule will expand EPA’s jurisdiction to nearly all areas with any hydrological connection to navigable waters. This rule relied on—and I want to quote here General Peabody of the Army Corps of Engineers—‘‘inappropriate assumptions with no connection to the data provided, misapplied data, analytical deficiencies, and logical inconsistencies.’’ In fact, the Army Corps, the joint author of the rule, was so concerned about the EPA’s methods, they wanted their name and logo removed from EPA documents. Furthermore, it has now come to light that the EPA broke Federal law by engaging in a propaganda campaign to carry out this agenda behind their rule. Congress has a responsibility to guard against these bureaucratic power grabs by executive agencies. This is why I introduced the companion bill to the underlying legislation immediately after the rule was finalized. The resolution has gained more than 70 cosponsors, with supporters from both sides of the aisle. Thanks to the expedited procedures established under the Congressional Review Act, when we vote on this legislation tomorrow, the bill will proceed directly to the President’s desk. Tomorrow’s vote will also mark the second time legislation has passed out of the House of Representatives to repeal the waters of the U.S. rule with bipartisan support. My hope is the President will listen to the American people, listen to their concerns, local officials, smallbusiness men and women, and begin pursuing policies which expand economic opportunity, and not stifle innovation with one regulation after another. b1315 Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I just want to respond to something the gentleman from Washington said when he basically made the statement that as long as committees take action, we don’t need open rules. That is a whole new approach to the way this place is being run. I thought the Speaker of the House made it very clear he wanted more open rules. The previous Speaker of the House did, too. He didn’t do that. The bottom line is just because a committee took action on it, there are 435 Members of this House, and not everybody is on the same committee. We ought to be able to have a freeflowing debate, and people ought to be able to offer amendments. We ought to deliberate. I am going to make a prediction that, if we did have an opportunity to truly be a deliberative body, you might get better legislation, and you might get legislation that gets lots of bipartisan support and actually gets signed into law and we get things done. Instead, we are stuck in this pattern where we really don’t have regular order. We have order enforced with an iron fist where people are just locked out. It is not just Democrats that are locked out of the process; it is Republicans as well. When you close a rule down completely, it means nobody—nobody—has an opportunity to offer anything. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the portion of the rule that deals with the Iran terrorism bill. I have voted for every Iran sanctions bill to come to this floor. I helped draft many of them, and I am ready to draft, work on, and vote for Iran sanctions bills in the future even if they are opposed by the administration. Keep in mind, nearly every Iran sanctions bill, which has passed this House floor, became law, and gave us at least some leverage over Iran, was opposed by the thenGeorge W. Bush administration and by this administration. We need a good process to draft good legislation that will do what President Obama promised we would do, and that is adopt new sanctions designed to change Iran’s behavior with regard to its nonnuclear wrongdoing, its support for terrorism, its missile test in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, its human rights record, and its seizure of American hostages. Unfortunately, this is a flawed bill which is the product of a flawed process. Look at the process: 100 cosponsors, all from one party, with no Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee invited to help draft the bill or even invited to cosponsor it. Now this process is epitomized by a closed rule. The gentleman from Washington offers a new definition of an open rule. An open rule is a closed rule on a bill that has been considered by a committee. That is the new definition of ‘‘open rule.’’ I suggest we keep the old definition. This is a closed rule that prevents people from offering amendments that might have had a better chance of passing on the floor than they would have in committee. A Member should be free to offer amendments both on the floor and in committee if they are a member of the committee; but this is a closed rule, and this process of a closed rule prevents amendments to fix flaws in the bill. There are at least two. The first is that the bill deprives the President of the authority to delist some 489 entities. It locks them on to the SDN list, but it leaves out 269 other entities, creating two classes of wrongdoing companies and other entities that sponsor and facilitate terrorism for no apparent reason. An entity stays on the list until the President issues a certification, a certification that no President could ever certify. You have to certify that we know that from the beginning of time the entity has not had any dealing with any of dozens of different terrorist organizations. That is a certification designed to be impossible and designed to lock entities in. I look forward to a bipartisan process. For example, I have a bill that has been cosponsored by the current and immediate prior chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee. There are other bills subject to a bipartisan process because we do need new sanctions on Iran to change its nonnuclear wrongdoing. Those sanctions are warranted because Iran has engaged in the missile test in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution, because its support for terrorism is responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people in Syria and Yemen, and because it used to hold four but now holds five American hostages, not to mention its other human rights records. It is consistent with administration policy that we have sanctions on Iran’s nonnuclear behavior. The negotiations in Vienna, the negotiations on this deal, left out all of Iran’s nonnuclear behavior, not because it was intended to give them carte blanche, not because we were accepting their support for terrorism, but because these were to be the subject of other sanctions and other efforts to force a change in Iran’s behavior. Finally, the question is, well, do sanctions work? That is the one thing the opponents and proponents of the deal agreed on. The proponents of the deal said that the sanctions have brought us a very good deal. The opponents of the deal said that more sanctions will get us a better deal. So in a House that was divided on almost every aspect of Iran policy, the one thing we agreed on was that sanctions have the capacity to change Iran’s behavior. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an additional 1 minute. Mr. SHERMAN. So the President promised that we would not abandon our efforts with regard to Iran’s terrorism and with regard to Iran’s hostage taking, and that we would not abandon the four hostages they had then or the additional hostage that they have taken since the deal, and that we would not turn a blind eye to the fact that Iran is the single most important ally of the butcher Assad, who has killed over 200,000 of his own people, not to mention Iran’s support for terrorism in Yemen. Mr. Speaker, we should not fail to do so simply because we have a deal that was exclusively, strictly, and explicitly limited to dealing with Iran’s nuclear program. That said, the bill before this House today is a flawed bill that cannot be corrected because of a flawed process. We need a bipartisan process that crafts a policy toward Iran’s nonnuclear wrongdoing that unites, if not all of this House, a large majority of this House. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to make the point that it is customary, whether Republicans are in control or whether Democrats control, that the CRAs, the Congressional Review Acts, come to the floor under a closed rule. I might also say that, regarding the STREAM Act, all amendments that were germane were made in order. As it comes to the bill pertaining to Iran, that bill was marked up in committee last week. No amendments were offered, and the bill passed on voice vote. Having made those points, Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the good gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ). Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule. Tonight President Obama will deliver his final State of the Union, where I expect he will celebrate his supposed achievements over the last 7 years. Outside the beltway, and especially in western Pennsylvania, there is little to celebrate about the Obama Presidency. The war on coal has been a central feature of Washington’s misguided efforts over the past several years, and it has caused the loss of over 40,000 jobs in the coal industry across the country and economic hardship in coal country. Later today we will vote on the STREAM Act, which challenges OSM’s socalled stream protection rule. I am a cosponsor of this legislation, and I look forward to its passage. The stream protection rule is yet another block in the wall of regulation that President Obama has been building the last 7 years. It will lead to the loss of thousands of jobs, and it will reduce coal reserves by 41 percent. That amounts to a $20 billion loss to the economy. Just yesterday we learned of the bankruptcy of yet another coal company. The job losses, firm closures, and disruptions to our communities are real, and they cannot be ignored any longer. This is an attack on cheap, plentiful, and reliable energy, and it will result in more control from Washington of the economy and the American people. Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow Members to support the passage of this rule and the associated bills. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I again continue to be amazed that the gentleman from Washington defends this process. I don’t know how anybody can defend this process, it is so flawed. The end result is, again, bringing bills to the floor that are going nowhere and that are sound bites. They are not serious legislation. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the Statement of Administration Policy on all three bills in which the White House says they will veto these bills. 
H.R. 1644—STREAM ACT  (Rep. Mooney, R–WV, and 34 cosponsors, Jan. 11, 2016) The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1644, which would delay for at least three years updated regulations, known as the Stream Protection Rule, to protect streams 
from the effects of destructive surface coal mining practices. Such a needless delay of these important safeguards would impact the communities and economies that depend on clean water and a healthy environment. The current stream protection requirements governing surface mining activities are more than 30 years old and do not incorporate significant advances in scientific knowledge and mining and reclamation techniques. An arbitrary three year restriction to block the updated modern, sciencebased regulations would significantly impair the ability of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) to accomplish the mission and responsibilities the Congress laid out in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, including preserving clean water, human health, and the environment. H.R. 1644 would prevent the restoration of hundreds of streams, result in deterioration of water quality for thousands of stream miles, and create sustained regulatory uncertainty, as well as public health impacts for downstream communities. In addition, the bill would impose arbitrary requirements and unnecessary processes that would seriously impede OSMRE’s ability to use the best available science to protect public health and the environment. If the President were presented with H.R. 1644, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY  
WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES  (Sen. Ernst, R–IA, and 49 cosponsors, Nov. 3, 2015) The Administration strongly opposes S.J. Res. 22, which would nullify a specified Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Army (Army) final rule clarifying the jurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The agencies’ rulemaking, grounded in science and the law, is essential to ensure clean water for future generations, and is responsive to calls for rulemaking from the Congress, industry, and community stakeholders as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. The final rule has been through an extensive public engagement process. Clean water is vital for the success of the Nation’s businesses, agriculture, energy development, and the health of our communities. More than one in three Americans get their drinking water from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs that are at risk of pollution from upstream sources. The protection of wetlands is also vital for hunting and fishing. When Congress passed the CWA in 1972 to restore the Nation’s waters, it recognized that to have healthy communities downstream, we need to protect the smaller streams and wetlands upstream. Clarifying the scope of the CWA helps to protect clean water, safeguard public health, and strengthen the economy. Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 focused on specific jurisdictional determinations and rejected the analytical approach that the Army Corps of Engineers used for those determinations, but did not invalidate the underlying regulation. This has created ongoing questions and uncertainty about how the regulation is applied consistent with the Court’s decisions. The final rule was developed to address this uncertainty and it should remain in place. If enacted, S.J. Res. 22 would nullify years of work and deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty needed to invest in projects that rely on clean water. EPA and Army have sought the views of and listened carefully to the public throughout the extensive public engagement process for this rule. Simply put, S.J. Res. 22 is not an act of good governance. It would sow confusion and invite conflict at a time when our communities and businesses need clarity and certainty around clean water regulation. If the President were presented with S.J. Res. 22, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY  
TRANSPARENCY ACT  (Rep. Russell, R–OK, and 62 cosponsors, Jan. 11, 2016) The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act, which would prevent the United States from implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) by tying the Administration’s ability to fulfill U.S. commitments under the deal to unrelated, nonnuclear issues. H.R. 3662 includes provisions that connect the United States’ JCPOA commitment to provide sanctions relief by delisting certain Iranrelated individuals and entities, including banks, to nonnuclear issues outside of the scope of the JCPOA. In addition, certain provisions would effectively preclude delisting of individuals or entities on Implementation Day of the JCPOA—the day on which the International Atomic Energy Agency verifies that Iran has completed key nuclearrelated steps that significantly dismantle and constrain its nuclear program— based on activity that may have taken place and ended long before Implementation Day and involving persons or activity that will no longer be sanctioned postImplementation Day. By preventing the United States from fulfilling its JCPOA commitments, H.R. 3662 could result in the collapse of a comprehensive diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Such a collapse would remove the unprecedented constraints on Iran’s nuclear program that we achieved in the JCPOA, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a devastating blow to America’s credibility as a leader of international diplomacy. This would have ripple effects, jeopardizing the hard work of sustaining a unified coalition to combat Iran’s destabilizing activities in the region, calling into question the effectiveness of our sanctions regime and our ability to lead the world on nuclear non proliferation. The Administration has consistently made clear that the purpose of the nuclear negotiations, and ultimately the JCPOA, was to address one issue only—the international community’s concerns over Iran’s nuclear program and to verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The JCPOA is the mechanism through which the United States was able to garner international support for our sanctions and achieve a diplomatic resolution. As we address our concerns with Iran’s nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, the Administration remains cleareyed and shares the deep concerns of the Congress and the American people about Iran’s support for terrorism. Powerful sanctions targeting Iran’s support for terrorism, its ballistic missile activities, its human rights abuses, and its destabilizing activities in the region remain in effect. Anyone worldwide who transacts with or supports individuals or entities sanctioned in connection with Iran’s support for terrorism or development of WMD and their means of delivery, including missiles—or who does the same with any Iranian individual or entity who remains on Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List—puts themselves at risk of being sanctioned. The President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of the JCPOA. If the President were presented with H.R. 3662, he would veto the bill. Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a statement from the Win Without War coalition, 11 million activists across the country in opposition to H.R. 3662. 
A STATEMENT FROMDREWPROCTOR , ADVOCACY DIRECTOR OF ‘‘WINWITHOUT WAR’’ The Win Without War coalition, on behalf of our 11 million activists, urges your office to stand strong against all attempts to undermine the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in Congress. In particular, we urge Representative McGovern to OPPOSE H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act. H.R. 3662, which would prohibit President Obama from delivering on sanctions relief, has the potential to damage the leadership and credibility of the United States at this critical moment just before the historic agreement is implemented. Furthermore, the timing of the House’s vote—between President Obama’s State of the Union speech and the deal’s implementation date later this month—appears to be a deliberately partisan act designed to undermine the President and weaken his legacy. At a time when much of the Middle East is engulfed in war, the US has rightfully seized this opportunity to solve one of our most pressing national security threats without dropping a single bomb. We must not let political interests trump our national security goals. Huge progress has been made since the Iran deal was announced last July. Just yesterday, Iran reportedly took steps to remove the core of its plutonium reactor and fill it with concrete. Sincerely, DREWPROCTOR , Advocacy Director, Win Without War. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from 65 environmental organizations representing millions of members in opposition to H.J. Res. 22. 
JANUARY 12, 2016. REPRESENTATIVE : The undersigned organizations, and our millions of members and supporters, oppose the Dirty Water Resolution (S.J. Res. 22). The ‘‘Resolution of Disapproval’’ under the Congressional Review Act attacks the Clean Water Rule, the Obama administration’s landmark initiative to restore safeguards against pollution and destruction for lakes, streams, wetlands and other water bodies. The Clean Water Rule restores important safeguards that once existed for a variety of water bodies. Those safeguards were eroded after a pair of Supreme Court decisions and by policies the Bush administration adopted, which left many water bodies inadequately protected or lacking the pollution control requirements of the Clean Water Act. The rule restores prior protections for many critical wetlands, which curb flooding, filter pollution, and provide habitat for a wide variety of wildlife, including endangered species and wildfowl and fish prized by hunters and anglers. The Dirty Water Resolution is an extreme action that seeks to kill the Clean Water Rule using the Congressional Review Act, which goes far beyond stopping a disapproved administrative action. The Congressional Review Act says that an agency may not adopt ‘‘a new rule that is substantially the same’’ as the disapproved rule, and the breadth of that requirement is very unclear. 
In the context of the Clean Water Rule, it could be read to prohibit EPA and the Army Corps from issuing any rule that establishes protections for waters that the Clean Water Rule covers, like lakes, streams, and wetlands. The Dirty Water Resolution radically undermines the agencies’ ability to clarify the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act—despite urging from industry associations, conservation groups, members of Congress, state and local leaders, and Supreme Court justices for such a clarification. By pursuing this anticlean water resolution, propolluter members of the House of Representatives are seeking to kill a commonsense and modest rule containing scientificallysound and legallyvalid protections for the nation’s waters, including critical drinlcing water supplies. Restored clean water protections enjoy broad support. In polling for the American Sustainable Business Council, eighty percent of small business owners—including 91% of Democrats, 73% of Independents and 78% of Republicans—said they supported the then proposed Clean Water Rule. A strong majority, 71%, also said that clean water protections are necessary to ensure economic growth; only six percent said they were bad for growth. Similarly, a bipartisan research team polled hunters and anglers nationwide and discovered that 83% surveyed thought that the Environmental Protection Agency should apply the rules and standards of the Clean Water Act to smaller, headwater streams and wetlands. Support for this policy was strong across the political spectrum, with 77% of Republicans, 79% of Independents and 97% of Democrats in favor. We ask that you oppose the Dirty Water Resolution (S.J. Res. 22) because it will undermine protections for our drinking water supplies, flood buffers, and fish and wildlife habitat. This attack on clean water is not only a waste of the House’s time but also an excessive and dangerous act that jeopardizes clean water for generations to come.

Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from eight sportsmen and conservation organizations in strong opposition to S.J. Res. 22. 
JANUARY 11, 2016. Re Hunters and Anglers Strongly Oppose S.J. Res. 22 Invalidating the Final Clean Water Rule DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : The undersigned sportsmen and conservation organizations strongly oppose Senate Joint Resolution 22, which the House of Representatives may vote on this week and would invalidate the final Clean Water Rule. This important rule clarifies Clean Water Act jurisdiction in a manner that is both legally and scientifically sound. This joint resolution is an extraordinary and radical action to overturn a fundamental, onceinageneration final rule that is critical to the effective implementation of the 1972 Clean Water Act, and that was adopted following an exhaustive public rulemaking process. The resolution would overturn a rule that finally resolves longstanding confusion and debate, promotes clarity and efficiency for regulatory programs promoting river health, and preserves longstanding protections for farmers, ranchers, and foresters. By using the Congressional Review Act, this joint resolution not only wipes out the final Clean Water Rule but also prohibits any substantially similar rule in the future. It locks in the current state of jurisdictional confusion and offers no constructive path forward for regulatory clarity or clean water. America’s hunters and anglers cannot afford to have Congress undermine effective Clean Water Act safeguards, leaving communities and valuable fish and wildlife habitat at risk indefinitely. This joint resolution dismisses the voices of the millions of Americans, including businesses that depend on clean water, who support the new rule and are eager to reap its benefits. The agencies engaged in a very transparent and thorough multiyear rulemaking process that included over 400 stakeholder meetings and an extended public comment period that produced over one million comments. Nearly 900,000 members of the public commented in support of the Clean Water Rule. A recent poll found that 83 percent of sportsmen and women think the Clean Water Act should apply to smaller streams and wetlands, as the new rule directs. The Clean Water Rule clearly restores longstanding protections for millions of wetlands and headwater streams that contribute to the drinking water of 1 in 3 Americans, protect communities from flooding, and provide essential fish and wildlife habitat that supports a robust outdoor recreation economy. The sport fishing industry alone accounts for 828,000 jobs, nearly $50 billion annually in retail sales, and an economic impact of about $115 billion every year that relies on access to clean water. The Clean Water Rule will translate directly to an improved bottom line for America’s outdoor industry. Opponents claiming the rule goes too far and protects water too much have filed a barrage of nearly identical legal challenges in numerous district and appellate courts across the country. On October 9, 2015, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily stayed the Clean Water Rule nationwide. The Clean Water Rule and those who oppose it will have their day in court. Meanwhile, we want Congress to know that despite these legal challenges, conservationists across the nation are steadfast in our support for the Clean Water Rule. After nearly 15 years of Clean Water Act confusion, further delay is unacceptable to the millions of hunters and anglers eager to have their local waters fully protected again. We are confident that, when the dust settles in the courts, the Clean Water Rule will withstand challenges saying it protects our water too much. The Clean Water Act has always been about restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters. It is bedrock support for America’s more than 40 million hunters and anglers and for the 117 million Americans whose drinking water depends on healthy headwater streams. We thank all of the members of Congress who stand with America’s sportsmen and women to block attempts to derail the rule, and ask you to reject S.J. Res. 22 and any other legislative action against the rule that may follow this year. Sincerely, American Fisheries Society, American Fly Fishing Trade Association, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, International Federation of Fly Fishers, Izaak Walton League of America, National Wildlife Federation, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Trout Unlimited. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from nine public interest, environmental, and labor organizations strongly opposing H.R. 1644. 
JANUARY 11, 2016. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of our millions of members and supporters we strongly urge you to oppose the stream pollution bill, H.R. 1644, a bill expected on the House floor the week of January 11, 2016. This bill would put costly and unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles in the already overburdened regulatory process with the sole intent of ensuring that coal companies can continue to destroy streams with coal wastes. The present rules protecting such streams date to 1983. After the Department of Interior took several years to develop the proposed Stream Protection Rule, this bill requires a new study, this time by the National Academy of Sciences, on the effectiveness of the current decadesold surface mining regulation. The bill carves out two years for the completion of that study and then bars DOI from updating the rule for an additional year after that. In the meantime, communities will continue to shoulder the burden of water pollution and mining abuses. The intent of these new delays is clear: let the mining companies continue unimpeded with sacrificing the streams and health of the communities that surround their mines. Another section of the bill adds new procedural hurdles before DOI can act under the surface mining law. Today, the Secretary and the heads of all rulemaking agencies regularly make available all the information relied upon concurrently with the proposed or final rule. Doing so enables stakeholders to weigh in during the public comment period on the basis for the proposal. This bill requires DOI to publish all scientific data used in a proposed rule 90 days before publication. It is unclear what the intent of this redundant provision is other than to congest the regulatory system with even more process and delay. If the Agency fails to meet this new paperwork burden, the goal of the authors is met—the protections must be delayed even further. Unfortunately, these types of delay tactics are becoming increasingly common across 
the regulatory spectrum as polluters attempt to dodge their responsibilities. Thus, H.R. 1644 continues a dangerous trend of undermining public health and environmental protections under the guise of transparency. We urge you to vote against this legislation, both to protect mining communities and to our reject attempts to delay and frustrate improved regulatory protections. Sincerely, Center for Biological Diversity, Center for Effective Government, Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, Economic Policy Institute, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Natural Resources Defense Council, Public Citizen, United Auto Workers, United States Public Interest Research Group. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD a letter from the Union of Concerned Scientists in strong opposition to H.R. 1644. 
UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS , September 9, 2015. DEARREPRESENTATIVE : The Union of Concerned Scientists, with 450,000 members and supporters throughout the country, strongly opposes The Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute to H.R. 1644, the STREAM ACT. H.R. 1644, as amended, would require the public disclosure of any and all information used to promulgate rules, and even policy guidance, relating to the Surface Mining and Control Act. As we highlighted in Science, this proposal is just another example of what’s becoming an old and tired song: an attempt to cloak an effort to block commonsense regulation in the guise of transparency. Furthermore, as we noted in a letter sent to the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this year opposing H.R. 1030, the Secret Science Reform Act, this type of proposal represents a solution in search of a problem and greatly impedes the agency’s responsibility to protect public health and the environment. The amended version improves the original bill by exempting certain types of data from public disclosure. However, the language is so vague, it will make it very difficult for scientists doing federallyfunded research to know whether or not the data they have spent years collecting may be prematurely disclosed before they can publish their own studies. At the very least, this discourages scientists from doing any crucial research that may be required to be publicly disclosed. Worse, by linking agency rulemaking to public disclosure, this bill risks the timely implementation of regulations and guidance documents that protect the public health and safety and our environment. Agency rules will be delayed if any piece of underlying data used to inform rules or guidance documents is not publicly disclosed 90 days before the proposed rule or guidance is published. This is flawed because the data is not owned by the Department of Interior and the release of the data is under the researcher’s control. For each day the data is delayed, the comment period is extended by a day. If the delay lasts longer than six months, the rule must be withdrawn. These restrictions apply even to emergency rules, unless a delay ‘‘will pose an imminent and severe threat to human life.’’ Notably missing here however is the environment. For example, if a stream is polluted at a level that doesn’t pose an immediate risk but may pose a longterm risk, under this proposal, the environmental pollution could not be stopped until it might be too late. This proposal offers special interests a new way to game the system, by challenging the comprehensiveness of any data that the Department of Interior submits to fulfill the bill’s requirements. Who decides when the data includes ‘‘all the data?’’ How much data, for example, must be released to justify an economic assessment, or an environmental analysis or a guidance document? Unanswered, too, is the question whether a regulation or guidance document based on exempt information is considered valid for purposes of this bill. Could the use of exempt information itself be grounds for a challenge? This bill would also expend taxpayer dollars by requiring the Department of Interior to spend $2 million on a study to evaluate the ‘‘effectiveness’’ of 1983 regulation to protect perennial and intermittent streams through the use of stream buffer zones. But the goal of the study is not to actually help the Department of Interior become a better custodian of our environment. The real goal is to impose a sweeping moratorium on all regulations related to stream buffer zones for the time it takes the National Academy of Sciences to complete the ‘‘comprehensive study’’ plus another year for review. Since the bill anticipates funding for the NAS in both 2016 and 2017, Interior regulations would be blocked for at least three years. If the study is never funded though, the rules would be indefinitely delayed. We recommend that you oppose Representative Mooney’s amendment to H.R. 1644, as well as the underlying bill. The proposal would inhibit the Department of Interior’s ability to carry out its science and evidence based responsibility to protect human health and the environment. We strongly urge you not to report this proposal out of committee. Sincerely, ANDREW A. R OSENBERG , PH.D., Director, Center for Science and Democracy, Union of Concerned Scientists. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the great State of Washington (Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER ). Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, for 20 years, Republican and Democratic administrations, alike, have effectively regulated navigable waters—which is the official term— under the Clean Water Act to protect both our environment and private property, but the Obama administration is trying to change all of that. The Obama Administration’s new definition will give the EPA authority over every pond or seasonal stream, drainage ditch, or puddle in the United States— every single one. Every piece of land where water falls from the heavens, the EPA is claiming control over. What does that mean if you want to put a deck on your house or move your driveway or build a shed or something similar? It means you are going to have to apply to the Federal Government for a permit. What do those permits look like? They take upwards of 788 days to obtain, and they cost upwards of $270,000 to get per permit, per puddle, per ditch, or per stream that you want to amend. So I hope you are either really rich and have a ton of time on your hands or you don’t want to ever change anything because this is almost impossible. I would call this new change a solution in search of a problem, but it is a solution that is going to create a problem. There is no evidence that this is going to give us stronger environmental protections, that we are going to have cleaner water, or that we are even going to have a benefit. What is really going to happen is the EPA is going to be kingmaker; and you and I, as Americans, are going to be forced to grovel at their feet, begging for permits on our own land. This really impacts those of us in the West tremendously. Every American should sit up and pay attention because this impacts everybody, including cities and counties. I hope you don’t need a new hospital in your area or you don’t need a grocery store or perhaps your city needs to expand or grow or change, because this effectively says that one agency, headed by very political and liberal—at this point, very liberal—ideologues will get to make that decision, and they are not going to give us the benefit. That is the scary thing here. So I look forward to joining with Republicans and commonsense Democrats, because believe it or not, just like in years past, Republicans and Democrats are both opposed to this, to put this block in place and to move forward. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would just simply say that there is a difference between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to the environment, protecting the health and wellbeing of the people of this country, especially from industry. I think we, on the Democratic side, have consistently been on the side of protecting people, and my friends on the other side have been consistently on the side of industry, no matter what it means to people. We see what is going on in Flint, Michigan, right now and the terrible water crisis that is happening there and the Republican Governor who is part of what appears to be a coverup at the expense of those citizens. It really is quite astonishing. b1330 Again, this bill is going nowhere. It is going to be vetoed by the White House. So we can go through this charade. I would just conclude right now, at least this portion of my speech here, by saying that, as I said in the beginning, if, in fact, my friends on the other side of the aisle want to get serious about legislating, there are areas of agreement on these environmental issues, and certainly on this issue regarding Iran, where Democrats and Republicans can come together. But for whatever reason, I think my Republican friends have no interest in serious legislating. I think that is regrettable because what we are doing here is wasting taxpayer money and wasting the people’s time here in this Congress. We could be doing other things that could actually be moving this country forward. 
I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL). Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ) for yielding. In my capacity as a member of the House Committee on Financial Services’ Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing and as a businessperson with over three decades of experience in both international affairs and banking, I have carefully considered the testimony of leading foreign policy experts cautioning against America blindly putting its faith in a country that has never done anything to make them worthy of that trust. The nuclear agreement has only emboldened the Iranian regime. And why wouldn’t it? When one sees the recent results of President Clinton’s agreement with North Korea and this administration’s lack of resolve and realism, why not? I remind this body, Secretary Kerry, and the President of the warning issued to the House of Commons by Winston Churchill: ‘‘An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last.’’ The Iranians have kidnapped another American, taken deliveries of missile technology from Russia, conducted missile tests in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and ramped up the actions and rhetoric against our Arab allies. All of this is disturbing. This is all before Iran has even received a dime of up to $100 billion in expected sanctions relief. When he announced the nuclear agreement, the President said: ‘‘American sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, its human rights abuses, its ballistic missile program, will continue to be fully enforced.’’ The bill discussed in this rule, H.R. 3662, guarantees that. This bill removes the politicization of the listed entities in the nuclear agreement and forces this President to live up to his own rhetoric. I am proud to support this critical piece of legislation. I call on all Members to support the rule and final passage of the bill and help guarantee the safety of the American people and our allies around the world from one of our most credible threats to our national security. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would just say to the gentleman that, if this were a serious effort to do something in response to Iran’s behavior, this would be a bipartisan effort, but it isn’t. It is clear what this is. This is a way to basically try to embarrass the President, I guess. That seems to be the motivation behind almost everything that is brought to this House floor. Mr. Speaker, as I said before, we ought to be doing serious business here, and we are not. One of the things that we have been trying to do on our side is to bring to the floor legislation and amendments to deal with the terrible situation with regard to gun violence in our country. We are rebuffed at every moment. We can’t bring anything to this floor with regard to guns, I guess because the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee doesn’t want to tick off the National Rifle Association. Be that as it may, I want to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question. If we do, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up bipartisan legislation—this is actually Democrats and Republicans who support this— that would close a glaring loophole in our gun laws allowing suspected terrorists to legally buy firearms. This bill would bar the sale of firearms and explosives to those on the FBI’s terrorist watch list. Mr. Speaker, amidst gun violence in communities across our country and global acts of terrorism, it is time for Congress to act and keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists. I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the RECORD along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for the life of me, I can’t understand why somehow it is okay to bar suspected terrorists from flying on airplanes, but somehow it is this terrible infringement on their rights to say that they can’t go out and buy a firearm. It makes absolutely no sense. I don’t think the American people—whether you are Democrat or Republican or Independent—can figure out why people are so resistant to that here in this Congress. Here is a novel idea. bring it to the floor. Allow us to have an upordown vote, not just a procedural vote, but a real upordown vote on this, and I am willing to bet that it will probably pass with a bipartisan vote. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, if it embarrasses the President to be held accountable for the very words that come out of his mouth, I guess there is not much we can do about that. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ). Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Washington for yielding me the time. I guess if we want to advance policy around here, the rhetoric coming from across the aisle about it being a waste of time to legislate and put these ideas out in front of the American people and hold the President accountable for the runaway efforts by his administration and his agencies, then we are just not hearing an honest effort on the other side. We have halfbaked regulations that will damage sectors of our economy in this 262 pages of revised rules that are coming down from the Department of the Interior. Since 1983, the stream buffer zone rule has been a rule that has struck a pretty good balance between protecting water resources and mining. Adding 262 new pages effectively bans all mining within 100 feet of anything that they might define as a stream, which is going to have very detrimental effects on energy and our ability to conduct business in this Nation. The new rule would lead to the loss of thousands of jobs, damage our Nation’s ability to produce critical minerals, construction materials, and domestic energy, something that we have had an advantage on up until recently. While Interior claims to have spent 6 years studying this rule, it managed to completely ignore the views of the States impacted by the rule. I think we need to have more local input and support to H.R. 1644 and hold the administration accountable for what it does. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), my good friend. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and passage of S.J. Res. 22, which provides congressional disapproval on EPA’s extreme overreach with their waters of the U.S. rule. Last June, the EPA published its final orders of the U.S. rule that would virtually give them authority over any place water flows or accumulates. This would include driveways, ditches, manmade ponds, and even our watered lawns. Currently, private and public entities spend an average of $271,000 and wait an average of 788 days to obtain permits from the EPA for projects currently under its jurisdiction. Expanding EPA’s authority in this unprecedented way would be extremely devastating to landowners, especially farmers, and make devastating statistics even worse. With this bill, Congress would nullify this ridiculous rule and continue to provide Americans with personal control over their property. Property is not an asset that can be taken control of on the whim of a government agency. Property rights are an essential natural right of every American, and this fact has been embedded in our country’s DNA since its beginning. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and S.J. Res. 22 so we can prevent this terrible law from infringing on the natural rights of all Americans. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I have heard a couple of speakers now talk on this, and I think some of the confusion might be cleared up if they actually read the rule. The gentlewoman from Washington who spoke earlier talked about that this would regulate puddles. Well, the 
clean water rule does not regulate puddles. In fact, numerous comments were submitted to EPA asking the Agency specifically to exclude puddles. I have got good news for you: the final rules does just that, and the clean water rule does not regulate most ditches either. We might as well get those facts on the table. I would urge my colleagues on the other side that maybe they ought to read the rule before they come up with a bill like the one they came up with. Mr. Speaker, I don’t know what else to say, other than the fact that this process stinks. Again, two closed rules and a structured rule on the third bill. We have a controversial bill on Iran that is one of the most partisan pieces of legislation on foreign policy that has been brought to this floor by my Republican friends. It is really frustrating because I think there is a lot of common ground on holding Iran accountable where Democrats and Republicans could come together and actually craft something that had, if not unanimous support, almost unanimous support. I think that would be a powerful signal to send not only to Iran, but to the rest of the world. But instead of going down that road, my Republican friends decided to squander that opportunity and come up with a political sound bite. The same goes for the two environmental bills that are being brought before this House. They are going nowhere, but they are nice sound bites, and they may please a particular special interest, but this is not serious legislating. I am going to say to my colleagues again, I know you are going on your retreat this week, and maybe there ought to be a side meeting that some of my friends have about what it is that they think we ought to be doing here in this Chamber and what it is that they think that their job ought to be. I would suggest that it has to be about more than just political sound bites and messaging bills. There is a lot that we need to get done. That requires us working together. I won’t get everything I want and you may not get everything you want, but we need to figure out a way to make this place work because it is not working. There is a reason why the approval rating of Congress is like in the negative numbers. It is because people see consistently nothing but political sound bites and messaging bills come to the floor and get voted on and we debate them passionately, but they go nowhere. I think people would like us all better, Democrats and Republicans, if we actually accomplished something. I hope you go on your retreat and you kind of reflect on that, and maybe you will come back the week after with a new outlook. Maybe all of these promises from the Speaker of the House and the previous Speaker of the House about a more open process about regular order will be more than words when you come back. I would finally say again that I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question so we can bring up this commonsense bipartisan bill to basically prevent those who are on the terrorist watch list from being sold guns. Again, I, for the life of me, don’t understand why it is so controversial, but in this House of Representatives it is. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. Vote ‘‘no’’ on this closed rule, and reject this closed process. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the good gentleman’s wishes for a good retreat for the Republicans this coming next few days, and I look forward to finding opportunities to work together with his side of the aisle on many important things facing our Nation. I just would remind them, too, that there have been plenty of opportunities for all Members of this body to have input on these pieces of legislation before us through committee, here on the floor, in Rules. I think following regular order is proving exactly what we wanted it to do to give people that opportunity. I am very happy that we have been able to do that. Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule that we are considering today allowing for consideration of three very important pieces of legislation that I think will protect our national security interests abroad and hold the administration accountable for sanctions lifted under the Iran nuclear agreement. It will ensure that mining communities and hardworking families are not crushed by another crippling Federal regulation, and it will help protect our rural western communities by providing muchneeded relief from the burdensome waters of the United States rule. b1345 Although we may have different viewpoints and differences of opinion, I believe this rule and the underlying bills are strong measures that are important to our country’s future. I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 583 as well as the underlying bills. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule 
[a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of adoption. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 233, nays 173, not voting 27, as follows:

The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5minute vote. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—ayes 239, noes 183, not voting 11, as follows:

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 1644. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 583 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1644. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PAULSEN ) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1431 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1644) to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to ensure transparency in the development of environmental regulations, and for other purposes, with Mr. PAULSEN in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. LOWENTHAL ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1644, the Supporting Transparent Regulatory and Environmental Actions in Mining Act, or the STREAM Act for short. The STREAM Act has three goals. First, it establishes a requirement for scientific transparency and integrity in any rulemaking conducted by the Office of Surface Mining—we will be calling that OSM during our debate—under the authority of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. Some people call it SMCRA. In the past, the Office of Surface Mining, or OSM, has sought to promulgate rules based on internal studies that are not made public. The first section of H.R. 1644, the STREAM Act, ensures transparency by requiring OSM to publish all scientific products it relies on in the rulemaking process. For federally funded scientific products, the STREAM Act requires OSM to also publish raw data. If a scientific product is withheld from the public for more than 6 months, then the rule, environmental analysis, or economic assessment it supports will be withdrawn. The second goal is to require an independent thirdparty assessment of the existing 1983 rule—which we are operating under right now—to determine if any deficiencies exist. The purpose of the independent study is to mitigate the polarization of this issue. As such, the STREAM Act requires the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Interstate Mining Compact Commission, to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of the 1983 stream buffer zone rule. Mr. Chairman, this study will examine the effectiveness of the existing 1983 rule by the National Academy of Sciences and make recommendations for improving the rule, if necessary. The Secretary is prohibited from issuing any regulations addressing stream buffer zones or stream protection until 1 year after the completion of the study and is required to take into consideration the findings or recommendations of the study. This element of the STREAM Act is important because it ensures that the 24 States with primacy over surface mining will have input on the study. Unfortunately, beginning in 2011, OSM completely shut the States out of the rulemaking process, even though OSM had signed memoranda of understanding with 10 cooperating agency States in 2010 and one other State signing on as a commentator. According to OSM, ‘‘States permit and regulate 97 percent of the Nation’s coal production. States and tribes also abate well over 90 percent of the abandoned mine lands problems.’’ That is in the words of OSM. The expertise for understanding the stream protection rule and other regulations promulgated under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act lies with the States, not with OSM. Yet, the States were completely cut out of the rulemaking process. The third goal, finally, of H.R. 1644 is to inhibit OSM’s regulatory overreach by curtailing regulatory action that would duplicate, enforce, or determine compliance with laws that are outside of OSM’s jurisdiction. An express concern related to the ongoing stream buffer zone rule rewrite is 
that OSM has sought to interpret and enforce the Clean Water Act, which is outside of its authority, by establishing a new set of water quality monitoring, evaluation standards, and procedures. In fact, the draft rule amends 475 existing rules promulgated under SMCRA, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. OSM used the rulemaking process to rewrite the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 and went well outside of Congress’ intent in writing that law. Also—and this is amazingly shortsighted for our economic and energy future as a country—the draft rule released in July 2015 would freeze or sterilize more than 60 percent of the Nation’s coal reserves. If the draft rule, as written, is finalized, the administration will expose the U.S. taxpayer to takings litigation. This has happened before. An example would be the Whitney Benefits case in Wyoming that involved a regulatory taking of coal reserves that underlie alluvial material. Passage of the STREAM Act will halt this destructive rulemaking process and provide an avenue for a collaborative approach to address deficiencies in the existing rule, if any, with the primacy States. It will save and protect the American taxpayer. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the STREAM Act, or H.R. 1644, which is simply the latest attempt by the majority to prevent the implementation of new, commonsense rules to protect people and the environment from the destructive impacts of mountaintop removal coal mining. Mountaintop removal mining is a serious environmental and health threat. It occurs throughout Appalachia. Countries literally blast the tops off of mountains, scoop out the coal, and dump what used to be the mountaintop into the valleys below. In the process, landscapes are scarred, wildlife habitat is destroyed, mountain streams are buried, fish are killed, and the people living in the valleys suffer. The impact on the landscapes, as you can see from this picture here, is obvious. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to look at this photo of a mountaintop removal mine and understand the catastrophic impact to the environment. The impacts, however, to people are not as obvious to the naked eye, but they are just as severe. Several years ago there was an article titled ‘‘Mountaintop Mining Consequences,’’ in the journal Science. As we all know, Science is one of the most preeminent scientific journals in the world. In that paper, a dozen scientists from 10 institutions reported that mountaintop mining with valley filling ‘‘revealed serious environmental impacts that mitigation practices cannot successfully address.’’ They went on to write that ‘‘water emerges from the base of valley fills containing a variety of solutes toxic or damaging to biota,’’ and that ‘‘recovery of biodiversity in mining wasteimpacted streams has not been documented.’’ Again, that is a direct quote. But let’s also talk about the impacts upon people. They write, ‘‘Adult hospitalizations for chronic pulmonary disorders and hypertension are elevated as a function of countylevel coal production, as are rates of mortality; lung cancer; and chronic heart, lung, and kidney disease.’’ These are serious issues. They deserve a serious response. The current administration proposed such a response in July of last year with a new rule to govern mountaintop removal mining. Sadly, the majority is falling back on the same political playbook they have used time and time again: attack, obstruct, and delay. What do I mean by that? As it was pointed out, the development of the stream buffer zone, which is what we are talking about, took place under the Reagan administration in 1983, in which the President and the administration proposed a buffer around streams to protect the valleys around it. It was just the beginning. It gave the Office of Surface Mining oversight over the management, knowing that there are really some problems in there still to be worked out later in terms of how you regulate when this is done primarily by the States. This new buffer requirement that you have got to give these streams 100 feet on each side went on after 1983. On December 18, 2008, at the very last moment—at midnight—in President Bush’s term, he introduced a new stream buffer rule in which he basically eviscerated the old and gave many more exemptions and, as I quoted, put in a new rule in 2008 that said that not only did it loosen protection, it allowed for the dumping of this residue from mining into the streams if avoiding disturbance of the stream is not potentially or reasonably possible. So what it said is that you can dump. If you can’t figure out what else to do, you can dump. Immediately that was challenged in the courts. By 2014, the Federal courts overturned Bush’s stream buffer rule. That is where we were by 2014. It was overturned by the courts even though it was never fully implemented to change the Reagan rule. Then what happened right after that, in February 2014, the majority party then said, ‘‘Let’s put up the loosening of the buffer rule by having now put the Bush rule into legislation.’’ Well, that was voted down. That came out of this House, but never was voted upon and never got to the President’s desk. Then what happened in the omnibus bill is they decided to change from direct opposition by weakening the rule to delaying the rule. They said, ‘‘Well, let’s put in a 1year delay.’’ This December that was one of the riders in the appropriations omnibus, but that was taken out at the last minute. Then we held a hearing in Natural Resources on this new bill that is before us, H.R. 1644, which occurred, as we all know, in May of 2015. We held a hearing on this stream buffer rule to delay the new rule that was going to be coming out in 3 years. But we had the delay in it. We held that hearing 2 months before the rule was even proposed. So we are delaying a rule that was first proposed months before we even actually saw what we were delaying in that rule. Then what happens is that we are now here to vote on a bill that delays the action for 3 years. b1445 It is really all about delay. It is not about the policy, because the policy, we would give at least a chance to work with this new stream protection rule if we were really dealing with the policy and seeing what needs to be improved upon where we are. We are going back to delaying it, the new implementation. Why did it take from 2008 until now to really come up with a new stream protection rule? Well, in large part that was due to the majority party’s multiyear investigation into the rule. We had various subpoenas and tens of thousands of pages of documents, but in the end we found no political misconduct. All we did was to delay the implementation of a new rule from even coming out and costing the taxpayers money. There were political shenanigans going on in the rule, even though they found no real political shenanigans going on. However, we had 12 hearings to deal with political shenanigans. The administration’s proposed rule comes out in July. It is now January, over 7 months. How many hearings have we heard on the proposed rule? How many? I think the answer is zero. So we have never discussed the proposed rule. We are now voting to delay it, without ever discussing what it is, and it is just completely irresponsible to be now voting on something that stops a rule in its tracks that we have never had time to discuss. Now, we know that this bill isn’t going to go anywhere. Even if the Senate was to pass it, the President has already issued a veto threat. So instead of this bad rerun, where the majority now is trying to evade and block this rule for the fourth time, maybe we should take a look at some of these environmental consequences and health impacts of mountaintop removal mining; look at the proposed rule and try to work with the administration to really come up with something that protects communities, instead of just attacking and, if that doesn’t work, delaying. 
I urge my colleagues to defeat this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MOONEY ) who has done an excellent job on the committee representing the folks of West Virginia. Mr. MOONEY from West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman LAMBORN and Chairman B ISHOP for their leadership in getting this bill to the floor, and my friend, BILLJOHNSON , for his continued support on this issue. It is imperative that we pass our bill, H.R. 1644, the Supporting Transparent Regulatory and Environmental Actions in Mining Act, also known as the STREAM Act. My bill delays the implementation of the Obama administration’s stream protection rule. When the rewrite of the rule was first proposed, the Office of Surface Mining described it as a ‘‘minor’’ regulation that would only impact one coal region. They could not be more wrong. This rule contains sweeping changes that modify 475 existing rules and is over 2,500 pages in length. Taken together, these changes will destroy up to 77,000 coal mining jobs nationwide, including up to 52,000 in the Appalachian region. This would be devastating to States, like my home State of West Virginia, that have already been hit hard by President Obama’s continuous war on coal. Between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs in western mining States will be lost, between 5,000 and 14,000 jobs will be lost in the interior States, and between 30,000 and 50,000 jobs in the Appalachian region will be lost due to this new stream protection rule. These new regulations would be catastrophic to the hardworking American families that depend on coal to keep their energy costs low. In my State, 90 percent of power is generated by coal fired plants. One recent study showed that if the Obama administration successfully implements its radical environmental policies, the average American family will experience a $1,707ayear increase in their home energy costs by the year 2025. The average American family earned $53,657 last year. The average family in West Virginia earned $41,059, which is $12,598 under the national average. This home energy cost increase will be detrimental for all Americans, but especially for West Virginians. When I campaigned to represent the people of the Second Congressional District of West Virginia, I promised that I would do all I could to fight for the coal industry and the hardworking men and women of our State. You have to understand that these jobs in West Virginia are goodpaying jobs. These are jobs that families rely on to put food on the table and provide for the health and safety of their families. This STREAM Act is completely unnecessary. Going after these jobs is callous and wrong. West Virginia and our country need the STREAM Act to pass the House and the Senate and be signed into law. I urge my colleagues in the House to vote for this important bill today. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA ). Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, not long ago, the Speaker of the House, PAUL RYAN, said that he wanted to make the House an ‘‘ideas factory.’’ But with this bill today, it is clear that the only items being produced by the House are cookiecutters, because we have done this before, again and again and again. House Republicans have made it their mission to kill the stream protection rule and protect the ability of coal companies to dump their mining waste wherever they want. They didn’t see the rule until last July, but that hasn’t kept them from a 5year crusade to prioritize mining company profits over the health and welfare of nearby communities, wildlife, and the environment. First, they carried out a multiyear investigation into this rule, holding no less than 12 hearings and demanding tens of thousands of pages of documents, and ultimately coming up with nothing. Then they passed a bill last Congress to block the rule. Actually, they liked it so much, they passed the bill twice. Those bills, however, went nowhere. This Congress, they included a rider on the appropriations bill to block this rule and voted down my amendment to strip the rider out. The rider was eventually removed before the bill became law. This bill will suffer the same fate. It will not become law. President Obama has said he would rightly veto this bill, and there are not nearly enough votes to override that veto. So why are we wasting this Chamber’s time on this meaningless cookie cutter legislation when we could be facing the real energy crises confronting the Nation, such as admitting that climate change is real and helping coal mining regions make a smooth transition off dirty fuel? But if we want to talk about the stream protection rule and the devastating impacts of mountaintop removal coal mining, we would have a hearing on it in the Natural Resources Committee, and I would welcome such a hearing. But, as my colleague and friend from California has pointed out, despite the 12 hearings the majority held on this rule before they ever read it, they have not held one since it was published. It is almost as if their minds were made up about the rule before it even came out. That doesn’t sound much like an idea factory to me, Mr. Chairman. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ), a member of the Natural Resources Committee. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for the time to speak regarding this important legislation, which I believe would help relieve the overregulation that we have seen in recent years in the coal industry. The coal mining industry has supported countless jobs in Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District for generations and continues to do so. In addition to jobs, coal also helps provide millions of Americans with affordable and reliable energy. However, overregulation, such as the stream buffer rule, has taken a big toll on our region. Layoffs have affected miners and companies across Pennsylvania, as these job creators continue to face unprecedented regulatory challenges. Reports have indicated that the rewrite of the stream buffer zone rule from the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement would lead to the elimination of 7,000 mining jobs and cause economic harm in 22 States. With the rewritten regulations proposed, this bill introduces a bit of common sense, Mr. Chairman. It seeks to make sure that the regulation is based on proven science, requires a study on the strength of existing stream buffer rules, and, finally, seeks to end duplicative rulemaking. This is the least we can do to help limit the strain and provide some certainty for coal companies and, quite frankly, families who make their living in that industry where so many jobs are in the communities that we serve. As a cosponsor of this legislation, I strongly support it, and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on final passage. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. YARMUTH ). Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. In recent weeks, we have learned about the water contamination problems in Flint, Michigan. By now, many of us have seen angry mothers and fathers on local television there, holding up water that looks like this, demanding a response from government officials. I think we all support the steps that the State and Federal Government are now taking to ensure that the water in Flint is safe for families to drink. But what if the legislation we are debating right now prevented government officials from taking that action? There would obviously be an outcry from Members on both sides of the aisle, and the bill would likely be defeated, as it should be. I am here on the floor today to say that this bill does, in fact, block government officials from protecting the water supply, not for the people of Flint, but for families in Appalachia and other coal mining communities. This water isn’t from Flint, Michigan. It is from a well near a mountaintop removal site in eastern Kentucky. This orange water is what comes out of 
taps in much of Appalachia, where water is contaminated by toxic mine waste from the reckless practice of mountaintop removal mining. I have talked to teachers in eastern Kentucky who tell me that when the children in their classes draw their environment, they draw the water orange because that is what they see. How tragic is that? I have had the opportunity to fly over mountaintop removal sites and the areas around them, and the water looks a lot different than it should, a lot of colors that come out of Crayola boxes. Explosives used in the MTR process pollute the air, and the exposed rock and particulate matter allow heavy metals and toxins to leach into and poison the water. The situation is made even worse by coal companies who are allowed to dump mining waste directly into waterways. These actions, and the consequences of mountaintop removal, have created a public health crisis, with families living near or downstream of these mining sites experiencing higher rates of cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, birth defects, and infant mortality. More than 2,000 miles of Appalachian streams have been poisoned since mountaintop removal began about 40 years ago. The Obama administration is trying to respond to that crisis with the commonsense, scientifically sound stream buffer rule. This proposed rule would take some important, although modest, steps to limit mountaintop removal practices and protect the water supply in mining communities. This bill would stop those efforts. It allows coal companies to continue to destroy mountains, pollute water supplies, and endanger the health of families living in the surrounding communities. Whether in Flint, Michigan, or eastern Kentucky, all families deserve water that is clean and safe and a government that cares and responds when their health is in jeopardy. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous measure. Mr. LAMBORN. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I am going to recognize a Member in just a second. But in response to Mr. YARMUTH , I would just like to point out that the Office of Surface Mining has left States out of the discussions. States like Kentucky are not allowed to collaborate in this process, and that is unfortunate, because I think Kentucky and other States have something to contribute to this dialogue and this issue. So that is what the STREAM Act that we are going to vote on in a little bit would accomplish. b1500 It brings the States back into the equation. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON). He has been a stalwart defender of the coal industry and the future that coal has in the energy and economy of our country. Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I thank the chairman for those kind words. Mr. Chairman, this is an extremely important topic, and I couldn’t agree more with what the gentleman has just said. This is largely an overreach by a Federal agency stepping all over the rights of the States to regulate their own use of their natural resources. So, for that reason, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1644, the STREAM Act, legislation that requires OSM to extend its new stream buffer rule while the National Academy of Sciences studies how current OSM rules affect the industry. Mr. Chairman, OSM’s rule will cost jobs, increase electricity prices, and jeopardize grid reliability, along with usurping states’ rights. Stop and think about it for a second. Shouldn’t Federal agencies understand what that all means before enacting a rule like this? The Supreme Court certainly does. The Supreme Court has already told the EPA, for example, in one instance: You have got to consider the economic impacts of the rulemaking that you are doing. According to recent studies, OSM’s proposed rule will have several very negative impacts. Let’s talk about how it is going to cost jobs. As many as 80,000 people could lose their jobs. Now, OSM said it is only 7,000, but a recent study says that it could be upwards of 80,000 people. OSM denies this job loss because they say these jobs will be replaced by jobs created to comply with the rule. Something tells me that those supposed new jobs are not going to be in places where mining is going on, in places like eastern and southeastern Ohio. You are talking about entire communities rolling up the sidewalks. It is going to raise electricity prices and affect the energy grid reliability. Roughly 64 percent of Ohio’s energy comes from coal. Ohio’s electricity prices are currently below the national average. In total, 22 States rely on coal as their primary fuel source. This is going to usurp states’ rights. State regulators who perform 97 percent of regulatory activities are completely left out of this rulemaking process. In fact, all but two cooperating agency States have terminated their agreement because of OSM’s actions. Look, this administration and this rule reflect a callous disregard for American coal, American coal miners, their families, the businesses that rely on the energy, and the industry as a whole. Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to put politics aside. This is about an industry. It is about people’s lives. I urge my colleagues to support the STREAM Act. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the Member from Virginia (Mr. BEYER ). Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the STREAM Act. We should not willfully delay the stream protection rule. I have seen firsthand the impacts of coal mining, both positive and negative. I spent 9 years visiting the coal counties in Virginia: Buchanan, Dickenson, Lee, Wise, Russell, and others. When times are good, there are good incomes and nice cars. When times are hard, times like today, when we are not mining much coal mostly because of the abundance of natural gas, then things are pretty sad. When I was Lieutenant Governor of Virginia during the 1990s, mountaintop removal became the most prevalent coal mining technique in central Appalachia. Surely, coal can have a positive impact on local economies. But we also have to look at the impact it has on the environment and the health of these same communities. My good friend, Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio, has said that these are about the lives of people. Absolutely right. And we have shown callous disregard for the health of the people who live in these communities. The citizens of these same Virginia coal counties have by far the worst health outcomes of anybody in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The cost benefit analysis, yes, but we are not doing anything to stop coal companies from mining coal or even mountaintop removal. We are just demanding that it be done responsibly. It takes tons of rocks and soil to expose underlying coal seams, but these are placed in valleys, headwater streams filled with all this displaced material. This can have significant impacts on water quality. West Virginia University—not one of those liberal universities in New England—a West Virginia study in 2012 found that mountaintop coal mining has adverse impacts on surface and groundwater quality. The Congressional Research Service, nonpartisan, said, since 1992, almost 1,200 miles of streams were buried by surface coal mining practices. The cumulative effects of such surface coal mining operations include, number one, deforestation, which has been linked to harming the aquatic community; two, accelerated sediment and nutrient transport; and, three, increased algae production. Surface mining has also been responsible for most of the huge flooding in central Appalachia because, when you disturb natural streambeds, cover them with mine spoils, destroy the vegetation, all the topography is different. Virginia Tech has been working with the coal industry for over 30 years to mitigate these effects, to reclaim the streams and lands that have been disturbed, and a lot of progress has been made. But we can and should do all that we can to protect our critical headwater and small streams before the impacts occur. Water monitoring found that Kelly Branch Mine in Wise County, Virginia, 
dumped toxic pollutant selenium into streams at levels far above the State water quality standards and without a permit to allow such pollution. As a result of a citizen suit, Southern Coal Corp. has since agreed to do the environmental cleanup, but we shouldn’t need the lawsuits which too often lead to the bankruptcies of the coal companies. Lawsuits like this make it unsurprising that a group of researchers from West Virginia University— again—and Washington State University published a study in 2011 on the association between exposure to mountaintop removal mining and the increased rate of birth defects in central Appalachia. This again gets back to callous disregard for the people who live in central Appalachia. These people have been paying for the externalized costs of mountaintop removal for far too long, and local communities have been suffering lifethreatening health problems and a damaged ecosystem. This is why, with Congressman LOWENTHAL and Congresswoman E STY, we offered an amendment to ensure that this bill paid attention to the negative health impacts. Unfortunately, the amendment was not made in order. But we can’t continue to ignore this. Adjusted for every other factor, overwhelming scientific evidence links the practice of surface coal mining with elevated rates of serious health problems, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and pulmonary disease, and overall mortality rates are about 20 percent higher in the coalfields than the national average. The ecological integrity of the streams is an indicator of the human cancer mortality rates. So the folks that live near these streams are much more likely to die and die young. This bill destroys the proposed protection for the people who live in southwest Virginia and coalfields across the country. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote against the STREAM Act. The people of Appalachia deserve better. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, in response to a statement that was just made, let me point out that Johns Hopkins researchers—maybe one of the leading medical institutions in our country—found that ‘‘no increased risk of birth defects was observed from births from mountaintop mining counties after adjustment for or stratification by hospital of birth.’’ So there are other issues going on that do affect the health in these areas. But you can’t blame it on mountaintop mining, at least not according to Johns Hopkins. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. LUMMIS ), who is a valuable member of the Committee on Natural Resources. Mrs. LUMMIS. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Chairman, if you have been listening to this debate thus far, you would believe that we are only talking about mountaintop mining. Well, I want to assure you the bill that I support that is on the floor today is also trying to protect non mountaintop mining because the rules that have been proposed by the Obama administration apply to all coal miners. They apply to nonmountaintop mining as well, including mining in my State of Wyoming and the mining that can occur in the State of Montana, to my north, that has enormous undeveloped coal reserves. My State of Wyoming has been the number one coalproducing State in this Nation since 1986, for 30 years. The reclamation of those mines is state of the art. If you go to the top of the tipples at those mines and look around, you cannot tell, if you are an untrained eye, whether the land has been mined and reclaimed or undisturbed and un mined. It is because the quality of reclamation that is required by the State of Wyoming is so state of the art that the water is clean, the land is reclaimed, the wildlife returns. In fact, the wildlife prefers to graze on the land that has been reclaimed, as opposed to the land that has not been mined. States have proven that they can regulate and return properties to a condition that Americans can be proud of and know that we will be safe. Yet, the States have been shut out of this regulatory process. Legislation which we are discussing today, the STREAM Act, would allow and restore States their rightful place in this discussion. Where the expertise lies is in the States. They are the ones that should be included in the crafting of any Federal legislation and, in my view, should be left to the States where the expertise lies and where the differences between mining on nonmountain property and a mountain property can be properly addressed. Applying this stream buffer rule, which the administration proposes, to nonmountaintop mines is absurd. I would further assert that the expertise to deal with mountaintop mining lies in the States where that mining is currently occurring. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue. Mr. LAMBORN. Will the gentlewoman yield? Mrs. LUMMIS. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. LAMBORN. I have seen some of the operations in the great State of Wyoming. Isn’t it true that the reclaimed and restored land does not have the invasive species that we have unfortunately seen in this country in recent decades? The Acting CHAIR (Mr. CURBELO of Florida). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. LAMBORN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. So without the invasive species in the restored land, you could almost say, couldn’t you, that the land is better than it was before? Mrs. LUMMIS. Reclaiming my time, the answer is yes, for several reasons. It is because the mix of grasses that are used to reseed the land that has been mined and reclaimed is a mix of grasses that provides for the health that allows for grasses that don’t naturally clump, grasses that spread out, to be on the reclaimed land. So when it rains, you don’t have the kind of running off of the topsoil that would occur if the grasses are the type of grasses that tend to clump, instead of cover the ground uniformly. So that is one of the reasons why the reclaimed land actually is a better trap for water. As we know, when water seeps into the ground, the ground naturally filters the water. So it allows for less runoff of topsoil and allows for the rain to seep into the ground. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has again expired. Mr. LAMBORN. I yield the gentlewoman from Wyoming an additional 30 seconds. Mrs. LUMMIS. The soil itself is a natural filter for this water. These are the kind of things that States’ experts know, and their expertise should be inserted into any rulemaking process. That is part of the reason that I support the STREAM Act. I support my colleagues from the East and appreciate their attention to this important piece of legislation. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I would like to talk in response to some of the points raised by my esteemed colleagues from the other side about the doom and gloom of job loss numbers that they presented. I believe 70,000 jobs will be lost with the proposed rule or we just heard also possibly 80,000 direct mining jobs might be lost. These are, indeed, frightening numbers. Unfortunately, they are not credible and not based upon any kind of evidence. Those estimates which we are hearing come from a study that was paid for by the National Mining Association, and those numbers are the same, that 70 or 80,000, as the total number of coal mining jobs currently in the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration. b1515 In fact, the National Mining Association study that we have heard about projects up to 52,000 coal mining job losses in Appalachia as a result of the administration’s proposed rule. There are less than 50,000 coal miners in that entire region today, so apparently this rule creates jobs before it costs jobs. We shouldn’t be surprised that the industry would come up with such inflated numbers. After all, they don’t need to be accurate. They just need to scare people, much in the same way as the American public was told that the Affordable Care Act is going to destroy an untold number of jobs, except that 
we have now added 14 million private sector jobs since that act was signed into law. Today we should be extremely skeptical of industry scare tactics. Actually, the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the stream protection rule found, in fact, not 70,000, not 80,000, but there would be a net loss of only 10 jobs. This is a small price to pay for cleaner water and healthier communities. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In response to my good friend and colleague Representative LOWENTHAL , I would like to say that just in today’s Wall Street Journal, Arch Coal revealed that it has declared bankruptcy. They are one of the top coal producers in this country. I would say that the loss of jobs and this administration’s war on coal is actually a staggering and frightening phenomenon, and that is why we need the STREAM Act. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. JENKINS ). Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. I thank the chairman. I rise today in support of the pending legislation, H.R. 1644, the STREAM Act. Appalachia is suffering. Years of burdensome regulations from this administration have had a devastating impact on coal. West Virginia miners, families, and businesses are paying the price. Since 2012, according to The Wall Street Journal, 27 coal mining companies in Appalachia have filed for bankruptcy. In just the past 4 years, we have seen 7,000 coal miners lose their jobs in West Virginia. Why? Because each and every day, President Obama’s EPA and the Office of Surface Mining are regulating coal mines out of business and putting miners on the unemployment line. Coal miners are the heart and soul of communities in West Virginia, and the significant layoffs we are experiencing are simply heartbreaking. The President, the EPA, and the OSM continue to ignore the economic pain they are inflicting. The stream buffer zone rule, which the STREAM Act would halt, is yet another example of unnecessary regulation, one that will increase energy costs for American families and businesses. The OSM’s new stream buffer zone rule will lead to thousands more job losses in West Virginia and across the Nation. An independent study found it would eliminate at least 40,000 direct coal mining jobs on top of the 42,000 indirect jobs and other jobs that have been lost just since 2011. Even OSM’s own analysis estimates that this rule would result in the loss of thousands of jobs. That does not include the thousands of jobs that depend on coal indirectly: our Nation’s small businesses, equipment manufacturers, transportation, and others. Mr. Chairman, this is unacceptable. It is also the reason why I helped secure a provision in the omnibus that mandates that OSM work with the States. I support the STREAM Act, and I encourage its passage. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 81⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Colorado has 9
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I would like to respond to my colleague’s comments about the lack of any health impacts of mountaintop mining, quoting a study from Johns Hopkins University about the lack of any identifiable birth defects that are correlated with coal mining or mountaintop mining. I would like to again read from the Science article of January 8, 2010, called ‘‘Mountaintop Mining Consequences,’’ a collaborative effort of scientists from the University of Maryland; from Duke University; from the University of Minnesota; from West Virginia University; from Wake Forest University; from Miami University, Oxford, Ohio; from the University of California at Berkeley; from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; and from the same Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland. They found their results on the potential for human health impacts were this: adult hospitalizations for chronic pulmonary disorders and hypertension are elevated as a function of county level coal production, as are rates of mortality, lung cancer, and chronic heart, lung, and kidney diseases. That is what the scientists have found that are the result of a potential for human health impacts. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY ). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support H.R. 1644. I think it is really important that sometimes we actually talk to people who work in coal country, people who live in coal country, people who have generationally been part of coal mining. Too often I come to this floor in America’s House and I hear all these different things that are going on. If you want to talk about health, let’s talk about the health of our community. Let’s talk about the tens of thousands of jobs that will be lost because of more regulations. We know that commodity prices will fluctuate. The one thing we know for sure is that regulation will not. It will forever put a price tag on this product that will make it impossible for it to compete on the open market. Yet we will sit here and we will talk about things that really aren’t true, and we will say it in a manner that we say this is so bad, this product is so horrible, do you realize what it is doing? And my answer is, yes, I do. It employees tens of thousands of Americans. These are not, by the way, Republican jobs. These are Democrat jobs for the most part. These are American jobs. These are red, white, and blue jobs. This is about a product that has been the workforce of American energy. This makes it possible for America to compete anywhere in the world because of low energy costs. I would just ask my friends, while it may become a political issue and it may seem like it is a great talking point, you need to walk in those communities. You need to go into those schools. You need to go into those towns. You need to go into those homes. You need to go into those mines. You need to look into the faces and the eyes of the people who bring this tremendous product out of the ground and tell them what they have been doing generationally is horrible for the country. You need to tell them that the way they have been making a living, the way they have been putting a roof over the heads of their children, the way they have been putting food on the table for their kids, the way they have been putting clothes on their backs, and the way they have been preparing for their future is bad; you have acted terribly in doing this, and we need ought to spank you. Really minor adjustments—475 modifications. That is not minor; that is major. That makes the cost of this product go off the charts. It doesn’t matter that it changes anything. This is one promise the President kept. When he was a candidate running for this office, he said: If you want to continue to make power, make electricity, by using coalfired power plants, you can do that, but I will bankrupt you. He has kept that promise. Promise made, promise kept. He has turned his back on over a quarter of a million people who depend on coal for their livelihood. He has turned his back on an America that is looking to take advantage of gifts that were given to us by God—natural resources. We have not turned our back on health; we have not turned our back on the future of our children; but what we also will not do is we will not turn our back on onerous regulations that do nothing to make it better for our people. All we are asking for is to take a really good look at this. The stream protection rule, that doesn’t make sense. The Clean Power Plan didn’t make sense. It makes sense to some because it will put them out of business to say: All right. Fine. We need to do this to really hurt these folks. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. LAMBORN. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. It really comes down to this. We are at a crossroads in this country. We have to present really bold visions of where we 
think the country should be going. We need to talk about policies that are going to make America stronger. We need to talk about policies that put Americans back to work. We need to talk about policies that the American people can look at and say: Do you know what? There is a clear difference. There is a new day coming for America. There is a new way to run the government. There is a new way to look at regulations and understand that these aren’t helping; they are hurting. I would just ask all of my colleagues very strongly to support H.R. 1644. Do the right thing for America. Forget about whether to wear a red shirt or a blue shirt. Think about the red, white, and blue that we stand for every day. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would just like to respond to some of the attacks from the other side that are supporting the STREAM Act that the administration’s stream protection rule is really an attempt to destroy jobs, it is really part of, as one of my colleagues has said, the war on coal. But nothing could be further from the truth. What we are talking about are commonsense protections for communities. Contrary to the Republican chorus that there is a war on coal, let me read to you, Members, that the Energy Information Administration estimates that U.S. coal production for 2014 was up 14 million short tons from 2013, and that this production growth is going to continue through 2030. While coal exports are predicted to drop in the short term, they are going to reach historic high grounds around 2030. We are not talking about destroying these communities. We are talking about allowing these communities to thrive, to be healthy, to protect the valleys, to protect the streams, to protect the ecology, to protect the public health, and to allow us to have mountaintop mining, but safe and healthy mountaintop mining. That is what we are talking about. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague, Mr. LAMBORN . This is a very important issue. I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. MOONEY , for sponsoring this piece of legislation that not only impacts his home State of West Virginia and the other coalproducing States in the Midwest, but also my home State of Illinois. Coal production in my home State is a significant driver in our State’s economy, particularly the part of the State that I represent. I would not be here today, Mr. Chairman, without what coal has meant to my hometown of Taylorville in my home county of Christian County. I saw in the midnineties what a signature on a piece of paper right here in Washington, D.C., can do to destroy a local economy. In Illinois alone, today, coal jobs employ nearly 5,000 workers. Just a few short years ago, that was many more. The industry contributes $2 billion to our State’s economy. Unfortunately, this proposed stream protection rule is another example of this Obama administration waging war on coal. By their own estimates, OSM claims this rule would kill 7,000 coal jobs. That is 2,000 more than exist in the State of Illinois today. Through independent analysis, it shows job losses may be even more in the tens of thousands. This rule is not only going to hurt coal miners, but also those in my district and others that work at coalfired power plants. It is going to hurt consumers. It is going to hurt the poorest of the poor in this country, who are going to have to pay higher rates when base load generation facilities that burn coal go offline. b1530 These coalfired power plants, Mr. Chairman, provide some of the best paying jobs in my district. Where are they going to go to find work when this administration’s war on coal takes their jobs away? I have advocated for important language in working with my colleagues Mr. MOONEY , Mr. L AMBORN , BILLJOHNSONfrom Ohio, J IMRENACCI , and others. We want to make sure that we have the States sign off on this OSM stream protection rule before the Federal Government can come in and take those coal mining jobs away. Mr. Chairman, it is clear that this administration’s war on coal isn’t going to stop today. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this legislation. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close as soon as the opposing side has closed. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I would like to read a few lines from a letter that was sent from a coalition of 35 national and local groups which are strongly opposed to this bill. They write: ‘‘The proposed stream protection rule is essential to protect the waters in mining regions and to ensure that communities will have viable economies after the resource is extracted and mining ceases.’’ They go on to point out that mountaintop removal mining is ‘‘responsible for the destruction of over 500 mountains and approximately 2,000 miles of stream channels across central Appalachia. This form of coal mining devastates both the thriving natural ecosystems of the Appalachian Mountains as well as entire communities of residents who have lived on their homesteads for generations.’’ They conclude: ‘‘Please oppose the STREAM Act, and allow the proposed stream protection rule to proceed without congressional interference so that communities living in the shadows of mining sites can have safe water resources.’’ I also have a letter of opposition from the United Auto Workers and eight other organizations, which state: ‘‘This bill would put costly and unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles into the already overburdened regulatory process with the sole intent of ensuring that coal companies can continue to destroy streams and coal wastes. We urge you to vote against this legislation both to protect mining communities and to reject attempts to delay and frustrate improved regulatory protections.’’ Mr. Chairman, I urge the opposition to H.R. 1644. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In my closing remarks, I would like to highlight the findings of an economic impact analysis of the draft stream buffer zone rule, released in 2015, issued against the Obama administration regulation. The study was done by the ENVIRON International Corporation. ENVIRON found that 64 percent of the Nation’s coal reserves would be sterilized, or frozen, resulting in an annual loss in value that ranges between $14 billion to $29 billion. The proposed rule hits longwall mining particularly hard, causing a decrease of 47 to 85 percent in recoverable longwall coal reserves. Longwall mining is considered the safest, most efficient, and most profitable type of underground mining. Sterilizing so much of the Nation’s coal reserves will have a significant impact on employment, ranging from a loss of 40,000 to about 77,000 direct jobs and 112,000 to 280,000 indirect jobs from those businesses and industries that provide goods and services to the mining sector. These jobs are highpaying, family wage jobs, with excellent benefits, including health care. The economic impact to the coalproducing States and counties will be staggering. The STREAM Act instills sanity into the Office of Surface Mining’s rulemaking process by requiring transparency in the scientific products used by OSM in any rulemaking that they have. It narrowly focuses the stream buffer zone rule to actual stream buffer zones and not 474 other regulations. It also allows States with the expertise in regulating the Nation’s coal mines to participate in the assessment of the effectiveness of the existing rule. Finally, it reins in OSM’s overreach into areas outside of its statutory jurisdiction. Mr. Chairman, there are two great ironies in this whole war on coal by the administration. Actually, it is a war on the American people. It is a war on working families because it not only costs highpaying jobs, but it drives up 
the cost of energy. When you drive up the cost of energy, that takes money out of people’s pockets, and they have less money left over to take care of their families and to provide for their futures. If the war on coal by this administration were successful, not only would you have those negative impacts, but many of the environmentalists would just create another war. There is already one major group that says, ‘‘Oh, we don’t even like natural gas,’’ which is being touted as the replacement for coal. They don’t even like that. There will be some other reason to which they will find objection with regard to whatever takes coal’s place, would that day ever come. When you run the numbers, the environmental impact of getting rid of coal completely for electrical generation would have a negligible impact on any future impact on the global climate. Let’s pass the STREAM Act as it protects jobs, it protects rural communities, and it protects the American taxpayer. I ask that my colleagues support this important piece of legislation and vote for its final passage. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the STREAM Act, which is a dangerous and unnecessary bill that would delay the finalization of the Department of Interior’s Stream Protection Rule. This critical rule will improve methods for monitoring and preventing damage to surface and groundwater from mountaintop removal coal mining. Surface mining in the steep slopes of Appalachia has disrupted the biological integrity of an area about the size of Delaware, buried approximately 2,000 miles of streams with mining waste, and contaminated downstream areas with toxic elements. Because of this dangerous practice, people have been drinking the byproducts of coal waste from mountaintop removal for more than two decades. Rather than clean and clear water running out of their faucets, the people of Appalachia are left with orange or black liquid instead. The health problems caused by exposure to these chemicals and heavy metals include cancers, organ failure, and learning disabilities. Not only that, but there are multiple cases of children suffering from asthma, headaches, nausea, and other symptoms likely due to toxic contamination from coal dust. This is environmental injustice. The people of Appalachia should have the right to send their children to a school not threatened by billions of gallons of coal slurry; the right to preserve the streams and valleys that have been part of their way of life; and the right to protect their own land, no matter how much coal might be underneath. I have consistently introduced legislation, the Clean Water Protection Act, which would put a stop to mountaintop removal mining, and I plan to reintroduce the bill in the beginning of this year. I urge my colleagues to oppose the legislation before us today that will only perpetuate the dangerous practice of mountaintop removal mining. The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5minute rule the amendment in the nature of a substitute, recommended by the Committee on Natural Resources, printed in the bill. The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. The text of the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows: 
H.R. 1644 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Supporting Transparent Regulatory and Environmental Actions in Mining Act’’ or the ‘‘STREAM Act’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in House Report 114–395. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . LAMBORN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 114–395. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I believe that this amendment is really technical in nature. It does two things. First, we ensure that the legislation does not infringe on copyright laws. According to the largest private publishers of scientific research, governmentfunded studies will be made publicly available ‘‘where the government has funded the publication of a private sector, peerreviewed article or where the author of the article is a government employee . . . we do not dispute that any such article couldn’t be made publicly available.’’ We are addressing that concern that was raised during the markup of this bill. Second, we identified a technical error in a U.S. Code citation and corrected it. I ask for a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition to the amendment even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, this amendment makes a small change to section 2 to make the bill somewhat more palatable to scientific publishers. So I will not oppose it, but it does nothing to actually improve the bill itself nor the requirement surrounding the advance publication of scientific data. Today we received a letter from the Union of Concerned Scientists that says they are strongly opposed to H.R. 1644. The scientists write: ‘‘This proposal is just another attempt of what is becoming an old and tired song, an attempt to cloak an effort to block commonsense regulations in the guise of transparency.’’ They continue: ‘‘The amended version improves the original bill by exempting certain types of data from public disclosure. However, the language is so vague it will make it very difficult for scientists doing federally funded research to know whether or not the data they have spent years collecting may be prematurely disclosed before they can publish their own studies. At the very least, this discourages scientists from doing any crucial research that may be required to be publicly disclosed.’’ They conclude: ‘‘If passed, H.R. 1644 would inhibit the Department of the Interior’s ability to carry out its science and evidencebased responsibility to protect human health and the environment. We strongly recommend a ‘no’ vote on H.R. 1644.’’ I agree with the scientists on this one. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the Member for not opposing this amendment, and I ask that we vote ‘‘yes’’ on it. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . KILDEE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 114–395. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 5, line 3, before the period, insert ‘‘or improve drinking water quality’’. Page 8, line 16, before the period, insert ‘‘, unless such a rule will improve drinking water quality’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, first of all, the underlying bill is an attempt to delay the implementation of the stream protection rule, an important rule that protects our Nation’s rivers, our streams, and the nearby communities from the effects of mountaintop removal coal mining. My amendment would not allow any rule that improves drinking water quality to be delayed. Ensuring that we protect our streams and rivers—often important sources of drinking water— is of vital importance. Listen, I know firsthand something about what happens when regulations are not strong enough to protect drinking water. Today, in my hometown of Flint, safeguards for better drinking water could have prevented the entire city and upwards of 10,000 children under the age of 6 from being exposed to dangerous levels of lead. Lead is a deadly neurotoxin that is especially harmful to young children. It can permanently lower the IQ, increase disruptive behavior, and stunt neurological development. These children in my hometown, many of whom already have great hurdles to overcome because of the misfortune of the ZIP code into which they were born—communities of very high poverty—now must endure another blow to their futures due to the decisions that were outside of their control and the lack of effective protection of their drinking water. No other community should ever face that same danger, the danger of having their children literally poisoned by unsafe, contaminated drinking water. My amendment will ensure important protections for other communities. Look, I have seen my community live through this. They continue to live through it. We should be doing everything we can not to weaken protections for drinking water, but to strengthen them to prevent this from ever happening anywhere else. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. b1545 Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, my heart goes out to my friend and colleague from Flint, Michigan. I share in the difficulties that they are suffering now in that city because of the water supply. I know that his intention is to do everything he can—and I appreciate his work—to help the people of his district, especially when it comes to water supply. I appreciate that. I do have to point out that the issue that was raised there is not a mining issue. It is from other sources. It is pollution from pulp and paper mills, and it is not a mining issue. Getting back to this amendment, I do have to point out that already under the law, permitted mines must already adhere to safe drinking water standards and are very heavily regulated by the EPA. The problem with the OSM, Office of Surface Mining, is that they are taking over—it is bureaucratic mission creep—they are taking over some of the EPA functions. Among other good things that the STREAM Act does is it prevents OSM from going down that road, and it leaves clean water issues under the jurisdiction of the EPA. So we just need to make sure that the government agencies stick to what they know best. The STREAM Act does that. Water quality is really not an issue when it comes to nonmine issues. I would ask for opposition to this bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, let me first thank the gentleman for his kind words and his concern over my hometown. It is an extraordinarily difficult situation. Sadly, it is actually the creation of a series of decisions by our State government to switch from the freshest, cleanest water on the planet, the Great Lakes, to the Flint River in order to save a few dollars, and then the failure of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to enforce even the minor protections that it has available to it. The reason I am offering this amendment and the reason that I offer it on this particular piece of legislation is that, in my hometown, it was led and it was a bad set of decisions made by an emergency financial manager. In another community, it may be another source. My view—and the reason I offer this amendment—is that we ought to do everything within our power in this Congress to make sure that we protect our environment and particularly protect drinking water. I believe my amendment would do that. I urge my colleagues to support it. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KILDEE ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan will be postponed. AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 114–395. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of the bill, add the following: 
Title IV of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1231, et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chair, my amendment seeks to return abandoned mine lands funding to its originally intended focus, which is to support the communities that are struggling due to their legacy of mining. This funding, roughly $600 million over 10 years, will assist struggling coal communities in diversifying their economies, increasing human capital development, and stimulating economic growth. The funding for this investment in mining communities comes from States that have been certified by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement as having already reclaimed their abandoned mines. These States are, therefore, receiving money from a program dedicated to helping communities deal with the impact of mining, but the Federal Government has certified that they have already dealt with those impacts. In fact, one State took $10 million of this funding to renovate a basketball arena. Meanwhile, States in Appalachia are facing the combined calamity of a collapsing coal industry and the environmental legacy of over a century of mining. In Scranton, Pennsylvania, for example, that legacy includes 65 million gallons of acid mine runoff every day. Every day, there are 65 million gallons of acid mine runoff flowing into the river. Across northeastern Pennsylvania, there are thousands of miles of streams impacted by mine drainage, many of which are totally devoid of aquatic life. On top of these environmental impacts, the decreased demand for Appalachian coal has devastated communities and workers who have built their lives and built their families around the coal industry. This amendment is for them and to help rejuvenate these small communities across Appalachia and in other regions. Nearly all the biggest coal companies in the United States are teetering on the brink of collapse. Several have been removed from the New York Stock Exchange due to their valuations falling too low. Just yesterday, Arch Coal, one of the biggest coal companies in the country, filed for bankruptcy. For the families that depend on these jobs, these benefits, and these pensions, we have to act. We cannot be dispassionate bystanders as the rug is pulled out from under these communities. They deserve our support. Now, this amendment recognizes the fact that coal helped to build this country, coal spurred the industrial revolution and powered us through two world wars. The communities of Appalachia that proudly dug the coal that powered America through the 20th century have earned the support they need to diversify their local economies, and that is what this amendment works toward. The sponsors of the underlying bill, the STREAM Act, purport to be concerned about jobs in the Appalachian regions. If that is their concern, then they should also support my amendment, which will create jobs in the communities that need them most and continue to have to spend money on reclaiming abandoned mines. For that reason, I urge my colleagues—and especially those of you who represent mining areas, as I do—to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment to revitalize historic mining communities. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Cartwright amendment to the STREAM Act. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Montana is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chair, we in the coal producing States in the West do pay the majority of AML fees every year, a reminder that Montana and Wyoming have more coal than anyone else in the world. Yet, this language would rip away funding of the AML from our coalcertified States like Montana, but also the tribes. The great Crow Nation depends on these funds. How can you justify ripping and robbing certified States that pay the majority of the AML funds and tribes away? What does it do? It rips away money that is used for restoration and protects small communities. Montana has been in the business of mining for over 100 years. We have over 
6,700 known abandoned mines and mill sites across our State, and we have worked hard to reclaim many of these areas. Yet, removing the funds from those small communities poses a threat. Governor Bullock, a Democrat, has also expressed his deep concerns about ending these payments and asked all of the Montana delegation, which there are three of us, to help safeguard this valuable program for the good of all Montanans and the great Crow Nation. This amendment is disguised as a solution. It doesn’t offer a solution. The underlying idea of it is to kill the coal industry. We have seen time and time again excessive overreach, not based on scientific data, but based on an agenda; and the agenda is to kill coal. In Montana, we love coal. In Wyoming, our neighbor to the south, we understand that coal drives our economy. It helps fund our schools, our bridges, our roads, and our community. I stand by Montana and I stand by the great Crow Nation and urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. LUMMIS ). Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, this is absolutely illustrative of the old adage: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. If it stops moving, subsidize it. So here is the deal: This country started mining a lot of coal, so the Federal Government taxed it in 1977 through SMCRA, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. They put a big tax on coal by the ton, not the Btus, by the ton. Then the coal companies and the coal industry kept moving, and now they want to regulate it. In fact, this administration wants to regulate it out of existence and has said so. Rules are being proposed to regulate the coal industry out of existence. So that is the keep moving part. Well, they are being very successful at regulating the coal industry out of existence. Now, we are to step three. If it stops moving, subsidize it. That is what the amendment we are discussing would do. It is saying the coal industry is on its knees, not acknowledging that they are the ones that put it there. Then they are saying: So let’s take money for all of those coal jobs that are being lost due to their policies and let’s subsidize it. Let’s give them economic development money. Further, let’s give it to the administration in Washington to sprinkle about to whom they think it should go to, rather than letting the States that are producing this coal have a fraction of the money that is being produced from their States. This is the Federal Government’s mentality run amok. This is something that Ronald Reagan talked about when he said: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. If it stops moving, subsidize it. These people don’t want subsidies. They want their jobs. They want their communities. They don’t want subsidies from the Federal Government. That said, the omnibus bill that we just passed last month had $90 million for economic development in areas that are losing jobs due to coal policies. For crying out loud, we have lost our minds. I urge you to oppose the Cartwright amendment. Mr. ZINKE. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chair, with all due respect—and I do have ample respect for my colleague from Wyoming—I will say this: Taxing it is not the issue here. Regulating it is not the issue here. Subsidizing it is not the issue here. We are talking about money that has already been allocated. In fact, Wyoming itself is slated to get $53.8 million. The point here is that this is money that is going to States that are already certified as having properly finished their mine reclamation. The proposal of this amendment is to take that money—it is not new tax, it is not new regulation, it is not a new subsidy—it is just take that money and spread it out among the States that are still reclaiming their mines, including northeastern Pennsylvania and all of Pennsylvania. We are talking about taking it from the four States that have been certified by the Federal Government as having completed their mine reclamation and spreading it out among the States that have not done so completely at this point and continue to work on it. Further, this is money that is not being taken from the tribes. I am not sure where that idea came from. It is money that is given to the States, not the tribes. Therefore, it makes sense to send it to the communities where the mines are still causing trouble and are still being reclaimed. Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the Cartwright amendment to H.R. 1644. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania will be postponed. b1600 
AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MS . SEWELL OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 114–395. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 5, line 3, before the period insert ‘‘or cause or significantly contribute to the development of negative chronic or longterm health conditions’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 583, the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple and straightforward. Moreover, I do not believe it conflicts with the intent of this legislation. Alabama has a long and rich history of coal production that provides my constituents and Americans across the country with affordable and reliable energy as well as goodpaying jobs. As a representative of Alabama, I am a strong supporter of an allofthe above energy strategy. I support the development and use of renewable energy like wind and solar as well as the traditional sources of energy like coal. Coal is very important in my State. However, I also believe that it is Congress’ responsibility to ensure that energy is produced in a way that does not adversely impact the longterm safety or health of my constituents. That is why I have offered this amendment to H.R. 1644. This amendment makes an important addition to the exception clause in section 2 of the bill. It simply ensures that rules will not be delayed if such a delay would cause or significantly contribute to the development of a negative, chronic, or longterm health condition. We have an obligation as representatives of the people to ensure that regulations are not only sensible but also pragmatic. They must also not be threatened by the policies and regulations, those things that directly affect the public health. I believe all of my colleagues share this belief. I know that my Republican colleagues share my concern for public health. The legislation already includes an exception clause that says a rule cannot be delayed if it would pose an imminent and severe threat to human life. I strongly support this clause, but it is not enough to simply protect the public from imminent and severe health effects. Cancer and lung disease are illnesses that are chronic and often not developed except over years. We should also ensure that the public’s longterm health and wellbeing is protected. This is a commonsense amendment that will protect the public health. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for it. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, although this is a very wellintended amendment, the purpose of the section of the bill affected by this amendment is already to ensure that good science is used in the development of the rules by making the scientific products on which the rule is based publicly available for review and already provides for an emergency exemption if the delay in the publication of a rule during this public review will pose ‘‘an imminent and severe threat to human life.’’ An imminent and severe threat to human life, that is already addressed in the text of the bill. Mr. Chairman, I believe that this is unnecessary. We also have protection under the existing Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, SMCRA. It is to ‘‘establish a nationwide program to protect society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations.’’ The law and the proposed bill that is before us today already are designed to help protect human health and the environment. So although this is a well intended amendment, it is unnecessary, given this background. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, I think that the plain reading of the bill, the bill itself, talks about imminent and imminent threat. It doesn’t necessarily deal with longterm effect. My commonsense amendment would just make sure that any rules that actually affect public health that is chronic in nature and long term would also be covered with the exception. I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I am from a procoal State, but I also think it is really important to be propublic health. I ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Sewell amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Alabama will be postponed. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 114–395 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following order: Amendment No. 2 by Mr. KILDEE of Michigan. Amendment No. 3 by Mr. CARTWRIGHT  of Pennsylvania. Amendment No. 4 by Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote after the first vote in this series.

Ashford Duncan (SC) Kennedy Kind Palazzo Smith (WA) Westmoreland Williams ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR  
The Acting CHAIR (during the vote). There is 1 minute remaining. b1636 So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. SMITH of Nebraska) having assumed the chair, Mr. SIMPSON , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1644) to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to ensure transparency in the development of environmental regulations, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 583, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on the amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. KILDEE. I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Kildee moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1644 to the Committee on Natural Resources with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: Page 5, strike line 3 and insert ‘‘either an imminent or longterm threat to human life or increase the incidence or prevalence of lung cancer, heart or kidney disease, birth defects, or heavy metal contamination in communities in the vicinities of mountaintop removal coal mining projects.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, this final amendment to the bill will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended. The bill is yet another attempt to delay the issuance of new and updated regulations to protect our streams, our rivers, and our communities from mountaintop coal mining. These safeguards are important for protecting the health and safety of the drinking water in communities and of children living near mountaintop removal coal mining. Mr. Speaker, my motion would prevent the stream protection rule from being delayed if there is an increase in the incidence or prevalence of lung cancer, heart or kidney disease, birth defects, or heavy metal contamination in these communities. We cannot allow the underlying bill to further delay important protections of public health. I know, firsthand, what happens when protections are not strong enough to prevent heavy metals, mainly lead, from contaminating drinking water. I have seen thousands of kids in my hometown of Flint, Michigan, poisoned by leadcontaminated water. Let me repeat: Today, in the 21st century, thousands of children being poisoned by lead in their drinking water due to the lack of effective enforcement. For 14 months, in my hometown of Flint, children, citizens have been exposed to drinking water with very high levels of lead. These kids, especially, will face consequences. This is not a problem without victims. Children will face cognitive difficulties, developmental problems, behavioral issues, all because in Michigan our Governor appointed an emergency financial manager to take over the city of Flint, and without any concern for health or the welfare of the people who live there, simply to save a few dollars, switched the city of Flint, not by the city itself, but the State of Michigan switched the city of Flint from Lake Huron to the Flint River as its primary drinking water source. That highly corrosive river water led to lead leaching into the water system and, for 14 months, going into the bodies of people in my hometown, into children, all because of ineffective, lackluster enforcement of protections built into the law. b1645 These kids in my hometown have a right to expect that the water coming through the faucet is safe for them to drink, and the Department of Environmental Quality in Michigan was warned—warned—by the EPA, warned by a researcher from Virginia Tech who came to Flint to study the water, and warned by a local pediatrician who saw elevated lead levels in the children’s blood in Flint, Michigan. What was the State’s response? To try to discredit those claims that there were elevated lead levels, to actually— believe it or not—tell the people of the city of Flint that those researchers are wrong and they should just relax. That is what they were told. Relax. This is the 21st century. We ought to have in place adequate protections to 
make sure that drinking water is safe. What has been the response, even now in my own hometown in the State of Michigan? There have been some news conferences, but from July, when the State was first made aware of this, until today, the State has yet to step in to even supply bottled water, relying on the generosity of corporations, of labor unions, and of citizens, neighbors helping neighbors. Unfortunately, I think they see this more as a public relations problem than as a public health emergency. This is what happens when we don’t recognize the importance of regulation to protect public health. This is what happens when we weaken protections for drinking water for our environment and for our land. Is this really what we want to do? Or don’t we have an obligation to do everything in our power to protect the people back home, to protect children from this terrible, terrible kind of contamination? The steps that we are taking today that are on the floor of the House will simply be one more step to weaken those sorts of protections. My motion to recommit would correct that. Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to please join me. Protect our people, protect our land, and protect our kids. Join me in supporting this motion. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I urge us to reject this motion. It is only going to delay passage of this excellent piece of legislation. We just rejected a very similar amendment moments ago, and that was a substantive amendment. This is a procedural—not even a substantive—amendment. The bill does three great things, and that is why we need to pass the bill. It promotes transparency and scientific integrity. It requires an independent thirdparty review of the proposed OSM, Office of Surface Mining Bureau, rule. And it prevents OSM from regulatory overreach. So for those three important reasons, we should pass this bill. When it comes to health in particular, let me read a sentence from the text of the bill: ‘‘This subsection shall not apply if a delay in the publication of a rule will pose an imminent and severe threat to human life.’’ So we do already address health. It is covered in the bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge a rejection of the motion to recommit and the passage of H.R. 1644. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 5minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered; and the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 757. This is a 5minute vote. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—ayes 186, noes 237, not voting 10, as follows:
