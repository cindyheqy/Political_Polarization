Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize John Bartkowski who is retiring from the Sixteenth Street Community Health Cen-ters on March 31, 2017. He retires as CEO and President at the organization after serving for nearly 30 years. Mr. Bartkowski has spent much of his ca-reer at the Sixteenth Street Community Health Centers making an extraordinary impact on the lives of the people they serve through both innovation and growth. When John started at Sixteenth Street they had one storefront loca-tion and now have 5 sites. Over the decades he has led the organization as a tireless advo-cate and provider of quality care for commu-nity health concerns to make a real difference in the lives of the people they serve. 84 per-cent of the individuals they serve are Hispanic/ Latino, 19 percent are uninsured and 65 per-cent are at 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Level or under. There is a huge need for qual-ity bilingual services and Sixteenth Street Community Health Centers has met that need on all levels. While at the helm of Sixteenth Street Com-munity Health Centers some of John’s most notable achievements in addition to expansion include: the creation of an Environmental Health Department to address lead poisoning and asthma issues, formation of HIV/AIDS outreach which was later expanded to a De-partment, addition of Behavioral Health Serv-ices, Accreditation by the Joint Commission and initiation of the Annual Celebrity Roast to raise funds for the clinic. While he could have been satisfied with maintaining a focus solely on the clinic, John Bartkowski sought to better the entire community. He applied for funding and worked with partners to improve blighted areas like the Menomonee Valley and brought bike trails and new businesses to the area. John truly believes in the concept that a soci-ety becomes more vibrant and productive when it is inclusive and he has walked that talk. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to know and work with John Bartkowski for many years on a myriad of health issues. I join with friends and colleagues to congratulate him as he transitions into a different phase of his life. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor John Bartkowski. The citizens of the Fourth Con-gressional District and the State of Wisconsin are privileged to have someone of his ability and dedicated service working on their behalf for so many years. I thank him for all that he has done and I am indeed honored for these reasons to pay tribute to John Bartkowski. PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. GREG WALDEN 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 13, 2017 Mr. WALDEN.

ECONOMIC GROWTH IN JACKSON COUNTY, GA 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 13, 2017 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the economic growth that Jackson County has experienced over the past year. The investment of new companies in the Ninth District of Georgia has brought hundreds of new jobs to our community, and it is my hope that this growth will continue for years to come. For many years, companies have made their home alongside Interstate 85 in the mid-dle of Jackson County. The continued growth of e-commerce, in addition to the demand for expedited shipping by customers, has made it necessary for companies such as Amazon, Williams-Sonoma, and Whole Foods to ac-quire regional distribution centers. We are eager to welcome these companies, as well as many others, to northeast Georgia. In addition to the settlement of new compa-nies in Jackson County, there have been mul-tiple expansions that have been announced by already existing businesses and health cen-ters. The continued growth of these compa-nies shows that they have found a community in the Ninth District that is conducive to their businesses’ future. The number of companies that have de-cided to absorb industrial space in our district represents another notable step towards in-creased economic strength for our community. However, Jackson County is continuing to in-vest not only in the economic sector, but in the future of young men and women by cre-ating a college and career academy. In fall of 2017, the county will submit a proposal for this academy, which has the potential to attract new industries to northeast Georgia, as well as to educate the young men and women of our community. Mr. Speaker, I applaud this holistic approach to community growth on the part of Jackson County. HONORING THE 45TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE CAMILLUS ERIE CANAL PARK HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 13, 2017 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the 45th anniversary of the Camillus Erie Canal Park in my hometown of Camillus, New York. Established in 1972, the Camillus Erie Canal Park is part of the Erie Canalway Na-tional Heritage Corridor in Upstate New York. It is maintained and operated by an entirely volunteer group dedicated to preserving and restoring the historic Erie Canal in the Town of Camillus. The Camillus Erie Canal Park offers Central New Yorkers, tourists, and students from across New York State over 10 miles of his-toric walkways, boat rides along the Erie Canal, and museums showcasing the history of the canal. Critical to the preservation of this historic site, members of the Camillus Erie Canal So-ciety and many hardworking volunteers in our community worked to restore the 1842 Nine Mile Creek Aqueduct at the Camillus Erie Canal Park. This is the only restored navi-gable aqueduct in New York State and is list-ed on the National Registry of Historic Sites. The Erie Canal stretches from Albany to Buffalo and has played a pivotal role in the so-cioeconomic development of New York State and our country. This corridor, which is cele-brating its 200th anniversary this year, was re-cently designated a National Historical Land-mark. I am proud to recognize the 45th anniver-sary of the Camillus Erie Canal Park, as well as the Camillus Erie Canal Society for the in-credible work they do to preserve the cultural heritage of the Erie Canal in Central New York.
