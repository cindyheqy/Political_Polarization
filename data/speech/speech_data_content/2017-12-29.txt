Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 50th Anniversary of Belle Grove Plantation, a museum of an extraordinary historic house located near Middletown, in the part of the 10th Congressional District of Virginia that includes the northern Shenandoah Valley. The remarkable history of this home begins in 1732, with the settlement of the family of Jost Hite, one of 16 German immigrant families, on land they obtained in two land grants. Jost Hite’s grandson, Isaac Hite, Jr., served as Lieutenant with the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. In 1783, he married Nelly Conway Madison, sister of a future President of the United States, and received 483 acres from his father, on which they built the Belle Grove Manor House from limestone quarried on the property. Isaac Hite, Jr. was eventually commissioned as Major in the Frederick County Militia by Governor Patrick Henry in 1785. Major Hite was evidently a highly successful farmer and entrepreneur who expanded the grain and livestock plantation to 7,500 acres and also successfully operated a general store, a gristmill, a sawmill and a large distillery. However, it is also selfevident that, without the labors of the many slaves who lived on the plantation, Major Hite would not have had this success. Family records compiled by the staff of Belle Grove Plantation indicate that the Hite family owned 276 slaves who worked in a variety of capacities at Belle Grove between 1783 and 1851. Shortly before the Civil War, Belle Grove was sold to a person outside of the family and during the war, it was seldom without a military tenant and its grounds were hardly ever without an army. Belle Grove was most notably used as a headquarters by Union General Phillip Sheridan during the Civil War Valley Campaign of 1864 and it was centrally located during the pivotal Battle of Cedar Creek. After a successful surprise attack by Confederate General Jubal Early during the early morning hours of October 19, 1864, General Sheridan regained the territory later in the day, thus securing the strategically critical Shenandoah Valley for the Union and significantly boosting President Abraham Lincoln’s chances of being reelected. I am honored to represent a Congressional District with historical places such as Belle Grove Plantation that are essential to the telling of the story of our nation. Fifty years ago, on August 13, 1967, Belle Grove was dedicated as a museum and today, it is a National Historic Landmark, a Virginia Historic Landmark, and a historic property of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It is also the most significant structure in the Cedar Creek and Belle Grove National Historic Park, a partnership park comprised of private landowners, county governments and nonprofit organizations that was established by Congress under the leadership of my predecessor, Congressman Frank Wolf, and authorized by the National Park Service on December 19, 2002. Through the many interpretive programs it offers, Belle Grove Plantation serves the people of the Commonwealth and our nation as an educational center that helps Americans of all ages establish a stronger sense of our own identity through a better understanding of our past. The entire operation of the museum is funded by private contributions since it receives no government funding and is not a recipient of a regularly scheduled contribution from the National Trust. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and our colleagues to join me in thanking Belle Grove Plantation Executive Director Kristen Laise and her staff and volunteers, as well as the members of its Board of Directors, for their extraordinary purposefulness, ingenuity and resourcefulness in preserving Belle Grove Plantation as a special place to learn about the history, culture and economy of the northern Shenandoah Valley during the 18th and 19th Centuries. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say congratulations to the National Grange on 150 years of service to rural America, and to thank Susan Noah, President of the Oregon State Grange, and her husband, Mark, for their continued leadership in my home state. In Oregon, we understand how important it is to support our rural communities. The National Grange has been a steadfast partner in this effort. With over 167 Granges and 5,000 fraternal members in Oregon—and several thousand affiliate members—the National Grange is a strong advocate for rural communities in our great state of Oregon and across the country. The Grange has been essential in the development of rural America during three centuries: during the 19th Century, they advocated for legislative protection for farmers through the Granger Laws; in the 20th Century, they promoted research and education to improve agriculture through the Cooperative Extension Service and Land Grant Colleges while working to expand mail delivery and electricity to rural areas; and in the 21st Century, they have encouraged the expansion of broadband internet service. The Grange has provided a megaphone for the voice of rural communities throughout the country. The effort of this organization to bring people from across the country and across the political spectrum together in support of rural America is truly inspiring. Being a champion for rural America is an endeavor that transcends party lines and benefits all Americans, not just those living in rural communities. The Grange has led the effort in this, with an emphasis on service to the local community and volunteerism to improve the quality of life and economic wellbeing of rural America. On behalf of rural communities in Oregon and across the country, and the entire United States Congress, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the National Grange on 150 years of unwavering service to rural America. f 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize First Night Winchester which, for 31 years, has provided the residents of the Northern Shenandoah Valley a wonderful way to celebrate New Year’s Eve. In 1986, Winchester community leader Kathy Nerangis asked other leaders to join her in creating a familyfriendly, nonalcoholic event, where people could congregate to enjoy live performing arts and each other’s company, as an alternative way of welcoming in the New Year. First Night Winchester held its inaugural event on December 31, 1987 in Old Town Winchester, attracting 1,800 people. Since then, it has become a timehonored tradition for many individuals and families to make their way down to the center of town to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and good tidings of those who congregate for the special occasion. After three decades, those who, as children, enjoyed First Night Winchester with their families, are now bringing their own children to celebrate and the number of participants has, on occasion, reached 10,000. Throughout the day, rides are offered on the Shenandoah Valley Gas and Steam Engines, the Shenandoah Valley Civil War Museum is open for visits, face painting is offered at the Museum of the Shenandoah Valley and a live performance of ice sculpting is taking place on the Old Town Walking Mall for everyone’s enjoyment. Throughout the evening, the many downtown Winchester churches and the Handley Public Library house a diverse assortment of performers, including jugglers, gospel singers, comedians, classical pianists and neoclassical guitarists, magicians and blue grass and Delta blues musicians. The evening ends with the ushering in of the New Year as all gather to join in the countdown of the official ‘‘Apple Drop’’ and enjoy the spectacular fireworks that follow. Despite the enrichment to the quality of life that the more than 200 First Night events provided in the past, First Night Winchester is one of only 36 cities that continue this tradition, making it the 5th oldest in the nation. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask you to join our colleagues and me, in honoring and thanking the visionary leaders of First Night Winchester, whose steadfast commitment to improving the quality of life of their northern Shenandoah Valley community has resulted in three decades of one of the best First Night experiences in the nation and in wishing the wonderful board of directors, staff and volunteers of the event, many more years of success in the future. 
IN HONOR OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PERMANENT STRUCTURE FOR THE MASON AND PARTNERS HEALTH CARE CLINIC 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the awardwinning Mason and Partners (MAP) health care clinic and to congratulate George Mason University School of Nursing and its partners on the establishment of a permanent MAP Clinic in Manassas Park, Virginia. The clinic provides residents of medically underserved areas with a variety of health care services, including physicals, screenings, health care counseling and acute primary care treatment while, at the same time, offering George Mason University nursing students and those in related studies the invaluable practical experience of treating and counseling patients who utilize the clinic. George Mason launched its first MAP clinic in 2013, originally offering its services at the Manassas Park Community Center. Since then, the operation has expanded to three Northern Virginia sites while also broadening the services it provides. The clinic strives to serve as a bridge for patients with no access to healthcare until they are able to arrange for more formal healthcare coverage for themselves. The MAP clinic program has greatly benefitted a significant variety of George Mason students. By offering an active learning lab, nursing and health and human services students are able to receive reallife experience working on interprofessional teams, a learning opportunity that is not available to many students across the nation. These clinical opportunities have been so wellreceived that the federal government’s Health Resources Service Administration (HRSA) has made two awards totaling $2 million to support the education of George Mason University School of Nursing students in this way. Mr. Speaker, I take great pride in celebrating with you and our colleagues the establishment of the first permanent structure of the MAP clinic in Manassas Park, Virginia. In addition, I ask that you join me in congratulating the George Mason University School of Nursing and its partners, Dr. Allison Ansher of the Prince William Health District, the Parks and Recreation and Education Departments of the City of Manassas Park, the city’s Community Development Office and interim director Calvin O’Dell, the Potomac Health Foundation and the students and faculty of George Mason’s College of Health and Human Services, for the extraordinary success of this visionary, nurse led program and in wishing them all the best in their future collaborative endeavors. IN HONOR OF SHERANDO HIGH SCHOOL AND 25 YEARS OF EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate Frederick County’s Sherando High School, an excellent high school in the 10th Congressional District of Virginia, while the school community is celebrating its 25th Anniversary. The school slogan, ‘‘where one person can make a difference,’’ summarizes the caring, respectful culture that has been created at Sherando High School during those 25 years. Central to this special culture are the guiding words of the Mission for the staff, wherein they accept responsibility for providing ‘‘a safe and supportive environment that encourages intellectual, emotional, physical and social growth’’ and ‘‘a positive educational atmosphere which will encourage students to maximize their learning opportunities.’’ The Sherando community is proud of the fact that the entire community supports students with learning differences and that these students are encouraged to be an important part of the school and to benefit from the daily educational and social activities of the school. This caring attitude also extends to other students, including those struggling with severe depression. Hundreds of members of the Sherando community have participated in Out of the Darkness walks, raising funds for suicide prevention programs. Another important aspect of Sherando High School’s culture is summed up in the third sentence of the staff mission statement: ‘‘We will promote the active participation of parents and the community in the educational process.’’ This welcoming attitude of the school has provided the community the opportunity to cheer on Sherando students in a variety of pursuits, including dramatic productions, D.E.C.A and FFA activities, choir concerts, The Widget Cup, a design/build interscholastic competition that shows off the talents of Career and Technical Education students, and the marching band, which recently took first place in General Effect, Drum Major, and Color Guard disciplines at the CD Hylton High School Regional Marching Band Competition in Woodbridge, Virginia. The motto of the school, ‘‘Once a warrior, always a warrior’’ certainly rings true in the area of athletics, where community residents and alumni get caught up with Sherando football and other athletics, and even travel long distances to see their athletes compete at regionals and at state championships. And at the very event that took place on October 7, 2017, several athletes from the past were recognized as the first inductees into the Sherando Athletic Hall of Fame. Congratulations to Tyler Gaines, Kelley Washington, Emily BudnykPutt, Robyn RitterBrowne, Zach Franz, Pepper Martin, and Jason Barbe for this special recognition. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me and our colleagues in congratulating Principal John Nelson, his dedicated faculty and staff and the entire Sherando High School community, on 25 years of extraordinary success and in wishing them a continuation of this success in the years to come. HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN VIRGINIA’S 10TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the following law enforcement personnel who have recently been honored by the 12th Annual Law Enforcement Appreciation Dinner that took place in Clarke County, for their invaluable service and commitment to our communities. Therefore I include in the RECORD the following excerpts from a speech delivered by Mr. Jim Wink, the founder of the Horseshoe Curve Benevolent Association, which sponsored the dinner. 
OFFICER BENJAMIN MACE  Officer Mace was selected to be recognized for his exceptional performance of duty last February. Officer Mace observed an inmate not acting in a normal fashion and after further observation he noticed the inmate had a bedsheet tied around his neck and an additional knot and loop tied around his feet in order to pull the device tighter. After notifying Officer Keister of the situation, officer Mace entered the inmate’s cell and used his 911 knife to cut the sheet from the inmate’s neck. Officer Mace’s response to this critical situation was highly professional and reflects great credit upon them, the Regional Detention Center and our profession. Officer Mace, congratulations and thank you for being there for us. 
OFFICER JOSEPH SHOREMOUNT  Officer Shoremount has been a member of the Berryville Police Department since 2015 and has quickly become a familiar face with many members of the community, especially the downtown business owners. Joe makes it a point to take the time to contact the community in a meaningful way, and has even been known to keep a football in his trunk for an occasional pickup game of football in Rose Hill Park. Joe has been instrumental in orchestrating several community engagement events to include national night out activities, wellness and safety fairs at the Mary Hardesty House, and holiday toy collections for underserved children in the area. For Joe, being a police officer in a small town involves much more than taking reports and writing tickets. He strives to look for ways to be proactive in dealing with community concerns while representing the department in a professional and empathetic manner. Officer Shoremount, congratulations and thank you for being there for us. 
CLARKE COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE  The Clarke County Sheriffs Office has nominated several employees that support their officers and security efforts. The first is Mr. Robert Wilkerson. Robert is a communications specialist. He has been employed at this office since 2001. During his tenure, he has been called on numerous occasions to fill in, work over his assigned shifts, and report for work on short notice. Bob has demonstrated the ability to work under extreme stress. His professionalism is appreciated by all. He mentors less experienced staff and is always approachable. We truly appreciate Bob for his numerous accomplishments and his loyalty. Mr. Wilkerson, thank you for your outstanding support to those who protect us. 
The next two outstanding workers who support the Clarke County Sheriffs Office are Beth Marple and Jim Pearce. They are the victim witness coordinators for Clarke County and the City of Winchester. Beth is an inspiration for all of those in public safety. She works tirelessly for many hours and always has a great attitude. As a victim’s advocate, she has no equal. Jim Pearce is a shining example of humility and a man with a big heart. In addition to his work with victims of crimes, Jim accepts all related challenges. As president of the local fop and crime solvers, he helps law enforcement in countless ways. Beth and Jim, thank you for being there when the sheriff and the people need you. The next awards are somewhat unusual, so I am turning their presentation over to Clarke County Sheriff Tony Roper. Sheriff Roper: On July 12, 2017, Deputy Jacob Kennedy responded to a report of an armed larceny of an automobile. Deputy Kennedy located the vehicle and attempted to affect a traffic stop. The suspect exited the vehicle and ran into an adjacent wooded area. Local law enforcement from several jurisdictions, with the help of K–9’ s and a helicopter, conducted a search of the area but were not able to find the suspect. However, Wayne Warfield Jr., Brian Morgan, and Shannon Dulaney did. They located the suspect in a field adjacent to their residence. The quick and brave response from these three, detaining the suspect and relaying this information to emergency communications personnel, made the arrest of this suspect possible. For their actions of courage and selflessness, we recognize Wayne Warfield Jr., Brian Morgan, and Shannon Dulaney for their extraordinary concern for the safety and security of the citizens of Clarke County. Thank you very much for being there. 
DEPUTY TRAVIS W . ADAMSON  On May 13, 2017, Deputy Garrison and Adamson dispatched to a call in Stephens City where an infant wasn’t breathing. Deputy Garrison, being the first unit to arrive and found an infant female baby, 4 days old, unconscious and not breathing. Deputy Garrison jumped into action and started CPR on the baby. Deputy Adamson arrived shortly after and assisted Deputy Garrison in performing CPR. This CPR was continued until fire and rescue units arrived. The baby, whose name is Georgina, had a faint pulse when transported to the E.R. She was later transferred to the NICU and then onto UVA at Charlottesville. Had it not been for the quick action of these deputies, it is likely the outcome would have been completely different. The sheriffs department made contact with the mother of this child and she confirmed that little Georgina was doing well. Deputy Garrison and deputy Adamson, congratulations and thank you for being there when needed. 
WINCHESTER CITY SHERIFF ’S OFFICE  The staff of the Sheriff’s office made the choice of who should be recognized. The deputy they chose has been in law enforcement for 2 decades and has been a patrol deputy, investigator and narcotics agent. For almost 4 years now, he has been a valued asset of the Winchester city sheriff’s office and the citizens of Winchester. He has spearheaded this organization in becoming one of the most professional sheriff’s offices in the United States. He has set them apart and above others by implementing cost saving measures, kept a balanced and frugal budget, updated equipment with no or little cost, provided the department with a complete set of general orders, initiated emergency response protocols for the Joint Judicial Center, set guidelines for safer handling of prisoners, began a Naloxone program, implemented an inhouse training program thus reducing time and cost spent by deputies on the road, conducted active shooter trainings for courthouse staff, designed the office’s first website, placed the department on social media, implemented several community relations programs such as reading for children and cops and robbers, coauthored 2 books for children, began a sheriff’s office foundation, implemented mandatory cit/cpr and first aid training for all deputies, started the sheriff’s office’s first srt team, upgraded the joint judicial center’s security, obtained an explosive k9 for no cost, and made the Winchester city sheriff’s office Virginia’s 96th law enforcement office to achieve accreditation from the Virginia Law Enforcement Professional Standards Committion. This deputy is the first one in the office and the last one to leave. He is not just a deputy, he is a leader, he is out friend, and he is our sheriff—Sheriff Les R. Taylor. Sheriff Taylor, congratulations and thank you for all that you have done and are planning on doing for us. NORTHWEST VIRGINIA REGIONAL DRUG AND  
PRICE  Special Agent Price has been a strong team player and has established himself as a natural leader within the task force. In the last 12 months, he has been the case agent for investigations that have led to some very notable and outstanding seizures. As a result of his diligence and hard work, SA Price seized over 300 grams of cocaine, over 100 grams of crack cocaine, over 5700 doses of MDMA, over 2300 grams of marijuana and over 10,000 grams of synthetic marijuana. The approximate street value of all the narcotics seized is greater than $300,000. He was also able to seize over $50,000 in US currency and two vehicles that were the proceeds of illegal narcotics sales. SA Price obtained and executed 17 search warrants within the last year. While extremely busy with his own investigations, SA Price has continuously made himself available to assist all team members with their own investigations. He truly understands the concept of being a ‘‘team player’’. SA Price also served as a field training agent to two newly promoted special agents assigned to the task force. He has volunteered his own personal time to be an active particiant with Operation Prevention to educate local students on the dangers of illegal narcotics and to prevent the addictions that are plaguing our nation. The task force commends Special Agent Josh Price for his excellent work ethic, pride in his community and his continuous efforts to make it a safer and better place for all our citizens. Special Agent Joshua T. Price, congratulations and thank you for being there for us. 
TROOPER BRIAN G . DAVIS  Trooper Davis serves and protects the counties of Clarke, Frederick, and Warren by enforcing all traffic and criminal laws and exemplifying outstanding service and dedication to the community in which he resides. Trooper Davis endures countless hours serving the department as a trooper, crime prevention specialist, accident reconstructionist, field training officer, as well as, driving under the influence (dui) detection basic instructor. He also served as a mentor for the 125th State Police Trooper Basic Session from August, 2016 through March, 2017. There he assisted the State Police Academy staff with the coordination of training for 65 new troopers. He did this on a voluntary basis and did so without any complaints during the 26 weeks away from home. Trooper Davis’s investigative skills are outstanding, and he provides invaluable guidance and instruction to fellow troopers within the area. Furthermore, his knowledge of the laws of Virginia enhances his ability to effectively communicate with the community. Trooper Davis is a true asset to the department, as well as the area. Thank you, Trooper Brian G. Davis, for your outstanding service and for always being there when needed. The Virginia State Police also wants to honor Master Trooper Jerry P. Bosserman of the criminal justice information services division, sex offender investigative unit. Trooper Bosserman serves as the sole state police trooper assigned to this unit for the city of Winchester and the counties of Clarke, Frederick, and Warren. He oversees the compliance of Virginia sex offender registry laws through daily contact with offenders to assure they are properly registered. In addition, he assures they are in compliance with laws dictating where the offenders live, work, vehicle registration information, as well as their use of the internet. He also provides educational programs to assist sex offenders semiannually. This ensures awareness of new law changes and their duties and responsibilities to remain in compliance. As a result, he has established the lowest recidivism rate in the Commonwealth of Virginia. When an offender has not followed the laws, Trooper Bosserman pursues their cases through the identification and expeditious pursuit of all leads, collection and preservation of evidence, and the arrest of violators. Thereafter, he presents the case to the court providing the evidence and testimony in accordance with his training, laws, policies, and procedures as it relates to the State Police Sex Offender Registry. Trooper Bosserman graduated from the Va. State Police Basic Academy in July, 1978. His initial duty assignment was to the Winchester area and he has served this community for over 40 years. His investigative skills are outstanding, and he provides invaluable guidance and instruction to fellow troopers and cooperating agencies across the commonwealth. Furthermore, his knowledge of the laws of Virginia enhances his ability to effectively communicate with the community. The Virginia State Police strongly believe that Trooper Bosserman is a true asset to the department, as well as, to the sex offender investigative unit. Last but not least, three years ago we recognized and presented a plaque and goodies to a very famous Virginia State Police dog named Kota. He almost lost his life that year chasing a criminal. Sadly, Kota passed on just recently. He obviously will be missed. Thank you, Kota, for your service. That, ladies and gentlemen, highlights how lucky we citizens of Northern Virginia are, given the outstanding people we have protecting us. When we started putting together tonight’s program, we were extremely pleased at the local response. If this program was open to the public, I don’t think there is a facility in the area that could hold all those citizens that would want to thank you for what you do for us. Thank you and your families for all that you do. 
IN HONOR OF THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF BENJAMIN BANNEKER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Benjamin Banneker Elementary School, as it celebrates 70 years of excellence in the 10th Congressional District of Virginia. Located in the Village of St. Louis in Loudoun County, the parents, teachers and students of Benjamin Banneker School and its predecessor, St. Louis School, have survived the awful conditions of segregation and the political gamesmanship over desegregation, to become a wonderful place of learning for a multi racial student population in 2017. The village of St. Louis was established in 1881, when landowner Thomas Glascock sold oneacre lots to formerly enslaved families. Earlier, in 1877, a oneroom school had been established to attempt to serve the educational needs of the children of St. Louis and surrounding areas. However, the St. Louis School and other schools for black students of this era were overcrowded, mediocre facilities, usually with only a wood stove for heat and an outhouse. In 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Plessy vs. Ferguson mandated that segregated public schools in Loudoun County and elsewhere in the nation operate under the doctrine of ‘‘Separate but Equal.’’ While AfricanAmericans advocated for equal pay for teachers and equal facilities for students, conditions remained unequal, with upwards of 50 students being placed in some oneroom schoolhouses. By 1930, a national movement for ‘‘equalization’’ had been established by the NAACP and the parents of AfricanAmerican students in Loudoun County began a protest movement known as the CountyWide League. After many years of advocacy for improved conditions, on March 31, 1948, the Parent and Teacher Association of St. Louis was able to convince the county school board to purchase 19 acres in the village and build the sixroom Benjamin Banneker School, bringing together black students from several area schools whose buildings had badly deteriorated. While there were improvements in conditions at allblack consolidated schools such as Benjamin Banneker, the NAACP, represented by future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, argued that such physical improvements did not equalize the learning experience of blacks and whites, and that, in fact, the ‘‘separate but equal’’ doctrine was inherently unequal. Although, in 1954, the Supreme Court agreed with the NAACP in the landmark decision of Brown vs. Board of Education, parts of the Commonwealth of Virginia defied the judicial mandate until 1967, when Loudoun schools were finally integrated. In 1968, and as an aspect of the integration process, the Loudoun School Board attempted to change the name of the school to Mercer Elementary. However, the pride of the St. Louis community once again prevailed, as the community was able to convince the school board to reverse itself and keep the Benjamin Banneker name, whose namesake had been such an inspiration for the students and teachers of the school. Born a free man, Banneker was a selfeducated natural philosopher, mathematician and astronomer, who helped to survey the new capital city, the District of Columbia, and challenged future president Thomas Jefferson on the issue of slavery, asserting that it totally contradicted the religious and political principles of our nation as they were laid out in the Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights. Mr. Speaker, I recently had the pleasure of visiting Benjamin Banneker Elementary School and meeting three of the school’s alumni, Mary and Eugene Howard and Ann Bland, who were students during the years of segregation. I then had the privilege of joining them and the school principal, Robert Carter, and the school’s fifth graders, in dedicating a beautiful plaque that they initiated, to memorialize the school’s important history. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and our colleagues to join me in honoring the determination of those who worked to ensure a quality education for the students of Benjamin Banneker School during those difficult years of segregation and in celebrating the outstanding teachers, administrators and community leaders who, seventy years from its founding, are continuing the tradition of providing an excellent education to the students of the school. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST. PAUL AME CHURCH 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate the St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church of Winchester, Virginia, on the celebration of its 150th anniversary. In 1867, only two years after the end of slavery, a small group of devout Christians in Winchester met in the home of Jacob Randolph and Mary Catherine Martin to begin organizing one of the first 50 chartered AME churches in the nation. The initial concept of the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church grew out of the Free African Society that was established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1787. In response to ‘‘unkind treatment’’ and discriminatory practices at St. George’s Methodist Church in Philadelphia, Richard Allen, Absalom Jones and other African Americans withdrew from the church to eventually form the national AME Church in 1816, providing people of African descent, who have the same potential and worth as anyone else, the selfrespect, dignity and freedom to worship God that they deserved. The history of St. Paul AME church is the story of a closeknit AfricanAmerican congregation of Christian disciples located within the Fort Loudoun community of Winchester. Because of its close ties with black and white families in the community, the church has been a spiritual center of the society, regularly ringing its massive 650 pound bell on important days of the Christian calendar and important occurrences, such as weddings and funerals, for the St. Paul congregation, itself. In fact, St. Paul was the first church in Winchester to recognize the end of World War I with the ringing of its bell on Armistice Day. Despite hardships brought on by the impacts of slavery that had recently ended, and the destructive impacts of segregation that continued for decades into the 20th Century, St. Paul AME Church has been an important force for good and for justice in the Winchester community. As leaders in the civil rights movement, the congregation hosted the Pastor’s Alliance of Winchester as it began the first Winchester chapter of the NAACP in 1915. In collaboration with other churches, the St. Paul congregation has consistently done good works in the northern Shenandoah Valley, such as supporting the ‘‘Showers for Souls’’ program for the homeless at Mt. Carmel Baptist Church and with its emphasis on education, the church has a long tradition of supporting the Freemont Street Nursery and giving scholarships to high school seniors as they embark on higher education and providing financial and spiritual support for these scholars throughout their years in college. In 2004, a remarkable thing happened in the history of the church. A significant leap of faith, similar to the one that started the church, was taken by the church’s pastor, Rev. Kevin Wilson, and the leadership of the congregation. After more than a century of use, the church building was in significant need of repairs. Overcoming their own pride, the congregation let the surrounding community know about their predicament and was surprised by the amazingly generous response of the residents of the northern Shenandoah Valley, both black and white. Through the raising of significant funds, the generous volunteering of time and effort and the excellent leadership of contractor Shockey and Sons, in collaboration with members of the congregation, such as Mr. Bill Buckner, a beautifully renovated church, that is a historic landmark of the City of Winchester, was reopened in 2005. Over the years, the abundant goodwill that had been created by acts of faith and love of hundreds of Christian disciples at St. Paul AME Church, resulted in an incredible outpouring of love and generosity in return. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and our colleagues to join me in congratulating Reverend Kevin Wilson and the congregation of St. Paul AME Church, and all those pastors and lay members who preceded them, for being the strong, loving body of Christ that God intended them to be. As the next 150 years unfold, may the bell of St. Paul AME Church toll again over the community that it has served so faithfully. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOP OF VIRGINIA REGIONAL CHAMBER 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Top of Virginia Regional Chamber on the occasion of its 100th Anniversary and to highlight the extraordinary impact that it has had on the people of the northern Shenandoah Valley. Although it has undergone at least five name changes in the last century—starting out as the Winchester Board of Trade and, since 2006, as the Top of Virginia Regional Chamber—it has always remained true to its stated purpose of promoting the general welfare and prosperity of the northern Shenandoah Valley. 
During the past century, the chamber his improved the quality of life of the people of Winchester, Frederick County and Clarke County in many important ways. In the late 1930s, it advocated for the construction of the Winchester Municipal Airport and for the completion of Route 50 from Winchester to the Shenandoah River. During 1950s, it was deeply involved in the establishment of Shenandoah University in Winchester, and in 1993, the chamber advocated for the construction of Route 37 around Winchester and even initiated a grassroots movement in 2004, to gain support for completing the road. In addition, the encouragement and support of its members has always been a priority of the Top of Virginia Regional Chamber and among the services and programs offered to its 835 current corporate members are quarterly educational seminars through Lord Fairfax Community College’s Small Business Development Center, frequent Business and Breakfast and Business After Hours opportunities, various educational lunches and the activities of the Young Professionals Group. Recently, several innovative chamber initiatives have added significantly to strengthening the social fabric of the northern valley. The Community Leadership Program is a rigorous, ninemonth program that develops leaders by teaching important leadership skills and an understanding of complex community problems and their potential solutions. The Valley Business Women program helps women achieve their own personal and professional transformation. The chamber’s Workforce Development Committee has partnered with local businesses and public schools to help develop the region’s workforce of the future. And since 2010, with the creation of its Public Policy Committee, the chamber has become an important venue for discussions about public policy matters, including education, transportation, workforce development, regional economic development, health care, and legislation at the local, state and federal levels. Its yearly breakfast meetings with state legislators, prior to and after each General Assembly session, as well as periodic reports from the member of Congress representing the northern Valley, have been excellent opportunities for an exchange of ideas. Mr. Speaker, I don’t know of a single organization in the northern Shenandoah Valley that has done more to unify the community than does the Top of Virginia Regional Chamber, by highlighting extraordinary work that is being done by valley residents. Each year, the Greater Good Awards dinner recognizes some of these amazingly generous individuals and the Valor Awards dinner allows the community to recognize and thank our Valley heroes for their special acts of valor and selflessness. Because the Commonwealth of Virginia has a general election each November, the chamber’s Hob Nob event is often the only opportunity for chamber members and the public to hear directly from a wide variety of candidates running for office. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I ask you and our colleagues to join me in congratulating the Top of Virginia Regional Chamber for 100 years of successfully promoting the general welfare and prosperity of the people of the Northern Shenandoah Valley and to express gratitude to President and CEO Richard Kennedy, the chamber’s board of directors and its great staff, as well as all those chamber CEOs, board members and staff who preceded them, for their hard work in serving the chamber’s membership and in being such a powerful source of unity and enlightenment for the larger valley community. 
IN HONOR OF PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY RED CROSS ON ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF SERVICE 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Prince William County Red Cross as it celebrates 100 years of service to the people of Prince William County, the City of Manassas and the City of Manassas Park. This milestone of a very special organization in Northern Virginia gives me an opportunity to celebrate the International Red Cross and Red Crescent, as well as the Prince William Chapter’s national organization, the American Red Cross, founded by Clara Barton on May 21, 1881. The American Red Cross received its first Congressional Charter in 1900 and to this day it has been tasked by the federal government with providing services to members of the U.S. Armed Forces and their families as well as providing disaster relief in the United States and around the world. Inspired by the motto ‘‘Sleaves Up. Hearts Open. All In’’, the American Red Cross goes wherever it is needed, from small house fires to multistate natural disasters, guided by a policy of total impartiality as to the community or individuals to be served, so that all people can have clean water, safe shelter and hot meals—and many times, a shoulder to cry on—when this care is needed the most. The American Red Cross is the nation’s largest blood collection organization, supplying 40 percent of the blood we use. Over the last century, the Prince William Chapter of the American Red Cross has served the people of this region with essential blood services, partnering with local community and faith based organizations to obtain lifesaving blood donations. Literally 90 percent of the disasters the Red Cross responds to are home fires and to effectively respond to them in their community, the Prince William Chapter has maintained an oncall volunteer Disaster Action team to support the first responders as well as residents who are displaced. The American Red Cross empowers people at the community level, providing emergency and health and safety training and certification classes to provide fellow Americans with the knowledge and skills they need for effective leadership in the event of an emergency. Over the long history of the Prince William chapter, it has offered First Aid/CPR/AED or Automated External Defibrillator training classes, as well as Babysitting and Childcare and Aquatics courses throughout the community. By authority of Congress, the American Red Cross has provided essential support to the members of our Armed Forces and their families and the Prince William chapter of the Red Cross has worked with military families and active duty members to help prepare them for deployments, provide care and nurturing to wounded warriors in area military hospitals, and Reconnection Workshops for military families to help them reestablish themselves as a family unit after returning from service. Mr. Speaker, because 90 percent of Red Cross workers are volunteers, I ask you and our colleagues to join me in expressing deep gratitude for the selfless and courageous sacrifice of the volunteers of the American Red Cross, who have done so much to prevent and relieve the suffering of others, and to congratulate the wonderful volunteers and employees of the Prince William Chapter, as they celebrate the 100th Anniversary of their extraordinary service to their community.
