Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate Karen McGinnis on her retirement. For the past 20 years, Karen has served as the director for what is known as the Hazardous Materials Management and Emergency Response Federal Training Center, or HAMMER, which is in my district at the Hanford Site in Richland. I have personally visited and can truly say HAMMER is a oneofakind facility. I have witnessed the handson training they provide to Federal employees, like Hanford workers and emergency responders who are deployed throughout our Nation. The services they provide to the TriCities community and the country are essential. Karen has worked to strengthen HAMMER’s partnerships with Federal and State agencies, Tribes, safety professionals, and community leaders. She focuses on worker health and preparedness, and she has a passion for employee safety. Her leadership has made HAMMER one of the premier training centers in the world. As director, Karen has facilitated the training that makes it possible for the Federal Government to fulfill its obligation to clean up the Hanford Site. I thank Karen for her dedication to HAMMER, and I wish her the best in her retirement. f 
AMERICA’S FAITH IN CONGRESS (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the American people have little faith in Congress. They don’t trust Members to work together in a bipartisan way, to put public interest above selfinterest, and to do their most basic job, which is to set a budget and be fiscally responsible. Our Nation is strongest when our democratic institutions generate confidence, not cynicism, and when our leaders inspire pride, not pessimism. That is why Congressman FITZPATRICK  and I introduced the FAITH in Congress Act. It requires House leaders to prioritize bipartisan bills over partisan ones, because we must put country over party. It abolishes automatic pay increases for Members of Congress, and it prohibits firstclass travel at taxpayer expense, because it is time we end these perks. It enacts a simple principle called no budget, no pay, which says that if Congress doesn’t pass a budget and appropriations bills on time, Members don’t get paid, because the best way to stop incompetence is to stop rewarding it. 
Finally, it imposes a lifetime ban on former Members becoming lobbyists, because there should be no doubt that Members come to Congress to serve the public, not to line their own pockets. It is up to Congress to take the tough but necessary steps to earn the public’s trust. The American people’s faith in Congress has been damaged, and it is our job to repair it. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ERNIE SIMONS (Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. Ernie Simons, a longtime Georgia resident, a brave hero of the Vietnam war, and a dedicated public servant who has worked tirelessly on behalf of the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces. Having first served as a marine in Vietnam, Mr. Simons continued to serve as an employee of the Georgia Department of Veterans Service. During his 30 years there, he worked in a number of capacities, including as the director of the Georgia Veterans Memorial Cemetery and director of the Health and Memorials division of the Georgia Department of Veterans Service. In April, the community renamed Veterans Drive, a road adjacent to the veterans home where Mr. Simons dedicated so many years, as Ernie Simons Veterans Way. There is perhaps no better tribute for a man who has given countless hours and his undivided attention to our local heroes than to have this road named in his honor. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please stand with me to honor the life and legacy of this Georgia hero, greatly deserving the respect of all Americans. 
75TH ANNIVERSARY OF WOMEN AIRFORCE SERVICE PILOTS (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a very special group who will celebrate their 75th anniversary this Saturday in Sweetwater, Texas: the Women Airforce Service Pilots. When the forces of fascism and totalitarianism were upending the entire global order, it took every ounce of our Nation’s measure and every man and woman to win World War II. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, 28 female pilots volunteered to form America’s first female squadron. From 1942 to 1944, over 1,000 women trained to fly ‘‘the Army way’’ at Avenger Airfield in west Texas. As the first women to fly American military aircraft, they logged more than 60 million flight hours, flying every plane in the military’s arsenal. They ferried equipment, towed gunnery targets, and flighttested aircraft, serving at over 120 bases across America so we could win the war abroad. These brave ladies were vital to the war effort and, ultimately, to our victory. Seventyfive years later, their legacy continues to inspire us all. God bless these female freedom fighters who served with less recognition than their male counterparts at the time, but with no less honor and distinction. God bless America, and go west Texas. f 
DEMOCRACY REFORM (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, President Trump promised to drain the swamp. In reality, he has made corruption much worse here in Washington. Yesterday, we learned that a foreign government paid the President’s personal attorney $400,000 for a meeting with President Trump; the Secretary of the Treasury requested a government plane for his honeymoon; the VA Secretary took a $125,000 taxpayerfunded trip to Europe with his spouse; and the Republicans who control Congress have done nothing about it. They are putting politics ahead of our country by turning a blind eye to this administration’s corruption, and they are focusing on getting things done for their wealthy donors instead of their constituents. The culture of corruption must end. That is why, early this week, Democrats introduced A Better Deal for our democracy: a bold, comprehensive proposal to bolster our Nation’s ethics laws, overhaul our campaign finance system, and create more transparency and accountability so government works for all of the American people. That is the Better Deal the American people deserve; that is the Better Deal Democrats will deliver; and that is why Democrats are fighting for it. 
RECOGNIZING OFFICER MARK DALLAS (Mr. KINZINGER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent, Dixon Police Officer Mark Dallas, for his heroic actions during the shooting incident at Dixon High School last week. On the morning of Wednesday, May 16, a student opened fire inside Dixon High School. Without hesitation, Officer Dallas chased down the student and returned fire. He disarmed the shooter and took him into custody. The swift, decisive actions by Officer Dallas demonstrate the difference between a job and one’s calling. His fearless sacrifices are core to who Mark is and who God called him to be. As more details emerge surrounding the shooting incident, one thing is certain: Officer Dallas is an American hero. He stepped into harm’s way to prevent a terrible tragedy and saved countless lives. He heroically protected the students, including his own son Josh, the faculty and staff, and the entire Dixon community. Mr. Speaker, it is the men and women of our law enforcement, like Officer Dallas, who embody the very best of who we are as a nation. The courageous service of America’s finest is truly the thin blue line between order and chaos. On behalf of the 16th District of Illinois, I thank Officer Mark Dallas for his bravery and heroism, for his steadfast commitment to protection and serving, for being a role model to so many, and for making us all Dixon strong. f 
STOP HIDING THE TRUTH (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, while Democrats continue to focus on better jobs, better wages, and a better future for hardworking Americans, Republican indifference to the chaos, crisis, and corruption in this town, for example, at the EPA, is at an alltime high. Why in the world, in the context of the fact that we have 17 different intelligence agencies who concluded that Russia interfered with the election and an ongoing investigation into whether the Trump campaign was involved in selling out our democracy, do some folks continue to try to undermine this investigation? The ongoing criminal inquiry is a legitimate undertaking. It is not a witch hunt. In fact, everyone leading that investigation is a Republican: Bob Mueller, Republican; Rod Rosenstein, Republican; James Comey, Republican; Christopher Wray, Republican. What exactly are you all complaining about? It is time for the coverup caucus in this institution to stop hiding the truth from the American people. 
NATIONAL POPPY DAY (Mr. BOST asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, on May 25, we celebrate National Poppy Day. After World War I, the poppy flourished in Europe. Scientists said the growth was because the soil in France and Belgium became enriched with lime from the rubble left by the war. From the dirt and mud grew beautiful red poppies. The red poppy came to symbolize the blood shared during battle following the publication of a wartime poem, ‘‘In Flanders Fields,’’ by Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae while serving on the front lines. The poppy honors those who served and died for our country in all wars and 
reminds the American people of the sacrifices made by our veterans while protecting our freedom. To those who gave the ultimate sacrifice, we say thank you.

AMENDMENT NO . 109 OFFERED BY MRS . DEMINGS  
OF FLORIDA  At the end of subtitle A of title XII, add the following new section: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 908, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ). Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this legislation and especially this part of the bill, which includes a provision that declares Dr. Afridi an international hero. For those who don’t remember Dr. Afridi, who now languishes in a Pakistani prison, this was the brave soul who helped us identify Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the slaughter of 3,000 Americans on 9/11. Pakistan arrested him on trumped up charges, and he now lingers in a dungeon, ignored by us, ignored by the world. This is an international hero. This is a man with courage. It is a disgrace that our country still has relations, when Pakistan rubs this in our face. I would hope that this Congress—and, Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for putting this in the bill that we are declaring to the world Dr. Afridi must be freed, and he is a hero, an international hero to all of humankind. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR ). Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member Mr. SMITH, and I rise in support of this legislation, and in particular, in support of amendment No. 202 offered by myself and Mr. CASTROand Mr. D OGGETT . This amendment requires the Air Force to conduct a core sampling study at Lackland Air Force Base to determine potential hazardous substances along the route of a wastewater pipeline replacement project. Project negotiations are being held up because the proposed route transects two very old landfills whose contents are unknown. Soil sampling to identify potential contaminants along the construction site will allow this project to move forward. Replacing this crumbling pipeline is critical to avoid continual wastewater spills, which impact the environmental health and wellbeing of both the military base and the residents of San Antonio. I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, the legislation, this en bloc amendment to bring wastewater services to over 500,000 residents in San Antonio, a rapidly growing southwest community. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ). Mr. CORREA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment 96 that is included in the en bloc amendment. My amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to study how the Department of Defense can attract and recruit students from higher education institutions with backgrounds in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cybersecurity. To make sure we draw from the best and brightest of our country, this study would consist of students from all higher education institutions, including but not limited to Hispanic serving institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander serving institutions. World war III is currently taking place in cyberspace, and that is why it is important that we find our young men and women, the best and brightest we have, to fight this battle. Additionally, with China racing to dominate the artificial intelligence space, we must find suitable individuals to keep up with China’s artificial intelligence advancements and massive investments in this area. My amendment would ensure that our Nation has the information it needs to recruit our brightest and best. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I would inquire of the gentleman if he as any more speakers. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I don’t have any more speakers. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ). Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to ensure that Purple Heart and Medal of Honor recipients, veterans with serviceconnected disabilities, and former prisoners of war have access to military exchanges, commissaries, and morale, welfare, and recreation facilities. We should all agree that these heroes of our Armed Forces have done more than enough to earn this access. It is our duty as a Nation to not only say that we appreciate their service, but also to enact policies such as this demonstrating this gratitude. A 2017 Defense Department report shows expanding access will not only make life easier for these veterans, but will also strengthen the commissary and exchange system. This amendment has been endorsed by the VFW, American Legion, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Wounded Warrior Project, Disabled American Veterans, and AMVETS. Mr. Chair, I thank Congressman WALTER JONES for joining me on the bill and on this amendment. I thank the chair and ranking member for including my amendment in this bloc and for their work on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support these amendments. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON  LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member and the chairman of the Rules Committee for listening to both my concerns and the amendments that we have offered. We are very pleased to have at least 10 amendments to deal with this important legislation. Mr. Chair, I rise to thank the chair and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for the en bloc amendments. I would like to draw particular attention to a few Jackson Lee amendments as the Congress prepares to adjourn for Memorial Day. I want to thank the men and women who serve in the United States military. The Jackson Lee amendment offered in this year’s NDAA will provide oversight with information or guidance on efforts at K–12 schools on Federal military facilities to maintain safety and security from active shooters. Just coming from my district and in the neighboring area, the Santa Fe tragedy, of which I attended vigils over the weekend and listening to children talk about being fearful of guns and going to school, has been a very difficult set of circumstances. So the Jackson Lee amendment would, in fact, seek an assessment from the Secretary of Defense of the strategies that may be used to reduce the security threats posed by active shooter incidences at public schools and secondary schools. Today, the DOD operates 60 schools in seven States, 26,000 military connected students, and that is a process where I think the Pentagon and the Defense Department can be very, very helpful. Jackson Lee amendment No. 91 seeks to have a report 180 days following enactment from the Secretary of Defense, which will include the Coast Guard, on maternity mortality rates among members of the Armed Forces and the Department. For every 100,000 births in the United States in 2013, the Centers for Disease Control estimated that 17.3 percent of mothers died, the highest mortality rate of all industrialized countries by several times over. I believe we can be very effective in having solutions. My amendment No. 68 considers the vital role in the National Guard and reservist field when called to service. I work with the National Guard. Mr. Chair, I thank the Texas Guard and the National Guard. I have seen them in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I believe it is an important assessment to continue to remind us of the work that they do, civilian soldiers, of course. Jackson Lee amendment No. 89 provides a report 220 days after enactment on the DOD’s capacity to provide survivors of natural disasters—we are still 
experiencing the suffering of Hurricane Harvey, and I believe this is a major important time. It is important as well to deal with cybersecurity, and so I have an amendment that seeks an assessment that would consider what occurred in 1992 following Hurricane Andrew when the DOD stood up emergency housing, and to look at those options. The same thing with dealing with cybersecurity: I believe that it is important for the DOD to deal with the feasibility of creating an apprentice program to address the agency’s shortages of qualified cybersecurity persons. Let me just simply say that this legislation will be helpful in defining how we answer a lot of hard questions. I do want to take note of the fact that I would like to see in the State Department and the DOD that we work on better relationships with Pakistan and try to discern how we can weave through some of the difficult issues that we are addressing and develop that alliance again. My other amendments deal with raising awareness among students traveling abroad; expanding the report required by the bill to include information on the opportunities dealing with artificial intelligence, dealing with cybersecurity, sharing of Navy desalinization technology for civilian applications. Something that I have been working on for a number of years: I just was in a meeting dealing with the impact of Boko Haram and as well its farreaching impact throughout Africa, north Africa, and the death that it has been engaged in. My amendment will be providing for DOD assistance to the Nigerian Government in developing a missing persons database to report on missing, exploited, and trafficked persons. The DOD has provided the kind of assistance that has been allowed by our laws, but it is a horrific circumstance. Then finally, I have an amendment addressing dangers associated with manmade space debris in low Earth orbit to manned and unmanned missions. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support our amendments. I thank those who have managed this legislation. I think the important point I want to make sure is the active shooter; the mortality rates dealing with mothers, maternal mortality rates and the loss of mothers and the loss of children in the instance of child birth. I would ask that my amendments be accepted. Mr. Chair, I rise to thank the Chair and Ranking Member of the Rules Committee for the inclusion of Jackson Lee Amendments in the Rules for H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2019. I also thank the Chair and Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee, and their staffs for working with me and my staff to include Jackson Lee Amendments in the Amendment En Blocs for H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2019. As a Member of the House Budget Committee, I am keenly aware of the budget pressures caused by Sequestration and repeated government shutdowns that have plagued defense and nondefense agencies. It is past time for the Congress to engage in an authentic bipartisan budget process that puts the national interest over party interest so that we can complete the annual appropriations process by September 30, 2018, and prevent any further government shutdowns. I have several amendments to H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2019, which will be addressed in my submitted statement. I would like to draw particular attention to a few Jackson Lee Amendments because of their importance to the people whom I serve in the 18th Congressional District of Texas, or they are of significance to the people who rely upon the resources provided by the National Defense Authorization Act to defend our nation. As the Congress prepares to adjourn for Memorial Day weekend, I want to thank the men and women of the Armed Services, and the dedicated civilian professionals of the Department of Defense and its branches for their sacrifice and service to our nation. I hope that in some small measure that the passage of this bill will convey to them the heartfelt respect and appreciation this body has for what they do each day to keep our nation and its people safe from harm. The Jackson Lee Amendments offered to this year’s NDAA will provide oversight with information or guidance on: 1. Efforts at K–12 schools on federal military facilities to maintain safety and security from active shooter situations; 2. Reporting on maternity mortality rates among service women, and female dependents of all service members, including the Coast Guard; 3. Raising awareness among students traveling abroad about recruitment tactics used by foreign intelligence agencies seeking to snare them into spying against the United States; 4. Readiness of the National Guard and Reserve for disaster response; 5. Defense Department’s capacity to provide emergency shortterm housing to disaster survivors; 6. Development of a cybersecurity apprentice program to provide on the job training for certain cybersecurity positions and to support the acquisition of cybersecurity certifications; 7. Expanding a report required by the bill to include information on the opportunities and risks associated with advancements Artificial Intelligence and its subdiscipline of machine learning; 8. Reports on cybersecurity threats posed by the achievement of stable quantum computing; 9. Sharing of Navy desalinization technology for civilian applications; 10. Condemning Boko Haram; and providing for DoD assistance to the Nigerian government in developing a missing persons database to report on missing, exploited and trafficked persons; and 11. Addressing dangers associated with manmade space debris in low earth orbit to manned and unmanned missions. The Jackson Lee Amendments that I would like to emphasize include: Jackson Lee Amendment No. 159, which seeks an assessment, from the Secretary of Defense, of the strategies that may be used to reduce the security threats posed by active shooter incidents at public elementary schools and secondary schools located on the grounds of Federal military installations. Our nation’s military provides for the needs of military families including the education of their children. Since 1816, a Military Service, the Department of War or the Department of Defense has operated schools on military installations. Today, the DoD operates 60 schools in 7 states: Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, New York, South Carolina and Virginia. There are 26,000 military connected students attending Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools, which are operated by Department of Defense Education Activity, which is located in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Local Education Agencies operate about 150 public schools on military installations throughout the United States, educating about 80,000 students. As you already know, on Friday, May 18, 2018, the community of Santa Fe, Texas became the most recent school to experience an active shooter gun violence, which took the lives of eight students and two teachers. No parent should have to endure the loss of a child. Over the last year we have seen deadly active shooter attacks carried out by a lone gunman at K–12 schools, where the shooter was often a student. The safety and wellbeing of children of our active duty personnel are our responsibility. This Jackson Lee amendment seeks information on what is being done and what can be done to increase school security against activity shooters situations in K–12 schools on military installations. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 91, which seeks a report 180 days following enactment from the Secretary of DoD, which will include the Coast Guard, on maternity mortality rates among members of the Armed Forces and the dependents of such members. For every 100,000 births in the US in 2013 the Centers for Disease Control estimated that 17.3 mothers died, the highest maternal mortality rate of all industrialized countries—by several times over. Between 1990 and 2015 it is reported that maternal mortality rates around the world fell by 30 percent while at the same time in the US, the ratio went up nearly 60 percent. A 2012, Pentagon report states that mothers delivering at military hospitals are more likely to hemorrhage after childbirth than mothers at civilian hospitals. More than 50,000 babies are born at military hospitals each year, and they are twice as likely to be injured during delivery as newborns nationwide. This Jackson Lee Amendment would provide a clearer understanding of the mortality 
rates of mothers: who were pregnant, undergoing delivery, or had delivered a child less than 1 year before their deaths. Jackson Lee amendments No. 68 and No. 89 provide additional attention to DoD disaster response. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 68, considers the vital role the National Guard and Reservist’s fill when called to service in disaster response. I thank the Texas Guard, National Guard, and Reservists as well as the active duty military personnel, including the Coast Guard who 
came to the aid of victims of Hurricane Harvey. You saved thousands of lives and Texans will be forever grateful that you answered the call to serve our nation as members of the armed forces. Hurricane Harvey’s impact in Texas is still being felt nine months later. The storm’s footprint covered over 9,000 square miles, including the city of Houston, Texas. Hurricane Harvey dropped over 52 inches of rain in the Houston area an over 60 inches were recorded elsewhere in the state. At its peak on September 1, 2017, onethird of Houston, our nation’s fourth largest city, was underwater leaving 34,575 evacuees in shelters across Texas. Before the flood waters had receded in Houston two other monster hurricanes were bearing down on citizens living in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The scope and magnitude of these dueling disasters tested the National Guard and Reservists in ways that were new. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 68 requires a readiness report on the National Guard and Reservists to make sure they have what they need to assist communities in need of disaster assistance during the 2018 Hurricane Season which begins June 1st. Many Texans are still recovering from Hurricane Harvey, and the same is true of Puerto Rico residents who are attempting to recover from Hurricane Maria. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 68 improves the bill’s ability to support the important mission of the National Guard and Reservists to engage in disaster response. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 89 provides a report 220 days after enactment on the DoD’s capacity to provide survivors of natural disasters with emergency short term housing. Hurricane Harvey is the largest housing disaster to strike the U.S. in our nation’s history. During Hurricane Harvey over 300,000 structures flooded in southeastern Texas, where extreme rainfall hit many areas that are denselypopulated. At its peak on September 1, 2017, onethird of Houston, our nation’s fourth largest city, was underwater with 34,575 evacuees in shelters across Texas. The storm and resulting flooding damaged 203,000 homes, of which 12,700 were destroyed. Port Arthur residents were living in tents, after 80 percent of the city’s housing was flooded by Hurricane Harvey rains, which led to acute housing needs. The city of Beaumont lost its fresh water supply leading to the closure of hospitals and evacuation of patients to hospitals in other cities. There were significant delays in the provision of enough hotels for all of those impacted by the storm. However, within weeks hotel rooms were sufficient to address most housing needs for those displaced by the storm. Unfortunately, the number of hotel rooms in Jefferson County Texas was insufficient for the demand for housing, which left residents living in tents until housing options could be found. This Jackson Lee amendment seeks an assessment that would consider, what occurred in 1992 following Hurricane Andrew, when the DoD stood up emergency housing in the State of Florida for thousands of Floridians who lost their homes to that storm. Earlier this year, the House passed H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerabilities Disclosure Act, which I introduced to address the need for effective and aggressive action to deal with the threat of Zero Day Events. A Zero Day Event describes the situation that network security professionals may find themselves when a previously unknown error or flow in computing code is exploited by a cybercriminal or terrorist. The term ‘‘Zero Day Event’’ simply means that there is zero time to prepare a defense against a cyberattack. H.R. 3202 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber vulnerability disclosures. I have previously introduced legislation to address the cybersecurity workforce shortage in the Federal government. On that bill, H.R. 1981, Cyber Security Education and Federal Workforce Enhancement Act, establishes the process for looking outside of DHS and within its ranks to solve the shortage of cybersecurity professionals. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 97 seeks an assessment from the DoD on the feasibility of creating an apprentice program to address the agency’s shortages of qualified cybersecurity professionals for certain cybersecurity positions. There is a growing shortage of cybersecurity professionals with over a quartermillion positions remaining unfilled in the U.S. alone and a predicted shortfall of 1.5 million cybersecurity professionals by 2019. There are additional Jackson Lee Amendments included in this bill that provide reports to the authorizing committees on a range of security and safety issues related to technology and innovation, with an eye toward the future. The world is on the verge of significant breakthroughs in computing, space exploration, medical advancements, and innovations in medicine, engineering, and know how. At the same time we are seeing extreme weather events that are causing significant shifts in rainfall patterns in this country and around the world that require that we invest in water management and desalinization technology to assure reliable access to abundant fresh water. Artificial intelligence (AI), and quantum computing are rapidly changing areas of computing science that will have direct and significant implications for our economy, national defense, and our nation’s security. I have two Jackson Lee Amendments that have been adopted in En Bloc Amendments that will provide additional scope to an existing report on AI, and another report on the implications for the security of computing networks should quantum computing innovation establish more stable systems. The current stage of computing innovation is akin to the Age of Flight at the time of the Wright Brothers. We are in the infancy of the Computing Age, the best is yet to come, but we should be mindful of the rewards as well as the risks. We will have aggressive programs to meet the challenge of achieving stable quantum computing because if we are not on the bleeding edge of this innovation curve, there could be dire consequences for the security of defense, civilian, private sector, and academic computing networks, challenges to our leadership in computing advancements, and we run the risk of negative economic impacts. At best we are the first to achieve these advancements in computing, and at worse we are in second place. I thank the Committees for including Jackson Lee Amendments Nos. 126 and 193 in the Amendment En Blocs for H.R. 5515. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 90 directs that the Secretary of DoD will provide a report 240 days from enactment of this bill on the risks posed by manmade space debris in lowearth orbit, including recommendations on remediation of such risks, and outlines of plans to reduce the incident of space debris. Space debris encompasses both natural and artificial particles. This Jackson Lee Amendment would address the risk of manmade space debris. Manmade objects in Earth’s orbit that may no longer serve a useful function can include nonfunctional spacecraft, abandoned launch vehicle stages, missionrelated debris and fragmentation debris. Space debris travels at speeds up to 17,500 miles per hour is fast enough a small piece of manmade debris to damage to a satellite or a spacecraft. There are more than 20,000 pieces of debris larger than a softball or orbiting the Earth. There are 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger. There are many millions of pieces of debris that are so small they can’t be tracked. NASA tracks more than 500,000 pieces of 
manmade space debris in Earth’s orbit. Jackson Lee Amendment seeks a report from the Secretary of Defense on the risks posed by manmade space debris, solutions for reducing risks and strategies for reducing the incidence of more manmade space debris being introduced into space. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 61 on the Rule for H.R. 5515, directs the following Secretary of Navy to submit reports to Congress on the feasibility of applying desalinization technologies to provide drought relief in areas impacted by sharp declines in water availability for both military as well as civilian purposes. (listed as No. 482 on the Rules Committee Roster) In 2010, the United States consumed about 355,000 million gallons of water per day. Worldwide, some 700 million people do not have access to enough clean water. In 10 years the number is expected to more than double to 1.8 billion. Twothirds of the Earth’s surface is water, but in fact less than 1 percent it is available for human use. The rest of the water on our planet is either salt water found in oceans, fresh water frozen in the polar ice caps, or too inaccessible for practical usage. While population and demand on freshwater resources are increasing, supply will always remain constant. And although the water cycle continuously returns water to Earth, it is not always returned to the same place, or in the same quantity and quality. This is why I offered this Jackson Lee Amendment No. 61. It is time to plan for the future water needs of our country. 
There are serious water shortages in some regions of the country and the prospects that sustained water shortages due to regional growth and climate factors may make it necessary to develop alternative sources for water intended for human and agricultural uses. If we can harness the technology to convert ocean water into fresh water the future of cities and rural communities that depend on water can be much brighter. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 88 on the Rule for H.R. 5515, Requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress programs and procedures employed to ensure students studying abroad through Department of Defense National Security Education Programs are trained to recognize, resist, and report against recruitment efforts by agents of foreign governments. The number of U.S. students studying abroad for credit during the 2015–2016 academic year totaled 325,339 students. This represents just over 1.6 percent of all U.S. students enrolled at institutions of higher education in the United States and about 10 percent of U.S. graduates. Study abroad provides opportunities to students and helps nation’s economies. A recent survey found that almost 40 percent of companies surveyed missed international business opportunities because of a lack of internationallyco competent personnel. However, the opportunities to study in another country come with some risks. In 2014, the FBI released a 28minute spy film called ‘‘Game of Pawns, ’’ which was based in part on the real life story of Glenn Shriver, who in 2004 was a 22yearold studying in Shanghai. The Michigan native found a seemingly innocent job online—writing papers on U.S. China relations. Over time, the job description changed. Glenn Shriver accepted $70,000 from Chinese operatives and agreed to apply for U.S. government jobs in order to gain access to classified information. By then, the FBI was on to him. He was arrested in 2010 and pleaded guilty to one count of attempting to spy. He was sentenced to serve a fouryear prison sentence. At the time FBI did not say how many students had been turned into spies but said they are increasingly being targeted. Destinations for U.S. students studying abroad include: Africa; Asia; Europe; Latin America; Middle East; and Oceania. When 95 percent of consumers live outside of the United States, we cannot afford to ignore this essential aspect of higher education. Jackson Lee Amendment No. 88 will provide the tools and education needed to U.S. students studying abroad to help them protect themselves from attempts the recruitment tactics of foreign agents. Thank you to the Committee for the inclusion of these Jackson Lee Amendments in the final bill. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, we have no further speakers.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 908, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, I want to take a moment as we approach the conclusion of this debate to again express my appreciation to the members of the Armed Services Committee, to all of the Members of the House who have contributed to this product, as well as to our staff. Mr. Chairman, I think many Members do not realize that it requires a lot of long, hard, late work on the part of the staff to sift through the 578 amendments that were filed for the Rules Committee in order to make our floor consideration go as smoothly as it has. I want to express again, as I have started our general debate, my appreciation to not only our committee staff, who have been doing this throughout markup and on to floor consideration, but the Rules Committee staff and the leadership staff on both sides that have facilitated this product. It was a good bill to begin with, but with the assistance of a number of Members, it has become a better product, and it is certainly a worthy cause for Members to participate in and to show our support for the men and women who serve. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I, too, want to thank all the people who worked to put together this product. As always, our committee, I think, was a fine example, both of how to legislate and how to do it in a bipartisan way, starting at the committee process, starting with the chairman’s mark. As the chairman has mentioned, just about everybody in this House has contributed to this product, either in committee or once we got to the Rules Committee with the amendments that they offered. It took an extraordinary amount of work on behalf of the Members, but, most importantly, on behalf of staff to sift through all of those amendments, to reach agreements where they could, to set up reasonable debate where they couldn’t, and they did an outstanding job. This is the best staff I have ever worked with. They do an amazing job. And we all have to remember the baseline reason why we are doing this. As the authorizing bill for the Department of Defense, this is the bill that sets the policy that helps the men and women who fight and serve to protect our country. So it is an incredibly important task. I want to particularly thank the chairman. It has been a great working relationship this year, as always. I think we have an excellent product. I look forward to getting it passed today and going to conference with the Senate. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. R YAN), the distinguished Speaker of the House. (Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, this has been a very busy week in the House. I just came to the floor from a ceremony where I signed three major pieces of legislation that are now headed to the President’s desk to become law. This House has been very busy keeping its promises: to unleash our economy, to take care of our veterans, to provide hope for the terminally ill. We just signed those three things that are now on their way to the President’s desk. But perhaps the most important promise that we made was the one that we made to the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces. We promised to start rebuilding our military to give them the resources that they need to do their jobs, to reassert the United States’ dominance in our military in the world. After tax reform, that was my most important legislative priority, because that was our most important legislative priority. Mr. Chairman, it is another promise kept. Earlier this year, we enacted a historic increase in military funding, made possible by the bipartisan budget agreement that came before it. This allowed us to advance the bill that we have before us right here today. I want to thank the members of the Armed Services Committee, the ranking member, but I especially want to thank Chairman THORNBERRY for his work on this bill and his tireless advocacy for our men and women in uniform. This National Defense Authorization presents another major step toward rebuilding and reforming our military. It will repair the damage done over the previous decade. It starts with readiness. It starts with readiness because this country has had a readiness crisis that has been costing us lives. More American servicemembers are being killed in accidents and training exercises than on the battlefield. As Secretary Mattis put it, he was shocked by the poor state of our readiness. We must reverse that. This bill invests in training. This bill invests in equipment. It grows the size of all branches of our military, and it prioritizes missile defense and our nuclear deterrent. It is a very dangerous world, and this legislation will help us counter the threats, whether they are new or traditional, whether from China or Russia or Iran or North Korea. But, like I said, we are not just rebuilding our military, we are reforming our military. The legislation streamlines the bureaucracy and improves the buying practices so that we are not devoting more resources to waste, we are devoting more resources to what counts: keeping this country strong and keeping this country safe. And, of course, we are taking care of our servicemembers and their families with the biggest pay raise for our troops in 9 years. I am so proud of this legislation. I am so proud of our legislators. I am so proud of the chairman for making this moment possible. Here we are, not just keeping our promise, but making this a better, stronger, safer United States. This will have a lasting impact, and this will ensure that America continues to lead in the 21st century. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and the members of the committee, and I urge adoption of this bill. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, with appreciation for the kind words, but especially for the commitment from the Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. The Committee will rise informally. The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. FERGUSON ) assumed the chair.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 The Committee resumed its sitting. 
AMENDMENT NO . 168 OFFERED BY MR . FERGUSON  
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. A MODEI ). It is now in order to consider amendment No. 168 printed in House Report 115–702. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment 
No. 168 to the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 908, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank, first of all, Chairman THORNBERRY for working with me on this amendment to provide a clear legislative direction for the GSA’s new ecommerce portal provider system for commercial offthe shelf sales. My amendment would strengthen supplier data protection requirements and express the sense of Congress that implementation of this program will be done in a manner that enhances competition. I fully support the committee’s efforts to reform the procurement process to increase efficiency and reduce waste for the Federal Government, and most importantly, the taxpayers. However, there are still some unanswered questions regarding the implementation of the program. Moving forward, I believe that there is still important work to be done to ensure that the portal results in robust competition from a broad range of suppliers, which is vital to achieving the efficiencies and cost savings that the committee is seeking. The American people have told us over and over again that they do not want the Federal Government picking winners and losers, and I fully agree. We do an amazing job around here sometimes of creating very large monolithic monopolies as unintended consequences. Mr. Chairman, I want to make sure that we don’t do that with this important reform. While my amendment takes steps to improve data safeguards, I remain concerned about the anticompetitive efforts of concerns from suppliers, both large and small, regarding the baseline data access between competitors. Whether a small business or a multinational corporation, private companies are fiercely and understandably protective of their proprietary data. Competition requires willing competitors, and competitors expect a level playing field, a playing field on which the referee is not also a player on the other team. Promoting competition in this program requires that we continue to listen to and, more importantly, address the concerns of potential suppliers. My amendment is a step in the right direction, but there is more work to do, and I look forward to continuing to work with the chairman in good faith to improve this system to make sure that it is achieving the results that we truly know that it can. Mr. Chairman, today, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of amendment No. 168, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, although I am not opposed. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Washington is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL ). Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the committee for including language that will authorize the Department of Defense to include the role of women in their research on the National Strategy on Countering Violent Extremism. Mr. Chairman, we are learning every day that women are active agents deterring or engaging in violent extremist movements. A 2017 report by the organization Futures Without Violence found that several contemporary organizations, for example, the Islamic State and Boko Haram, capitalize on women’s efforts and demonstrate keen awareness of the strategic and tactical potential of female extremists. And while many, many more women are victims of terrorism, some are serving as supportive wives and mothers to the next generation of extremists; others are acting as propagandists, fundraisers, and suicide bombers. The apparent proliferation of female actors in extremist groups, often underestimated, calls for strategies that effectively counter their participation in violent extremism. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FERGUSON ). The amendment was agreed to. b0945 The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under House Resolution 908, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. FERGUSON ) having assumed the chair, Mr. AMODEI , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5515) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2019 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 908, he reported the bill, as amended by House Resolution 905, back to the House with sundry further amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any further amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. The amendments were agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the bill in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Thompson of California moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5515 to the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: Add, at the end of the bill, the following, and conform the table of contents accordingly: DIVISION E—PUBLIC SAFETY AND SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS PROTECTION 
Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this division, and biannually thereafter, the Attorney General shall make the National Instant Criminal Background Check System index statistics available on a publically accessible Internet website. 
The amendments made by this title shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment of this division. TITLE II—PROVIDING A RESPONSIBLE AND CONSISTENT BACKGROUND CHECK PROCESS 
The purpose of this title is to enhance the current background check process in the United States to ensure criminals and the mentally ill are not able to purchase firearms. 
This title and the amendments made by this title shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment of this division. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order against the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion to recommit. Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, and it would not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Mr. Speaker, less than 1 week ago, 10 people were shot and killed in their school in Santa Fe, Texas. As usual, Members sent thoughts and prayers. They said that things have got to change, and then they did nothing. We held our 47th moment of silence since the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School 5
1⁄2years ago. For every Member who looks into the face of yet another grieving family and says, ‘‘I am with you,’’ and then does nothing, I have a message for you: You are complicit. You are allowing criminals and the dangerously mentally ill easy access to guns. Your inaction is leading to gravestone after gravestone. We have not had one vote on legislation to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them. If we are not allowed a vote, there is blood on the hands of Congress. Since Sandy Hook, more kids have been killed by someone using a gun than all of our troops killed in combat since 9/11. Let that sink in. Seven thousand young kids are dead, in part, because of our inaction. I don’t know about you, but that number keeps me up at night. These are children who are robbed of a lifetime of experiences and robbed of their future. Instead of going to their graduation, their parents go and visit their grave. This amendment is straightforward, and, if adopted, it will not kill the bill. It does two things: First, it provides grants to States to get more records into the background check system. I think we can all agree, for the system to work, it has to have the most uptodate records. Second, it would expand background checks to all commercial sale of firearms. So if you walk into a gun show and try to buy a gun, you have to undergo a background check. If you go online and try to buy a gun, you have to undergo a background check. This isn’t some radical idea. 208 Members of this Congress, Democrats and Republicans, are cosponsors. Even 94 percent of gun owners support expanding background checks, and we can’t get 94 percent of the people to agree that the sky is blue. This kind of consensus should unify us. It should empower us on this floor to do what is right. We know that background checks work. Every day, background checks stop more than 175 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun. But in some States, these same folks can walk into a gun show and buy the same gun without a background check. This motion would change that. Yesterday, the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force heard from young leaders who are begging Congress to pass laws to help prevent gun violence. One of the hardest things for me to hear was one student saying that he was not actually surprised that there was a shooting at his school. Kids now have an expectation that one day it will happen to them. This is shameful, and it is the future that we are leaving for our children and our grandchildren. I know what the chairman is going to say. He is going to say the NDAA is no place for this amendment. First, this isn’t an extraneous provision. The NDAA has language directly addressing guns and gun ownership. Without that language in the bill, we wouldn’t be able to offer this amendment today. Second, the NDAA has long been a place for extraneous provisions. In this bill alone, the majority has weakened environmental oversight and permitted drilling, has addressed medical fees in national parks, and has addressed yacht safety, just to name a few extraneous provisions. So I ask you to join me: No more complicity. No more blood on the hands of Congress. No more moments of silence. It is time for moments of action. Vote ‘‘yes’’ on this motion. It will not kill the bill, but it will save lives. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order? If not, the gentleman from Texas makes a point of order that the instructions in the motion to recommit offered by the gentleman from California violate clause 10 of rule XXI by proposing an increase in mandatory spending over a relevant period of time. Pursuant to clause 10 of rule XXI and clause 4 of rule XXIX, the Chair is authoritatively guided by estimates from the chair of the Committee on the Budget that the net effect of the provisions in the motion to recommit would increase mandatory spending over a relevant period as compared to the bill. Accordingly, the point of order is sustained and the motion is not in order. Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the House? 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I move to lay the appeal on the table. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15 minute vote on the motion to table will be followed by a 5minute vote on passage of the bill, if arising without further proceedings in recommittal. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 224, nays 191, not voting 12, as follows:

b1031 So the bill was passed. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2019 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, due to a family issue I was not present for votes on May 24, 2018. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 229 and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 230. 
AUTHORIZING THE CLERK TO MAKE CORRECTIONS IN ENGROSSMENT OF H.R. 5515, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Clerk be authorized to make technical corrections in the engrossment of H.R. 5515, including corrections in spelling, punctuation, section and title numbering, crossreferencing, conforming amendments to the table of contents and short titles, and the insertion of appropriate headings. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. 
REPORT ON H.R. 5952, COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019 Mr. CULBERSON, from the Committee on Appropriations, submitted a privileged report (Rept.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 1, rule XXI, all points of order are reserved on the bill. 
PERMISSION FOR THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS TO HAVE UNTIL 5 P.M. ON THURSDAY, MAY 24, 2018, TO FILE A PRIVILEGED REPORT Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Appropriations have until 5 p.m. on Thursday, May 24, 2018, to file a privileged report to accompany measures making appropriations for the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. f 
PRIVILEGED REPORT ON RESOLUTION OF INQUIRY TO SECRETARY OF COMMERCE Mr. RUSSELL, from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, submitted an adverse privileged report (Rept. No. 115–705) on the resolution (H. Res. 877) of inquiry directing the Secretary of Commerce to provide certain documents in the Secretary’s possession to the House of Representatives relating to the decision to include a question on citizenship in the 2020 decennial census of population, which was referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed. 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10 a.m. tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. 
PERMISSION FOR MEMBER TO BE CONSIDERED AS FIRST SPONSOR OF H.R. 1094 Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may hereafter be considered the first sponsor of H.R. 1094, the Weekend Voting Act, a bill originally introduced by Representative Louise Slaughter of New York, for the purposes of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. 
HONORING VETERANS AND SERVICEMEMBERS (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our liberties, our freedoms, and our precious way of life. Montanans are a proud and patriotic people who always answer the call to serve their Nation. They are mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons 
and daughters. Some did not return from the theater of conflict, giving their lives for our country and our liberty. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to them and to their families. We owe them a debt we can never fully repay, as much as we try. As we mark Memorial Day, we pray for the families of the veterans whose sacrifices have secured our freedoms, and we give thanks for the blessings of life and liberty, peace and prosperity that their service has secured for all of us. 
AMENDMENTS INCLUDED IN THE NDAA (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as we come upon this weekend, I want to certainly offer my respect for the men and women in the United States military and those who have fallen in battle. In this last authorization bill for the defense, I want to emphasize important amendments that I had approved dealing with active shooter, dealing with the violence against our children and having that explained or researched; and, as well, the maternal mortality rate will be included, along with 10 other of my amendments. At the same time, I wish to speak about something that saddens me on the breach of the rule of law and the breach of the Constitution that our President is engaged in: the maligning of the special counsel and, of course, the attempt to expose a confidential source. So let me hold up this picture of Rudy Giuliani who, in 1998, said in another investigation of a President: ‘‘He’s got to do it. He’s got to do it.’’ So I would offer to say that the President of the United States needs to sit down with the special counsel and tell the truth. That is what our men and women fight for overseas and around the world: democracy and the rule of law. That is what the President should do. 
RECOGNIZING THE AMERICAN LEGION’S NATIONAL POPPY DAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this weekend our Nation marks one of the most solemn occasions, Memorial Day. It is a time when we honor the sacrifices made by our fallen military members. Tomorrow marks the American Legion National Poppy Day. Each year members of the American Legion distribute poppy flowers with the request that those receiving a flower making a donation to support our veterans, active servicemembers, and military families. At the end of the First World War, the poppy flourished throughout Europe because of the lime in the rubble left over from the war. The red poppy is a nationally recognized symbol of sacrifice that has been worn by Americans since World War I to honor those who served and died for our country in all wars. It reminds Americans of the sacrifices made by our veterans while protecting our freedoms. Mr. Speaker, I will proudly wear a poppy tomorrow to honor our fallen servicemembers, and it is my hope that all Americans will do the same. f 
HONORING CLIFFORD JOHNSON, SR. (Ms. BARRAGA´N asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Mr. Clifford Johnson, Sr., who will be 100 years old on June 7. Mr. Johnson, a Cherokee Indian Freedman, was born in Lenapah, Oklahoma, on June 7, 1918. He fought bravely during World War II, serving as a staff sergeant in the U.S. Army. He began a lifelong career with the United States Postal Service in 1946. Mr. Johnson is a loving father, grandfather, and greatgrandfather. Mr. JOHNSON is a patron of Macedonia Baptist Church in Watts, California, and attributes his longevity to being close to God and treating other people the way he would want to be treated. I want to wish Mr. Clifford Johnson, Sr., a very happy birthday and thank him for his service to our country. 
RECOGNIZING STAFF SERGEANT MICHAEL ‘‘MICK’’ DEHART (Mr. DAVIDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Staff Sergeant Michael ‘‘Mick’’ DeHart for the selfless actions and bravery he showed on April 10, 1969, during the Vietnam war. While conducting a routine reconnaissance operation, Staff Sergeant DeHart and his platoon were ambushed by a numerically superior force. Throughout the firefight, Staff Sergeant DeHart moved through the enemy fire to provide cover for injured soldiers, distribute supplies, and coordinate a counterattack. As dusk approached, Sergeant DeHart, at significant personal risk, moved to an exposed position, fired on machinegun positions and approaching enemy soldiers, halting their advance. He also aided in the successful exfiltration of his unit. For his heroism in combat, Staff Sergeant DeHart recently had one of his two Silver Stars upgraded to a Distinguished Service Cross. Thank you, Sergeant DeHart, for your heroism, courage, and service to our great country. HONORING ROCIO GUILLEN ROCHA (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Rocio Guillen Rocha. Rocio attended the Route 91 festival on October 1 in Las Vegas. Rocio would say that her greatest accomplishment was being a mom to her four kids—Marcus, Christopher, Sofia, and Austin—and being engaged to her fiance´, Chris Jaksha. Rocio had lived through many major life events. She had given birth to her youngest child, Austin, just 6 weeks prior to her death, and she was paralyzed after giving birth to her second child, Christopher. Rocio was a fighter who worked hard to walk again after being paralyzed. After a lot of work and training, she eventually was able to walk again. Rocio was known as being a supermom who loved supporting her kids while they played baseball. She was an amazing mom who worked long hours as an assistant manager at California Pizza Kitchen so she could take care of her kids. Rocio had a great sense of humor, and she was always laughing, even through the tough times. She is remembered for being patient and loving by all those who knew her. I would like to extend my condolences to Rocio Guillen Rocha’s family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. f 
RECOGNIZING GORDON ‘‘BATMAN’’ VARNEDOE (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gordon ‘‘Batman’’ Varnedoe’s 80th birthday, which he celebrated on May 19. Mr. Varnedoe is a staple of Savannah, who lives to put a smile on everyone’s face and is never afraid to try something new. Known to locals as Batman, he is often seen in parades wearing his cape and mask, but he earned the nickname in high school for his passionate belief in truth, justice, and an American moment. Mr. Varnedoe breaks out of his cape and into 18th century English attire as General James Oglethorpe, Savannah’s founder, to welcome visitors to this historic city. His latest projects include substitute teaching at various schools and officiating weddings in his General Oglethorpe persona. He sets records in international weightlifting competitions at 73 years old. He is likely the oldest rugby player in Georgia, and he has founded numerous organizations to help sports thrive. 
Everyone can learn from Batman’s enthusiasm for life and his ability to make the world a more colorful place. Happy birthday, my friend. 
b1045 HONORING COACH SCOTT GLABB (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I take a few moments today to honor one of my constituents, Coach Scott Glabb, for his contributions to Orange County youth. Mr. Glabb has been an important figure as a teacher and wrestling coach at Santa Ana High School for about 30 years. After wrestling in college for Eastern Washington University, Coach Glabb came to Santa Ana High School in 1990, where he became a teacher and a head coach. Mr. Glabb’s dedication led Santa Ana High School to 26 straight CIF championship league titles. Coach Glabb also coached two individual national high school champs: Tony Perez in 1998 and Jose Leon in 1999. With the girls, he was equally successful. He had two female wrestling State champs: Lizette Tenorio in 2009 and Berenice Blanco in 2012. Mr. Glabb was more than a coach and a teacher. He was a role model for a lot of kids that didn’t have a chance to make it out of their neighborhoods. Thank you, Coach Glabb. We wish you success in your retirement. 
ANNUAL ROLLING THUNDER MOTORCYCLE RIDE (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, the Nation sets aside time to remember those who gave all for our country. Thousands will travel to Washington, D.C., for the annual Rolling Thunder motorcycle ride to remember and honor the fallen, and millions across the country will participate in parades or gather around monuments and parks to recall a loved one or a neighbor who never came home. There will be the playing of ‘‘Taps’’ and heartfelt and silent whispers of: I miss you; I wish I could see you; and thank you. Memorial Day is truly a national holiday in that it is a day that politics are avoided, and given some of the debates we have been having and what you see on TV, that is not a bad thing. When you visit Arlington Cemetery or any of the national cemeteries across the country, including the National Cemetery of the Alleghenies, not far from my district, the gravestones don’t mark one’s party affiliation. Rather, the simplicity of the stones remind us that they were Americans, they served, and that they are remembered. May God grant eternal rest to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice to our country, and may He bless the families of the fallen with His tender mercies. f 
MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mental Health Awareness Month. We have got to realize that one in six adults in the United States lives with a mental illness. However, only 43 percent of them receive any sort of treatment. I saw this firsthand as a prosecutor, as many, not all, but many men, women, and even juveniles were behind bars because of a mental illness. Unfortunately, due to the cutbacks in funding and the legislature’s cutting back on sentences, many failed to receive the proper treatment, and what we had was a revolving door where we no longer could rely on the criminal justice system to house and treat those with mental illnesses. Fortunately, in my district on the Central Coast of California, we have many organizations that realize this and attempt to provide proper services, including Interim, Parent’s Place, and the Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties Behavioral Health Departments. So now it is Congress’ time to play their part. We, on the bipartisan Mental Health Caucus, are committed to ensuring accessible mental treatment. Good mental health this month and every month for all ages of life and all walks of life contribute to the overall health of our communities, and that is why we should continue to work to fund and provide mental health services throughout our country. 
HONORING DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICER ROGELIO SANTANDER (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, recently, Officer Rogelio Santander of the Dallas, Texas, police department was responding to an ordinary call: a thief at a Home Depot. As Officer Santander and his colleagues attempted to arrest the outlaw, the crook pulled out a pistol and started blasting away at the officers. All three officers responding to the call were critically wounded, the criminal’s bullets hitting their mark as he cowardly ran away from his crimes. Police Officer Crystal Almeida and a civilian Home Depot employee were shot and are now recovering from their wounds. At just 28 years of age, Officer Santander was murdered in the youth of his life. Another member of the thin blue line killed simply because he wore the badge to protect and serve the rest of us. A man of many hats, the 3year veteran of the force was a member of the rare breed, the American breed. His fellow officers, friends, and family members remember this Texas law man, Santander, as a person who always went the extra mile to protect and serve his community. Without fail, he encouraged his friends and family to be the best version of themselves during their life. Peace officers like Santander are the last strand of wire in the fence between the law and the lawless. We mourn his sacrifice, but we thank the good Lord that a remarkable man such as he has ever lived. And that is just the way it is. f 
THE TIMES THEY ARE ACHANGIN’ (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, our country’s democracy and rule of law are in danger, being threatened at every moment. Today is my birthday and also the birthday of Bobby Zimmerman aka Bob Dylan. And with that, I quote Bob Dylan: 
Come writers and critics Who prophesize with your pen And keep your eyes wide The chance won’t come again And don’t speak too soon For the wheel’s still in spin And there’s no tellin’ who that it’s namin’ For the loser now will be later to win For the times they are achangin’ Come senators, congressmen Please heed the call Don’t stand in the doorway Don’t block up the hall For he that gets hurt Will be he who has stalled There’s a battle outside and it is ragin’ It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls For the times they are achangin’ The line that is drawn The curse it is cast The slow one now Will later be fast As the present now Will later be past The order is rapidly fadin’ And the first one now will later be last For the times they are achangin’ 
My colleagues, get it together and save democracy and protect us from this President. 
RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MICHIGAN INTERNATIONAL SPEEDWAY (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Michigan International Speedway as they celebrate their 50th anniversary in 2018. Located in my district in the heart of the beautiful Irish Hills, Michigan 
International Speedway is one of the Nation’s premier racing facilities. Throughout the season, MIS will be commemorating this milestone by showcasing many of the memorable moments and drivers in the track’s history. I look forward to joining everyone to kick off their first NASCAR race of the year, which is just weeks away. In addition to NASCAR, MIS offers year round entertainment and festivals, making it a leading tourist attraction for people near and far. Through their extensive charity work and programs like the Spirit of America Blood Drive, MIS is actively involved in improving the community and impacting lives. Mr. Speaker, Michigan International Speedway is a staple of our community and the world of racing. We are fortunate to have them in the Seventh District. Here is to 50 more years of lasting memories for fans and drivers alike. 
AMERICAN LEADERSHIP ON THE GLOBAL STAGE (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am absolutely flabbergasted at the announcement that just came out of the White House that President Trump is canceling his meeting with Kim Jongun of North Korea. The world held out hope that the Trump administration’s diplomatic engagement with North Korea would bear fruit. But you cannot have thin skin if you want to make progress with a difficult adversary such as the Kim regime. Imagine how different the course of history would look if every chance for peace was scuttled because one party was too mean to the other. To make matters worse, the President’s bizarre letter returns to the same bellicose rhetoric that last year heightened tensions and raised the specter of war. Any type of military conflict on the Korean peninsula would come with horrific consequences. After a year of alienating friends and allies, unwinding our commitments, and drawing back from the world stage, it is clear what the Trump motto of ‘‘America First’’ actually means ‘‘America Lashing Out,’’ leaving America last and alone. American leadership on the global stage has been laid low, not by a rival, but by a President who has sidelined diplomacy, shut out expertise, and thrown out any rational approach to making policy. 
RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT OF DOUG WRIGHT (Mr. BISHOP of Utah asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, June 1 will mark the end of an era in Utah broadcasting. For the past 40 years, Utahans have heard Doug Wright inform, uplift, and bloviate— that is his word, not mine. On Fridays, he reviewed movies, crowned losers, and gave prizes worth up to dollars. For the callers, it was telephone torture, but for the listeners, it has been a friendship through the airways. The Doug Wright Show is ‘‘Where Utah Comes to Talk.’’ In Utah, it is not news until you hear it on Doug’s show. Doug got exclusives, and he did it through hard work, fairness, and being worthy of the trust Utahans placed in him. Doug wasn’t always cooped up in a studio. From the back of a Harley and with a microphone in his hand, he raised the money to bring street lamps to his adopted home of Eureka. His motorcycle rally, the Ride to Light up Eureka, set records, and continues to grow each year. Doug has earned awards and accolades and has been at the top of the ratings, but he will tell you the best thing to come from the newsroom was his wife, D. With her, he grew a family and shared with his audience all the joys and trials that come with a family. As Doug advised us at the close of each day’s program: Tonight, when you go home, make sure you hug the people you love. f 
SUPPORTING THE REVITALIZATION OF OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the timely Senate action of the just passed National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2019. Similar to last year, the NDAA is geared towards increasing the readiness of our military and properly equip our troops for their safety and for their effectiveness in their mission. The steady decline of our Armed Forces under the previous administration is well documented. Now we are continuing the revitalization we started last year by investing in our soldiers and providing them with some of the necessary equipment needed to get their job done. This is about providing for the well being of our troops and their families, including the largest pay raise in 9 years. We are also investing in critical missile defense and nuclear deterrence programs that will substantially improve our national defense capabilities. In order for America to continue as a leader of the free world, our military must be ready to defend us from all and any threat. As we head into this Memorial Day holiday, we can, in part, honor the fallen by an effective NDAA, giving our military what it needs, and support, indeed, as we remember this Memorial Day weekend. f 
GLEN COVE’S 350TH ANNIVERSARY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GAETZ ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from New York (Mr. SUOZZI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, today marks the 350th anniversary of the founding of my hometown, Glen Cove, New York, on May 24, 1668. Earlier this year, we also celebrated the 100th anniversary of Glen Cove’s designation as a city. I love Glen Cove. I served as the city’s mayor from 1994 to 2001. My father, Joseph, an Italian immigrant and an American success story, was the first Suozzi to serve as mayor from 1956 to 1960. My uncle, Vincent, also known as Jimmy Suozzi, was the second. He served from 1973 to 1979 and again from 1984 to 1987. The most recent Suozzi to serve as mayor, my cousin Ralph served from 2006 to 2013. In fact, in the 100 years since Glen Cove became a city, a Suozzi has served as mayor for 32 years. We Suozzis have devoted a great deal of our lives to serving the city we love, and we have been repaid with the satisfaction of knowing our friends, neighbors, and family will continue to strive to work to ensure our best days are still yet to come. Glen Cove was the first industrial center of Long Island. The Carpenter, Simkin, and Cole families purchased over 2,000 acres of waterfront property overlooking Hempstead Harbor and the Long Island Sound from the Native American Matinecock Tribe. b1100 There they built a lumber mill and a gristmill powered by the fresh water of Glen Cove Creek. Originally named Musketa Cove, which means ‘‘a place of rushes’’ in the Matinecock language, Musketa Cove went on to become one of the top four ports for smuggling on Long Island, as no one wanted to pay the English taxes on brandy, rum, and wine. The area grew with professional craftsmen, weavers, carpenters, wool spinners, tailors, millers, and shipbuilders. Corn farming developed in the surrounding area. A second major industry began in the early 1800s when Dr. Thomas Garvie discovered massive clay deposits and began to mine and ship the clay to potteries in New York City and elsewhere on Long Island. Dr. Garvie also began a daily steamship operation between Glen Cove and New York City that began to attract residents looking to escape the city’s sweltering summer heat. Tourismminded residents started to worry that the name Musketa Cove 
sounded too much like mosquito cove, and, in 1834, they changed the name to Glen Cove. It worked. By the mid1850s tourism was booming with daily steamship operations, leading to the development of six major hotels, taverns, and boarding houses. A new industry emerged. The Duryea Starch factory took advantage of the fresh water, the gristmills, and the plentiful corn and became one of the world’s largest starch factories. In fact, in 1878, Duryea won the Paris Gold Medal for the best starch in the world. Industry flourished, tourism flourished, and Glen Cove began to attract more attention. In the early 1900s, some of the wealthiest families in the world made Glen Cove their home. J. P. Morgan, the wealthy financier, who bailed out the U.S. Government; F. W. Woolworth, the founder of the original five anddime department store, whose marketing began the commercialization of Christmas gift giving; and the Pratt family, who amassed their fortune by controlling the kerosene market and, ultimately, merging with John D. Rockefeller to form Standard Oil, all built their massive summer estates in Glen Cove, leading to the moniker of the ‘‘Gold Coast.’’ Between the industries that flourished on the waterfront and the Town & Country magazine rated Gold Coast estates, Glen Cove with its vibrant downtown of merchants was booming. Immigrants from all over the world and America flocked to the area to work at the starch factory, or the Ladew Leatherworks that tanned hides to be used for industrial belts. Immigrants like my grandfather and father from Italy, and others from Ireland, Poland, Germany, and elsewhere, worked not only in the factories, but in the gardens, kitchens, pantries, and garages of the Gold Coast estates. African Americans from the South migrated to the area and found work, many as experts training and caring for thoroughbreds and polo ponies. Around 1917, Glen Cove residents, who saw the economic vibrancy from the estates, the factories, and the vibrant downtown, populated by Jewish, Italian, and English merchants, no longer wished to share their plentiful property and sales tax dollars with the town of Oyster Bay, under whose jurisdiction Glen Cove existed as a village. Community leaders worked with the State legislature and the Governor to break off and become Long Island’s first city. Glen Cove has traveled a long journey. Its population exploded, as did much of Long Island, with veterans returning from World War II. Its industrial vibrancy, which went on to include Li Tungsten, a munitions factory; Mattiace Petrochemical; Columbia Ribbon and Carbon; Powers Chemco; Konica; and Photocircuits, a circuit board manufacturer, all left behind a negative environmental legacy that the City has now cleaned up as it moves forward to a new age of development and waterfront revitalization. With hundreds of acres of publically owned nature preserves, three public beaches, golf courses, a fishing pier, and multiple ballfields and parks, Glen Cove has been restored to a waterfront community with a short commute to Manhattan that once attracted some of the wealthiest families in the world. Unlike much of Long Island, that is either all rich or all poor, or all Black or all White, or all this or all that, Glen Cove remains a diverse community with the wealthiest of the wealthy and a large supply of lowincome housing that is anchored by a solid middle class. It is home to over 60 ethnicities: two Catholic churches, two Baptist churches, two Jewish synagogues. It also has houses of worship for African Methodist Episcopalians, Lutherans, Methodists, Episcopalians, and Evangelicals. The Presbyterian church is one of the most beautiful architectural marvels of the City. Glen Cove is also home to a Russian Orthodox church, a Sikh gurdwara, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and several Latino churches. Many movies, television shows, and commercials have been filmed in Glen Cove, including Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest, starring Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint; and Sabrina, starring Audrey Hepburn, William Holden, and Humphrey Bogart. In fact, as mayor, I met Harrison Ford while filming the remake of Sabrina with Julia Ormond and Greg Kinnear. I met Michael Douglas while filming A Perfect Murder, and told him how his dad, Kirk Douglas, had filmed A Lovely Way to Die in the 1960s in Glen Cove. A former Pratt estate, now the Webb Institute of Naval Architecture, was stately Wayne Manor in Batman Forever. A host of other movies, such as Annie Hall, Hair, Eyes Wide Shut, and one obscure favorite, A New Leaf, were all filmed in Glen Cove as well. Famous historical figures called Glen Cove home. Bobby Kennedy resided in Glen Cove when he ran for United States Senator of New York. Jackie Kennedy called West Island home after the President had been shot. The first female congresswoman from New York was Ruth Baker Pratt. Baseball legends, including Roy Campanella, Whitey Ford and, more recently, Yoenis Cespedes of the New York Mets. Billy Joel spent a short time in Glen Cove. And Ashanti grew up in Glen Cove—I attended her sweet 16 birthday party—while many other artists record here regularly at Cove City Sound Studios. And Sergeant Major Dan Daly, a marine, is one of only 19 men in U.S. history, in our entire Nation, to have received the Medal of Honor, twice. Many of the old estates have been repurposed, including Killenworth, a former Pratt estate that served as the home of the Soviet Ambassador of the United Nations, and still serves the Russian Ambassador. Nikita Khrushchev visited the estate after pounding his shoe on the lectern at the United Nations back in the 1960s. Welwyn, another former Pratt estate, is a 200acre nature preserve and serves as the Nassau County Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center. Not every Glen Cover has a boldface name, but every Glen Cove resident contributes in their own unique way to the community: the first responders, the business owners, and the volunteers; the elected officials, city employees, the coaches, and the moms and dads; the teachers, preachers, and the gadflies that show up at the city council meetings; the worldclass restauranteurs and bakers, the multigenerational shop owners, and the too many to mention fraternal and service organizations. Glen Cove is alive and will continue long after these words are forgotten. As I said, I love Glen Cove and Glen Cove is why I love America. It has diversity. It has history. And it has wonderful people. Glen Cove has offered opportunity to so many families, including mine. It is what makes America great. E pluribus unum, ‘‘out of many one.’’ Glen Cove has every type of ethnicity, religion, and income group. It enjoys low crime, low unemployment, and a robust community life. It works and it will continue to work. Happy anniversary and congratulations to my friends and neighbors. God bless our warm city with the cool sound, and God bless the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
TRUMP’S MOBILE SECURITY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. TEDLIEU) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I am here with Congressman RUBEN GALLEGO . I would like to talk about national security and how the President of the United States may be inadvertently giving away classified information. The President, through public reporting, shows that he is unwilling to swap out his cell phones. There is a big problem with this. Last term, I was involved with this flaw called the SS7 flaw. It is something that allows foreign powers and criminal syndicates affiliated with foreign powers to listen in on your cell phone just knowing your cell phone number, and there is no real good way to stop it. Our concern is that if the President finds it too inconvenient to deal with this issue of his cell phones, then his conversations could be listened in on by other foreign nations or by criminal syndicates. We also find this somewhat ironic and hypocritical when the Republican 
controlled Congress, last term, went to great lengths to talk about the potential damage of having a private email server for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This is a very similar concept. These are cell phones from which foreign powers can get the actual conversations of the President of the United States. We just want the White House, the Secret Service, and other agencies to talk to the President and say: Look, you just have to deal with operational security. You are their most highly valued target in terms of intelligence information that foreign powers want; and, please, for our national security, swap out your cell phones. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO ). Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I came down to the floor today to give a gentle reminder and a wakeup call to Chairman GOWDY and to Speaker R YAN. I know they have a lot going on. The Speaker is flying out to do a fundraiser today. But I want to make sure he actually understood that what we know, also from multiple media outlets, is that this President is using a phone that is potentially compromising national security. Rather than use the best, most secure communication technology in the world, President Trump just reaches into his pocket and pulls out his regular offtheshelf phone when he wants to discuss matters of state. Now, he can switch to another phone, a governmentprovided phone, one that is secure, and he can still even tweet from that phone, but, for some reason, he is still stuck on this phone that is a national security risk. Why would the leader of the free world, and our Commander in Chief, expose sensitive communication to foreign intelligence agencies? Why would he act in such a reckless, negligent manner? Well, according to news reports, the simple answer is that Donald Trump uses his personal cell phone because he just feels like it; it is more convenient for him. Forget the rules and forget the warnings from the military. He just does what he wants and ignores the consequences. I want to highlight this story for Chairman GOWDY and Speaker R YAN because I know they care deeply about data security at the highest level of our government. After all, when Secretary Clinton was found to have used her personal email server, they launched multiple, monthlong investigations. They spent millions of tax dollars conducting five emergency hearings, including four, coincidentally, right before the election, and ended up issuing more than 70 subpoenas. Their efforts helped generate huge amounts of media coverage. In one 6 day period, The New York Times ran as many cover stories about Hillary Clinton’s emails as they did about all of the policy issues combined in the 69 days leading up to the election. But now that President Trump’s widely irresponsible use of his personal cell phone has been exposed, now that we know he could be exposing America’s secrets to our gravest enemies, surely my Republican friends are going to be just as worried about data security as they were in the past and conduct some oversight. Surely, they will. They surely will demand and request all the documents, hold hearings, and question witnesses. Surely. They will want to get to the bottom of this scandal as soon as possible. Prior to the election, Chairman GOWDY explained to the reporters: 
This investigation is not about politics. This is not even about one individual. 
If it wasn’t about politics, and if it wasn’t just about stopping Hillary Clinton, the Speaker of the House and the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee should certainly feel interested in investigating the President’s cell phone use. And yet, coincidentally, they have been completely silent. Not one press statement, not one letter, not one word of warning to the White House. It is almost as if they have no interest in conducting real oversight of this President. It is almost as if they are more interested in helping this President than holding him accountable. It is almost as if this Republican Party has completely lost its moral compass under this President. Mr. Speaker, perhaps my good friend, Congressman TEDLIEU, could shed some light on more of these troubling issues for me. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman GALLEGO for his comments. Both of us served Active Duty in the United States military—Congressman GALLEGO served in combat—and we both know that one of the most important things to our military is operational security and protecting our communications and making sure that they are secure. b1115 Donald Trump is the Commander in Chief of our military. If there is anyone that needs to have their communications secure, it has got to be our Commander in Chief. Unfortunately, the President and the Republicans here that enable him are allowing him to have unsecured communications. That is really going to be harmful to our national security. This is not some sort of theoretical flaw that exists. The Federal Communications Commission has issued a report saying that this flaw where foreign powers can listen in on our cell phone communications is real, it exists. People have used it not just to listen in, but also to do nefarious things. A bank earlier this year lost millions of dollars because of this flaw. So, again, we urge the President and the Republicans here to change the President’s behavior, to do oversight on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I am going to conclude this segment. I thank you for listening. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. f
