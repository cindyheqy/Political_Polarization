Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor this year’s National Christmas Tree Contest winner who hails from my home county of Avery in North Carolina’s Fifth District, Mr. Larry Smith. This year, Mr. Smith won the national tree contest hosted by the National Christmas Tree Association, whose members have presented the official White House Christmas tree for display in the Blue Room since 1966. Growers must first win their local competitions in order to qualify for the association’s national contest. At the national competition, growers, industry experts, and consumers vote to choose the real Christmas tree grower who will provide the official White House Christmas tree. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent this year’s winner and was delighted to join Mr. Smith, his family and friends in presenting the First Family with its Fraser fir Christmas tree last week. As a former Christmas tree grower myself, I can attest to the importance of recognizing this often overlooked, yet highly significant, farming industry. Christmas trees have held a historic place in American family tradition since 1850. Long before artificial trees were around, real trees brought Christmas spirit into homes with their evergreen and fragrant branches during the season. Just as importantly, Christmas trees play a vital role in the North Carolina high country’s economy by providing jobs and livelihoods for thousands of North Carolinians. The Fifth District is one of the largest producers of live cut Christmas trees in the country, producing over 20 percent of the real Christmas trees in the United States. Representing over 95 percent of all species grown in the State, the North Carolina Fraser fir Christmas tree is the most popular Christmas tree in North America. It is shipped to every State in the U.S., as well as the Caribbean islands, Mexico, Canada, Bermuda, Japan, and other points all over the world. Congratulations once again to Mr. Smith, and thanks to Christmas tree growers across the country for contributing to our economy and providing the joy of having a real Christmas tree to families worldwide. ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS  
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share some good news with the House. Over a year and a half ago, we passed the Small Business Health Fairness Act. Small businesses were hit hard by flawed mandates, soaring costs, and limited choices under ObamaCare. The Education and the Workforce Committee worked hard to produce the Small Business Health Fairness Act, which expanded healthcare options and lowered costs for working families by encouraging small businesses to come together through association health plans and negotiate for lower costs on behalf of their employees. In October of last year, President Trump issued an executive order that built on the solutions in that bill, directing the Department of Labor to remove barriers and make association health plans a viable option for businesses and their employees. Well, it is working. In my home State of North Carolina, individuals in the hospitality industry will soon have access to a new association health plan that provides affordable, comprehensive coverage. Nearly half a million workers in North Carolina alone will have options they didn’t have before thanks to association health plans. In Oklahoma, chambers of commerce at the State and local level are working with some of the smallest businesses around to form association health plans and allow these talented individuals to keep doing what they really want to do, innovating and creating jobs only they will be able to create. Even farmers in Minnesota and Nebraska are finding ways to come together for better bargaining power that puts people and their healthcare choices first. Association health plans put people in charge. They empower small businesses to offer the same benefits that 
large companies can provide, and they allow employees to choose coverage options that work best for them. At the Education and the Workforce Committee, we have been proud to do our part to bring about this sustainable healthcare solution for millions of Americans. I welcome the news. 
RECOGNIZING PREMATURITY AWARENESS MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, November is Prematurity Awareness Month, and as the number of preterm births continues to rise in the United States, it is important to acknowledge this serious issue. In my own experience as an obstetrician having delivered over 5,000 babies, I have seen firsthand the seriousness of early birth. Premature birth is still the number one cause of infant mortality in the United States and around the world. Advancements in detection and care for infants born early have not made the same strides that other areas of the medical field have. The premature birth rate in Kansas is right below the national average of 9.93, meaning that approximately 1 in every 10 babies is born premature. In the coming weeks, Congress has the opportunity to act and pass the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act of 2018 and help those who cannot yet help themselves. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, this past holiday weekend, I had the pleasure, the opportunity, to travel to the Middle East and to the Horn of Africa. Specifically, I got to visit with some 700 Kansas National Guardsmen from the 2nd 137th Combined Arms Battalion and Battery C, 161st Field Artillery. These guardsmen have been deployed since April in support of Operation Enduring Freedom Spartan Shield. I am often asked what was the purpose of my trip. Why do Congressmen do these trips? First of all, I think it is important that, as a Congressman, I bring these troops a message of hope and thanks and let them know personally that we do care and are grateful for their service and the sacrifices they are making for this country. Next, my goal was to check on the mental and physical wellbeing of our troops. Despite talking to hundreds of our soldiers, I cannot get one of them to register one complaint. Specifically, I thought their mental health was outstanding, that they were all in good spirits and, indeed, had great hope. Physically, their nutrition appeared to be well attended to. Their medical and dental needs were well attended to as well. My one concern, perhaps, would be the housing. And though no soldier complained about housing, when you are there for a year at a time, I do think we could supply our soldiers with better housing. Today, we are reminded of the dangers of serving in our military as we lost three soldiers to a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. Certainly, my sympathy goes out to the families. I know the words that I can express will never be enough, but I would say this: Today we are also reminded once again that freedom is not free. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MAJOR BRENT RUSSELL TAYLOR The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, Major Brent Russell Taylor is one of six brothers to each wear the uniform of the United States Army. While training Afghan security forces in support of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, Major Taylor was killed by an apparent insider attack on November 3 in Kabul province while in the final months of his deployment. He is survived by his wife, Jennie, and seven children: Megan, Lincoln, Alex, Jacob, Ellie, Jonathan, and Caroline. In Utah, we mourn with the family of Major Taylor and grieve his loss and honor his sacrifice. As Major Taylor and his brothers passed through Basic Combat Training, they learned the seven Army values in great detail. Those values are loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage, and Major Brent Taylor lived these values. First, loyalty: Major Taylor swore to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and support and defend our Nation’s guiding documents against all enemies. He demonstrated his loyalty to this oath time and time again. Duty: Major Taylor earned a Bronze Star for his outstanding dedication to duty during combat operations in Iraq. The Army says doing your duty means more than carrying out your assigned tasks. Major Taylor’s military service record shows he employed this guidance to the fullest. So, too, does his life outside the military, because Major Taylor was not only Major Taylor, he was also Mayor Taylor. His community and neighbors so entrusted him to lead and provide that they elected him the mayor of North Ogden City in Utah. In that role, he did much more than carry out his assigned tasks. He worked to beautify and improve the city and to create a community that was welcoming to newcomers; and in the predawn morning of his last Christmas on Earth, Mayor Taylor ventured out into the cold to oversee the snowplows and salt trucks as they cleared the roads and made his city safe. Respect: Major Taylor not only enjoyed the respect of his family, community, and fellow servicemembers, but his praises came from across the globe. In a letter from Afghanistan to Mrs. Taylor following her husband’s death, an Afghan aviator said: ‘‘Your husband taught me to . . . treat my children as treasured gifts, to be a better father, to be a better husband, and to be a better man.’’ A man does not receive that level of praise without first showing his own grand measure of respect. Selfless service: As a high school senior in Chandler, Arizona, Brent delivered the honor speech at graduation, and his instruction to the audience was: ‘‘Go out. Be happy. Find peace and make a positive difference in the world.’’ Major Taylor left his family and American soil on four deployments to serve and ‘‘make a positive difference in the world.’’ In that same honor speech, he gave the order to ‘‘stick with it to the end.’’ He, himself, did just that. Honor: Major Taylor honored his faith, his family, his community, and his country throughout his short life. Brent’s social media postings are replete with photos of his children and family. They show images of love and service and patriotism, qualities of a man, a husband, and a father who honors his family and country. In his last Facebook post, Brent implored that we all remember: ‘‘We have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us.’’ And he ended the post with the words, ‘‘God Bless America.’’ Integrity: The Army says that integrity is a quality you develop by adhering to moral principles, and the more choices you make based on integrity, the more this highly prized value will affect your relationships with family and friends. The days since the sad passing of Major Taylor have been filled with an outpouring of love and grief expressed by those who knew Brent. His integrity left an impression, and his integrity affected his relationships. Finally, personal courage: In September of 2007, Major Taylor was commanding a convoy in Iraq when he was hit by an insurgent IED. His vehicle was struck by shrapnel, asphalt, and concrete debris. For the wounds received in action, Major Taylor was awarded the Purple Heart, and he would go on to deploy twice more. Brent Taylor stood as an example of personal courage. He lived the Army Values. In April of this year, the Department of Veterans Affairs opened a facility in North Ogden City. It is a place where veterans and their families can go to receive counseling and support. It is a place located in the heart of Brent Taylor’s hometown. As a small gesture to his service and his sacrifice, I have introduced a bill to name that VA facility the ‘‘Major Brent Taylor Vet Center Outstation.’’ The naming of a building will never repay the debt our Nation owes Major Taylor or his family, but it can stand as a humble reminder of the citizen soldier who lost his life in the service of others. 
b1215 BORDER SECURITY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, in the coming days, this House will debate the importance of securing our border with Mexico. This should not be a controversial debate. Every nation has the right to secure its borders. There are, indeed, differences among nations from the type of government to the freedoms and liberties a country’s people enjoy, and borders define where these begin and end. Borders also allow countries to determine who and, as important, what is allowed to enter into respective nations. It is this latter point, Mr. Speaker, given the historical context in which the United States and Mexico find themselves, that impels not only the United States but also Mexico to ensure that we have a secure border. There are certain products, namely dangerous narcotics, being made in and shipped through Mexico that we do not want in the United States, and there are items such as illicit cash from drug sales that Mexico does not want imported from the United States. Yes, we are concerned about knowing the identity of individuals coming into our country, and we need to be vetting each individual seeking admission to the United States. But it is the illicit drug trade, which is responsible for taking tens of thousands of lives on both sides of the border, that makes beyond urgent the securing of the U.S. Mexico border. Ninety percent of the heroin used in our country comes from Mexico. Fentanyl, methamphetamines, cocaine, and marijuana also flow across the border in staggering amounts. These poisons destroy lives and result in billions of dollars of illicit cash flowing to transnational criminal organizations on the Mexican side of the border. These organizations are described best in one word: evil. Over the last decade, Mexican drug cartels have been responsible for deaths of thousands of Mexicans, and their exports have killed thousands of Americans. Mexico prosecutes relatively few of the murders that occur on its soil. The cartels kill with impunity. They kill Catholic priests. They kill journalists. They kill students. They kill politicians. They have killed U.S. agents. And they kill each other. The rule of law has been replaced in many Mexican states with the law of violence, revenge, and brutal force. Headlines over the past 2 years tell the story: National Catholic Register, May 22, 2018: ‘‘Why Is Mexico the Deadliest Place to Be a Priest?’’ The New York Times, December 21, 2017: ‘‘Most Lethal to Journalists: 1. War Zones 2. Mexico.’’ CNN, July 2, 2018: ‘‘Mexico goes to the polls . . . 132 politicians have been killed since campaigning began.’’ The Wall Street Journal, November 14, 2018: ‘‘‘It’s a Crisis of Civilization in Mexico.’ 250,000 Dead. 37,400 Missing.’’ Progress against the cartels has been too slow, but there have been some encouraging developments. The trial of the alleged head of the Sinaloa cartel, Joaquin ‘‘El Chapo’’ Guzman, is underway in New York. Within the last month, the Department of Justice indicted individuals affiliated with the Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel, but those individuals remain at large. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration also recently announced it was joining with State and local officials in Chicago specifically to go after Mexican cartels, which have played a role in the violence that plagues that community, a community that is 1,500 miles from the border. In announcing the action, the DEA said: ‘‘There is no single entity or solution that can stop the flow of dangerous illicit drugs like heroin and fentanyl into Chicago or to keep them from harming the citizens of this great city. . . . To be clear, these drugs are being produced, manufactured, and trafficked by various Mexican cartels to numerous parts of the United States and elsewhere in the world.’’ Yes, Mr. Speaker, the border issue does not just affect California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. It affects the entire Nation, including my district in western Pennsylvania. Our two countries have not done enough to combat the epidemic of drugs and violence. It is an epidemic that has left mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters on both sides of the border steeped in grief. There is no single solution to this evil. But one tool is available, and that is the force of our will. It is an act of the will to stop the transfer of drugs northbound into the United States and the transfer of illicit cash southbound into Mexico. A secure border is a necessary prerequisite to this end. That secure border requires not only, where appropriate, physical barriers. It also requires significantly increased capacity for inspecting vehicles traveling between the United States and Mexico at our ports of entry. More inspection lanes, more equipment, and more personnel were prescribed in the Securing America’s Future Act. If we are serious about securing the border, that bill should accompany any appropriations language we pass this month. As the 115th Congress draws to a close, let us take one more vital step to ending the drug crisis and bring peace to Mexico and communities across the United States. Mr. Speaker, let’s secure our border. 
b1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. WILLIAMS ) at 2 p.m. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. You have blessed us with all good gifts, and this past week, with thankful hearts, we gathered with family and loved ones throughout this great land to celebrate our blessings together. Bless the newly elected Members of the 116th Congress who resume their orientation on Capitol Hill. Give them calm and confidence as they prepare for a new role as servants of our Nation’s citizens. Bless the Members of the people’s House who have been entrusted with the privilege to serve our Nation and all Americans in their need. Grant them to work together in respect and affection, faithful in the responsibilities they have been given. As the end of the 115th Congress approaches, bestow upon them the gifts of wisdom and discernment, that in their actions, they will do justice, love with mercy, and walk humbly with You. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CURTIS ) 
come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. CURTIS led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
AIKEN SCHOLARS ACADEMY (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the recent opening of the Aiken Scholars Academy, an academic school of excellence that offers students an engaging educational experience. It is the result of a partnership between the University of South Carolina Aiken and Aiken County Public School District. Aiken Scholars Academy, led by Principal Martha Messick, is one of only 1,500 schools worldwide to implement the Advanced Placement Capstone diploma program. This is an innovative program that provides students the opportunity to develop skills for college success, including research, collaboration, and communication. The curriculum was developed with feedback from higher education faculty and college admission officers. At the Aiken Scholars Academy, teachers have the flexibility to cover local, regional, national, and global topics relevant to their students, with a wide variety of themes. This provides for effective collaboration and innovation welcomed by Chancellor Sandra Jordan. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
TEXAS RANGERS: ONE RIOT, ONE RANGER (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, they have been the focus of legend and lore, portrayed on radio shows and the silver screen. It was this month, in 1835, the new Republic of Texas officially created a law enforcement force of three companies, 56 men each, known as the Texas Rangers. The Rangers wear a star made out of a Mexican cinco pesos coin on their western dress, with, of course, the ubiquitous cowboy hat. Captain Bill McDonald said it best: ‘‘No man in the wrong can stand up against a fellow that’s in the right and keeps on acomin’.’’ They are the oldest law enforcement agency in North America with statewide jurisdiction. These Texas lawmen have always had a certain swagger and a certain awe about them. Legendary Ranger ‘‘RIP,’’ rest in peace, Ford said this: ‘‘They did right because it was right.’’ And when the Dallas mayor needed to call in the big guns to prevent an illegal prizefight, Captain McDonald answered the call. As the story is told, the mayor asked: ‘‘Where are the other rangers?’’ McDonald replied: ‘‘Hell, ain’t I enough? There’s only one prizefight.’’ Texas Rangers: One riot, one ranger. And that is just the way it is. f 
MIRACLE MOUNTAIN (Mr. CURTIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, in Utah, wildfires are disastrous events that don’t just cause property damage. They can substantially disrupt the lives of families and have, unfortunately, become far too common in the West. Last month, Mayor Ellis of Elk Ridge reached out to me with a remarkable story from his community. In September, the Bald Mountain fire threatened Elk Ridge, nearly claiming countless homes. However, instead of burning into the sea, the fire suddenly halted, stayed behind the mountain, and spared the community. Mayor Ellis told me that after this remarkable event, many locals began to refer to the peak as ‘‘Miracle Mountain.’’ He then asked if we could commemorate this event by naming the mountain, and I happily took up the task. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to sponsor legislation, the Miracle Mountain Designation Act, supported by the entire Utah House delegation and Governor Herbert to name this mountain ‘‘Miracle Mountain.’’ Mr. Speaker, I hope this bill, once passed, will memorialize an event of great significance in this community. 
b1610 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. BYRNE ) at 4 o’clock and 10 minutes p.m. 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT A message in writing from the President of the United States was communicated to the House by Ms. Mariel Ridgway, one of his secretaries. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 1768) to reauthorize and amend the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1768 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act of 2018’’. 
Section 8 of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 (42 U.S.C. 7705b) is amended to read as follows: 
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on S. 1768, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1768, the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act of 2018. The bill before us is the same text of H.R. 6650, the bill I introduced in the House earlier this year to reauthorize a Federal program that improves America’s earthquake preparedness, and which the Senate agreed to accept as the final agreement. With a little indulgence, I might then say that this would be the RohrabacherFeinstein Earthquake bill. That is the way it goes. For 40 years the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, NEHRP, has supported efforts to assess and monitor earthquake hazards and risks across our Nation. Four Federal agencies coordinate their earthquake activities under this program: the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Science Foundation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. These agencies assess earthquake hazards, deliver notifications of seismic events, develop measures to reduce earthquake hazards, and conduct research to help reduce overall American vulnerability to earthquakes. The Congress last reviewed and reauthorized the program in 2004, and that law expired in 2009. Although Congress continues to appropriate funds for this important work, the legislation before us makes long overdue changes to modernize the program and make it more effective. The bill removes outdated language related to earthquake prediction and instead emphasizes the continued development of an earthquake early warning system. The bill also reduces various administrative burdens for Federal agencies, burdens that are disruptive to the essential mission of the program. Our approach also improves data sharing between these agencies. Finally, the legislation provides a 5 year authorization for appropriations at the current funding level. In my home State of California, we understand the omnipresent threat of another massive earthquake. According to the USGS, California has a 99 percent chance of being devastated by a magnitude 6.7 earthquake, or an even larger one, in the next 30 years. That is the same power as the 1994 Northridge earthquake which killed 57 people, injured more than 8,700 others, and caused damages of up to $50 billion, making it one of the costliest disasters in American history. California is not alone. Close to 75 million people in 39 States face significant risk from earthquakes. By being prepared for future disasters we reduce our potential loss of life and property for those who would suffer those consequences. I want to thank Senators DIANNE  FEINSTEIN and L ISAMURKOWSKI who introduced this bill in the Senate, as well as Representative PRAMILA JAYAPAL  who joined me in introducing the bill in this House. I want to thank the leadership of the House Natural Resources Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for working with us to bring this bill to the floor. Although the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has primary jurisdiction and we were given superb leadership by our current chairman, these committees and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology do share jurisdiction over the agencies in this program. Mr. Speaker, let me again express my deep appreciation for the leadership on the other side of the aisle, but especially now that we are going to be losing our chairman, for the great job that he has done as chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I look forward to working with the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology as the bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, BILLSHUSTER , Chairman. 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support S. 1768 to reauthorize the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program. I want to thank Senators FEINSTEIN  and MURKOWSKI for developing this good legislation. I also would like to thank my colleagues, Representatives ROHRABACHER and J AYAPAL , for introducing a House companion, and the chairs and ranking members of the authorizing committees for working to arrive at the consensus legislation we are considering today. The years 1964 and 1994 mark two of the worst earthquakes in U.S. history. Hundreds of people lost their lives, and thousands sustained injuries in these earthquakes that hit Alaska and the Northridge neighborhood of Los Angeles. Economic losses were in the billions of dollars resulting from earthquakes and tsunamis. While our Nation has been in the path of many disastrous natural events lately, we have been spared from a big earthquake for many years. But we should not become complacent, because another big earthquake will happen, and the human and economic toll will be felt far beyond the immediate disaster zone. S. 1768 makes Federal investments in research and preparedness activities that will help mitigate earthquake risks for Americans from coast to coast. Specifically, S. 1768 reauthorizes funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to continue to carry out research and other activities under the NEHRP program. Under NEHRP, NSF and USGS carry out fundamental research in the earth sciences. Both agencies have extensive networks of instrumentation that record seismic activity and advance our understanding of the onset, propagation, and intensity of earthquakes. Such research helps advance our early warning capability and helps communities make informed decisions for earthquake preparation. NIST is the lead agency for NEHRP and also carries out applied research that provides the scientific basis for earthquake resilient building codes and design guidelines. This bill aims to help communities survive a catastrophic event and continue with critical operations, such as emergency services, utilities, and communication networks. FEMA provides earthquake training and awareness to States and territories and assists communities in creating seismic mitigation plans in the event of a highimpact earthquake. These activities are invaluable in preparing communities for an earthquake and its aftermath. The last NEHRP reauthorization was nearly 15 years ago, and the authorizing law needs several updates to ensure it is keeping pace with the state of the science on earthquakes and translating that science into saving lives and property. The bill before us today includes those muchneeded updates and, importantly, provides NEHRP agencies with the needed authority to continue these investments with greater budgetary certainty for the next 5 years. I appreciate my colleagues working on this bill in a bipartisan fashion in the House and Senate, and I urge support for this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. SMITH), who is the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the gentleman from California, my friend and colleague, for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I support S. 1768, the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act of 2018. The final text of the legislation we are considering today was first introduced by Representative DANA ROHRABACHER as H.R. 6650 in August. Representative ROHRABACHER , an active and valued senior member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, led efforts to improve the original Senate bill and authorize some additional funding to advance earthquake monitoring and earlywarning systems that are critical to his home State of California. It has been 15 years since the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program was last reauthorized. This legislation modernizes earthquake safety programs 
that help States prepare for and respond to earthquakes. The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act is a result of bipartisan collaboration and work with the relevant agencies, congressional committees, private sector and State agency stakeholders. I want to thank Representative ROHRABACHER for his initiative on moving the bill forward and working across the aisle and across the Capitol with Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN to get it across the finish line. b1630 I also want to congratulate him for his 30 years of service to the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee; the Congress; and his constituents. Since joining the committee in 1989, he has been a dedicated advocate for our Nation’s space exploration programs, energy research and innovation, and preparing our Nation for natural hazards. I encourage my colleagues to support S. 1768 and send it to the President’s desk. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. We Californians know what suffering happens when you are unprepared for a wildfire. We have learned that lesson very tragically just recently. There is no need for us to suffer by being unprepared for the next earthquake. That is what this is all about. I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and especially thank the chairman for the fact that we have worked together in a way that is really going to have a positive impact on so many people by preventing them from having to suffer what we have seen recently in the wildfires in California. Mr. Speaker, although there is often disagreement in the people’s House, we should never overlook those many areas of concurrence. There are those who believe that human activity, for example, is causing a cataclysmic jump in the temperature of the planet. Others, however, disagree with this analysis and, thus, oppose policies that restrict human activities and drive up the cost of living a decent life. This issue has been a tumultuous division. However, there are so many other areas in which we can and will focus on, not just in terms of what our committee does, but on which we have a wide acceptance on where precautionary measures are justified and needed. Research in understanding how buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure react to earthquakes is an example of something that I expect that we all agree on. We can see that even here in this debate. I will not be here next year, but I wanted to mention just a few other sciencerelated areas where bipartisan action could be effective and where the costs of prevention are minimal as compared to the potential damage. These are things that we have worked on but have not come to a conclusion. Both the chairman and I won’t be here next year, but I thought I would mention them. For example, I hope there can be real progress made in the next few years when it comes to the protection of our planet from astroids and comets, which have caused massive damage—even extinction—over the last 250 million years. Although we are searching in space near and far for these objects now, we have not organized or put in place the means to divert them or eliminate a threatening object when it is observed heading in our direction. Another common ground issue should be protecting our space assets from orbital debris, which is basically a man made minefield in space. We rely on our spacebased assets for defense, science, farming, a huge portion of our commerce, and even for navigating your car to a local market. There are many other plans for new satellite constellations and new expectations for increased numbers of people visiting space. Thus, we will be expanding, hopefully, observation and monitoring of what is going on with the planet for the benefit of the people of the planet. But none of these uses of space will ever be put to work for bettering our lives unless we deal with the debris issue. If we are not protecting our spacebased assets, we are risking our future, our way of life, our security, and our prosperity. I am sorry we did not get this done. It was a bipartisan effort. We just didn’t get that, among all the things we were working on this Congress. But I hope the next Congress will succeed and will focus on those two issues where we can cooperate in a very bipartisan way. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the moving forward of S. 1768, the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act of 2018. May we always be prepared to deal with natural disasters, thus protecting our people from needless tragedies. We will always live with the potential of a severe earthquake, but we can minimize the loss and suffering. That is what we are doing here with this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the bill being signed into law by the President by the end of the year, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1768, the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act. This bill will reauthorize seismological research and warning systems through Fiscal Year 2022. Congress established the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) to carry out a longterm, interagency earthquake research program. NEHRP focuses on earthquake warning, hazard reduction, and minimizing loss after earthquakes. Earthquake early warning systems can provide several additional seconds of warning before the strongest ground shaking arrives, enough to save lives and protect critical infrastructure. In Northwest Oregon, it is not a question of if, but when, an earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone will hit our state. The U.S. Geological Survey, in collaboration with the University of Oregon, the University of Washington, Caltech, and University of California, Berkley, developed ShakeAlert, an early earthquake warning system. The technology has been tested and is proven to work effectively. Federal investments in these programs are critical. Although it is difficult if not impossible to know when and where the next large earthquake will occur, we must do everything that we can to prepare ourselves and our communities to mitigate destruction and save lives. Reauthorizing NEHRP is an important step in recognizing the science behind earthquakes and other natural disasters such as tsunamis and landslides. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1768. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
REDESIGNATING A FACILITY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology be discharged from further consideration of the bill (S. 3389) to redesignate a facility of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3389 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. REDESIGNATION OF NASA INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION FACILITY. 
The bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
GLOBAL FRAGILITY AND VIOLENCE REDUCTION ACT OF 2018 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5273) to reduce global fragility and violence by improving the capacity of the United States to reduce and address the causes of violence, violent conflict, and fragility in pilot countries, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5273 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act of 2018’’. 
AGENCY .—The term ‘‘relevant Federal department or agency’’ means the Department of the Treasury and any other Federal department or agency the President determines is relevant to carry out the purposes of this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, since the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States has committed lives and treasure to help stabilize countries plagued by conflict and insecurity. We undertake these efforts because unchecked instability abroad threatens our economic, humanitarian, and security interests here at home. Of course, the United States cannot achieve its objectives alone. We need to coordinate with willing and able partners. We need to engage local leaders, empower civil society, and work with the private sector. We need to improve coordination among our own national security agencies to ensure they are working together to advance clearly defined objectives and eliminate duplication and waste. Through this process, they learn and adapt. Last June, the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Department of Defense released a security assistance review that set out a framework to improve U.S. security assistance programs, including stabilization. The legislation we are considering today builds on that effort. This legislation requires the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Administrator of USAID, the Secretary of Defense, and the heads of other relevant Federal departments and agencies, to develop a comprehensive initiative to address global violence and instability. Within 6 months, the Secretary of State will submit to Congress an implementation plan that sets out clear goals and objectives, identifies priority countries and regions, defines the roles and responsibilities of each U.S. department and agency, and describes efforts to improve coordination and private sector engagement. Then, building off that initial survey, the Secretary will submit to Congress a 10year implementation plan for each identified priority country and region that aligns the diplomatic, development, and security activities of the United States. Mr. Speaker, this is a timely bill that will help ensure the effective use of U.S. foreign assistance, reduce violence and insecurity abroad, and keep America safe. It enjoys bipartisan support. And it just makes sense. I would like to thank the sponsors— Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL ; the chairman of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade Subcommittee, TEDPOE; the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, MIKE MCCAUL; BILLKEATING of Massachusetts—and their bipartisan cosponsors for their work on this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. I am proud to have authored this bipartisan piece of legislation, and I thank Chairman ROYCE for his leadership in bringing it to the floor. I also want to thank Congressmen POE, MCCAUL, KEATING , and A DAM SMITH for joining me as original cosponsors. Around the world, levels of violence are at a 25year high, driving massive instability. This is a global security threat, as fragile, unstable states are breeding grounds for criminals and terrorists. There is a significant economic toll as well. Violence and instability undercut American investment and development efforts, and cost the global economy nearly $15 trillion a year. But probably worst of all, this violence and instability has created a humanitarian catastrophe. The world now faces an unprecedented refugee crisis: 68.5 million people have left their homes. This is the highest level ever recorded. Naturally, we need to do more to end this violence and instability, and prevent it from happening in the first place. Over the years, we have learned a lot about what works to stabilize conflicts and prevent violence from breaking out. We need to update our government policies to implement those lessons. This bill does just that by establishing an initiative to reduce fragility and violence, and to align American policy and programs with best practices. It will require the State Department, USAID, and the Department of Defense to coordinate their diplomatic, development, and security activities, with a focus on at least six priority countries or regions. It also requires innovative approaches to coordinate our work with partners, measure results, and adapt to changing conditions. Finally, it mandates robust oversight to ensure our efforts are implemented effectively. b1645 The Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act is an important step in thwarting many of the most devastating crises facing the world right 
now and preventing new ones from emerging in the future. I am very happy to have authored this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in passing it today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas, Judge TEDPOE, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my strong support for this legislation of which I am an original cosponsor. I was proud to work alongside Ranking Member ENGEL , Mr. ADAM SMITH, Mr. M CCAUL, and Representative KEATING on this legislation. Around the globe today, Mr. Speaker, fractured nations are struggling with conflict, violence, and a range of other challenges that degrade security and prevent their internal development. Weak states and ungoverned places anywhere in the world provide opportunities for terrorism and instability to flourish. As a result, these fragile states become national security concerns for our country. Mr. Speaker, we need to solve problems in a smarter way so we don’t have to constantly deploy America’s sons and daughters into harm’s way to fight more foreign wars. The United States has been at war consistently for over 17 straight years. Maybe it is time we rethink our philosophy of constant military involvement throughout the globe as a first response to turmoil and unrest. We need to address the underlying root causes of instability: treat the disease, not just the symptoms. That is what this bill will do. It will require the development of a wholeofgovernment approach to targeting root causes of instability and conflict in the world’s most fragile regions before they require military interventions by the United States. Instead of parallel efforts that often respond to conflict with shortterm solutions, this bill will require long term, coordinated strategies that make our foreign assistance dollars more effective. It will allow Congress to have more oversight of those foreign aid dollars. The money we spend abroad must be designed to solve problems, not endlessly consume resources by military conflict. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member ENGEL for his leadership on this critical issue. I do urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I also want to take a moment to thank Ranking Member ENGEL for his friendship and support and his work on the Foreign Affairs Committee since I have been on the committee. I also want to thank Chairman ROYCE , who will also be leaving Congress at the end of this session, for his work. As we have said numerous times, if more committees would work in a bipartisan way to solve a specific goal— the longterm interests of the United States being that goal—I think things would be better here in the House. But I want to thank both of these Members for their relationship with me and for working so hard to help America solve these international problems in a bipartisan way. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE) who just spoke, I think it is very appropriate now, as the Congress is moving to an end, to thank him for his hard work and for his good friendship. He really is a Member’s Member and is really indicative of the bipartisan showing that we had for many, many years on the Foreign Affairs Committee. We are going to miss the gentleman on the committee, and we hope he will continue to watch us and call us and keep in touch with us because he truly is a fine Member and someone whom I am really proud to call my friend. And if I may so say, and that is just the way it is. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill I wrote with Mr. ENGEL , my good friend, the Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act. Mr. Speaker, one of our greatest national security challenges is preventing violent conflict around the world. Violent conflict creates hostile environments and displaces and deprives citizens. It costs the global economy over $14 trillion annually. They also provide fertile recruiting grounds for terrorist groups and transnational criminal organizations, which I have tracked in my role as chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security. Often, these environments thrive in states that are fragile, where the government loses legitimacy in the eyes of its own people and, ultimately, its ability to govern. When ignored, these breakdowns in a government ultimately can lead to lengthy and costly involvement by the United States. That is why, today, Congressman ENGEL and I are proposing an innovative, new way of thinking about these challenges. The Global Fragility and Violence Reduction Act requires the administration to launch an initiative to reduce this fragility and violence. This will guide our efforts to reduce violent conflict and help fragile states down a path towards stability. This bill also requires the Department of State, in coordination with USAID and the Department of Defense, to identify 10 countries or regions as a pilot program to start this new initiative. This initiative ensures local partnerships are at the core of any solution in order to deliver better longterm results. Since each fragile state is different, this initiative is flexible to address the causes of fragility. What may work to solve the economic and migration issues of Venezuela are likely to be different than the solutions needed to help curb terrorist groups in west Africa. By integrating the Department of State, USAID, and DOD together and prioritizing, we are reshaping how we think about how we deliver aid and development resources, preventing them from spiraling into chaos. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank, again, the ranking member; I would like to thank Chairman ROYCE for his friendship, as well as Mr. POEand Mr. SMITH; and I hope everybody will attend the chairman’s portrait unveiling at the National Archives this evening. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank the bipartisan group of lawmakers who worked with me on this bill—Mr. POE, Mr. M CCAUL—and I thank Chairman ROYCE for his leadership, as always. After 17 years of war with no end in sight, we should all be able to understand the value of preventing conflicts before they start. We have learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t when it comes to stabilizing conflicts and preventing violence from breaking out. This bill applies those lessons to American policy. By addressing the root causes of violence, we get closer to a safer and more stable, prosperous world. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the passage of this measure. I encourage my colleagues to do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking Mr. ENGEL , the author of this measure, and I express my deep appreciation for his help in all that we have undertaken with our committee. There are, as ELIOT knows, 70 million men, women, and children who have been displaced by conflict around this globe. While the United States is the most generous provider of humanitarian assistance, it is really true that no amount of tents and sheeting will stop the suffering and the misery that these people feel. We need solutions to get at the roots of these problems, and the legislation we are considering today helps us down the right path to do that. While it does not obligate the United States to take on stabilization efforts, it does provide the framework for improved coordination so that we can be more strategic, more efficient, and more effective with our diplomatic development and security assistance. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5273, as amended. 
The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
UNITED STATESMEXICO ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP ACT Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1567) to promote economic partnership and cooperation between the United States and Mexico, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1567 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United StatesMexico Economic Partnership Act’’. 
REGION .—The term ‘‘covered United States Mexico border region’’ means those portions of the United States and Mexico that are within 100 kilometers of the international boundary between those countries. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative CUELLAR and Representative CASTRO as well as the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. ENGEL , and the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, MIKEMCCAUL, for their work on the legislation that we are considering here today. The United States and Mexico share strong economic and cultural ties. As our neighbor to the south, a strong, stable Mexico benefits the United States. Realizing this, we already have many professional and educational exchanges between our two countries to help see that young people in Mexico graduate from school and enter the workforce with the skills, the credentials, and the experience that they need in the 21st century. In the 2015–2016 school year, 5,000 U.S. students studied abroad in Mexico while 16,000 Mexican students studied in the U.S. They did this through various exchange programs. These are good numbers, true, but more can be done to ensure that our young people are taking advantage of existing opportunities to study in both countries, and this bill builds on existing programs to expand and strengthen these exchanges. In particular, the bill focuses on exchanges in four important areas, and these are higher education, medical school, entrepreneurship, and the energy sector. These are all areas from which the U.S. and Mexico stand to mutually benefit from greater cooperation. There are, of course, areas in which the U.S.Mexico relationship can improve. For example, Mexico needs to do more to combat the rampant corruption that has taken its toll on its citizens’ trust. But this does not mean that our two countries cannot work together to ensure a brighter, more successful future for young people in both of our countries. Educational and professional exchanges are key to that goal, so I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure. This is a good bill. I 
thank its authors and Chairman R OYCE  for bringing it forward. I will discuss its merits in a moment because I can’t, in good conscience, stand on the House floor and talk about our economic partnership with Mexico and not speak for a moment on what is happening right now on our southern border. The President tweeted that the migrants seeking asylum in our country are stonecold criminals. I have seen the images, and I don’t see stonecold criminals. I see children with bare feet. I see hungry mothers. I see toddlers in diapers. I see desperate fathers. And I see tear gas being lobbed from the United States into Mexico. The President says not to worry. He says it is a very safe sort of tear gas. The American people aren’t stupid. The American people know what this country stands for. They know we are a nation of immigrants. They know that America doesn’t kick people when they are down or slam the door on those fleeing poverty and violence. I hope the President gets the message. Now, the measure before us deals with our incredibly important relationship with our neighbor to the south, Mexico. Mexico is our close friend and ally, our third largest trading partner, and a country with which we share extraordinarily close cultural and person toperson ties. This bill builds on the Obama administration’s 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative by requiring the Secretary of State to expand the exchange programs that allow our students and business leaders to share and learn from each other. There is no better way to advance the future of our bilateral ties than by allowing young people and professionals to experience what makes each of our countries unique. It is also critical that we send a strong message to the Mexican people that the United States Congress will not walk away from them, despite any damage done to our relationship over the past several years. As I have said many times in the Foreign Affairs Committee and on the House floor, the United States should be in the business of building bridges, not walls, to our friends in Mexico. The timing of this legislation could not be more ideal. b1700 Mr. Speaker, 4 days from now, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will be sworn in as President of Mexico. By passing this measure today, the House of Representatives is recommitting itself to our bilateral relationship. We are sending a loud and clear message that the prosperity of our countries’ futures depends on an enduring U.S. Mexico relationship. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR ), the author of this bill. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. ENGEL , for yielding to me and also for his leadership in helping to bring this bill to the floor. I thank him and his staff for the wonderful work that they have done. I also thank Chairman ROYCE and his staff for their leadership. I, with both Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL , spoke a lot about this bill and why it is important that we pass this particular bill. I thank my colleagues, Representative CASTRO and Representative P OE, who helped on this bill. I thank them for their work on the committee, and also Representative MCCAUL for signing on as a bipartisan measure. In fact, in the next few days, on Friday, Representative MCCAUL, myself, and a delegation will be going over to Mexico for the swearing in. I think this is a very appropriate time, as Mr. ENGEL mentioned, to have this bill to send this positive message. This bill is important in many ways. It is bipartisan legislation that promotes mutual national security interests and economic partnership and cooperation between the United States and Mexico, with a focus on the energy, health, entrepreneurship, and education sectors. Mexico is one of the United States’ top trading partners, with an estimated $615 billion in twoway trade between those two countries, which means that every day there is more than $1.3 billion of trade between the U.S. and Mexico. That means that every single minute you are talking about more than $1 million of trade between the U.S. and Mexico, and this is why it is very important to have this type of relationship. As the chairman mentioned a few minutes ago, in the 2015–2016 academic year, according to the Institute of International Education, more than 56,000 United States students studied in other countries in the Western Hemisphere, while more than 84,000 nonU.S. students from that region studied in the U.S. However, there are only 5,000 of those United States students who studied in Mexico, and only 16,000 of those non U.S. students were from Mexico. This is why we need to do more to increase our educational exchange with our very important trading partner. Specifically, this bill establishes that it should be the policy of the United States to continue deepening the economic cooperation between the United States and Mexico and to expand the educational and professional exchange programs with our neighbors to the south. In order to do this, it would require the Secretary of State to develop a strategy that: One, encourages more economic exchanges between the two countries at the secondary, postsecondary, and postgraduate levels, especially with communities in the southern border region; Two, encourages the United States and Mexican academic institutions and businesses to collaborate to train aspiring entrepreneurs; Three, promotes energy infrastructure coordination and cooperation through the support of vocational education, internships, and exchanges between both countries; and Four, assesses the feasibility of fostering binational partnerships between universities and medical school and nursing programs, and that is a natural fit that we can do with that particular neighbor to the south. So, again, if we increase economic exchanges at universities that we have in Texas and across California and New Mexico and Arizona and other parts, that basically means that we will better prepare our students for success in the workplace and increase job opportunities for those areas and the small businesses along the border. Again, to conclude, I thank the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Chairman EDROYCE . He is very passionate about Mexico, and I thank him for that passion. I thank Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL again. He is very passionate. I think this is something that we feel is very important about Mexico, and I thank him for advancing this bill through the committee. And, again, to the staff, both on the Republican side and on the Democratic side, I thank them. So, to conclude, I encourage my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation, and I look forward to seeing this bill pass into law. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I close by again emphasizing the importance of the U.S.Mexico relationship. For so many years, this relationship was characterized by mistrust. That has changed over the past two decades. As just one example, bilateral cooperation on counternarcotics is now the norm and led to the extradition of drug kingpin El Chapo Guzman to the United States in the last hours of the Obama administration. He is on trial now in an American court. Mr. Speaker, 20 years ago, it would have been hard to imagine coming to the House floor in support of a bipartisan bill on educational exchanges with Mexico. Now a bill like this will glide through the House with little opposition. But we cannot take this cooperation for granted. Far too much is at stake to allow the bilateral relationship between the United States and Mexico to deteriorate. There is a new government, a new leader of Mexico coming in, and I hope we can very swiftly establish the good relationship that our two countries have and not dwell on some of the recent discussions and problems involving a wall or anything else. 
So I thank my colleagues for joining me in supporting this legislation to double down on the successes in the U.S.Mexico partnership. I thank Chairman ROYCE , I thank the sponsors of this bill, I thank Mr. CUELLAR , and I thank all our colleagues for supporting this bill. I urge its immediate passage. The U.S.Mexico partnership is one of our most important partnerships, and the House of Representatives ought to be doing everything it can to enhance that relationship, and that is one of the things we are doing by passing this bill today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to again stress that this is one of America’s most important relationships. I would also like to stress my appreciation for the work of Congressman HENRY CUELLAR not just on this bill, but on the overall relationship with Mexico. I have had the opportunity to work with him in the past. I know his passion on this, and I appreciate his effectiveness. I thank Representative CASTRO as well, and, of course, the ranking member of this committee, Mr. ENGEL . And I should mention the work, also, of the chairman of our Homeland Security Committee, MIKE MCCAUL. They all worked on the legislation we are considering today. I think that educational and professional exchanges really allow young American and Mexican students and young professionals the chance to not only experience a new culture for them, but also to ensure that our young people graduate from school and enter the workforce with the skills, the credentials, the experience, and the knowledge also about our neighbors, the knowledge they need in the 21st century. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1567, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
PREVENTING DESTABILIZATION OF IRAQ ACT OF 2018 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4591) to impose sanctions with respect to Iranian persons that threaten the peace or stability of Iraq or the Government of Iraq, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4591 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Preventing Destabilization of Iraq Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, this past September, thousands of Iraqis protested throughout the south of the country calling for Iran to stop meddling in their democracy. Yet, as these protesters shouted out, ‘‘Iran out,’’ their pleas were met with bullets by militias funded by and commanded by Iranians. This latest bout of violence in Iraq is not surprising. Iran has used the fight against ISIS as an excuse to expand its footprint inside Iraq and to fund tens of thousands of militia forces. Even as ISIS has receded in Iraq, Iranian backed militias have continued to expand throughout the country and to expand into Syria, where these militias have helped the brutal Assad regime commit countless war crimes. These Iranianbacked militias not only threaten the Syrian and Iraqi people, they also pose a serious threat to U.S. personnel serving overseas, and I will tell you why. Mr. Speaker, 2 months ago, one of these militias launched mortars at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, prompting a stern warning from the administration that the U.S. will hold the Iranian regime accountable for any attack by these militias against any U.S. personnel or U.S. Government facility. These militias also pose a direct threat to Israel. Some have formed a socalled Golan Liberation Brigade, with the explicit intent to attack Israel. The U.N. Ambassador, Nikki Haley, has cited reports alleging that Iran has begun transferring ballistic missiles to these militias that are in Iraq. Despite all this, many of these Iranianbacked militias have not been designated as terrorist organizations nor are they otherwise subject to U.S. sanctions, despite being affiliates of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. This oversight could allow these militias to access the U.S. financial system. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation will allow support and it will bring that support to democracy in Iraq, and it will counter Iran’s deadly influence there. This bill is narrowly tailored to go after those militias directly funded and commanded by the IRGC—the same militias that have attacked our soldiers; the same militias that continue to threaten those in the region. I am pleased that this bill also includes provisions to establish a watch list of Iranianbacked militias in Iraq, which will allow Congress to continually monitor Iran’s activity in the country, including new militias which may emerge in the future. The Iraqi people deserve and want genuine political reform and democracy, and above all else, they want peace. This cannot happen so long as Iran continues to fund and command militias within Iraq. Empowering Iranian militias is a step backwards for Iraq. Instead, it would introduce the Hezbollah model and all the chaos that goes along with it. Iranian influence will only perpetuate the cycle of violence and increase the sectarian polarization, once again creating the conditions for the reemergence of ISIS, alQaida, and other radical Islamist groups. For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.

b1715 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, and I thank Representatives KINZINGER , POE, and S UOZZI for their bipartisan leadership on this legislation. And, of course, I thank Chairman ROYCE for working with me to get this legislation into shape for the floor. The vision that Democrats and Republicans have for Iraq is very similar. We all want to see Iraqis work together to provide for a more prosperous future for their country. We want the greatest number of Iraqis to access the wealth of their country’s natural resources. We want to see Iraqis focus more on what unites them than what divides them. We want to prevent the resurgence of ISIS and the next generation of ISIS or alQaida. We want to protect religious minorities. That is why it is so important to bring this legislation to the floor today. That is why Republicans and Democrats worked together to find common ground on American policies in Iraq. Especially after the Iraqi election, when it remains unclear which path Iraq will choose, we want to demonstrate to the Iraqi people that we support their efforts to build a better country. This bill penalizes those who want to exploit Iraq’s sectarian differences and those who use violence toward those ends. It also establishes a separate watch list to help keep track of proxy groups in Iraq that are doing the bidding of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It sends the message that those in power must prioritize answering to the Iraqi people and not to Iran. We hope that this legislation will empower those who seek a better future for Iraq and its people. I am glad to support H.R. 4591, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER ). A member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, he is the author of this bill, and his service to our Nation includes the time he spent as an Air Force pilot serving in Iraq and in Afghanistan. Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for his many years of service. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4591, the Preventing Destabilization of Iraq of 2018, which I introduced with my colleague, Representative SUOZZI . Since the toppling of Saddam Hussein, Iran has been working to gain access and influence in Iraq by dismantling American efforts to stabilize the country and the region. It is abundantly clear that Iran is working to gain influence in Iraq to further their radical agenda, and we must do everything in our power to counter their tyrannical regime and provide hope for the Iraqi people. I am troubled by the growing influence of Iranianbacked Popular Mobilization Forces, which are being set up as a parallel military structure to undermine the Iraqi security forces. Just this week, we saw the head of a powerful PMF, which would be sanctioned under this legislation, demanding that the Iraqi Government allow these militias to secure the border with Syria. Not only would this legitimize the PMF, but it would also give the Iranians one of their greatest desires, a secure land bridge to supply weapons and troops from Tehran to the Mediterranean. Over the past few months, we have seen the security situation in Iraq slip further into despair. The U.S. compounds in Baghdad and Basra were attacked by Iranianbacked groups, resulting in the latter shutting its doors. I believe retreating will only hurt the Iraqis and make the region a more dangerous place, a lesson that we have already learned once. Following the elections in Iraq this year, we saw Iranian proxies and militias, as well as Iraqis working on behalf of the Iranians, attempting to form a coalition government in Baghdad. This act, which passed the committee unanimously, would impose sanctions on Iranians or any other person who threatens the peace and stability of Iraq. It will also sanction several terrorist organizations, as well as their leaders, many of which are trained and funded by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. Passage of this legislation ensures that the Iranians are not given a free pass to meddle in the affairs of the Iraqi people. I thank all my colleagues for their work on this legislation. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SUOZZI ), an original cosponsor of the bill. Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member ENGEL and Chairman ROYCE for their bipartisan cooperation in this committee, and I thank Representative KINZINGER for his leadership on promoting stability in the Middle East overall. Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of the bipartisan H.R. 4591, the Preventing Destabilization of Iraq Act of 2018. At the 2018 United Nations General Assembly, Iranian President Rouhani spoke against foreign interventions and impositions of ‘‘alien wishes of the people of the region.’’ Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif complained about countries that support ‘‘nonstate actors who wreak havoc through terror.’’ They both might want to look in the mirror. In Iraq, Iranianbacked militias have committed human rights abuses for years, executing and beating civilians and looting homes. These same militias have taken roles in trying to influence Iraq’s nascent political system. In Iraq’s recent elections, IRGC Commander Qasem Soleimani personally meddled in Iraq’s political process by coercing Shiite parties with differing views to form a parliamentary majority, one that presumably would favor 
Iran’s agenda. This, of course, is only one example of Iranian activities across the Middle East. In Syria, Iranianbacked militias have done their own share of murdering and looting. In Yemen, the Iranianbacked Houthis oppress their own people and fire ballistic missiles at civilians in Saudi Arabia. From Bahrain to Lebanon, Iran has played a destabilizing role. H.R. 4591 would sanction any foreign person, not just Iranians, conducting significant destabilizing activities in Iraq. Corruption is endemic and rampant in Iraq’s political system. Iraq’s long term stability depends on a representative government that reflects the will of the people. This bill requires our government to review the status of two of Tehran’s proxies in Iran, HHN and AAH, and assess whether the State Department should designate them as foreign terrorist organizations. By 2011, AAH claimed responsibility for thousands of attacks on U.S. and coalition forces, including the tragic 2007 attack on the Karbala provincial headquarters, which resulted in the execution of four Americans. The group is notorious for its use of explosively formed penetrators, the devastating IEDs that have killed and maimed far too many American troops and civilians. HHN, a hybrid of fighters from AAH and Hezbollah Brigades of Iraq, played an active role against Americans during the Iraq war, and now in Syria’s civil war, boasting of a unit in the Golan Heights targeting Israel. These groups claim they exist to protect Iraqis, but as the evidence clearly demonstrates, they terrorize their countrymen and innocents across the region. But these militias are not the only security threat in Iraq. Although the Islamic State has largely been driven from Iraq, the country still faces a myriad of economic and political challenges. Left unaddressed, Iraq could once again destabilize, creating a void for ISIS or other extremists to fill and, once again, throw the region into chaos and turmoil. This summer, citizens of Basra, Iraq’s second largest city, openly protested the corruption and mismanagement that has tainted their water supply and left their electrical grid in tatters. They directed some of their anger at the Iranianbacked militias that have enriched themselves while ordinary Iraqis suffered. The Iraqi Government cannot provide the services its citizens so desperately need while so much power is controlled by the militias. We need to stand with and aid Iraqis that merely want to root out corruption and malign foreign interference in their internal affairs. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4591. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida, I LEANA ROS LEHTINEN , chairman emeritus of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who chairs the Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, Chairman ROYCE , and I commend both the Speaker and Ranking Member ENGEL . I am going to miss serving with you, ELIOT, as Chairman ROYCE and I say byebye in just a few weeks. But I thank them for always bringing to the floor bipartisan bills that make America a stronger place. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Mr. KINZINGER ’s bill, H.R. 4591, the Preventing Destabilization of Iraq Act of 2018. This timely bill will impose sanctions against a multitude of Iranian militias, proxies, terrorist groups, and other nefarious entities that are operating in Iraq. And it makes it clear that the United States will not allow Iran to continue undermining the stability of Iraq. This bill also includes important language authored by our presiding officer, Judge POE, ensuring that the State Department determines that if certain Iranianaffiliated individuals are operating as terrorists, then they should be designated as terrorists. It further includes language by our great friend Congressman JOEWILSON  of South Carolina, requiring a determination on whether Afghan and Pakistani brigades, under the control of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, should also be designated. This is common sense, Mr. Speaker. As ADAM KINZINGER knows firsthand, Iran has been working against U.S. interests in Iraq for years, and it is directly responsible for American casualties and is intent on continuing to destabilize Iraq for its own purposes. We have to ensure that there are penalties for Iran’s activities by doing everything that we can to block their proxies’ assets, to cut off their funding, and to restrict their travel. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. ROYCE and Mr. ENGEL . As we know, Iraq is a very important partner. This bill prioritizes its stability, and I thank the sponsor, Mr. KINZINGER , for authoring this bill. I encourage all of my colleagues to support it. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This is both a happy and sad moment for me. I am happy because, in the new Congress, I will be in the majority. But I am sad because so many of my friends are retiring, not coming back. I mentioned my good friend Mr. POE before, and I just want to mention our now Speaker up here, my good friend, ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN . We have been working together for more than 25 years in passing all kinds of important legislation involving people’s support around the world, making lives a little bit better for people, and working here to promote democracy at home. I want to have the opportunity to say that this Congress will be missing you. I know I will be missing you, and I know we will be in touch. You are the kind of Member that we need more of, someone who always reached across the aisle, someone who always worked in a bipartisan manner, and someone who was effective and intelligent. I am just proud to call you my friend. I had to say that. So I am going to close and say that Iraq is at a crossroads. We have another speaker? I am sorry. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas, Judge TEDPOE, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I want to reiterate that when the Foreign Affairs Committee meets and makes a decision, we do that almost in unison, Republicans and Democrats, looking out for the best foreign policy of the United States. And Chairman ROYCE and Mr. E NGEL , Chairman ENGEL , will do a great job in leading that effort, as you have done in the past when you were chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I am proud to support Representative KINZINGER ’s bill, the Preventing Destabilization of Iraq Act of 2018. For too long, Iraq has been the center of chaos and instability in the Middle East. While much of this is due to terrorist groups, its expansionist, saberrattling neighbor to the east also bears enormous responsibility for undermining Iraq’s sovereignty and security. Iran is determined, in my opinion, to make Iraq a puppet state of its tyranny. For years, Iran has armed and financed thousands of Iraqi militia fighters loyal to Tehran to spread its influence and fight its foreign wars. Many of these militiamen have American blood on their hands as well as their own countrymen’s. Earlier this year, Iran’s proxies in Iraq seized more seats in Iraq’s parliament and used violence to crush antiIranian protests. This legislation codifies crucial authorities to target Iran’s destabilizing activity. b1730 The bill also includes parts of my Iranian Proxies Terrorist Sanctions bill, which calls for the designation of two of the deadliest Iraqi militia groups backed by Iran: AAH and HHN. These killers have attacked Americans, including firing rockets at U.S. diplomatic facilities in Iraq as recently as this past August. They have participated in Bashar al Assad’s slaughter of the Syrian people and expressed a desire to attack Israel. War is in the mind of the Ayatollah. We must battle Iran in the arenas it hopes to control. Iraq is one of those key arenas. This legislation is a step towards confronting Iran’s conquest of the Middle East. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this important legislation and for the Senate to quickly bring it to the floor to help stop Iran, the world’s number one state sponsor of terror, from spreading its violent hate. And that is just the way it is, Madam Speaker. Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. Madam Speaker, it seems like we are playing revolving or musical chairs, but it is so good, because I get to see all my friends from different angles. Madam Speaker, Iraq is at a crossroads. And as someone who wants to see Iraq succeed in promoting pluralism and tolerance, I support this legislation because it will help Iraqis build a better future. This bill makes it clear that the United States will not side with those who continue to foment sectarian strife. No matter where you are from, if you undermine the democratic process in Iraq, if you threaten peace and stability there, if you prevent the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people, you will be penalized. That is why this bill is so important. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 4591 and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues for their bipartisan work on this important legislation. This measure will send a clear message to the Iraqi people that the U.S. supports them in their quest for peace and stability and democracy. Still recovering from the atrocities and desolation left by ISIS, the Iraqi people deserve a chance to establish a stable democracy free of Iranian meddling. To be clear, these Iranianbacked militias are not just a threat to the Iraqi people. These same militias have launched mortars at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and continue to threaten Israel. It is well past the time that these militias face justice and accountability for their war crimes. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4591, as amended. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO DEMOCRACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2018 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6207) to support democracy and accountability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 6207 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Democratic Republic of the Congo Democracy and Accountability Act of 2018’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. 
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. This is the Democratic Republic of the Congo Democracy and Accountability Act. Mr. Speaker, I would begin by thanking Congressman SMITH and Congresswoman KAREN BASS, they are the chairman and ranking member of the Africa Subcommittee, and I thank the ranking member of this committee, Mr. ENGEL , for their work on this bipartisan legislation. Long overdue elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are scheduled now for December 23, 2018. But we all know that simply holding elections is not enough. President Kabila already has remained in power 2 years past his constitutional mandate. And while I am pleased that he will reportedly step aside, the corruption of the Kabila government runs much deeper than just the presidency. Government officials and security forces continue to use their positions of power to undermine the election and to stoke instability in the country. Peaceful protests have been met with violence, with mass arrests. They have even been met with torture. New reports of abuse and intimidation against journalists and against activists by government forces emerge now every day. Meanwhile, arbitrary legal impediments have barred prominent opposition candidates from running. The government insists on using untested and confusing voting machines, leaving the election vulnerable to vote manipulation and to rigging. Throughout all of this, the government continues to boycott international efforts to support election preparations and to increase humanitarian assistance, and continues to deny, in the face of serious and mounting evidence, that there is a problem. I have been on three trips to the Congo over this issue over the years. The people of the Congo are suffering and the humanitarian situation is dire. Over 4 million Congolese are internally displaced. More than 13 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, including 7 million facing acute food insecurity. And another Ebola outbreak is threatening the lives of thousands. We know that government security forces are responsible for horrific human rights abuses and for provoking instability across the DRC. Just last year, two researchers were killed investigating human rights abuses in the country. One of these researchers was an American. The government continues to block efforts to fully investigate and hold individuals accountable. This cannot stand. The U.S. must be fully engaged in support of the Congolese people and their struggle to freely choose their next leader. This legislation we are considering today is a call to action. It requires a determination on individuals responsible for undermining peace and security, impeding the democratic process, committing human rights violations, and engaging in corruption so 
that they can be sanctioned. It calls for a focus on those that are blocking the democratic process. Mr. Speaker, we have seen this sad situation before in the DRC. We have seen instability and conflict spill into neighboring countries and undermine the entire region. We cannot let this cycle continue. A failed election in December would surely inflame the violence. This is why we must take decisive action to hold individuals accountable and ensure free and fair elections this December. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), and I ask unanimous consent that he may control that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS), the lead Democrat on this bill and the ranking member of the Africa Subcommittee. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly support H.R. 6207, the Democratic Republic of the Congo Democracy and Accountability Act of 2018. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important piece of legislation that seeks to promote free and fair elections in the DRC by imposing sanctions on high level individuals who are undermining democratic processes and institutions in the country as well as those who are responsible for extrajudicial killings and have engaged in public corruption. The DRC has the potential to be one of the richest countries on Earth. It has abundant deposits of copper, gold, diamonds, cobalt, and many other minerals. The Congo River is the second largest river in the world and the most powerful river in Africa, making way for enormous potential to generate hydroelectric power, and some scientists say it could provide enough power for all of subSaharan Africa’s electricity needs. DRC also has great agricultural potential, with its 80 million hectares of arable land, climate conditions, and water resources. This country has all the conditions to thrive and flourish, but it has not. Instead, continued delays in holding elections have increased tensions and unrest. Ongoing conflict in many parts of the country has resulted in hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons and refugees. The country is in a human rights crisis, and on top of all of this, the DRC is suffering from an Ebola outbreak. The humanitarian crisis in the DRC has been exacerbated by the political crisis over elections. With respect to the ongoing political situation, the current crisis in the DRC started in 2015 when President Kabila, who is constitutionally barred from reelection, deliberately stalled planned elections. President Kabila remained in post, although his second constitutional term ended in 2016. Since then, the political situation has steadily declined. The Congolese government and security forces have cracked down on antigovernment mobilization through excessive use of force on peaceful protesters, shut down media outlets, and targeted arrests of activists. In August 2018, President Kabila finally said he would uphold the constitution and not stand for a third term. Even with this announcement, the preelectoral environment remains tense and unsafe for activists, journalists, political opposition, and religious leaders. Additionally, according to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, just this month the government made a new round of arrests of prodemocracy activists ahead of presidential elections scheduled for December 23. This heavyhanded display of police and government security forces ahead of the longawaited presidential election undermines and threatens people’s ability to freely participate in the electoral process. The government must immediately release all people arbitrarily detained for peacefully protesting, including the numerous prodemocracy activists, political opposition leaders, and journalists. Finally, the government must investigate and hold to account those responsible for human rights violations, including arbitrary arrests and detention, torture, and other serious abuses. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BASS). Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is extremely important for addressing conditions in the DRC, but it is also important for sending a message to the world that the United States has not retreated from its commitment to protect human rights and advance democracy around the world. The late former U.N. Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and nine former African presidents said Congo’s future ‘‘is in grave danger.’’ ‘‘We are deeply concerned about the political situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC], which represents a threat to the stability, prosperity and peace of the Great Lakes region. . . .’’ Mr. Speaker, the situation in the DRC is deteriorating as we speak. It is time we act. Following a call from the region, please join my colleagues CHRIS SMITH, Chairman EDROYCE , and Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL , and I, and support this bill that supports human rights, democracy, and accountability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I urge my colleagues to support the Democratic Republic of the Congo Democracy and Accountability Act of 2018. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman ROYCE and Ranking Member ENGEL for their very strong support of this legislation and for their strong statements today. I think this is, again, another example of bipartisan legislation and the House uniting over a very egregious situation that is occurring in the DRC. I would point out to my colleagues that I have visited the DRC myself, been to Kinshasa, the capital, raised a number of human rights issues when I was there. But I also traveled to Goma, where there was terrible acts of bloodshed committed by both the government troops. As well as those that were combating the government, and even terrible acts by the peacekeepers, the U.N. peacekeepers, some years ago, where they were complicit in human trafficking, particularly of little children. b1745 In my subcommittee, I chaired four hearings on this horrible practice of the peacekeepers themselves causing such violence against kids. There is now a much better situation, but it is still awful, and, again, we are now facing another serious crisis. I would also point out to my colleagues that KAREN BASSand I had a trip planned to Kinshasa for August 24 and 25. We made part of that trip where we went to Ethiopia, but we were denied visas. We could not get visas to go to the DRC. We wanted to raise issues with Kabila, himself, with regards to the election and human rights abuse. We were denied that by not getting a visa. This bill could not be more timely. Indeed, there is an urgent need to focus attention on the DRC, a strategically located, resourcerich country, which has been misgoverned for much of its history and again is in crisis today. The wonderful people of the DRC deserve better, far better than they have gotten from the Kabila regime. Next month, just before Christmas, the country is scheduled to vote to replace Joseph Kabila, who has retained power in defiance of constitutional term limits for some 2 years beyond his mandate. Right now, there is talk of further postponement of the election, which would accord with Kabila’s desire to postpone a transfer of power for as long as possible. If such a delay occurs, it would be attributable to the obstacles placed by the Kabila government to holding a free and fair election. 
This bill before us today shows congressional resolve that there be accountability and codifies three executive orders by three Presidents: President Bush, President Obama, and President Trump. It points out that there needs to be significant progress towards holding free and fair elections or else they will not be lifted, and it does so for 7 years. We are talking about respecting fundamental freedoms of the press, expression, and assembly, as described in the December 2016 Saint Sylvestre agreement and in U.N. Security Council Resolution 2348. It also points out that there needs to be, in the legislation, a free and fair Presidential election in accordance with the constitution of the DRC and that a democratically elected President has been sworn in and taken office. It also supports the humanitarian and accountability efforts of civil society groups pushing back against civil strife and political repression. In particular, it acknowledges the role of the faith community and the Catholic Church, which educates and heals the Congolese people through its schools and hospitals, while upholding the need for the rule of law and respect for constitutional principles in the DRC. Indeed, the Congolese Conference of Catholic Bishops, known as CENCO, has played a singular role in promoting restoration of democracy and respect for fundamental civil and political rights, including brokering the December 2016 Saint Sylvestre agreement. Mr. Speaker, this is a critical time for the DRC. We have an emerging Ebola crisis in the eastern part of the country. I note that, over the weekend, our Embassy in Kinshasa was forced to close due to ‘‘credible and specific’’ terror threats. The Embassy will remain closed at least until tomorrow because of those threats and perhaps even beyond that date. We are hurtling towards a political inflection point within the next month, which will either mark a turn towards proper constitutional governance or a downward spiral towards growing chaos and bloodshed. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our staff members who made this bill possible, particularly Lesley Warner of my staff. We traveled to the Congo in 2016 with Chairman ROYCE and had very important meetings there, frustrating but important meetings. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this measure. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC, borders nine other countries in subSaharan Africa, and positive or negative events there often impact the entire region. This is why stability in the DRC is a priority not for that country’s people, but for many other countries, including the United States. That is why Chairman ROYCE  and I led a codel there and why so many of our other members on the Foreign Affairs Committee—Mr. SMITH and Ms. BASS—have been there and have really cared about the region. For years, the DRC has been on the brink of crisis. More than 13 million people need humanitarian support, including 7.8 million children. Across the country, violent conflicts have intensified, including near the city of Beni, where health workers are battling a deadly Ebola outbreak. The current government, as my colleagues mentioned before, has shown a concerning disregard for democracy and the country’s constitution, with troubling restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly and disturbing reports of Congolese security forces violating the human rights of peaceful protestors. Next month, the DRC will hold elections, as my colleagues have mentioned, that were supposed to be held back in December of 2016. It is a critical time for the United States to show that we are committed to the DRC having a peaceful political transition and moving toward accountable, democratic governance. The Democratic Republic of the Congo Democracy and Accountability Act, this bill, asks the administration to continue providing robust humanitarian and development assistance to the people of the DRC. It also requires the President to submit a report to Congress detailing the extent to which Congolese Government officials are involved in human rights abuses against civilians and codifies previous executive orders that target the property and interests of any persons responsible for actions that threaten the stability of the DRC. It is important that we continue leading the international community to address the many challenges in the DRC. That is why this bill asks the administration to keep the DRC on the U.N. Security Council agenda and work to ensure the U.N. peacekeeping mission there has sufficient means to operate effectively. After decades of conflict and instability, the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo deserve a peaceful democratic transition. By passing this bill today, we show that the House is committed to supporting that process. Mr. Speaker, it is in the national security interest of the United States to support a peaceful political transition and accountable governance in the DRC. With elections scheduled for next month, this bill comes at a critical time. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for his comments and for his strong support. Mr. Speaker, this is a true bipartisan bill. Our fingers are crossed for the people of the DRC. They deserve a free and fair election. Whoever emerges as the winner hopefully will take them on a new course. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. ROYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6207, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, twothirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. 
IRAQ AND SYRIA GENOCIDE RELIEF AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2017 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendments to the bill (H.R. 390) to provide emergency relief for victims of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in Iraq and Syria, for accountability for perpetrators of these crimes, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the Senate amendments is as follows: Senate amendments: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following: 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act of 2018’’. 
It is the policy of the United States to ensure that assistance for humanitarian, stabilization, and recovery needs of individuals who are or were nationals and residents of Iraq or Syria, and of communities in and from those countries, is directed toward those individuals and communities with the greatest need, including those individuals from communities of religious and ethnic minorities, and communities of religious and ethnic minorities, that the Secretary of State declared were targeted for genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes, and have been identified as being at risk of persecution, forced migration, genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes. 
Amend the title so as to read: ‘‘An Act to provide relief for victims of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes who are members of religious and ethnic minority groups in Iraq and Syria, for accountability for perpetrators of these crimes, and for other purposes.’’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today to urge strong support for H.R. 390, the bipartisan Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act. I want to begin by offering my special thanks to Majority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY for his strong and sustained support for the victims of genocide, for 
this bill, and for the work of his amazing staff, especially Luke Murry, who has done yeoman’s work on making sure that this moves forward; Senate Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL and his chief of staff, Sharon Soderstrom, for their work; as well as our friends on the Senate side. I especially want to thank EDROYCE , our chairman, and Ranking Member ELIOT ENGEL for their wonderful support for this bill, and for all the Members. I want to thank ANNA ESHOO , who has been tenacious in her support for genocidetargeted communities in Iraq and Syria, and Matt McMurray, her chief of staff, who has also been a great friend to work with on this legislation. My thanks to Mary Noonan, my chief of staff; Piero Tozzi, my staff director for the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee; Nathaniel Hurd at the U.S. Helsinki Commission, who has been lead staffer on the bill; David Trimble, senior fellow at the Religious Freedom Institute; and so many others who have been a part of this effort to get this across the finish line. Mr. Speaker, in September of 2013, I chaired my first of 10 congressional hearings focused in whole or in part on Christians, Yazidis, and other religious and ethnic minorities targeted by ISIS for genocide and other atrocity crimes, frustrated and deeply disappointed that the previous administration was failing to direct aid to these survivors and to support criminal investigations into the perpetrators. Three years later, on September 8, 2016, I introduced H.R. 5961. It was clear then, as it is now, that local overstretched, underfunded groups on the ground were being forced to fill a huge gap, like the Chaldean Catholic Archdiocese of Erbil in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, supported by the Knights of Columbus under the extraordinary leadership of Carl Anderson and by Aid to the Church in Need. To date, the Knights of Columbus has contributed $20 million and Aid to the Church in Need has contributed more than $60 million to the response for these people who are the survivors of genocide. Without this support from private charities, Mr. Speaker, many people, especially children, would have died or have been afflicted with serious disease or disability. Where was the United States? Nowhere to be found. Just before Christmas of 2016, I led a delegation to Erbil at the invitation of the Chaldean Archbishop of Erbil, Bashar Warda, who was heroically leading the effort to sustain more than 70,000 Christians who had fled ISIS, as well as some Yazidis and Muslims. There I met with genocide survivors, almost all of whom told me that they had family members who were murdered, tortured, beaten, and raped by ISIS. Their stories were tragic beyond words and heartbreaking beyond words, but members of my delegation and I were in awe of their deep and abiding faith in God, their resiliency, and their courage. They simply would not quit. They would move on and try to live a life and try to thrive. We visited a camp of 6,000 internally displaced persons, managed by the archdiocese, that the U.S. Government had not even visited until just before our trip in 2016, even though it was only 10 minutes away from the consulate. I was told I shouldn’t go because it was too dangerous. I asked, ‘‘Was there a specific threat?’’ and there wasn’t. When we got there, we were met by about 250 to 300 children, all about fourth or fifth graders or thereabouts, singing Christmas carols, and I felt, ‘‘Boy, that is a real threatening situation.’’ It was foolish in the extreme. They needed our help. They were not getting enough food. They were not getting enough medicine, and their shelter was very meager, to say the least. On January 10, 2017, I introduced H.R. 390, a stronger version of the previous bill. The House unanimously passed it—again, totally bipartisan—on June 6. On October 11, the Senate passed it with a slightly amended version, which is why it is here before the House today for reconsideration. b1800 H.R. 390 authorizes the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Secretary of State to direct humanitarian, stabilization, and recovery assistance to these communities to enable them to survive and someday thrive in Iraq and Syria. It also authorizes the Secretary and the Administrator to fund entities conducting criminal investigations into ISIS perpetrators who committed atrocity crimes in Iraq. The evidence these entities collect and preserve will be used to apprehend, prosecute, and convict perpetrators in a range of court settings. We have learned from the courts in Rwanda, in Sierra Leone, as well as the court in Yugoslavia, you have to capture this information. You have to get the testimonies from survivors and eyewitnesses to effectuate effective prosecutions. The surviving religious and ethnic communities have begun to receive some targeted aid from the United States under the leadership of Vice President PENCE , USAID Administrator Green, and Secretary Pompeo. The governments of Hungary and Poland, as well, have stepped up to provide assistance to those in need. However, we have to move quickly on this bill and on implementation on this. As Archbishop Warda, the head of Chaldean Catholic Church there, told me today: ‘‘Christians in Iraq are still at the brink of extinction. H.R. 390 is vital to our survival. If it becomes law, implementation must be full and fast. Otherwise, the help it provides will be too late for us.’’ Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this measure. A huge amount of work has gone into this bill. I especially thank Representative SMITH of New Jersey, who has been a tireless advocate on behalf of victims of genocide. He always has been, and he always will be. His efforts have helped to ensure that religious minorities still have a place in Iraq and Syria, that their presence remains part of the fabric of the Middle East. ISIS sought to eliminate religious minorities. That is why Congress fought to designate the crimes against them genocide. The House Foreign Affairs Committee has heard hours upon hours of testimony from genocide victims: a Yazidi man recounting the beheading of thousands of Yazidi fighters, women who detailed gang rape and sex slavery. We heard from a number of survivors that international assistance was not moving quickly enough to get people resettled in their homes and communities of origin. This bill would help to ease those people’s suffering and bring to justice those who are responsible. It would authorize assistance for groups investigating and prosecuting crimes against humanity and war crimes. And it would require our government to identify those who are vulnerable to genocide and war crimes, to help with their recovery and stability in the future. This bill will be an important tool in reaching our goal in Iraq and Syria, preventing the resurgence of ISIS. We cannot allow this barbaric group to take over territory or control people ever again. In Iraq, this means addressing the root causes of conflict that motivated people to join an extremist organization like ISIS in the first place. It also means pushing back on Iranian influence because Iran envisions an Iraq overcome by sectarian strife and intolerance. In Syria, that means finding a political solution that does not include Assad. Bashar alAssad is a magnet for extremism, and he continues to employ the worst violence against his own people. Since Assad’s thugs took the life of the first protester in Syria, more than half a million more Syrians have been killed, and more than 11 million people have lost their homes. I remain convinced and concerned about what our military is doing in Syria. In the waning days of ISIS in Syria, how do we intend to justify the presence of our military? This is a slippery slope to perpetual American boots on the ground, and we have to be careful. In addition, if my legislation, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, becomes law, we can provide the administration the leverage it needs to 
push for a political solution to provide justice to Assad’s many victims and to prevent the United States from getting further mired into another war in the Middle East. The only solution to the crisis in Syria is a political solution, and the Caesar Act would help pave a path toward that sustainable, political solution. I urge the other body to pass the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act so we can get it to the President’s desk. I believe the other body would pass my bill, but for a single member of that body who is holding it up for reasons which members of both parties don’t understand. I urge him to lift that hold so that this bill can become law. Mr. Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to pass the bill before us today, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS LEHTINEN ), the chairwoman emeritus of the Foreign Affairs Committee who currently chairs the Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to rise in support of CHRIS SMITH’s bill, the Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act of 2018. I again thank Chairman ROYCE and our esteemed ranking member, ELIOT ENGEL , for their efforts in bringing this important and bipartisan bill to the floor. This commonsense bill authorizes Federal agencies to provide assistance to entities that are working to hold accountable those responsible for genocide, for crimes against humanity, and for war crimes in Iraq and Syria. Over the last 7 years, sadly, ISIS has explicitly targeted and murdered tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of religious and ethnic minorities, mostly Christians and Yazidis in Iraq and Syria. We need to ensure that the proper people are being held accountable by giving the administration all of the tools that it needs to coordinate with and support the organizations that can identify and can prosecute those responsible. In addition, Mr. SMITH’s bill prioritizes emergency assistance to these religious and ethnic minority groups that are targeted by ISIS and continue to face persecution. Syrians remain in desperate need of humanitarian assistance, of stabilization assistance. We must ensure that these religious and ethnic minorities are getting the help they desperately need. I thank my colleague, CHRIS SMITH, such a strong human rights defender, for authoring this important bill and giving this authority to the administration. I urge all of my colleagues to give it their strong bipartisan support. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me again thank Mr. SMITH and Chairman R OYCE  for their hard work and leadership. The violence and suffering that has overtaken Syria and Iraq in recent years is heartbreaking, and it is infuriating, but we cannot allow the magnitude of the problem to discourage us from trying to work toward a solution step by step. This bill puts a focus on some of the most vulnerable groups caught up in this crisis. It will help to ease their plight, and it will help to provide them a measure of justice. Before I close, Mr. Speaker, I again thank you, Mr. POE, for your friendship and for your hard work, and Ms. ROS LEHTINEN for her friendship and her hard work. Chairman ROYCE just stepped out, but I want to say that we always talk about the bipartisan work that we have done on the Foreign Affairs Committee. We always say that the Foreign Affairs Committee is the most bipartisan committee in Congress, and it should be. It has to be because partisanship really should stop at the water’s edge. When we are talking about global interests, we have the same interests. That is one of the wonderful things about the Foreign Affairs Committee. I don’t know if I will have a chance to say this again in this Congress, so that is why I want to say it now: EDROYCE  has been a magnificent chairman and a magnificent friend. He has led this committee into bipartisanship on virtually all matters involving the global stage, and we have become a more effective committee because of his leadership. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman ROYCE for a job well done. It has been a pleasure serving with him and all the members on the committee. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. I thank, again, ELIOT ENGEL , Chairman ROYCE , and I LEANA ROSLEHTINEN , who is the former chairwoman of the committee. I thank her for her very kind remarks. She has been a leader on human rights herself all over the world, especially with regard to Iran and some of the legislation she has gotten enacted into law. I thank her for that extraordinary leadership. Again, this is an example of us pulling together and helping a group of people, survivors of ISIS genocide, who are in desperate need of assistance. We are now past the emergency level in most cases. When we originally introduced the bill, I named it ‘‘the emergency.’’ We didn’t get it passed fast enough, but there is so much more that remains to be done when it comes to recovery and sustainability of these precious lives that have been so wounded by ISIS through mass murder and genocide, which has been recognized by both the Obama administration and the Trump administration. So this is an idea whose time has come, and my hope is that it will be implemented faithfully and aggressively from the moment it is signed. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by recognizing the efforts of Mr. SMITH, Chair of the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Global Human Rights, and Ranking Member ENGEL for their strong leadership on this critical issue. Mr. Speaker, for seven years, the world has watched the brutal dictator Assad inflict untold suffering on the Syrian people. Since the beginning of the conflict, half a million people have been killed and 13 million—largely women and children—remain in dire need of basic humanitarian assistance in Syria. Over the course of this deadly conflict, we have seen Assad and his backers—Russia in the air, and Iran on the ground—commit atrocious war crimes, including using chemical weapons on civilians. I am sure I am not the only one who will never forget the footage shown before our Committee of a Syrian doctor trying to revive two young children, foaming at the mouth, after chlorine bombs rained down on their village; or the testimony of Caesar, a former regime police photographer, who bravely smuggled thousands of images cataloguing the gruesome and methodical torture in Assad’s prisons out of Syria. But the brutal Assad regime is not the only terror the Syrian people have had to endure— his brutality paved the way for ISIS to expand in the country as well. Exploiting the chaos created by the conflict in Syria, ISIS burst onto the scene in 2014 by declaring themselves and their supposed ‘‘caliphate’’—and committing obscene, horrific acts in an effort to spread their nihilistic, deathfilled ideology. Today, thanks to the service of our brave men and women in uniform, ISIS is receding. But we cannot forget the incredible evil they unleashed—while in power, they committed unfathomable violence against Christians and Yezidis in Syria and Iraq, and terrorized the Muslim communities unlucky enough to fall under their ‘‘caliphate.’’ Congress played a critical role in calling these atrocities by their correct name—genocide. This was a very important first step—allowing for assistance to get to minority communities desperately in need. Even now, there is still an urgent need for assistance to these vulnerable communities, which have been devastated by ISIS’ efforts to wipe them out. These ancient communities, whose roots go back centuries, include Christians, Yezidis, Assyrians, Syriacs, Turkomens, and many others. Their presence in Iraq and Syria is crucial to the social fabric of these nations. H.R. 390 offers additional, immediate relief for these vulnerable communities and also directs the State Department to do more to support efforts to collect and preserve evidence of ‘‘genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes’’ so that someday, justice might be served. I urge Members to support this bill and send it straight to the President so that the possibility of justice and accountability for these atrocities can give hope to those suffering today. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SMITH) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendments to the bill, H.R. 390. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendments were concurred in. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
AMENDING THE WHITE MOUNTAIN APACHE TRIBE WATER RIGHTS QUANTIFICATION ACT OF 2010 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the bill (S. 140) to amend the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010 to clarify the use of amounts in the WMAT Settlement Fund.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SHUSTER ) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on S. 140. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to come to the floor tonight, not only with another Coast Guard reauthorization bill, but it will be the last bill I will pass and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will pass, as my chairmanship expires and I leave Congress here at the end of the year. So it is a proud moment for me. I am especially proud that S. 140 was named the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018. This is a product of bicameral and bipartisan efforts. The Coast Guard is an armed service with a very difficult mission: to enforce all Federal laws on, under, and over the high seas in the jurisdiction of the United States. This bill supports the Coast Guard and its servicemembers by authorizing funding for fiscal year 2018 and 2019. The legislation includes three bills reported from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee: the Coast Guard Improvement Reform Act of 2017; the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2017; and the Federal Maritime Commission Authorization Act of 2017. The bill promotes commercial and recreational vessel safety, protects the environment, modernizes Coast Guard administration laws, and provides protection for American business in regard to foreign shipping alliances. b1815 Once again, it authorizes a heavy icebreaker to be purchased by the Coast Guard. We just hope the appropriators find the funding to do that for a much needed icebreaker. The bill is named for our colleague, FRANK LOBIONDO , who previously served as chairman and ranking member of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee during five different Congresses. His leadership on the subcommittee translated into many legislative victories for the Coast Guard and their hardworking Coast Guard members. So it is absolutely fitting to name this after FRANK  LOBIONDO . Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Reauthorization Act by voting ‘‘yes’’ on S. 140, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of S. 140, legislation that we have been somewhat patiently waiting for the Senate to move on for over a year. This legislation incorporates three different bills passed and reported by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last year: H.R. 2518, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2017; H.R. 1726, the Coast Guard Improvement and Reform Act; and H.R. 2593, the Federal Maritime Commission Authorization Act. This is going to provide both positive improvements in maritime policy, help with the competitiveness of the U.S. maritime industry, and it is going to be of substantial assistance to the Coast Guard. There are issues where we had some disagreement. It is not a perfect bill, but I am pleased to support it, and I urge all Members to support it. I am particularly pleased with the 2 year authorized funding levels for the Coast Guard. It has been hurt over a number of years. Their budget has been too thin, and cuts imposed by the 
Budget Control Act have been harmful. So this is a reasonable—not optimal— funding level, but it will meet both the acquisition and operational needs, and the Appropriations Committee will have the capability of meeting the targets we have set. It would have a rigorous new process before the Coast Guard can permanently close any air facility it operates. In my home State of Oregon there was a rather sudden announcement of a closure of an air facility in the mid coast, Newport, in Representative SCHRADER ’s district. The waters of the Pacific are extraordinarily cold year round. Survival times are not long, and we were putting mariners—both recreational, commercial, and others—at risk. So we have now imposed a new process. There will have to be an extensive public review justification, and then Congress will also have time to review, evaluate, and, if necessary, reject future proposed closures. I also support a provision in the bill that will allow certificates of documentation to be renewed on a multiyear basis. The Coast Guard has had a backlog forever on certificates of documentation, and they are annual. The rationale has been, well, we need to know your home port every year. We are going to have a process where you can get a 5year certificate, and then if you change your home port, you have to report it within a certain number of days to the Coast Guard. That solves that issue. There was a longdiscussed provision that was very controversial on the Senate side on the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act. We came up with a compromise. Again, I don’t know that it is optimal, but we can live with it. It sets strict technological standards for vessel discharges under the Clean Water Act to protect local waters, minimizing the introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species to where it was becoming an incredibly expensive and difficult problem. We don’t need to spread anymore. It establishes a uniform national standard for ballast water treatment that will be developed both by the EPA and the Coast Guard to aid commercial carriers in movement of goods by providing regulatory certainty throughout the United States. It retains a significant role for individual States and citizens to protect their local waters, which has been a critical sticking point in prior efforts to pass this measure. So under this proposal, States are guaranteed the ability to coenforce and oversee implementation of the vessel discharge program, petition the EPA and Coast Guard to strengthen ballast discharge standard, should technologies that are more stringent become commercially available, and call for the establishment of no discharge zones in important and sensitive State waters, similar to those currently available for marine sewage. That, again, was not necessarily optimal, but I think it is workable and protects the interests of the State and our precious resources. I want to acknowledge the chairman and thank him. This will be the last bill he manages on the floor. He has imposed regular order on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee with the water resources development bills, the first longterm FAA bill in three decades, and now an excellent Coast Guard authorization in addition to other products. I would like to also thank my ranking member—soon, perhaps, depending on where he decides to go—chairman of this subcommittee for his contributions. This is the third time that JOHN GARAMENDI has worked with the Republicans to deliver a good Coast Guard bill during his tenure. So, all in all, this is a strangely productive day for the House of Representatives, and I am proud to be here. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST), who is the chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time to speak in support of this act named after our friend, FRANK LOBIONDO . I thank the gentleman also for his time as chairman of the full committee. As a Representative of Florida, the State with the second largest coastline in the country, I do have a profound respect for the men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard, and as a veteran as well. It has been an honor to work on such a bipartisan committee, which likewise has been filled with members who support the Coast Guard across a diverse set of evolving mission sets. Every hour of every day the Coast Guard protects America’s waterways. They promote a healthy environment, they ensure the safety of mariners, they enforce our laws, they keep us safe from piracy, and they keep us safe from smugglers. Day in and day out I have had the opportunity to see some of their work firsthand. Recently I met with a search and rescue team in Pollocksville, North Carolina, as they worked tirelessly on behalf of communities impacted by Hurricane Florence. I see my local Coasties in places like Fort Pierce. I see them saving mariners young and old, those lost at sea. There is no doubt that their selfless heroism and their decisive work saved many lives in the Carolinas, just as it did in Florida’s Panhandle after Michael and across the Nation, wherever disaster befalls us. I am proud to support this bill, which also authorizes $10.6 billion to strengthen and support the U.S. Coast Guard in its invaluable defense of our waterways and of our homeland. I am especially glad to see the inclusion of my bill, the Jupiter Island Land Transfer Act. This provision will finally resolve a decadesold conservation issue in my district and transfer four critical acres of unused Coast Guard property to the Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge to ensure the endangered turtles will continue to thrive. By protecting this land, we are doing our part to help ensure that the natural beauty of the Treasure Coast is maintained and continues to be the driver of our economy for many decades to come. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the brave and hardworking men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard and their indispensable work by supporting the FRANK  LOBIONDO Coast Guard Authorization Act. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ), who is the ranking member. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I will make this very brief. I know we are up against the clock here. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. SHUSTER so very much for chairing the committee during my tenure on it and Mr. DEFAZIO, also, for his leadership. I want to also express my appreciation to the new chair, as well as the previous chair of the subcommittee, Mr. HUNTER , with whom I was able to work over the last 3 years. Essentially, this is a good bill. It covers the things that the Coast Guard needs. It increases their funding to a level that is necessary. The title of the bill is proper. We all thank Mr. LOBIONDO for his many years of service. There are a couple of things about the bill that I do want to speak to, and that is we have in the bill a backup system for the GPS that we so much rely upon now. It is finally going to get into the legislation. We also move forward with Blue Technologies and the autonomous, both air and underwater, vehicles that are going to be necessary for the Coast Guard to fully carry out its responsibilities. Beyond that there are some things in the bill that are a compromise. I want to point one out that is very important, and that is section 834 to which I continue to object. This is a bill that actually allows for an aged wooden ship to ply the waters of the Mississippi. The Coast Guard correctly states that this vessel, constructed primarily of wood, and operating the overnight passenger trade, presents an unacceptable fire risk to its passengers and crew, and, accordingly, the Coast Guard is opposed to this particular section. It is unfortunate that is in the bill. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  two letters, one from the Department of Homeland Security and another one from the National Volunteer Fire Council. 
NATIONAL VOLUNTEER FIRECOUNCIL  November 19, 2018. Hon. BILLSHUSTER , Chairman, House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. Hon. BRIAN MAST, Chairman, Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, Washington, DC. Honorable Peter Defazio, Ranking Member, House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. Honorable John Garamendi, Ranking Member, Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN SHUSTER , RANKING MEMBERDEFAZIO, CHAIRMAN MAST, ANDRANKING  MEMBER GARAMENDI : On behalf of the National Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC), which represents the interests of the nation’s volunteer fire, EMS, and rescue services, I am writing in opposition to a provision that was included in S. 140, legislation reauthorizing the U.S. Coast Guard, to exempt from fire safety standards certain historical vessels wishing to operate as cruise ships providing overnight accommodations to passengers. As the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated last year in opposing this provision: ‘‘The use of wood construction, even when supplemented by other fire safety measures, has failed time and again to provide an acceptable level of safety for United States citizens carried on board ships.’’ Fire safety standards have a proven track record of saving lives. Our members see this every day responding to fires in structures with and without modern fire safety protections. Fires occurring in updated structures are far less likely to kill or injure occupants and responders. One of the greatest challenges that fire safety advocates face is the belief that many people have that fire will never happen to them. The widespread adoption and enforcement of fire safety standards has led to a significant decrease in the number of fires, fire related deaths, and firerelated injuries in vessels and structures in the United States, in spite of the fact that the general public underestimates the risk posed by fire. I am concerned not only that the fire safety exemption in S. 140 will endanger the lives of the passengers and crew members aboard historical vessels, but also for the dangerous precedent that it sets. If you have any questions regarding this communication please contact Dave Finger, Chief of Legislative and Regulatory Affairs. Sincerely, KEVIN D. Q UINN, Chair. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. With that, I think I have consumed all the time allowed. I will simply close in this way: All in all this is our third effort to successfully pass legislation. I see the majority counsel over there. I thank JOHNso very much for working with us. And on the minority side DAVID is an extraordinary individual. It has been a pleasure working with him on this, the third 
successful passage of the Coast Guard reauthorization. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my Chairman on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Congressman BILLSHUSTER , and my Ranking Democrat Member on the Transportation Committee, Congressman PETER DEFAZIO, to endorse and support S. 140, the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018. The Coast Guard is a special Federal agency, one that is selfless in service and highly proficient in its work. Ironically, the Coast Guard also is an agency that is overworked, underresourced, and rarely given the thanks that the men and women of the Coast Guard so rightly deserve. Today, with the passage of this legislation, we can say that we are at last stepping up and authorizing funding levels commensurate with the many demands we ask our Coast Guard to undertake. The 2.6 percent increases for both fiscal years 2018 and 2019 will go far to address the deferred needs of the Coast Guard. This stands in sharp contrast to the folly of the Trump administration’s skinny budget for Fiscal Year 2017 that actually sought to cut Coast Guard funding by $1.3 billion—a gross mistake if there ever was one. In general, I applaud Chairman SHUSTER  and his staff, and Ranking Member DEFAZIO and his staff, for their cooperative and collegial, yet determined, negotiations with the other body to arrive at a final bill that advances or clarifies several maritime policy initiatives, improves Coast Guard administration and management, and enhances Coast Guard mission readiness and capabilities. I am particularly pleased that this legislation advances the Coast Guard’s future use of new technologies to improve maritime safety and security and maritime domain awareness. Chief among these is my provision to direct the Department of Transportation to establish a reliable backup timing system to function should the positioning, navigation and timing signals transmitted by GPS satellites be disrupted or degraded. The loss of GPS signals has been characterized as a ‘‘single point of failure’’ for national security and for critical infrastructure systems. Simply stated, we no longer can afford to ignore this threat, and I urge members to join me and support this legislation today. The bill also institutes a new acquisition policy for the Coast Guard to acquire unmanned aerial systems, or UAS. The inability of the Coast Guard to acquire UAS systems for its National Security Cutters is a chronic problem. Restricting the Coast Guard to acquire only systems already acquired and proven effective by other military or nonmilitary agencies, should enable the Service to acquire a UAS system that meets its mission needs without, as they say, ‘‘recreating the wheel.’’ In addition, the bill directs the Coast Guard to sponsor a National Academy of Science study on the status of unmanned, underwater vessels and their potential as mission platforms for the Coast Guard, especially for surveillance activities. This study should help inform the work of the Coast Guard’s Blue Technology Center of Expertise that Congress authorized earlier this year with the enactment of Public Law 115– 265. I also want to express my support for Title VII of the bill that reauthorize the activities of the Federal Maritime Commission and enact some important amendments to the Shipping Act made necessary by the disruption and consolidation in the global container shipping market. Overall, I am pleased that this legislation would authorize increased funding levels for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 for the Federal Maritime Commission. Increased funding should enable the Commission to improve its capabilities to monitor shipping trades that remain turbulent. The bankruptcy of Hanjin Lines in 2016 and the subsequent consolidation of the few remaining ocean carriers into three large alliances produced shock waves in global shipping markets. These new alliances also sent shock waves to U.S. marine terminal operators, tug operators, bunkering operators, and other marine service providers. Title VII of this bill amends the Shipping Act to make some targeted and strategic amendments to improve the legal standing of U.S. port service providers. Additionally, this title strengthens the authority of the Federal Maritime Commission to oversee and intervene, if necessary, in future interactions between these alliances and U.S. port service providers to ensure fair competition. I support these amendments to the Shipping Act as a good first step. I expect that these ideas will require additional refinement as the process moves forward, especially on how best to protect confidential and proprietary information gathered by the Federal Maritime Commission to understand market dynamics. I am open to those discussions and look forward to improving the bill. I also want to express my support for Title IX of the bill that establishes new authorities for the regulation of ballast water and incidental discharges from commercial vessels. While perhaps not perfect, the measure does provide for uniform regulation of vessel discharges within the scope of the Clean Water Act. In addition, the legislation addresses several important issues raised by coastal states, none the least granting states the ability to establish ‘‘no discharge zones’’ if necessary to protect sensitive state waters. In closing, this bill is noncontroversial legislation that addresses the interests of the Coast Guard and U.S. maritime industry. It also addresses the needs of the members on both sides of the aisle, and both sides of the Capitol. I support the legislation and urge its adoption. Although I spoke earlier to express my full support for the underlying bill, I rise now to express my strong opposition to a provision that the Senate inserted into the legislation over my objection. The specific provision is section 834, Fire Retardant Materials. Nothing could be further from the truth. What this provision actually does is reinstate an exemption from a longstanding fire safety requirement for passenger vessels carrying 50 or more people on overnight voyages to be constructed using fire retardant materials. And although the provision does not clearly state the vessel or vessels that would benefit from this exemption, the reality is that there is only one vessel, the Delta Queen, an aged paddlewheel steamship whose superstructure is almost entirely built out of wood, for which the exemption will apply. In 2008, the 110th Congress decided—wisely in my view—not to renew this illadvised exemption for the Delta Queen in favor of upholding maritime safety. It was the correct decision then, and it remains the correct decision today. I have little choice but to raise my objections to this provision based on the manner by which the other body tacked it onto the Coast Guard bill despite the fact that companion legislation introduced in the House, H.R. 619, went nowhere. This legislation would waive a critical maritime fire safety standard and consequently expose the American public to overnight travel on a vessel that the Coast Guard maintains is ‘‘an unacceptable fire hazard to passengers and crew.’’ The Coast Guard’s position remains clear and unequivocal. As stated in its 2008 Special Inspection report, the Coast Guard found that ‘‘The combustible construction of the vessel presents an unacceptable fire risk that cannot be mitigated by the addition of fire suppression measures.’’ The Coast Guard also concluded that, ‘‘The vessel, constructed primarily of wood and operating in the overnight passenger trade, presents an unacceptable fire risk to its passengers and crew.’’ Accordingly, the Coast Guard has been, and remains, opposed to legislation to renew the exemption from fire safety standards for the Delta Queen. Mr. Speaker, I have included in the R ECORD  the administration’s views letter stating its opposition to S. 89, which is the underlying provision in section 834. This provision also has drawn opposition from the National Volunteer Fire Council. The Council concludes that the ‘‘fire safety exemption in S. 140 will endanger the lives of passengers and crew members aboard historical vessels, but also for the dangerous precedent it sets.’’ Mr. Speaker, I have included in the RECORD  the Council’s letter stating its opposition to section 834. I commend the Coast Guard for upholding its fire safety standards. I fail to see why it makes any sense for the other body to advance legislation that would sharply contradict the Coast Guard’s recommendations and compromise maritime safety. The American public trusts Congress to ensure that our nation’s transportation system remains the safest in the world. Section 834 violates that trust. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LOBIONDO ), who is the current chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation, the former chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, and the namesake of this bill. Mr. LOBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman SHUSTER for yielding. It is an honor to have represented the Coast Guard’s only recruit training center in the Nation which is in my district. It is an honor to have represented the Coast Guard Air Station in Atlantic City, which is the largest helicopter air station that the Coast Guard has. Most of all, I want to recognize the men and women of the Coast Guard whom this bill will benefit. There are very few issues that have been so bipartisan across the board in my time here 
in Congress. When I first came, I didn’t really understand the commitment that the men and women of the Coast Guard continue to make for our Nation, always being asked to do more and given less to do it. In many respects I wish we could have done more over the years, but to be able to move forward with a bill like this that is so bipartisan I think speaks to our commitment as a legislative body to the men and women to whom we owe so much that protect our country. I want to particularly thank Geoff Gosselin who is now with the full Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, but was on my staff for a number of years and really did an amazing and outstanding job with Coast Guard issues for me in helping me to understand them and move them forward. So I want to thank all of my colleagues who have made this day possible. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the State of Washington (Mr. LARSEN ). Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the FRANK  LOBIONDO Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018. Protecting the maritime jobs of the hardworking Washingtonians in the second district of my State, including at Dakota Creek Industries in Anacortes, is a priority of mine. The passage of this legislation supports U.S. maritime defense policy and sustains a strong domestic shipbuilding industry. It is a win as well for the hundreds of men and women at Dakota Creek Industries, which is a key contributor to our regional economy. I appreciate the coordination with Senator CANTWELL , Senator S ULLIVAN , and Representative DONYOUNG as we have worked for a year and a half to find a path to save the hundreds of jobs at DCI. I also want to thank my friend, FRANK LOBIONDO . It is fitting that this bill is named for him, as he is a champion of all things transportation. He has worked tirelessly for the people of New Jersey, the people of his district, and for the people of this country to ensure that we have an infrastructure system in this country that works for all of them. It has been an honor to serve with him for nearly two decades, and I will miss the work of Representative FRANK  LOBIONDO . Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. HUNTER ), who is the former chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation and an advocate for the Coast Guard. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Chairman SHUSTER for giving me the opportunity to serve for nearly 6 years as the chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, and I would like to thank him for yielding me time. b1830 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 140, the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018. Congressman LOBIONDO is and has been a tireless advocate for the men and women of the Coast Guard, and there is no other name more fitting for this bill. Let me run through a few of the things that I find extremely great about this bill. Title 9 contains the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, legislation that I have introduced for three consecutive Congresses. It was compromised a little bit in the Senate but is still getting done. Mr. GARAMENDI and I held many, many subcommittee hearings together. He has been known to ask at the appropriate hearings about the backup to GPS. This question is always met with blank stares. This bill makes important progress on a backup GPS system. Finally, specifically section 514 establishes this backup timing component of the GPS system. That is no doubt thanks to Mr. GARAMENDI ’s tireless work. I am also pleased that the legislation establishes a landbased unmanned aircraft system program for the Coast Guard. They have never had their unmanned aerial vehicle program until now. They have had to rely on other services or agencies for this important capability. These additional UAS assets will strengthen the Coast Guard’s ability to interdict contraband and improve search and rescue missions. During the last 6 years, we have held 46 hearings and five roundtables. We have worked to protect the Jones Act and ensure that our country has a strong maritime industrial base, including a skilled pool of American shipyard workers and mariners who would be critical in a time of conflict. Earlier this year, Congress enacted legislation coming out of the tragic El Faro accident to improve the safety of those American mariners. We have also worked to reduce burdensome regulations that harm U.S. maritime jobs and the competitiveness of the U.S. flag fleet. We held joint hearings with the Committee on Homeland Security to shed light on security vulnerabilities at our ports and sought to enhance the screening of cargo entering our country and, with the Armed Services Committee, to look at the shared missions of the Navy and the Coast Guard in carrying out defense missions. We pushed the Coast Guard to act like the military service that they are. The subcommittee also took massive steps to modernize our Nation’s icebreaker fleet and to encourage the Navy and Coast Guard to have a comprehensive plan for the Arctic. Mr. Speaker, I want to end by thanking a few people. Some of the most fulfilling work serving as the subcommittee chairman was forming strong relationships with the men and women who guard our coasts. The Coast Guard House Liaison Office and the Coast Guard fellows assigned to the subcommittee over the last 6 years have represented their service well. I would like to thank them for their hard work and camaraderie. I also want to thank Congressman GARAMENDI for his friendship and being such a strong partner on these issues. Finally, I want to thank the subcommittee’s staff director, John Rayfield, and the exceptional committee staff who have been invaluable as a resource and worked tirelessly to carry out the subcommittee’s mission. With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the legislation. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY ). Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018. This bill provides critical policy guidance to the Coast Guard as it protects our Nation’s shores and maritime interests. The bill increases authorized funding levels, requires a review of our Arctic strategy and the Coast Guard’s ability to achieve it, and provides authority to procure three new National Security Cutters. The bill also includes a provision to ensure that public safety answering points that respond to 911 calls from vehicles in distress are trained to relay that information to the Coast Guard or tow companies. Sector Long Island Sound has been working with municipality dispatch centers in Connecticut and New York to implement a training program to route these calls. I want to thank Mystic towboat Captain Jeff Dziedzic for bringing this issue to my attention and Congresswoman ESTYfor working with my office last year to include this language in the bill. Mr. Speaker, eastern Connecticut is the proud home of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and Coast Guard Station New London. Therefore, I am particularly excited that this bill includes a provision that will help boost construction of the future National Coast Guard Museum to be built along the Thames River in New London. In particular, it authorizes engineering and design work to be performed by the Coast Guard in this project. The Coast Guard is the only military service without its own museum. Under the leadership of Jim Coleman, Richard Grahn, Admiral Papp, Captain Wes Pulver, and many others, this project is well on its way to becoming a world class destination to showcase the rich heritage of the Coast Guard, which dates back to 1790 when Alexander Hamilton created America’s ‘‘first fleet,’’ which, by the way, was organized before the U.S. Navy. I would like to thank the chairman, Mr. SHUSTER , and Mr. L OBIONDO , as they depart. Again, they are great role models of bipartisan leadership and about getting results. I want to also 
thank the ranking member, Mr. D EFAZIO, and also the subcommittee ranking member, JOHN GARAMENDI , for their hard work. I also thank Dave Jansen and John Rayfield for helping guide this bill to a successful conclusion. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT ). Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of this legislation. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership. I would like to highlight a specific portion of the bill. This provision preserves an important piece of American history and it supports American jobs. It would reinstate the Delta Queen’s grandfathered status from a law that prohibits wooden boats from carrying overnight passengers. Congress granted the Delta Queen a reprieve from that grandfathered law, which adversely impacts it, for four decades. In doing so, Congress recognized that the Delta Queen was constructed before the law that adversely impacted it was in place and that the law was intended to regulate vessels at sea, oceangoing vessels. It was never intended for riverfaring boats like the Delta Queen. That is why Congress granted this reprieve for 40 years. We failed to do that back in 2008. We are looking at $100 million in development, in economic dollars in the river areas of this country, including the city of Cincinnati, my area. It used to be the home port. It will be one of the stops. It means a lot of jobs for a lot of people. It will be safely done. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank Dave Jansen for his hard work and again congratulate the chairman on his last bill passing on the floor. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support S. 140, the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018. It is a good bipartisan bill. I urge all my colleagues to vote for it. Finally, I would like to thank the staff on both sides of the aisle. On our side, especially, I thank the Coast Guard Subcommittee staff and John Rayfield, who heads up that staff, for his tremendous work. He just informed me that, under the subcommittee’s jurisdiction, we will have authorized every single program under that committee’s jurisdiction. Great work by John and his team on the subcommittee. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the names of the staff on the committee. 
From Chairman Shuster’s Staff: John Rayfield Bonnie Bruce Lt. Commander Luke Peterson Kevin Reig Maggie Chan Kathy Loden Brittany Smith Hannah Matesic Fred Miller Geoff Gosselin Chris Vieson From Ranking Member DeFazio’s Staff: Dave Jansen Kathy Dedrick Alex Burkett From the Office of Legislative Counsel: Hank Savage Tom Dillon Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank all my members for the great support they have given me on both sides of the aisle to move a lot of bipartisan legislation. I want to thank them for that. I thank my subcommittee chairmen for their leadership in working with me. Finally, I thank my counterpart, the leader of the Democrats on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, sometimes being a worthy foe, most of the time being a dependable and able ally. I thank him for all his work. I also thank him for the very, very thoughtful small going away gift that he gave me. I appreciate that greatly. Again, I finally thank him for all his effort and work. I have no say in who is going to be the next chairman of the committee, but I can tell you that nobody is more able and knowledgeable about the transportation and infrastructure world than PETER DEFAZIO. I wish him the best and look forward to seeing him down the road. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of S. 140, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 140, the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018. Congressman LOBIONDO has served his constituents in New Jersey’s 2nd congressional district well, including the Coast Guard Training Center Cape May in Cape May, New Jersey. From his position on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, a panel on which we served together for a decade, he successfully fought on behalf of our state and the brave men and women in uniform who guard our nation. Congressman LOBIONDO has focused on strengthening our nation’s maritime industry, which is a critical source of jobs and economic output in New Jersey. During his time in Congress, Congressman LOBIONDO  fought to improve the lives of our service men and women and their families. Given his service to bettering the Coast Guard, it is fitting that this year’s authorization legislation is named after Congressman FRANK LOBIONDO . I look forward to this bill’s passage and strongly urge all my colleagues to support S. 140. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 140, the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act. No institution is more critical to our national defense and homeland security than the United States Coast Guard, and every day, the men and women of the Coast Guard carry out vital, lifesaving missions, including drug interdiction and search and rescue. On November 9, I had the opportunity to tour the Coast Guard’s District 11 facilities in Alameda, California. I was deeply impressed by the dedication and professionalism of the Coast Guard officials I met. However, I was also troubled by the state of some of Coast Guard’s equipment. Resources for the Coast Guard are clearly needed, now more than ever, so it is deeply unfortunate that the Trump administration has sought to cut the Coast Guard’s budget by as much as 14 percent and has transferred millions of dollars in Coast Guard funding to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Congress should not allow the Trump administration to raid the Coast Guard budget to implement its antiimmigrant policies. But today, I urge all my colleagues to support S. 140, and I applaud the Chairman and Ranking Member for their hard work bringing this important measure to the floor. Likewise, it is vitally important that, as negotiations regarding the Fiscal Year 2019 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act continue, Congress include sufficient funding for the Coast Guard so that it has the resources it needs to carry out its vital missions. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SHUSTER ) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the bill, S. 140. The question was taken; and (two thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendment to the House amendment was concurred in. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, Representatives of the 115th Congress, I am profoundly humbled and honored that the people of my district have entrusted me with the duty of representing them. The work of conducting the people’s business in this Chamber has endured through unfinished struggles for equality and justice, through conflicts abroad and crises at home. I look forward to taking part in that work through the remainder of this session and into the next Congress, when a historically diverse freshman class, including more women than ever before in our Nation’s history, will take their oaths. Our first responsibility must be to the most vulnerable and least fortunate among us, and our voices should amplify theirs. My parents both lived lives of service. My father, a conservative Republican, spent his entire career in the Air Force and was driven by a sense of duty. My mother, a progressive Democrat, believed at her core that we are defined by what we do for others. They have both passed away now, but my standing here is a testament to them. We in Congress have a responsibility and opportunity to improve the everyday lives of the people of our districts. On behalf of my community, your communities, and generations to come, I know that we can and must rise to the occasion and deliver shared and lasting progress.

LIEUTENANT COMMANDER VICTORIA MARUM (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Lieutenant Commander Victoria Marum on her separation from the United States Navy after 11 years of faithful service to our country. An esteemed member of the United States Navy, Lieutenant Commander Marum most recently served as the liaison in the Navy’s U.S. House of Representatives Liaison Office. I was so grateful for Victoria’s guidance during delegations that I was so proud to lead abroad, as she always handled stressful situations and difficult individuals—I won’t name names—with poise, humor, and resourcefulness. The talent she exhibited on Capitol Hill will serve her well on every path upon which she finds herself in the future. As Lieutenant Commander Marum embarks on a new chapter in her life, it is my hope that she may recall with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment the outstanding contributions she has made to the United States Navy, to the United States Congress, and to our great Nation, even though she is a Florida Gator. 
1918 FLU PANDEMIC (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, flu season is upon us, and I rise today to raise awareness about the 100th anniversary of the deadliest medical catastrophe in history: the 1918 influenza pandemic. 100 years ago, the flu took the lives of more Americans in 1 month than in the entirety of World War I. The 1918 flu pandemic lasted for 15 months. During that time, the average American’s life expectancy dropped by 12 years. 100 years later, there are still many outstanding questions about the flu pandemic, but what is certain is that the flu virus still poses an undeniable threat to our Nation. Last year, an estimated 80,000 Americans died from the flu. Investing in research and development for novel antivirals and ensuring people get the flu vaccine is crucial to protecting our Nation from another flu pandemic like the one we faced 100 years ago. 
RECOGNIZING GIVING TUESDAY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today on ‘‘Giving Tuesday’’ to recognize the importance of charitable giving, especially during this time of year. With the Christmas and holiday season upon us, we recognize and celebrate many blessings. As we reflect on all that we have achieved and accomplished, we must also remember the less fortunate among us. ‘‘Giving Tuesday’’ began in 2012 as a day to encourage charitable giving on the heels of shoppingfocused days like ‘‘Black Friday’’ and ‘‘Cyber Monday.’’ It is a dedicated day to give back. Americans are compassionate people who care about their neighbors on ‘‘Giving Tuesday’’ and all year long. Through monetary donations or gifts of time through volunteering, we are always finding ways to give back to our communities. But today, on ‘‘Giving Tuesday,’’ we find ways to lift up our fellow citizens. These acts of kindness and generosity highlight our American values. The best way to celebrate your blessings is to share them with others. No gift is too small and no gesture too insignificant to someone in need. It is the American way. f 
NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, as cochair of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth, I rise to recognize November as National Adoption Month. All children deserve the love and security of a forever family. Unfortunately, this is not a reality for too many children across the country. More than 123,000 children are waiting right now to be adopted from foster care in the United States. Those who reach adulthood and exit care without a family are far more likely to experience bouts of homelessness and unemployment, among other negative outcomes. Madam Speaker, who among us would have succeeded without the love and support of our families to be there for us, whether it was the family we were born into or the family we make. Madam Speaker, we must ensure that every child has the family they need to thrive. Adoption provides this pathway. On November 17, 19 Rhode Island families celebrated National Adoption Day by finalizing the adoptions of 23 children. I would like to honor these families and others who open their hearts to children in need. There is no greater gift than the gift of a forever home. 
CONGRATULATING THE CHAMPLIN PARK CHAMPS (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the Champlin Park Rebels girls volleyball team on winning the Minnesota State High School Championship, the first team in school history to bring a championship trophy back to Champlin Park. Their victory came after outlasting a very talented Eagan team, playing in its sixth consecutive state final. But the Rebels were just too much for them, starting strong and then never looking back. The pressure was on for the Rebels to win their school’s first ever state title, and they delivered every step of the way. They showed the kind of true determination that makes them champions both on and off the court. So, Madam Speaker, congratulations to these student athletes, the coaches, their parents, and all of the fans, and the entire Champlin Park community on a welldeserved, hard fought win becoming state champions. 
b1945 REAUTHORIZATION OF THE NATIONAL EARTHQUAKE HAZARDS REDUCTION PROGRAM (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to say how pleased I am that Congress has reauthorized the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, or NEHRP. I am grateful to Senator FEINSTEIN , as well as my colleagues in the House— Representatives ROHRABACHER , KNIGHT , and LAMAR SMITH—for their leadership in bringing this forward. This has been an important issue to me since I was in the State senate, given my State’s— Washington State’s—geography and the serious threats that we face from earthquakes. NEHRP reauthorization is the very first step to ensure that our States have the resources they need to prepare for earthquakes, States like mine that have been anticipating a catastrophic earthquake for many years. As we have watched tragedies unfold around the world, it is clear that we have to do everything we can to build resilience so that when earthquakes inevitably strike, our communities are as prepared as they can be. This reauthorization will ensure that all of our communities are able to improve their building standards, have early warning systems, and have better monitoring for seismic activity. I hope this bill will be one of many, and that we continue to build on this progress to ensure ample investment to build resilience, in particular for schools and hospitals. I look forward to working with my colleagues to push this forward in the next Congress. CONGRATULATING THE RIDGE POINT PANTHERS VOLLEYBALL TEAM (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, all Texans know that our stars are big and bright at night. But lately, 16 stars have been the biggest and brightest ever seen in Fort Bend County. Here they are. These stars’ names are Alana, Britney, Karly, Taylor, Tiana, Randee, Skylar, Charlie, Claire, Reagan, Baleigh, Nia, Tyler, Lindsey, Kendall, and Peyton. They revolve around a star called Coach Lori McLaughlin. They are the 2018 Ridge Point Panthers volleyball team. We are so proud they are State runnersup in volleyball in Texas: 47–6 was their record, 14–0 in district play. They have a warning for 2019 and beyond: The Panthers are still hungry and will be back. You can count on it. f 
GENERAL MOTORS IDLE (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, how troubling it is that General Motors has announced it is idling five major auto plants across the United States and Canada. At the Chevy Cruze plant in Lordstown, Ohio, facility alone, 1,600 jobs are on the chopping block. The dire impact in Ohio surges to 5,000 more potential lost jobs when auto part suppliers are considered. President Trump promised to defend manufacturing. He promised to cure the red ink of manufacturing job loss and wagecrushing trade deficits. Under him, both are getting worse. Instead, his party enacted deficitbusting corporate tax giveaways with the Republican tax scam. Where do the automakers intend to invest their bonanza? Not here. Time and time again, American taxpayers and workers have been asked to help the U.S. automakers. This latest move from General Motors is an affront to their investment. President Obama and congressional Democrats refinanced the ailing American auto industry in 2009. Democrats saved American manufacturing while the vast majority of Republicans voted no. Madam Speaker, we need fair trade to open markets and create jobs here at home. 
RELIST JEWISHOWNED HOMES ON WEST BANK IMMEDIATELY (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express our support for our great ally, Israel, and also to share my concern about a recent decision from the company Airbnb. On November 20, Airbnb made the decision to delist about 200 Jewish homes in the West Bank. This decision is a win for the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, the BDS movement, which is blatantly antiSemitic and consistently targets businesses that are operating in Israel. As a Representative from northwest Florida, I am proud to serve a State that has stringent BDS laws. I am incredibly proud of Governorelect RON DESANTIS for sharing his concern and for stating unequivocally that if Airbnb continues to engage in BDS activities, they have a right to speak, but they will hear from all of us very soon. 
CONGRATULATING WESTERN HIGH SCHOOL (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Western High School Pioneers on their first ever CIF football championship. Since Western High School opened its doors in 1955, the Pioneers have never won this coveted prize. Now, 63 years later, Coach Dan Davidson put together a very talented team that finally won CIF. Having grown up in Anaheim, I have seen many, many talented Western High School football teams come and go, but I have to tell Coach Davidson: Congratulations. Job well done. Again, congratulations to the Pioneers, to the parents, and to the student body: Job well done. Congratulations. We are all proud of you. 
CLIMATE CHANGE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GIANFORTE ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to move to the subject of climate change, however, my colleague, TERRI SEWELL , has reminded me that a very important organization needs a few moments, so I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL ), to speak about the Stennis Center. 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Rex Buffington, for his life’s work as executive director of the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Leadership since it was established 30 years ago. I again thank the gentleman from California for yielding me this time. I am joined here tonight by my fellow board members of the Stennis Center as we speak about the retirement of the executive director, Rex Buffington. For more than 30 years, the Stennis Center has taught, inspired, and 
trained our Nation’s young people through programs such as debate, women’s leadership initiatives, and Truman Scholars. Thanks to the leadership of Rex from the very beginning, their work has had a powerful impact on our Nation’s leadership, mobilizing a generation of dedicated public servants and community leaders. I am happy to share with Rex not only our southern roots—he is from Mississippi and I am from Alabama— but our mutual love for debate and our dear friend, my former high school debate coach, Coach Billy Tate. Coach Billy Tate, my high school debate coach at Selma High School, was instrumental in the creation of the John C. Stennis Novice Speech and Debate Tournament. I know that my life’s journey would not have been possible if it had not been for my high school debate experience. I know that the Stennis Center’s debate program is just one of the many ways young leaders across this country are being equipped with the invaluable tools necessary for leadership. Rex knows that it is the people behind our democracy that makes democracy work. He has been quoted as saying: ‘‘No government, regardless of its history or structure, can be better than the people who make it work.’’ I agree with Rex. When we have programs aimed at attracting thoughtful, committed, and honest leaders to public service, we get good policy in the end. While I am disappointed to see Rex’s time as executive director come to an end, I know that his leadership has set the groundwork for another 30 years of success in attracting young people of character to public service. The impact that Rex has had has been enormous, and I thank him. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. HARPER ). Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States House of Representatives and the Board of Trustees for the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Leadership, it is with great gratitude that we honor Rex Buffington for his many years of distinguished public service. Rex Buffington was appointed executive director of the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Leadership when the center was established in 1988 to promote and strengthen public service leadership in America. As executive director of the Stennis Center, Rex has been responsible for development and delivery of programs aimed at attracting young leaders to public service and providing current public service leaders with opportunities to further develop their leadership skills and capabilities. Participants in Stennis Center programs range from students in high school to Members of Congress. Prior to his work at the Stennis Center, Rex served as press secretary to Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi for 12 years. As the Senator’s chief spokesperson, speechwriter, and communications director, Rex coordinated activities and strategies aimed at achieving the Senator’s mission and legislative agenda. I am so honored to serve as chairman of the board of trustees for the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Leadership. I have seen what Rex has done firsthand, and it has been a privilege to work directly with him. Rex is an encourager of every person that he comes in contact with. He knows better than anyone the legacy of Senator John Stennis who served Mississippi and our Nation with great distinction for over 41 years as a U.S. Senator, ultimately becoming President pro tempore. President Reagan once called the Mississippi Senator ‘‘an unwavering advocate of peace through strength.’’ Senator Stennis had a passion for fostering leadership and promoting public service, two objectives that Rex has carried forward during his time serving as executive director. The USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier, the only one not named after a President, has the twoword motto adopted by Senator Stennis that he had: Look Ahead. Senator Stennis would be proud of the work that Rex Buffington and the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Leadership continue to do, and he would be proud of the great work that Rex has done. We are all very proud of the great work that he has done over these years of distinguished service to Mississippi and to our Nation. We congratulate him on a job well done, and we wish him the best as he looks ahead. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY). Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his generosity in yielding a few minutes for this very important moment. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute as well to a true public servant, Rex Buffington. Rex has dedicated so much of his professional life to supporting leaders in this country, most recently, as you have already heard, as the executive director of the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Leadership, where he has served admirably since the Stennis Center’s establishment in 1988. After many years of encouraging new leaders and supporting existing ones, Rex is retiring. His tireless efforts will be greatly missed, but I know I speak for many who know him in saying we are proud of him and we are confident that his next chapter brings more wonderful milestones. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Rex. His work for the Stennis Center has positively impacted American leaders from all generations and walks of life, from high school students to the Members of Congress who walk these halls today. I know this firsthand because I am one of those Members that he has impacted. I wish Rex, John Gavin, and Catherine great success in the road ahead. He will be missed, but his impact will be felt for many years to come. b2000 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. ROBY, Mr. H ARPER , and Ms. SEWELL for bringing to our attention one of the important organizations that develops leadership here in the United States, and, obviously, from the two of you, Mrs. ROBYand Ms. S EWELL , who are perfect examples of the success of the center. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, we will turn to another topic, I think, of interest, if my colleagues would just excuse me for a moment. I always try to start these sessions with purpose. What are we all about here? And I often use this from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and he said: ‘‘The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.’’ While I always use this, I am trying to figure now, how does this figure into climate change? What would the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt have to do with climate change in the era of greenhouse gas emissions? I thought about it for a while and I said, it may be difficult to make the connection, but there really is one. And I really want to start with this: What is our purpose here? If we think about climate change, we are going to have to understand and read and pay attention to this. This is the cover of an extraordinarily important document that the Federal Government, the Government of the United States of America, issued last Friday when most of America was out shopping, Black Friday. Now, maybe there is some reason that the administration chose to issue this critical report on that day. If it was to bury the report, they are not going to be successful, because this document, required by Congress over the last 20plus years, gives a clarion call to every human being on this planet today. That clarion call is so important that, on this first day following Thanksgiving and the issuance of this report, we brought it to the floor of the House of Representatives to alert this Nation that, despite trying to hide this report on Friday, it is now part of the public record. We need to understand what the impact of climate change is on all of us today, Americans, and to generations into the future. The impact is stark. It is heavy. It is ominous. And it is already happening. The front page says: Fires. I am from California. We know about fires. This is a month ago, fires in California, all of 
these at one time: the Mendocino Complex in my district, the largest single wildfire in California’s history; the Sierras, down in the southern valley; and the smoke from the Camp fire, burning more than 1,000 homes on this day; smoke covering nearly the entire State of California. Are those fires the result of climate change? The answer is absolutely, yes—the extensiveness, the severity, and the number of acres burned. More familiar, perhaps, and more recent, just days after those fires that I just put up there, this one happened. Eightyfour people are known to have perished in the Paradise fire, the most mass casualties in recent history in the United States. Unfortunately, there are still a couple hundred people unaccounted for. Is this fire a result of climate change? Yes, it is—the intensity of the fire, the rapidity with which it tore through the forest and wiped out an entire town of 26,000 inhabitants. Fourteen thousand residences were burned out in this fire. There is more to be said. How about flooding? Port Arthur, Texas, a city that was flooded, and more along the Gulf Coast this fall. Another community was totally wiped out or near totally wiped out on the Florida panhandle. Massive storms ripped through the Caribbean and up into the United States. Is flooding a result of climate change? The severity and the intensity of the flooding, certainly—North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, and Texas. In California, we have our share of it also. All of these are words laid out in this climate assessment: Economic losses today and into the future, perhaps $141 billion over the next several decades from heatrelated deaths alone; $118 billion cost from sea level rise. Do you live on the coast? The San Francisco Bay, Florida, a good portion of Florida, Miami, the Everglades, the East Coast, all of it is affected by climate change. We have a problem, folks. Are you interested in ecology? Are you interested in wildlife? Are you interested in forests? This was once a green forest in California. We predicted in the mid1990s, when I was given a task as the Deputy Secretary at the Department of the Interior to investigate and to anticipate what climate change would bring to America, we said there would be more fires, more intense fires. They would be more devastating. They would be larger. They would be faster. We said there would be more flooding. We said the hurricanes would be even greater than in the past. We predicted that a city called New Orleans would flood. We predicted that a place called New York City would flood. And they both did a few short years after that report, as we prepared the United States for the Kyoto climate conference. Coming out of that conference, the House of Representatives and the Senate of this great body denied the opportunity for the United States to join in the treaty that came out of that conference, and it got worse. Forests of California, we predicted there would be a dieoff. And, in fact, there is. This is just one small part of the massive dieoff of trees that is occurring in the forests all across America, even into the Arctic regions. Pay attention, America. Pay attention, Congress. Pay attention, Senate. And for heaven’s sake, President Trump, please pay attention to the reality of climate change. It is here. It is a massive problem. The U.S. military more than a decade ago predicted that wars would be breaking out because of climate migration, climate refugees. It is happening. It is happening around the world. Read this assessment of what it means to America. We have an obligation. We, the 435 Representatives of the American people, have an obligation to address this crisis. It is not a crisis of the future. It is a crisis of today and the future. Do we have the courage to do this? Do we have the courage to decarbonize our energy supplies? We have to find the courage. We have no choice. Joining me tonight are people, Members of this House who share the commitment to address climate change. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER ), my friend from the city of Chicago, to join us and share with us his concerns. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. GARAMENDI  from California, for organizing this evening’s conversation, but more importantly, for drawing attention to this critically important issue. It is more than a little bit shameful that the administration chose to release the Fourth National Climate Assessment on Black Friday, a day, as the gentleman noted, when most families, most people, are focused on the Thanksgiving holiday. Some are shopping, and some are hanging out with their family and friends. But it was clear that this was an apparent effort by the administration to introduce this report at a time when people weren’t paying attention. Fortunately, people are paying attention to this issue. We are seeing it with the concerns people have watching the fires in California; the floods and hurricanes this summer or fall in Florida; last year, with the hurricanes and flooding in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The report that was released on Friday was a rigorous report, assembled by 13 Federal agencies and covering more than 1,000 pages of detailed analysis and data, highlighting the impacts we can expect over the next decades into the next century if action isn’t taken. Impacts include increased storms, flooding, devastation, mudslides from the size of these storms; loss of physical property; incalculable human cost from loss of life and other damages; droughts that are leading to fires, crop failures, loss of arable land, not just in our country, but, literally, around the world. The facts are clear. But, again, the Trump administration tried to bury this report, and the President himself says he does not believe the report. Well, to put it simply, this is not about beliefs. This is about science. The facts could not be clearer. Climate change is a serious threat to our Nation. It is a threat to our economy, to our national security, and to the planet that we pass on to our children. We need to take action now before it is too late. The report forecasts that more severe storms, droughts, coastal flooding, and other climate effects could reduce the size of the American economy by 10 percent before the end of the century, almost doubling the impact to our economy of the Great Recession of 2008. The recent fires in California were exacerbated by climate change, and more fires are forecast in the Southeast and throughout the West, if action isn’t taken. The agricultural Midwest, from where I come, will be particularly hardhit. This report forecasts the farming sector could lose so much productivity that the crisis of the 1980s could even seem tame. We need to do something. On the national security front, we will be affected. The report says that climate change variability and extreme events, in conjunction with other factors, can exacerbate conflict around the world, as we have already seen. Droughts, floods, storm surges, wildfires, and other extreme events stress nations and people through loss of life, displacement of populations, and impacts on livelihoods, the report continues. While the White House refuses to make climate a priority, I am heartened that the Pentagon continues to treat this threat with the seriousness it deserves and focuses on it as a national security crisis. This is a global challenge. It can only be met with a global response. b2015 It needs the people of the world and the nations of the world to come together. This is literally a call to action for all of the people of the world. That is the power that was behind the Paris climate accord where every nation has come together and said: We must act, and we must act with urgency. The world needs American leadership, and, sadly, this administration is turning away from that responsibility and that obligation. But thankfully, we are seeing many cities, communities, States, and even business leaders saying: We are in. We are not going to step away. The Trump administration continues to say: We are walking away. 
The Trump administration, in fact, continues to make matters worse. They rolled back the Clean Power Plan to slow our transition away from dirty forms of energy. They have undercut environmental regulations to limit methane pollution. Most significantly, last year, the President announced he was withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement. Climate change is a global problem that requires global solutions, and American leadership must play a role. We must stay within the Paris accord. There is still time to fix this problem if we take action today. If we come together as a nation and if we come together as a world, then I hope we can do that in this body. I hope we can do this as a nation, and I hope this country can continue to lead to make sure that we pass on to our children an environment, a climate, and a world that is worthy of the legacy of our great Nation. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so very much for his very forceful words and for the fact that he brought to the table not alternate facts, but real facts laid out by the scientists who put this together. We have a challenge, and I know, with the kind of leadership the gentleman is providing for all of us here in the House of Representatives and back in Illinois, we have no choice but to get this done—and we will. Mr. Speaker, I would like now to turn to my colleague, Mr. PAYNE from New Jersey. We often are here on the floor together. I invite Mr. PAYNE to please join us, and we will talk about this issue as it might affect him and his constituents. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ). Mr. PAYNE. First, Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by thanking my colleague, Congressman GARAMENDI , from the great State of California for hosting this evening’s Special Order hour on the threat climate change poses for our Nation and our constituents. Mr. GARAMENDI has done a great service by hosting timely and important Special Orders throughout the 115th Congress. Today’s Special Order hour is especially important, as it comes on the heels of the Trump administration’s attempt to bury its own climate change report and only a day after devastating fires in California were contained. Because of global climate change, the United States is going to suffer from more frequent and more devastating disasters like Superstorm Sandy, which caused massive flooding in my State in 2012 and the Camp fire, which is the deadliest and most destructive in California’s history. Considering that Donald Trump thinks that climate change is an international conspiracy, a hoax concocted by the Chinese, it came as no surprise to me that he has released his own administration’s climate change report on Black Friday when people are out with their families shopping and not paying attention to what is going on in the news. The U.S. climate assessment is damning. It gives President Trump and his GOP allies no cover to proclaim that climate change isn’t real. The report took our country’s top climate scientists 4 years to research and write. It is more than 1,000 pages long and represents work done by 13 Federal agencies. One of the authors, Katherine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University, summarized the evidence like this: Climate change is happening here and now. If the United States does not act fast, the effects of climate change are only going to get worse for the American people. We already have to deal with increasingly frequent and deadly wildfires, hurricanes, and extreme weather events. That is going to get worse if we don’t curb greenhouse gas emissions that are impacting our climate. Climate change also means that some areas will see more rains and more flooding. Our Nation’s infrastructure is already suffering from neglect, as we have had a Special Order hour on that in the past. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives our infrastructure a Dplus. The stress of more frequent and intense rain, flooding, and heat is likely to cause a great deal of damage to our already frail infrastructure. Flooding will overwhelm and erode our roads. It will stress and possibly bring down bridges. We will have to shut down major roadways, railways, and ports. People’s lives and their livelihoods will be at risk. For my district in New Jersey, the economic impact will be devastating. My constituents work at Port Newark, the busiest in the East. They travel to and from jobs in New York City through the Nation’s busiest tunnels and bridges, which are already overwhelmed. They live on or near the water. Our national infrastructure just wasn’t built for the kinds of extreme weather we can expect if climate change goes unchecked. I have no doubt that the people of New Jersey are resilient, but the longer our Federal Government takes to address climate change, the more difficult it will become to adapt. But it is not just our infrastructure that is at risk if we don’t take action on climate change. If left unchecked, climate change is going to hospitalize and kill our constituents. According to the 2017 New Jersey Climate and Health Profile Report published by Rutgers University, air quality changes, such as increased groundlevel ozone and fine particulate matter changes in the air, will cause a rise in respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. Extreme heat and increasingly frequent heat waves will exacerbate people’s existing medical conditions and cause more heatrelated deaths. Changes to our ecosystem caused by increased humidity and higher temperatures will spread pests and infectious diseases. The vulnerability will not be equal. The people most at risk are people least able to migrate to safety. The elderly, young children, and people with existing medical conditions, poorer residents, urban residents, people of color, and laborers are all the people who are most at risk. The Trump administration and our GOP colleagues can keep their heads buried in the sand or they can work alongside countless people in government, academia, business, and civil society to mitigate the effects of climate change. To borrow a warning from a coauthor of the U.S. climate assessment: ‘‘It’s absolutely not too late to take action. But costs will really start skyrocketing if we don’t start reining in emissions.’’ Mr. Speaker, my Democratic colleagues and I are ready to pursue a greener future for our people. We are ready to transition to cleaner energy sources. We are ready to make sure auto emissions standards reflect 21st century technology. We are ready to make sure all Americans have access to clean air, clean water, and high quality healthcare. The question is: Will our Republican friends join us? Mr. Speaker, I want to once again commend Mr. GARAMENDI for always having these timely Special Order hours on issues that are critical to us at this time. The gentleman never misses a beat in terms of bringing issues to the floor that are relevant, important, and need to be addressed as soon as possible. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, in the gentleman’s discussion, Mr. PAYNE  hit upon a really important issue, and it relates to this. I brought this up because this is where I am coming from on public policy. When FDR said that it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little, normally we think about this in terms of economics, we think about in terms of wages, living standards, and the like. But you hit this squarely, because it is those who have little who are going to be the first and most terribly impacted by climate change. You talked about the vulnerable. You talked about the elderly, the young, the working class, and communities of color. Those who have the least will be the least able to adapt. They won’t be able to afford the additional electric bill for airconditioning. They are the most likely to get sick from the various new illnesses that will work their way into the American healthcare system. As the climate warms, we can expect to have more tropical, hot weather illnesses coming. We see it already. West Nile virus is the example that you gave. So this is very, very relevant. I don’t think FDR had in mind climate change when he talked about this. This is what 
he talked about during the Great Depression. This is relevant today in the era of climate change not just here in the United States, but you look at the poor around the world. For the population of Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world, it is likely that 50 percent or more of that population will have to move because of sea level rise. Ethiopia, where Patti and I served as Peace Corps volunteers, has always been plagued by famine as a result of the climate moving back and forth. It will get worse. So do we provide enough for those who have too little? Across the world this is a key issue. Joining me now is my colleague from California. He and I get to share the great SacramentoSan Joaquin Delta, the greatest estuary on the west coast of the Western Hemisphere. Before I come to Mr. MCNERNEY , I am going to put up one of your favorite things here for him to look at, because I know this is what gets him really excited—clean energy systems. This has been his life’s work, and he can talk about it. When he finishes, we will talk a little bit more about some of these. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCNERNEY ). Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend, for yielding. I want to thank my colleagues here tonight, Mr. PAYNE , Mr. S CHNEIDER , and especially Mr. GARAMENDI , who has been an absolute fierce advocate for action on climate and other issues. He is untiring, and I really have a lot of respect and admiration for that. Let me talk a little bit about the report first. This is a scientific report. It was created over a period of years by scientists. It is not an opinion paper. It is a paper that is based on facts, and it is based on modeling. If you do modeling, then you know what happens is you create a model. You test it against the facts. You adjust the model. You test it against the facts. You adjust it, and you reiterate until your model is pretty accurate. Then you make predictions. That is what has happened here. They have some very welltested models that are predicting very bad things. So it is an important piece of scientific literature, and I think science should be at least involved in the decisionmaking in our great country. Now, I think it is almost laughable that the administration tried to limit the exposure of this report by putting it out on Black Friday. I guess that didn’t work because a lot of people are excited in a negative way about this report and what it says. I think most Americans recognize that there is a problem here. Most all Americans recognize it, especially the millennials and the younger Americans. They know because it is going to affect their lives. Their lives are going to be directly affected more and more as we go forward, so they are very engaged in this issue. I think everyone knows in their hearts that there is a problem here, but I think one of the things that is a challenge is: How do we move forward on this? People don’t like change. People like to assume that their lives are going to go on, and they will do things the way they have always done them. But I think one of the things they are worried about is jobs. b2030 Well, let’s talk about that for a second. Mr. GARAMENDI mentioned that I worked on windmills. I worked on windmills for 25 years. I climbed a lot of windmills. It is a pretty exciting thing to do. You are up there working on something that is cool. You are looking down on the natural environment around you. If I was a coal miner, I would say: That is a pretty good alternative to going down into coals mine and breathing dust as to go up on windmills—kind of cold sometimes— but to go up on windmills and work your heart out and create clean energy. So another thing to think about is the number of jobs per energy produced. Renewable energies create a lot more jobs per unit of energy produced. That is an important consideration. So why can’t we move forward? I think the economy is going to improve if we reduce our consumption of fossil fuels. It will create jobs. It will make the environment cleaner. We will have less health impacts than we are seeing from fossil fuels, from coal, from oil, and certainly see a lot less climate impacts. There are a lot of really good reasons to move forward on this. I think if you can look at what America and the world would be like if we weaned ourselves off fossil fuels, it is a beautiful picture. We will have a lot of clean energy. We will have people employed. We will have people using electricity for transportation. We will have energy generated from windmills, solar, geothermal, and from all of these technologies that are there today that are economic and costeffective. In fact, wind and solar are more than competitive with fossil fuels. You can produce more energy per cost of energy with wind and solar than you can with oil and coal. They say natural gas is a great transition fuel, but if you only lose 2 percent of natural gas emissions in the process of creating energy, then you are already undoing the energy efficiency advantage of natural gas because natural gas methane is so effective as a climate change gas. I think we have a lot to look forward to if we determine and decide that we are going to move forward with this transition. One last thing. I want to say I have a challenge to the President. Mr. President, we know that climate change is happening. If you want to go down as a great President, if you want to go down in history as someone that changed history, as someone who changed history for the better, than embrace climate change action. Make a difference. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, before the gentleman leaves, I brought this up because I know that these wind turbines, these windmills are part of the gentleman’s life. You spent, as you say 25, 26 years building these systems. I believe he was doing it in Altamont Pass in California, which is now part of his district and adjacent to mine. It was 1978, 1979 that California passed the very first laws in the nation to provide a State tax credit for wind, solar, and conservation. I was the author of that law. The gentleman and I go back a long, long way here on this issue, Mr. Speaker, and we are not going to give up. As he said, it is about the next generation. I have got here on my phone, which I know I cannot use on the floor, so I am not going to turn it on, but I have a picture of my 13th grandchild, who was born yesterday. It is those children, that young boy and his generation, that will either curse us or thank us. Thank us because we had the courage, we had the wisdom to attack this problem; or curse us because we didn’t. I believe that we have the wisdom. We have people like Mr. MCNERNEY  who has spent his life working on this, both in the private sector and now in Congress. I thank him so very much for that determination to address this critical issue. I thank him for joining us tonight. I have noticed the EastWest show is back in town. Mr. TONKO and I started doing this 7 years ago. Climate change and energy issues were what we talked about back then. This was some of his work when he was working in the State government in New York City, as I recall. Not that he always talked about it on the floor, but he occasionally would point out that he was working, trying to create the new technologies that would address this problem. I thank him for joining us this evening. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative GARAMENDI for leading us in this Special Order that speaks to an urgency. More and more, people are beginning to recognize that it is within our responsibility to provide for the stewardship of our Earth, of the environment, and to pass it on to generations coming. As you just acknowledged the birth of a grandson, congratulations to Mr. GARAMENDI and his wife, Patti. It is important, it is incumbent upon us to do that. When we see the denial and the disregard—the denial for science, for climate change as a concept; the disregard for the Earth, the environment, and for public health—it is troublesome. Here we have in recent weeks heard about and presented the U.N. report through the IPCC, the international committee that looks at climate change, and they are indicating that 
there is precious little time, if any, by which to act—a timeframe that is becoming more and more urgent. It is so important for us to address the science of this issue, to look at the stats, to look at the data that is compelling, that speaks to everything from public health to job creation to a greening up of our thinking so that our policy and our resource advocacy will go toward what is a crisis situation. Just very, very recent, we have witnessed a report on the climate that is under the auspices of the Trump administration where they have responded to the United States Global Change Research Program, a Presidential initiative started by President Ronald Reagan that incorporates, I believe, some 13 agencies and their thinking about climate change. Members of his own cabinet are recommending and advising and he is rejecting. I simply don’t understand how we can ask people to utilize their expertise, invest their time and energy into forecasting where we are going to be and where we are, acknowledging where we are, and the work that is needed, and then to walk away from that presentation based on facts and science and data. You have witnessed at your end of the country what has happened with wildfires. I have seen 500year storms three or four times over in a decade. So the nomenclature is even off target. We are witnessing tremendous damage, loss of lives, property damage, and farming impacts with very rich soil being washed away, erosion of our coastal zones. What more do we need to have as evidence? The Department of Defense; the farming community; the business community; States like California, the gentleman’s home state; and New York, my home State, get it. We pull out of a Paris accord because we are not going to be part of an international community—the only industrial nation to pull out of that accord? It is revolting that we will not respond to this issue. As you indicated, we have been talking about this, we have been pushing this leadership since 2010 with the takeover of the House. We began our efforts in 2008 and 2009. We needed to continue to move forward. The efforts to go forward have been thwarted by a resistance to addressing this issue. I find it unacceptable. As we look upon the next few weeks before we take over with the majority in the House, we need to set a very ambitious tone that will move us forward with a number of issues being addressed under the umbrella of climate change. We have witnessed what has happened out there with the economy. We have calculated the hundreds of billions of dollars that are impacted because of public health costs, the damage to property, and the like. We need to move forward. We need to do this based on science and factual evidence that is available, that is at our fingertips. The time for denial is over. The time for disregard is over. The time for action is now. And we need to move forward, even asking as ranker on the Environment Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee for hearings in this regard, just hearings so that we can take testimony and advance the cause of the action that is required. Those requests have been falling on deaf ears. So we need to do better. We need to move forward with a sound plan and to understand that across the country more and more people are expressing their concern about climate change. They are witnessing it in the news every night. These wildfires have been greater in number, in severity. I believe this is probably the worst in history. So we need to do a lot more. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, Mr. TONKO said something a moment ago that I know will happen. He is presently the ranking member of the Environment Subcommittee of Energy and Commerce. In about 1 month I believe he is going to be the chairman of that committee. The hearings on this issue, the Fourth Annual Climate Assessment, will finally be heard and the issue will finally be before the Congress. It has been 8 long years of denial by the Republicanled Congress and 2 years by the current President. I know that in his role—and I believe he will be the chairperson of that committee— he will make sure that America and the Congress know and understand this critical issue. I look forward to those hearings. I look forward to his leadership on it, and once again to be on the floor with the gentleman with what we fondly call the East Coast WestCoast program. We are back. Mr. TONKO. Absolutely. Coastto coast this is an issue. We know that where there are innovative concepts, where there is an embracing of an aggressive agenda like in California, like in New York, there are ways to advance green energy, clean energy, innovation when it comes to efficiency, to make certain that those greenhouse gas emissions are addressed. It is within our control. So the human activity here, the human element, yes, is driving some of this. I know there are those who say I believe in climate change, but not humaninspired. Whether or not you believe that to be true, is it so bad to make cleaner the air we breathe, safer the water we drink, remediate the soils we require? These are important factors that can grow significant jobs in research, prototype development, and in product design. So let’s move forward. The evidence is compelling. The temperatures have risen some 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit since 1901. That is major change. The warming, in large part, is due to human activity. The continuation of burning fossil fuels, adding to the greenhouse gas emissions out there, is unacceptable. Sixteen of the last 17 years are the warmest years on record. And there are those saying: Well, it’s just a cycle. Well, that is a long stretch of time. There is no sign out there that it is going to stop. There is no pause there as a warning. Basically, the science that we have today, technology continues to advance in a way that enables us to have shelfready opportunity, the cleverness, the intellect that we harvest in this country, the intellect that allows us to design and understand concepts like capturing waste heat so that we can get more energy out of traditional designs, is a way to advance this cause. The green power that the gentleman just talked about with my fellow colleague from California, Representative MCNERNEY , these are real. They are not pie in the sky. They are happening as we speak. We just have to show the will and break the pattern that has been just too comfortable for us to go forward and say: Oh, well, it is greenhouse gas emissions. And, yes, there is a lot of damage out there, but that should be telling us we are already paying for greenhouse gas emissions, we are already paying for climate change, and we need to change that saga. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, indeed, we are paying for it in so many way. I showed earlier the fires, the floods, the sea level rise that is already occurring, the storm surge that recently affected the Panhandle of Florida. All of these things are the reality of today. And it is not going to go away. The gentleman cited several facts. This is one of our programs that we used 8 years ago. It is this slide. Eight years ago we used this in our Make It in America presentations and we talked about the wind turbines and solar. That is actually an electric bus made by a bus manufacturer in California, the Gillig company. They are using that. These electric buses are part of the future, as are electric cars. b2045 All of these are the new jobs. These are the new technologies. These are where people will be going to work. So that is where the jobs are. These are jobs that won’t be exported. These are American jobs. The maintenance of this, all of these things are available today. The gentleman mentioned California. Yes, California is way out in front, really, competing with New York on who can be the best to decarbonize, to move away from it. Unfortunately, the administration is going exactly the wrong direction. The President wants to do away with the mileage standards, the fuel mileage standards for automobiles, wants to reintroduce coal back into the economy, which is the worst of all energy sources. We don’t need to do that. We can do it. We have proven that it can be done, in California and other places, in other parts of the world. We cannot go backwards. We owe it to the future generations. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, as Mr. GARAMENDI presented that panel with Make It In America, it reminds me that, as you solve this crisis, as you speak to carbon pollution, you are going across so many policy areas: economic development, transportation, health, job training, certainly science and technology, energy and commerce. All of these disciplines. It just travels across all of these areas of activity because the solution is multifaceted. We need to do that. I talk to folks who will say: Gee, my newborn, or the youngest of our family, is struggling with asthma. And they are saying: I hear that asthma is up. I say: Well, have you related it to carbon pollution? The public health cost, the public health impact here is tremendous. So, as we work on this, we are allowing for policy in so many different areas to take hold so that we can go forward with an inclusivity that allows for a lot of work to be done, which generates jobs, oftentimes with research. And research equals jobs—sound, paying jobs. Mr. GARAMENDI. Exactly. Mr. Speaker, Mr. TONKO mentioned asthma. We Democrats campaigned on a better deal for the people, which I just happened to put up here: A better deal for the people. We talked about healthcare. Asthma is a preexisting condition. We have a challenge to deal with the Affordable Care Act and the Republican attempt to reinstitute insurance companies being able to discriminate based upon preexisting conditions. All of these things will tie back: job creation, new technologies, research, healthcare. All of this, in one way or another, comes back to this question of climate change. So we need to address it. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, let me just address some of those that aren’t as clearly connected. Mr. GARAMENDI talks about the need to address public health and to address that bending of the cost curve for healthcare. Well, wellness is an important part. If we can reduce the number of asthma cases, we are doing a big share of the activity that is required. Also, one would never expect, perhaps, that the Department of Defense would be out front on this issue. Why? Because they see a population boom around the world, and they see eroding land and crop failure because of drought. Well, they see that as civil unrest. They see it as a situation that can be damaging to the world community. That civil unrest is of great concern to the Department of Defense. So there are these dynamics that seem so disconnected from this overall topic of carbon pollution. And, yes, when people are faced with that direct question—Where are you on carbon pollution?—of course it is the logical thing: Reduce it. Reduce it. It doesn’t take that much of an effort. It takes the will to go forward and relate to energy efficiency, relate to greening up our policy, relate to renewable energy, battery development as a linchpin that can provide more certainty and predictability. We have it within our capacity, and I am convinced we will move forward as a House come January addressing this issue that has languished for far too long. Mr. Speaker, I again thank the gentleman for leading us in this discussion this evening. It is critical; it is vitally important; it will save dollars; and it will grow jobs. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. TONKO very much for joining us. This issue is about those of us who are here today, but it is, far more importantly, about those who will be in the future. I want to dedicate this hour to a very special person, our new grandson, Grady Christopher Bardet, who was born yesterday afternoon. Mr. TONKO. Congratulations. Mr. GARAMENDI. He will live in the future, either a very good future that we and our colleagues here build for him, or one that is not. To Faith and Eric Bardet, we love you. Thank you for this beautiful gift. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

.S7103 Vol. 164 WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 2018 No. 186 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was called to order by
