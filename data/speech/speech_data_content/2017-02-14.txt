Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Court Reporting and Captioning Week and in 
appreciation of court reporters across the country. Court reporters play a critical role in our communities. They are the guardians of our public record. They have unique skills translating the spoken word into text to be recorded for history. They preserve judicial proceedings and assist individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing. I have seen firsthand the dedication and professionalism shown by court reporters from my time as a special prosecutor in Wisconsin and, more importantly, from my wife Tawni, who has been a court reporter in western Wisconsin for nearly 25 years. I wish her a happy Valentine’s Day today. In addition to the critical role court reporters play in the courtroom, the National Court Reporters Association and its members have made significant contributions to the success of the Veterans History Project. The Veterans History Project, which was created by legislation that I authored, is the largest oral history collection in the world, having collected over 100,000 stories from our Nation’s veterans. Their stories are permanently stored at the Library of Congress and are available to the public. Shortly after the Veterans History Project was launched in 2000, my wife Tawni encouraged court reporters across the country to partner with the Library of Congress to assist in transcribing veterans’ stories; and to date, court reporters have submitted over 4,000 oral history transcripts to the Library of Congress. Not only have court reporters been willing to work with the Library of Congress to transcribe stories that had already been submitted, but many court reporters have personally gone and interviewed veterans in their local communities. For example, last August, at the court reporters’ national convention, the National Court Reporters Foundation celebrated Purple Heart Day by interviewing eight Purple Heart recipients for the Veterans History Project. Additionally, the National Court Reporters Foundation recently launched a new program called the HardofHearing Heroes Project, where veterans with profound hearing loss will be interviewed for the Veterans History Project through the use of realtime captioning. This is important because, according to the VA, hearing loss is one of the most common servicerelated injuries, and it is estimated that 60 percent of our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer some form of hearing loss. The program will help ensure every veteran has a chance to share his or her story. As we celebrate National Court Reporting and Captioning Week, I want to thank the National Court Reporters Association and its many members throughout the country for their hard work and professionalism. I especially want to thank the court reporters for their significant contributions to the Veterans History Project and to preserving veterans’ stories for generations to come. 
VENEZUELA SANCTIONS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN ) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the new administration, including Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, OFAC, took decisive action to hold Venezuelan regime officials accountable for their elicit activity. The announcement was that two Venezuelan nationals were labeled as ‘‘specially designated narcotics traffickers’’ pursuant to the Kingpin Act, including Venezuela’s second in command, the Vice President of Venezuela, and his front man, Lopez Bello. It also identified 13 companies owned or controlled by these individuals or other designated parties that pose a serious threat to U.S. national security as well as the U.S. and global financial systems. These designations were long overdue, Mr. Speaker, and represent a significant first step in what appears to be a positive, fundamental shift in our policy toward Venezuela. Just yesterday, my colleague MARIO DIAZBALART and I met with Vice President PENCE to discuss Venezuela and how Congress and the administration can work together to craft a positive agenda to help the people in Latin America suffering without democracy or human rights. Last week, Senator BOBMENENDEZ of New Jersey and I led a bipartisan and bicameral letter—together with 32 of our congressional colleagues—to the President urging his administration to take immediate action against the Maduro regime for his illicit activity and for its gross human rights abuses. While this round of sanctions target the illegal drug activities of these officials, this is just the tip of the corruption iceberg in Venezuela, Mr. Speaker. In fact, Venezuela’s socalled Executive Vice President has facilitated drug shipments, has protected drug traffickers in Venezuela, and has alleged links with the U.S.designated foreign terrorist organization and Iranian proxy, Hezbollah. According to OFAC, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the second individual also sanctioned is Lopez Bello, who laundered drug proceeds and generated significant profits as a result of illegal activities. Holy Toledo. While these announced sanctions were a critical first step, it pales in comparison to the dire humanitarian situation that Maduro and his cronies have created for the people of Venezuela. Mr. Speaker, Venezuela has been on a downward spiral for years, and there have been bipartisan calls from Congress to take action in support of the Venezuelan people. Maduro’s failed economic policies have the country with the highest inflation rate in the world leaving his people without food, without basic necessities, without medical supplies. In most areas, hospitals and groceries have shut down due to lack of supplies, and the people of Venezuela are forced to ransack what is left of these hospitals and stores for the basic survival of their families. How does the regime react when they see the suffering of their own citizens? They are lining their own pockets at the expense and the suffering of the Venezuelan people. An AP report showed that seniorlevel officials like Generals Rodolfo Marco Torres and Carlos Osorio are allegedly orchestrating fraudulent schemes with suspected shell companies to personally profit, instead of bringing food to the people. Opposition leaders like Leopoldo Lopez and Antonio Ledesma are still in jail or under house arrest. Leaders like Maria Corina Machado of the National Congress is still not allowed to travel outside her country. This is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. Their socalled crimes: speaking out against the Maduro regime and standing up for democratic principles. The regime stifles all who stand for democracy and freedom in Venezuela. The opposition is vilified, is persecuted, and is arrested on false charges. We must show Venezuelans that their fight is not in vain, that their actions are seen, and that their cries are heard. Next on the sanctions list should be the judges and officers of these kangaroo courts in Venezuela who are behind this unwarranted incarceration and are responsible for the injustices and human rights violations. Mr. Speaker, this is what America is all about. We stand firmly by our values, firmly in our ideals, and we promote and defend them, and we try to have other parts of the world be enlightened in this way. Hope is dwindling quickly in Venezuela. As human rights violations multiply, now is the time to hold Venezuelan regime officials accountable, and we urge all responsible nations to join us in this struggle. 
b1015 LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, if you would have asked me when I first got elected to Congress, would I ever expect to be in a position, months after a Presidential election, about whether or not the integrity of that election was at stake, I would have said ‘‘of course not.’’ Our democracy’s strength is that any adult has an equal say in it through their vote; that the wealthiest or the poorest, the youngest or the oldest adult, regardless of their gender, race, 
religion, or sexual orientation, we all have an equal say in our democracy via our vote; which is why the vote is so important. It is the great equalizer and it gives us confidence in our government, that whoever the people select to be President should be the force of the majority. But the concern I am speaking about today is the concern that somehow the election this past November might have been interfered with by another government. Now, I know we have all heard about the intelligence community’s classified report regarding Russian hacking and interference in our elections. I have read it and so have many of my colleagues. And, allegedly, President Trump has read the document as well. My concern is that we seem to have different interpretations of a document that is very clear about unprecedented outside interference. For those of us who have read it, shock. Shock that another country would be so cavalier in their approach to interfere with an election, to manipulate the truth, to go farther than we have ever seen in trying to get the outcome they wanted and ultimately got. There is no secret that President Trump has an unnerving affection for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has called Putin ‘‘very smart.’’ He claimed Putin was a better leader than Barack Obama. And Trump even defended Putin in a recent interview with a FOX News talk show host. The connections to Russia and his Cabinet are equally unnerving. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had numerous business dealings with Russia, and was even recognized by Putin with the Order of Friendship in 2013. But it doesn’t stop there. Just last week, U.S. investigators confirmed that parts of the 35page intelligence dossier, compiled by a former British spy, were accurate. The dossier contained still unconfirmed details of an alltoocozy relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Trump Cabinet. Just yesterday, President Trump’s own National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned after being busted for having potentially illegal conversations with the Russian Government regarding lifting sanctions on the country prior to President Trump taking office; conversations he had previously misled to the FBI and the Vice President. Who else knew about Flynn, and when did they know about it? Now, I don’t bring this up as an effort to get back into a Cold War with Russia, as some seem to condone. I am disgusted by the Russian Government’s scapegoating of the LGBT community and their authoritarian approach to civic affairs. I think getting back into a Cold War would be a terrible idea, and there are some areas around the globe where we could welcome cooperation to solve humanitarian crises. My concern lies in that the Russian Government did something, hacking and interfering in our elections with the intent of electing their choice for President, Donald Trump. That must be addressed through sanctions and safeguards to make sure it never happens again. If anyone in the executive branch is suggesting lifting any sanctions after what just happened, there needs to be a public dialogue about why, because if they read the same report that I did, there is no way that would be the appropriate response. But given President Trump’s unwillingness to accept the reality of the Russian interference in our election, given the closeness of several leading members of the President’s Cabinet to Russia, and given the recent resignation of our National Security Adviser over his dealings with Russia, I feel it is imperative that the American people get all the facts. Should we be lifting sanctions against a country our intelligence community tells us intentionally, and in multiple ways, tried to interfere with our elections and, ultimately, get the person they wanted elected? Or should we be doing even more to guarantee the sovereignty of our country and the integrity of our elections in every possible way? Currently, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are investigating Russian interference with our elections, and I applaud them for taking the issue so seriously. Personally, I would love to see an outside, nonpartisan, independent review as well. However, we need to take this right to the people. The classified report about election interference by the Russians could, in my opinion, with appropriate protections, be declassified so that the American people could see it for themselves. Mr. President, I request you ask for that report to be fully declassified. If your administration’s assertions are correct, let the American people see it. Let the truth come out. But my guess is, when they see the totality of the report, there will be a lot of explaining for this administration to do, both about our response to Russia and how we protect our elections in the future. It is really that simple. Let the people decide. Declassify the report. 
HONORING BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY ON ITS 70TH ANNIVERSARY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Brookhaven National Laboratory on its 70th anniversary. The United States is the greatest Nation in the world, and one of the reasons why is Brookhaven National Laboratory. Their science research is aggressively pursuing cures to illnesses, protecting our national security, and increasing our energy independence. Imagine being able to witness a recreation of the very beginning of our universe, a replica of the primordial soup which once comprised all that had existed right before your very eyes. Also imagine that this very same equipment could be used to find cures to illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. I am proud that Brookhaven National Laboratory is located in the greatest congressional district in America, the First Congressional District of New York. For nearly threequarters of a century, Brookhaven has stood as a world class research center that conducts groundbreaking studies within the scientific community. Brookhaven asks the big questions that scientists have been researching for generations, and has allowed us to look into the building blocks of our world. Between preservation of our ecosystem, studies on the environment, and researching new forms of sustainable energy, Brookhaven is a world leader in scientific research. There is also incredible cultural and historical relevance of the site of Brookhaven National Laboratory. There was once a World War I Army training center called Camp Upton located where Brookhaven stands today. It was at this camp that Irving Berlin wrote ‘‘God Bless America’’ while serving in the U.S. Army. Brookhaven is not only a local and regional treasure, but also a national asset. The machines in Brookhaven have been utilized by the most brilliant minds in America, from the scientists of MIT and Yale to the engineers at GE and IBM. While there are 17 national labs across our great country, Brookhaven is a unique user facility which focuses in a number of disciplines, not limited to particle physics, chemical engineering, and systems engineering and integration. In previous Congresses, critical funding has been provided in support of the ARPAE program for several of Brookhaven’s phenomenal projects on energy production and storage, and so much more. There has been discussion in the past to cut funding for Brookhaven’s nuclear physics program to levels that haven’t been seen since 2008. This would be a mistake. Brookhaven features some of the most important scientific efforts in the world, with assets like the National Synchrotron Light Source II, or NSLS II. NSLSII has allowed for incredible advancement in the research and development of super conductors, which have the potential to revolutionize energy consumption in the U.S. and save into the billions for the American people and American businesses. Another program in need of our continued support is the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, or RHIC. This multifaceted machine is essential for studies on matter and has key practical applications, like figuring out 
how to best protect our homeland using detector technology. There is also the Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer, or BLIP, which has been recently upgraded to advance the field of medical science. This upgrade allows BLIP to better diagnose and treat illnesses, including heart disease and many forms of cancer, such as leukemia and melanoma. With Congress’ continued support, there is limitless potential for needed discovery and advancement. I thank the Speaker for allowing me to discuss this amazing national treasure. I also thank Doon Gibbs, who is the lab director, for his outstanding leadership at this facility. It is a privilege to stand here on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to speak on behalf of America’s great scientists and their vital work. Congratulations again to Brookhaven National Laboratory on 70 years of groundbreaking, innovative research. And to everyone at home, Happy Valentine’s Day. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JOE WILLIAMS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a loving family man, a great friend, a veteran, a civil rights leader, and former Fresno City Council member, Joe Williams. Joe passed away last week at the age of 79. He was a loving husband, father, and grandfather. He dedicated much of his life to public service. No matter whether you were a good friend or you hardly knew Joe, he had a way of making everyone feel important and special. In 1968, he started a 26year career at the Fresno Economic Opportunities Commission. After 2 years of serving as the director of the Fresno County Head Start, Joe was promoted to serve as the executive director for Fresno EOC. During his tenure at the Fresno EOC, he established 35 new programs, with a budget starting at $1.8 million, growing it to $37 million. With the help of over 670 employees in the Fresno EOC, he was able to implement so many important programs, such as the Women, Infants, and Children program, otherwise known as WIC; opened the first rural health clinic in Fresno County; and started Meals on Wheels programs for seniors. But he didn’t stop there. Joe was a doer. He created a sanctuary program for homeless youth, which was established and later named in his honor upon Joe’s retirement. Under his leadership, the Fresno EOC became a model for similar programs around the Nation, one of the truly outstanding leaders in terms of community action agencies in the country. Joe made that happen. In 1977, he became the first African American elected to the Fresno City Council. He served two terms and was always an advocate for what was best for the entire city. He said: You know, you’ve got to feel it in your gut; and if it’s there, you do it. He was a civil rights leader in our San Joaquin Valley and throughout the State and the Nation, encouraging others to do the right thing. My thoughts and prayers are with Joe’s wife, Laura; their children, Michael and his wife, Sonya, Winston, and Terri; his brother, George; his grandchildren, greatgrandchildren, and numerous nieces and nephews. My colleagues, I ask you to join me in paying tribute to the life and times of Joe Williams. He will be remembered in a selfless way in which he lived his life, always looking to help those in the community who needed help. As Emerson once said: ‘‘To have a friend is first to be a friend.’’ Thank you, Joe, for being my friend and being the friend of our community. I join his family in honoring his life and love and service to our country, and he will be greatly missed. FLOODING CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA  
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the flood conditions in California. It is either feast or famine. We either had the last 6 years of some of the driest conditions we have experienced in over 1,000 or, in the last 2 months, record rain and snow in the mountains and, thus, floods that we are experiencing. This last weekend I joined on an official tour of Merced County with Sheriff Warnke. In Le Grand, this weekend we had 25 homes in my district that were evacuated. I commend the collaboration between the Merced County officials, the California Office of Emergency Services, and FEMA for rightly declaring a state of emergency for the flooding that is happening and may continue with new storms coming. My thoughts are with the people in Butte, and Sutter and Yuba Counties. The emergency spillway that could be compromised at Oroville Dam is something that we are all concerned about; 200,000 people, as we know, have been evacuated from their homes. That is why I joined Congressman GARAMENDI and my colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump requesting, as the government has asked, a Major Disaster Declaration under the Stafford Act. A Major Disaster Declaration will provide greater collaboration among local, State, and Federal governments, and will provide immediate resources where they are most needed. Additionally, we must invest in California’s infrastructure needs. Its water infrastructure needs to fix a broken water system. The President has proposed a significant massive infrastructure program, $1 trillion. That could be used not only in California, but throughout the entire country. We need additional water storage in order to prevent devastating flood conditions as we are having now, and also to store that water so we can have it during the dry conditions. So two things go hand in hand. There are another series of storms expected later this week, and we still have about 2 months left of our winter season. Therefore, we need all hands on deck. We are using every tool available to reduce the potential flood and damage and accidents that are there, but we must invest to fix this broken water system. The President’s proposal will allow us to provide additional surface storage supply to not only protect against flooding, but also to store that water so that when we have the dry periods in California, we can use that water for our crops and for the people who need it the most. f 
b1030 HISTORIC BRISTOL BOROUGH, PENNSYLVANIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about Bristol Borough, Pennsylvania, a picturesque town in my district situated along the Delaware River midway between Philadelphia and New York. Since 1824, Bristol Borough has embraced the motto ‘‘Welcome Friend’’ after a sign greeted Marquis de Lafayette on his ‘‘Farewell Tour of America.’’ Bristol Borough continues to welcome newcomers to an incredibly caring community of residents and leaders pushing the town into the future. Bristol Borough’s history closely parallels the economic, commercial, and industrial history of the United States. In the late 1960s, U.S. Steel Corporation closed their facilities just up the road, and thousands of employees lost their jobs. In turn, downtown Bristol Borough lost an incredible amount of traffic. But what the people did not lose was their passionate desire to improve their town, restoring its former glory with an eye to an even brighter future. Mr. Speaker, the people of Bristol Borough are tough, resilient, and they have grit. Smallbusiness owners in downtown Bristol are revitalizing their town, and they have been noticed. As a finalist in the nationwide Small Business Revolution, Bristol Borough shines a spotlight on the vital impact small businesses have on our economy, our communities, and our daily lives. As a member of the House Committee on Small Business, I pledge my commitment to pursue policies that protect and foster these small businesses and that make Bucks County truly a great place to live. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, heroin and prescription opioid abuse are devastating communities across 
our Nation. From Levittown to Lower Salford, no part of my district is left unaffected by this epidemic. Last year in Bucks County, opioidrelated deaths rose by 50 percent. In Montgomery County, opioid overdoses claimed a staggering 240 lives. Mr. Speaker, every fatality represents a family crushed by the overwhelming loss of a loved one. As lawmakers, we have the responsibility to act. Passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the 21st Century Cures Act were monumental first steps in countering the opioid crisis, but we must continue to press the issue from all sides, from the trafficking of narcotics across our border to preventing the overprescribing of painkillers. Congress alone cannot solve this problem. We must be ready and willing to work with State and local leaders, law enforcement, healthcare professionals, and educators in our districts. We are all stakeholders in this challenge. Together, we can eradicate this epidemic, we can protect our families, and we can free our communities from this menace. 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington (Mr. HECK) for 5 minutes. Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, it may be Valentine’s Day, but I rise today to share a story of a Christmas miracle. Now, this is little Gracie, and she was born on Christmas Day in 2015. Unfortunately, not too long after she was born, she was diagnosed with a respiratory virus. It is a very bad thing for little people because they have little lungs and little respiratory airways. Frankly, it can be extremely dangerous. To make matters worse, she was snowed in at the hospital where she was born. She had to spend 5 days at the NICU before they could transport her to a children’s hospital. When she finally did arrive at Seattle Children’s Hospital, she had pneumonia, E. coli, and a collapsed lung. But, fortunately, little Gracie is a fighter, as was her medical team, and she made a complete and full recovery. With coverage through Medicaid, her parents were able to focus on her care and her future. The financial stress of hospital bills that come with intensive care, a cardiac catheter, a life flight, and numerous medications was daunting, but it was not devastating. Gracie’s story is just one example of the difference Medicaid expansion through the ACA has made for millions of children throughout our Nation. Mr. Speaker, when I am home, I hear these stories all day long about how the ACA has made a real difference in the lives of people. The ACA in my State expanded coverage to more than 750,000 people. In fact, this January, we hit record enrollment of 225,000 sign ups. That is a 13 percent jump from last year. The ACA is working for many people across America; but let’s be honest: we have also heard the other stories from people who aren’t seeing these gains. Instead, they are seeing higher premiums and increased medical costs in general, with little improvement in coverage. Those are legitimate concerns that Congress needs to address. But whenever Congress makes major changes, such as Social Security or Medicare, or enacts big ideas, there will always be unexpected results in parts of the program that don’t function as anticipated or designed. Our job is to follow up, see what works, and adapt accordingly going forward. Even the best laws are going to require some adjustment. Let’s do that. Let’s do it the smart way, the American way, and work together to fix the parts of the ACA that need fixing while maintaining that which works. Repeal and replace is not the answer. It is not the answer. Working together to fix it is the answer. As we continue—or begin—to work together, I hope we will remember Gracie and know that health care is not a miracle. Health care is the result of hardworking doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals and a financially viable healthcare system and our actions here to support that in Congress. We all come here for lots of reasons: philosophy, values, and ideology. We come here to represent our districts and their major components. I have the privilege to represent Joint Base LewisMcChord, the largest force projection base on the West Coast, and many thousands of State employees—I have the State capital—who work every day to elevate the human condition of their friends and neighbors. We come here to represent the 672,554 people of our districts. Mostly, I hope, however, that we come here to represent the Gracies of our districts. What I believe deep in my soul is that, if we will keep Gracie and the Gracies of our district in our hearts and foremost in our minds, if we keep them as our touchstone and our North Star, then America is going to be all right. I plead with you to do just that. 
CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF SAVANNAH’S NAACP The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the NAACP’s Savannah branch. In July of 1917, James Weldon Johnson, field secretary of the NAACP, established Georgia’s first NAACP branch in Savannah with 68 original members. Similar to other NAACP branches, the Savannah branch pursues political, educational, social, and economic equality of minority groups and citizens. For the last 100 years, Savannah’s NAACP branch has fought to eradicate racial hatred and discrimination in the community. Its first meeting of 2017 was held on January 22 at St. Paul Christian Methodist Episcopal Church to install new officers and leadership. I am proud to recognize today the branch’s new officials, including President Al Scott, Vice Presidents W. Richard Shinhoster, Lynette Hymes, Barbara Magwood, Secretary Linda Carter, and Treasurer Joe Lang. I am confident in this leadership’s ability to continue to uphold the values of the NAACP and help Savannah serve as an example to the nearly 75 NAACP branches Georgia has today. REMEMBERING STETSON BENNETT , JR. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember a lifelong public servant, Mr. Stetson Bennett, Jr., of Jesup, Georgia, who passed away on Thursday, February 9, 2017, at 87 years old. Mr. Bennett was born in 1929 to Reverend Stetson Bennett, Sr., and Irene Bennett in Wayne County. He graduated from Jesup High School in 1947, before attending Auburn University. Around this time, he also married his wife, Patsy Jones. They were married for more than 69 years. Mr. Bennett first entered public service in 1949, as chief deputy clerk. By 1965, he was elected clerk of superior court and served nearly 50 years. Recognized by the Georgia House of Representatives as the longest serving constitutional officer in Georgia, Mr. Bennett has received a number of honors throughout his career. His dedicated service earned him Clerk of the Year Award in 1985, the highest honor a clerk can receive. Fittingly, the award is now named in honor of Mr. Bennett. Perhaps his proudest achievement was when the citizens of Wayne County officially named the main courtroom the Stetson Bennett, Jr. Courtroom in honor of his years of service to the community he loved. In addition, he served as the president of the Wayne County Chamber of Commerce, was an active member of the Lions Club, and helped develop Wayne Memorial Hospital as a member of its board. Mr. Bennett was always proud of where he came from, which was clear from how selflessly he dedicated his life to Wayne County. He truly will be missed. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask for your thoughts and prayers for Mrs. Leigh Ryan, a Tybee Island mother of two who is battling an aggressive form of cancer. Originally from Roberta, Georgia, Mrs. Ryan settled on Tybee Island 20 years ago to work as a nurse at Memorial University Medical Center. Since arriving on Tybee Island, giving back to the community has been a top priority for Mrs. Ryan, who is a member of Junior League and often works with the homeless in the area. 
She was originally diagnosed with breast cancer in the fall of 2015, but through treatment, Mrs. Ryan believed herself to be cancer free. Unfortunately, around Thanksgiving of 2016, doctors told her the cancer was back. With Mrs. Ryan’s twin 8yearold daughters in mind, a close friend began fundraising to help care for Mrs. Ryan’s children as she continues her treatment. The community returned the kindness she showed them and raised more than $40,000 for Mrs. Ryan in the first week of collecting donations. It is inspiring to see a community come together to help someone in need, especially someone who has already done so much for the community. Please keep Mrs. Ryan, her daughters, and the generous community of Tybee Island in your thoughts. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of my dear friend, Mr. Randell Kicklighter, who passed away on Saturday, February 11, at the age of 74. Randell, as he was known to his family and friends, was an icon in the Garden City, Georgia, community. He spent his life helping others, sharing wisdom, and brightening people’s days. At the age of 18, he met the love of his life, Bessie. Ten months after the couple met, they ran away and married. Randell went on to serve 2 years in the United States Army, making sure to always have Bessie by his side. During this period, the couple spent time in both the U.S. and Germany serving our Nation. When Randell returned from duty, he decided to go to beauty school and become a hairdresser, which would allow him to work beside Bessie every day. They opened a salon called Randell and Dean’s, which quickly gained a reputation around Garden City. Clients would say you could not expect a quick trim because long conversations with Randell were a must. I can attest to this firsthand. You see, Randell kept my hair for over 37 years. Many times it was just he and I together, and he was truly one of my best friends. However, Randell worked harder than nearly anyone around. He never retired and worked until the last day in his salon. Each day after work, Randell would head to the gym to exercise. Even there, he continued his hard work and long conversations. In the 1960s, Randell won many power lifting competitions. Then, at the age of 61, he competed and won national bodybuilding competitions. Even at the gym, Randell was talking to people about his children and grandchildren and sharing tips about exercise. Randell was one of my best friends, and I will miss him, as will everyone who had the honor of knowing him. OUR CRUMBLING NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) for 5 minutes. Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, candidate Trump talked a lot about the need to invest $1 trillion in our crumbling infrastructure, and President Trump, on Inauguration Day, referenced again the need to invest in our infrastructure. There has been little progress since that point and no major proposals. Last week, I talked about surface transportation. I am running a clock on the costs to the American economy and the American people of not investing in roads, bridges, highways, and transit. That clock started at noon on the 20th of Inauguration Day, and it is now up to $11 billion. That is the cost to the American people, to the economy, of not investing. This week we have seen a dramatic new example in a different area of infrastructure of the costs of not investing: the evacuation of 130,000 people below the Oroville Dam in California. This shouldn’t be happening. Federal and State officials warned that the dam didn’t meet current safety standards in 2005, yet no investments and no improvements were made. I wish this were an isolated example. Unfortunately, 96 percent of the dams in America are owned by State, local, and private entities, and many are in need of upgrades or a complete overhaul. Fifty years is the estimated lifetime of a dam. There are 50,000 dams that are past that lifetime, and some of them are safety critical, that is, if they fail, people will die. b1045 The American Society of Civil Engineers gives us a D. They say by 2020, 70 percent of our dams will be over 50 years old. There are 2,000 that are classified as a high hazard today—those whose failure, by definition, or misoperation will probably cause loss of human life. We need about $53 billion to repair these dams. That is a lot of money, but think of what a life is worth. Think of the cost of the damage that is caused when these dams fail. Most everybody downstream has Federal flood insurance. Instead of the Federal Government partnering and working with communities and States to improve these dams and prevent a disaster, until last year, the only program we had was one to mitigate after the disaster. But luckily, we moved forward last year in the Water Resources Development Act with an amendment offered by our colleague Mr. MALONEY that would authorize repair and rehabilitation of nonFederal dams and provide proactive maintenance and repair. Obviously, it is much more costeffective than waiting until failure and then mitigate the property loss downstream and declare an emergency to rebuild the dam. We will have the sad loss of life when we don’t make those investments. There are many examples that I could cite. A dam failure in Hawaii killed seven people. It had never been inspected. It was a 100yearold dam. In 2 weeks, we will mark the 35th anniversary of the Buffalo Creek Dam failure in West Virginia. It killed 125 people, 1,100 were severely injured, and 4,000 people were homeless. The dam had received safety violations, but there was no followup. So, this is another aspect of infrastructure in America that needs investment. President Trump was pretty much spot on with his estimate of a trillion dollars. If you look at surface transportation—roads, bridges, highways, and transit—if you look at infrastructure for water treatment—think Detroit—or if you look at the thousands of communities that need to upgrade or rebuild their sewer facilities and other aspects of infrastructure, a trillion dollars would just about do it. If we made those investments, we would put hundreds of thousands of people to work in this country, make America more efficient and more competitive in the world economy. But many of my Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle think that we shouldn’t be making these investments publicly. They classify any kind of spending as a deficit, even if it is a capital investment that will last for a hundred years or a capital investment that will save lives and mitigate losses for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Flood Insurance Program. It is penny wise and pound foolish not to make these investments. We can and should. We need to move forward and rebuild our country. f 
BRING HADAR HOME The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MAST) for 5 minutes. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Hadar Goldin. Hadar was born in the Galilee region of Israel in 1991. He was a gifted young man—a happy person with a lively personality. He was an accomplished painter and, I am told, an inspiration to everybody that knew him. He served as a lieutenant in the Givati Brigade of the IDF. Mr. Speaker, I did not know Hadar personally, but, during my time serving alongside the IDF, I knew so many who were just like him. I met some of the most humble and compassionate people that I have ever known. I chose to serve alongside the IDF because our friends in Israel fight for the same values that we fight to protect in our country: human dignity, freedom, and liberty. I can tell you from experience that we soldiers often label our uniforms with sentiments that are important to us. Hadar had his rifle belt embroidered 
with the words ‘‘strength and humility.’’ He fought not out of hatred for his enemy but to protect his homeland and his family. He used the embroidery as a reminder that a soldier has the courage to use his weapon when needed, but even more importantly, has the humility to restrain from its use in the name of peace. But on August 1, 2014, when Hadar was only 23 years old, he was killed by Hamas terrorists, just 2 hours after a ceasefire had been declared in the Operation Protective Edge war in Gaza. Hamas terrorists maliciously dragged his body away from his home and into an underground tunnel. They stripped and left his clothing and have held his corpse ever since. Americans are no strangers to the term ‘‘missing in action,’’ as we still have, shamefully, thousands unaccounted for in Southeast Asia. This is a painful and uncertain future that no family deserves. This should never, ever be condoned. Last week, I had the opportunity to meet with Hadar’s family. They are unable to give their son the proper burial because Hamas is holding his body hostage. Mr. Speaker, we know that Hamas does not value human life. They seek to destroy all that Israel and the United States hold dear. Even the last administration called for the condemning of this action in the strongest possible terms. They called it barbaric. We must now enter into a new chapter—one where we support our Israeli allies and stand side by side with them in the fight for freedom. This was a ceasefire that Israel entered into at the urging of former Secretary of State John Kerry and the United Nations. They should bear some responsibility for ensuring his body is returned home. Mr. Speaker, I urge the United Nations to step up for what is right. Show some spine, show some resolve, and stand against Hamas. Do not be a rug that Palestinians trounce across as they shop the United Nations to fulfill their agenda while never being held accountable for their acts of terrorism and their acts against basic human dignity. I urge the new administration to take the necessary steps to help bring Hadar home and ensure his family can finally give him a proper burial—the kind of burial that every soldier, regardless of their uniform, deserves. 
ACA STORY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, this beautiful child is Charlie. Charlie is an infant from Westport, Massachusetts. Charlie’s dad has a green card and his mom is an American citizen. Charlie’s mom wrote me to share their family’s Affordable Care Act story, an important one, yet, in many respects, not that uncommon. When Charlie was born, his mother had to postpone her Ph.D. ambitions because she needed a fulltime job to support her family. Although she has two master’s degrees, she is working over 40 hours per week in a restaurant. That restaurant doesn’t offer benefits, so Charlie’s mom has to purchase her own health insurance policy for her family. The Affordable Care Act has helped them find the health plan they need at a price they can afford. Charlie’s family got covered. Charlie’s mom also wrote me to tell me that, on January 21, she came to Washington and marched with women from around the world because of the fact that all families like hers should have health care, for all children like Charlie who need health care, and because she believes Americans should want all their neighbors to be healthy. I agree with Charlie’s mom. We should all have access to essential healthcare services. This is a family working to make it on their own, not seeking transitional assistance from the government, sacrificing to move their family forward, striving to succeed, to earn the American Dream. The Affordable Care Act provides them this opportunity. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF MOREHOUSE COLLEGE’S 150TH ANNIVERSARY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and pleasure to rise today to recognize my alma mater, Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, as it celebrates 150 years of educating, training, and empowering outstanding leaders. The yearlong sesquicentennial celebration began in January 2017, and will include many events for students, faculty, staff, administrators, donors, families, and friends of Morehouse College. The theme of the celebration is ‘‘A House United,’’ which highlights Morehouse’s position as a unifying force around the globe and here at home. Tracing its roots back to the Reconstruction era after the Civil War, Morehouse was founded in 1867, as the Augusta Theological Institute in Augusta, Georgia. The school was founded by Reverend William Jefferson White, with the encouragement of Reverend Richard Coulter and Reverend Edmund Turney. It aimed to prepare Black men for ministry and teaching. In 1879, the Augusta Theological Institute moved to the basement of the Friendship Baptist Church in Atlanta and was renamed the Atlanta Baptist Seminary. In 1885, the institution relocated to its current site in Atlanta’s West End community. The seminary became a liberal arts college and was subsequently renamed the Atlanta Baptist College. During these early years in Morehouse’s history, the institution expanded its curriculum and established the tradition of educating leaders for all areas of life. In 1913, Atlanta Baptist College was renamed Morehouse College after the corresponding secretary of the Northern Baptist Home Mission Society, Henry L. Morehouse. Throughout its 150year history, Morehouse College has made a significant mark on our State, our Nation, and the world. Here, many notable men gained the knowledge and training that enabled them to become some of the greatest influences of our time, including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; noted theologian Dr. Howard Thurman; civil rights leader Julian Bond; filmmaker Shelton ‘‘Spike’’ Lee; Olympic gold medalist Edwin Moses; CEO of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, Emmitt Carson; and many more. Morehouse principles often instill a desire for public service to benefit mankind. In the United States Congress, Representative CEDRIC RICHMOND , chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, as well as many staff members and former Members of Congress, hold degrees from Morehouse. U.S. Presidents have relied on alumni such as former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, former Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Louis Sullivan, former Surgeon General Dr. Daniel Satcher, and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations James Nabrit, Jr. Around the country, State and local governments have been led by alumni such as Maynard H. Jackson, the first AfricanAmerican mayor of Atlanta, Georgia. As a 1968 graduate of Morehouse College, this oneofakind institution has a special place in my heart. During my matriculation, I got to know on a personal level the late Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, the most renowned president of Morehouse, who was a mentor to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Through him, I met Dr. King during his life, followed him in protest marches, and sang at his funeral, which was held on the campus and attended by many national and international luminaries. Today, under the leadership of the 11th president of Morehouse College, Dr. John Silvanus Wilson, Jr., also an alumnus, the school continues to be consistently ranked as one of the top colleges in the Nation and among the highest respected Historically Black Colleges and Universities. As the Nation’s largest liberal arts college for men, Morehouse has conferred more bachelor’s degrees on Black men than any other institution in the world. b1100 Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Morehouse College for 150 years of preparing young men to aspire to unique and distinctive goals while leading lives of leadership and service. This institution 
was born out of the death of slavery in America. It guided young Black men through the era of segregation in the South, and it continues to empower marginalized populations against the oppression still prevalent in the world today. It is my hope that the generations of Morehouse Men of today and tomorrow will continue the progress and continue to leave their marks on our Nation and the world. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOWS WORLD WHAT A DISASTER LOOKS LIKE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, standing before almost entirely White crowds in North Carolina, Michigan, Virginia, and Ohio, candidate Donald Trump painted a bleak picture of AfricanAmerican life in 2016, full of crime, high poverty, and failing schools. He went on to say, ‘‘It is a disaster the way African Americans are living,’’ and asked, ‘‘What the hell do you have to lose?’’ In just 3 short weeks, Mr. Speaker, President Trump has shown the world exactly what a disaster looks like. He has put a White supremacist in the White House as his chief political adviser. He has given us an Attorney General who spent the last 30plus years working against civil and voting rights. He has appointed a shamefully illprepared Secretary of Education whose only qualification seems to be her ability to contribute millions to Republic candidates in what can only be described as the textbook definition of pay to play. Candidate Trump promised to be the hero of working people, but President Trump is doing the exact opposite. His actions tell a lot more than his tweets. His Cabinet is full of millionaires, many with ethical challenges and conflicts of interest. He has already raised the cost of mortgages for many Americans. He is proposing that we abandon the overtime rule that would ensure bigger paychecks for working people. He is working to dismantle Wall Street reform and is proposing a border tax that would give corporations a huge tax break while costing working men and women more on groceries, clothes, and other goods. The policies of the Trump administration are an extension of the policies that Republics in the House have pushed for years. To candidate Trump’s question what do you have to lose, for starters, your voice at the ballot box. A free and fair election is the hallmark of democratic governance, yet the Trump administration and Republics in Congress continue to threaten this basic pillar of democracy. They have promulgated blatant falsehoods about voter fraud, sowing fear and distrust. They have worked and are working across the country to prevent people of color from voting. They are refusing to investigate Russian interference in our elections and are currently moving legislation through the House of Representatives to eliminate the only Federal agency tasked with helping Americans vote and protecting our voting machines from hacking. As President Trump and his spokespeople continue to make demonstrably false claims about widespread voter fraud and cozying up to the country that attacked our democracy, House Republics just passed out of committee H.R. 634, legislation to eliminate the only Federal agency tasked with certifying the security of our voting machines, the Election Assistance Commission. Fortyseven out of fifty States rely on the EAC’s voting machine certification program in some capacity. A recent report by the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology concluded, ‘‘Voting machines are neither secure nor complex. In general, these stripped down computers utilizing outdated operating systems possess virtually every conceivable vulnerability that a device can have.’’ In my home State of South Carolina, we currently use voting machines that were rejected by the State of Ohio in 2007 for being ‘‘buggy, unstable and exploitable.’’ And even though machines are not supposed to be connected to the internet, they are well past their shelf life and, therefore, more likely to break down, crash, and produce errors. Replacing these outdated machines with updated ones will cost a significant amount of money, and the burden is on the States to do so. Mr. Speaker, if House Republics are serious about election integrity, they ought to stop working to prevent people of color and start investing in voting infrastructure. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 11 o’clock and 6 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. HULTGREN ) at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Our fervent prayer, O God, is that people will learn to live together in reconciliation and respect, so that the terrors of war, and of dictatorial abuse, will be no more. Guide our hearts and minds, that every person of every place and background might focus on Your great gift of life, and so learn to live in unity. May Your special blessings be upon the Members of this assembly in the important, sometimes difficult, work they do. Give them wisdom and charity, that they might work together for the common good. May all that is done this day in the people’s House be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. TROTT ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. TROTT led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, there are few places that encapsulate all our country has to offer more than my home city of Chicago. The strengths of the Nation can be seen in every corner of my district, where we celebrate diversity, passion, and resilience. This includes our immigrant communities, and I am proud to represent one of the most welcoming cities to those seeking a better life in America. That is why it is ridiculous to hear the President continue his bizarre barrage of attacks against our great city with his newest and most misguided claim yet, that elevated gun violence in Chicago stems from undocumented immigrants. Not only do his comments do nothing to address the gun violence problem in Chicago, but they are just plain wrong. Like most major cities, we struggle with violence and encourage constructive assistance. But studies have shown that immigration has no effect on crime rates. In fact, researchers have found immigrants generally have the strongest incentives to avoid activity that will put them in contact with the criminal justice system. The President should stop attacking the most vulnerable members of our society and, instead, look for pragmatic, commonsense policies to support comprehensive immigration reform and gun violence prevention. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MIKE ILITCH (Mr. TROTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the passing of a great American, Mike Ilitch. Born to Macedonian immigrants on the west side of Detroit, Mike Ilitch became one of the most successful businessmen in the history of our country. From humble beginnings, he built one of the largest food, sports, and entertainment empires of our time. He personified the American Dream, a constant reminder that anyone from anywhere who is willing to work hard and dream big can enjoy the opportunities in America. However, he was more than an icon. He was a pillar of our community. During our city’s most challenging times, he never turned his back. When so many others gave up on Detroit, he never lost faith in the resilience of the city and the people he loved so much. All of us who have enjoyed ‘‘pizza pizza,’’ or Redwings hockey, or Tiger baseball, or the Fox Theatre know of Mike Ilitch’s success. But what we will miss most is Mr. I’s kindness, generosity, and compassion for others. f 
BIOMETRIC SCANNING AT THE NORTHERN BORDER (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express concern about the President’s executive order wherein he supports the use of biometric scanning at all northern border crossings, including the crossing between the United States and Canada at Buffalo. The President’s biometric scanning plan would effectively shut down the Peace Bridge, which is the busiest northern border crossing for passenger vehicles, and second for commercial vehicles, thus stopping the movement of traffic and trade, and creating a wall like effect between the United States and Canadian relations. Canada is not our enemy. We are friends and trading partners. In my Buffalo district, we border Southern Ontario, the most populated province of all of Canada; and the Peace Bridge moves $30 billion in commerce, representing $230 billion in economic activity, and 1 million jobs. The biometric scan plan for the northern border is unworkable and an unnecessary barrier between friendship and trade. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ED MOORE (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Ed Moore, who was truly a pillar of our community in northern Indiana. In 1979, Ed founded the Christian radio station, WFRN, which has been a beacon of faith and joy to its family of listeners for nearly 4 decades. I have had the privilege of visiting the WFRN studio many times over the past 5, 6 years. Each time, I saw Ed’s passion for serving the Lord and helping listeners strengthen their faith. WFRN has had such a positive impact on so many lives, and Ed’s legacy is that it will continue to do so. In announcing Ed’s passing, his family noted they were saddened, yet rejoicing, because Ed is with the Lord. Mr. Speaker, I join Ed’s children, Doug, Steve, and Rachelle, his 11 grandchildren, and the entire WFRN family in mourning Ed’s passing, celebrating his life, and rejoicing that today he is with the Lord. HOUSE REPUBLICANS REFUSE TO INVESTIGATE THE SWAMP (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives is a separate and coequal branch of government. And yet, House Republicans refuse to investigate the swamp of corruption that is percolating at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Michael Flynn has resigned in disgrace. And yet, the Trump administration has jeopardized our national security by continuing to play footsie with Vladimir Putin and the Russians. House Republicans have done nothing. It is impossible to figure out where the Trump family business ends and the White House begins, yet House Republicans have done nothing. Seventeen different intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russians interfered in the election to help Donald Trump, yet House Republicans have done nothing. It is time for House Republicans to investigate this White House and stop acting like puppets of the Trump administration. The American people deserve answers. What exactly did Donald Trump know, and when did he know it? f 
VOTE AGAINST EXECUTIVE OVERREACH (Mr. MARCHANT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, at the 11th hour, the Obama administration’s Labor Department issued a rule that stonewalled bipartisan changes to the unemployment insurance program. These changes were made so that tax dollars would be used in a more efficient and more effective manner. It has been 5 years since Congress passed legislation giving the States the discretion on drugtesting policy for unemployment applicants. Using delay tactics, the previous administration prevented that law from ever being implemented as designed. This kind of executive overreach impedes the ability of States to ensure that the unemployment insurance program accomplishes its intended purpose, and that is to promote reemployment. In Texas, we take the job of fiscal responsibility very seriously. This week, Congress is responding to that overreach by the previous administration. We hope that Congress will take that responsibility very seriously. I urge my colleagues to vote against the executive overreach and to vote for H.J. Res. 42. 
INVESTING IN A WORKING GOVERNMENT (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, recent executive actions have resulted in confusion, demonstrations, and latenight court rulings. Many executive orders have been announced with little notice, and the American people have had to wait hours afterwards to see the text. Federal agencies have also been blindsided by these orders. The Secretary of Homeland Security found out about the President’s immigration orders through cable news. In some cases, the President himself has been uncertain of what his executive orders contain. Sir, we need transparency today. Congress has a responsibility to eliminate this confusion and make sure that executive actions are clear and transparent to all Americans. That is why I am introducing the Executive Order Transparency Act. This onepage bill requires that all executive orders be posted on the White House website 72 hours before each is signed. This simple bill is an investment in a working government, and I urge all my colleagues to join me. 
THE MILITARY NEEDS MORE ENLISTED MEN AND WOMEN NOT MORE OFFICERS (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, in Scott Berg’s biography on Woodrow Wilson, it says that, in World War I, we had one officer for ever 30 enlisted men. President Eisenhower once said we had too many officers when we had one officer for every nine enlisted. Now we have one officer for every 4
1⁄2to 5 enlisted. We are almost overrun with retired admirals and generals. This is very expensive. President Trump wants to greatly expand the numbers in our Armed Forces. If we do, what we need is more enlisted men and women, not more officers. I started in the Army as enlisted and left as a captain, but we simply can’t afford as many officers as we have today. We now have 475,000 retired officers drawing military pensions and 1,500,000 enlisted retirees. These two million military retirees, and those near retirement, should be demanding more fiscal conservatism by the Pentagon, or, in the very near future, we will not be able to pay our military pensions with money that will buy very much. 
REAUTHORIZATION OF THE ELECTION ASSISTANCE COMMISSION (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 794, which will reauthorize the Election Assistance Commission until 2022, provide payments to the States to upgrade the security of voter registration databases, and require an assessment of each State’s voting systems. Foreign hackers targeted the voter registration databases in more than 20 States in 2016. Candidate Trump encouraged hackers to target his opponent. He won the election and continues to cozy up to Russia. And now, House Republics are moving to eliminate the EAC, a key force in combating foreign cybersecurity attacks against our democracy. ‘‘What do you have to lose?’’ candidate Trump asked. Try free and fair elections, Mr. Speaker. I urge my Republic colleagues to put country before party and stand up for American democracy. Stop trying to suppress minority voters. Support an independent commission to investigate Russian meddling in our election. f 
RECOGNIZING THE 150TH BIRTHDAY OF LITTLE RIVER COUNTY, ARKANSAS (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a milestone for Little River County, Arkansas. On March 5, the county will celebrate its 150th birthday. According to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas, Little River County came into existence following an act of the Arkansas General Assembly, officially separating from Hempstead and Sevier Counties in 1867. During its century and a half, the citizens of Little River County have shown resilience and innovation as they weathered the Great Depression, sent its men to fight in World War II, and grew the local economy in the years since. In recent years, Little River County has withstood severe flooding, but they have come back strong and resilient. Little River County is blessed with natural resources, including forestry, agriculture, and minerals that all provide the inputs for manufacturing jobs that play a big role in the local economy, and will continue to do so in Little River’s next 150 years. I am proud to call Little River County part of the Fourth Congressional District, and I congratulate its citizens on 150 years of progress. 
b1215 RESIGNATION OF MICHAEL FLYNN (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, Michael Flynn’s resignation does not close the book on the administration’s coziness with Russia. It confirms the urgent need for a bipartisan investigation of Russia’s ties to the Trump administration and its ongoing influence. It confirms the urgent need for the President to release his tax returns so the American people can see any business ties that the President has to Russia. We need a full, independent inquiry into not just the actions of Michael Flynn in one conversation with the Vice President, but the ongoing connections between the administration and Russia, because the one thing we know for sure is it doesn’t stop there. President Trump’s fawning praise of Putin and the previous resignation of other aides over their Russian ties made it clear that this is a problem that goes beyond General Flynn. What we have learned over the past 24 hours is that colluding with a foreign government or lying to the Vice President and others is not what brought Flynn down. It seems that it was only the disclosure of those lies that made it untenable for Flynn to remain. The White House was apparently okay with everything until the American people found out. We need to find out what else the White House and President Trump doesn’t want us to know about their connection to the foreign power that interfered with our election, and we need to start today. f 
IT IS THE MEDIA’S CHOICE (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the liberal national media have two choices. First, they can continue their dislike—some would call it hatred—of President Trump that results in severely slanted coverage. This is the road to selfdestruction. The media’s credibility has hit a record low, and the American people soon will stop looking to them for news. Or, second, the liberal national media can start covering President Trump objectively. This means not portraying his actions in the worst possible light but sometimes giving President Trump the benefit of the doubt. It means giving his side of the story. It means, most of all, recognizing that President Trump represents the legitimate hopes and fears of millions of Americans. If the liberal national media continue to treat President Trump unlike they would a Democrat, the public will grow tired of the double standard. The American people have an innate sense of fairness, which the media should not ignore. For their own sake and for the sake of our democracy, the media should change their ways. 
REPEAL WITHOUT REPLACEMENT WOULD BE DEVASTATING (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, Republicans are moving ahead with the repeal of ObamaCare—but years later, after all the talk, they still have no replacement. Six weeks into control of this Congress and of this government— all branches—there is no plan. From today’s Politico, it reads: ‘‘House conservatives . . . are plotting a major push to repeal the law immediately without simultaneously approving an alternative.’’ The consequences of Republican repeal without replacement are devastating: 30 million Americans would lose health coverage. People could be kicked off their coverage. They would not be allowed coverage if they have a preexisting condition. Young people could be kicked off their parents’ plans. In recent weeks, Republicans have been bombarded with messages from their constituents sending a clear message that the Affordable Care Act repeal would be devastating to their family. It would be devastating to real people like Jia Ireland, my constituent, who, before ACA, had no health insurance. Because of Medicaid expansion, she and 600,000 other Michiganders have coverage. We cannot lose access to health care in this country. We ought not do that. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP MUST RELEASE HIS INCOME TAX RETURNS (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I had a town hall in Memphis on Saturday. We had over 1,000 people there, and over 10,000 people live streamed on Facebook. Many were concerned about Russia’s influence with this administration. Something smells. It would be like a vegan going and talking about how much they were supporting the Beef and Dairy Council, or that ChickfilA cow going up and saying: Eat more chicken. There is something else to it. There is an ulterior motive. This President’s love affair with Russia, his constant support for Russia and Putin—one of the most villainous leaders on the face of this Earth—spells a problem. We need to get to the bottom of it, and one way we will find out is through his taxes. Mr. Speaker, I urge the President to release his income taxes to the American people. It is so important to us having confidence in his administration and to our government’s ability to withstand an evil power, as Ronald Reagan called them. PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 66, DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO SAVINGS ARRANGEMENTS BY STATES FOR NONGOVERNMENTAL EMPLOYEES, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 67, DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO SAVINGS ARRANGEMENTS BY QUALIFIED STATE POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS FOR NONGOVERNMENTAL EMPLOYEES Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 116 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: H. R ES. 116 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House any joint resolution specified in section 2 of this resolution. All points of order against consideration of each such joint resolution are waived. Each such joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in each such joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on each such joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce; and (2) one motion to recommit. SEC. 2. The joint resolutions referred to in the first section of this resolution are as follows: (a) The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 66) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to savings arrangements established by States for nongovernmental employees. (b) The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 67) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to savings arrangements established by qualified State political subdivisions for nongovernmental employees. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alabama? There was no objection. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 116 provides for consideration of two joint resolutions designed to protect working families by blocking harmful regulations through the Congressional Review Act process. In 1974, Congress passed and President Gerald Ford signed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. This legislation, which has broad and bipartisan support, sets standards for employerprovided retirement plans to protect the workers of the United States of America. This regulatory framework for employerprovided retirement plans has been largely successful at helping working families save for retirement over the last 40 years. Unfortunately, in the waning days of his administration, President Obama put forward regulations to uproot this system that has worked for decades. The Obama administration’s rules would pave the way for government run IRAs—for bureaucratrun IRAs— managed by States and certain municipalities. Employees in several States would be forced to automatically enroll in these government and bureaucratrun IRAs that are not subject to the important protections established by ERISA. In other words, in the waning days of the Obama administration, they sought to take back from workers the protections that were given to them when ERISA was passed 40 years ago. Let me say that again. Workers’ ERISA protections will be out the window for those people in these government and bureaucratrun plans. These regulations remove important protections for American workers as they relate to their retirement plans. American consumers would be directly hurt by this regulation were it to go forward. Just as bad, workers would have less control over their retirement savings. Withdrawals or rollover investments to a privatesector account could be restricted and even penalized. These regulations would create disincentives for small businesses to offer their retirement plans and invest in their employees’ retirement, resulting in fewer options for workers. Instead, smaller employers will likely simply shift their employees on to these government and bureaucratrun plans. These regulations could also create a confusing patchwork of rules that vary State to State or, even worse, city to city. This confusion would directly hurt the consumer. Another concern with pushing people on to government and bureaucratrun retirement plans is that taxpayers would end up footing the bill. We have seen how poorly managed many State and city pension plans have been all over this country. If these government run IRAs are also mismanaged, taxpayers may be asked to pay and to honor the government’s promises. Ultimately, these regulations are simply another attempt to exert control over the American people with a ‘‘government knows best’’ policy. Mr. Speaker, the American people are not children that need direction from their parents. They should not be forced by the heavy hand of the government and faceless bureaucrats to obtain certain plans the government 
likes that they may not need or want. People are free today to decide whether they want their IRAs or not. This will put them in a position where they can be forced to have them whether they want them or not. We have seen the problems caused when the government tries to tell the American people what to do or what the government thinks is best for them. These types of heavyhanded policies simply do not work and they are counter to the principles our country was founded on. So these two bills would use the Congressional Review Act process to block these anticonsumer regulations from taking effect. By passing these two bills, we will protect working families, we will support our Nation’s small businesses, and we will be shielding the taxpayers from potential liabilities. As I pointed out last week on this floor, just because we pass these bills using the CRA does not mean we cannot continue working toward solutions that improve our Nation’s retirement programs. Just as the CRA gives Congress power to block regulations, the legislative branch can also give agencies further instructions and directions if a regulation is needed at some point in the future. As a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find solutions to help Americans save for their retirement. Attempting to use the regulatory pen to skate around ERISA and its important protections is just not the right answer. So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this rule and these pro consumer bills and protect American families, workers, and their retirement plans. I reserve the balance of my time. b1230 Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, we are less than 2 months into 2017, and today we have another closed rule, or as I call them, ‘‘Putin rules.’’ This is how they operate in Russia—no deliberation. It is simply astonishing that here in the people’s House we continue to have this closed process: no amendments, no debate, no nothing, completely shut down. I have very serious concerns about the road we are traveling down. The 115th Congress is only 6 weeks old, and we have already ushered in a process that is alarmingly restrictive. It should distress not just Democrats, but Republicans as well. This is now the norm and is very, very sad. Mr. Speaker, today’s rule would pave the way for the House to repeal two important consumer protections that help working families save for retirement. These protections went through a very lengthy process of review. We are repealing these protections without the committees of jurisdiction having any chance to weigh in and in a rushed process that is completely closed. These protections, as I said, were reviewed by the relevant agencies; they were subjected to public commentary; and we are bringing them to the floor to repeal them without even giving the committees of jurisdiction an opportunity to actually discuss these bills, to discuss whether this makes sense. Mr. Speaker, America is facing a retirement savings crisis, and rules like this—I should say, protections like this—are essential to helping workers plan for the future. As of today, 55 million Americans lack access to a way to save for retirement out of their regular paycheck. As a result, nearly half of all workers have no retirement assets. Yet we know that employees are 15 times more likely to save just by having access to a workplace retirement plan. These programs are a commonsense solution for working families and small businesses. Republicans should be working to strengthen programs like these, not rip them apart. If you have a problem and you want to make a tweak, maybe you ought to work with the agency to make that tweak, but not an outright repeal. Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, pushing dangerous bills like this in a closed process with no debate is a lousy way to conduct the people’s business. But with the avalanche of alternative facts coming out of the Trump White House every day, it should be no surprise that the House Republican majority on Capitol Hill is carrying on in such a heavy handed way. God forbid, in the people’s House, we should actually deliberate and have debate and have the kind of giveandtake that the American people expect. Mr. Speaker, as bad as this process is, as bad as dismantling the rules and regulations put in place to protect the savings of working families is, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about something that is very serious and troubling to the American people. Mr. Speaker, this administration regularly goes on TV and appears before the press—and let me say this as plainly as I can—and consistently spouts falsehoods. Now, I am told, Mr. Speaker, that under the rules and precedents of the House that there are certain things that cannot be said. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Rules Committee and as somebody who respects the precedents of the House, I am going to be very polite in how I respond here today. I will speak plainly, but politely. I want people to understand that I would like to say things much stronger based on what is happening in this country and based on what is happening in this administration. Mr. Speaker, I certainly wouldn’t want to do anything to hurt anybody’s feelings, but it is troubling what is happening, the falsehoods and fabrications that we hear each and every day. Some of it is trivial and some of it is silly, like saying that his inaugural crowd size was bigger than President Obama’s. Who cares? But some are more sinister and more dangerous, like the claim that 3 million to 5 million ‘‘illegal aliens’’ voted for his opponent in the 2016 Presidential election. Every fact checker, every Secretary of State, both Republicans and Democrats, say this is absolutely false. There is no basis for this falsehood. It undermines confidence in our political system. My fear is that the real purpose of this claim is to put in place policies to restrict voter rights in order to make it more difficult for people to vote in this country. Mr. Speaker, every day it feels like President Trump and his White House are trying to set a new record in terms of misinformation. There are so many falsehoods coming out of this White House, it makes me nostalgic for Nixon. President Trump, in a meeting with U.S. Senators last week, repeated another falsehood, that he only lost New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bussed to the State to vote illegally. This is simply not true. There is no basis for this statement. This is similar to the President’s fabrication that 3 million to 5 million votes were cast illegally in the 2016 election. Plain and simple, President Trump and his White House staff continue to provide zero evidence to back up their claims of voter fraud. On Sunday, when top White House aide Stephen Miller was asked about the judiciary challenging President Trump’s unconstitutional Muslim ban, he aggressively attacked critics and said that ‘‘the powers of the President to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.’’ The powers of the President will not be questioned. I couldn’t believe my ears when I heard that. President Trump might talk a lot about his love for Vladimir Putin, but this is not Russia. This is the United States of America. We have checks and balances to stop authoritarianism. Kellyanne Conway, when she is not giving free commercials for the Trump family business on the taxpayers’s dime, is making up stories about the Bowling Green massacre, a terrorist attack which never happened, and spouting alternative facts on a daily basis. The latest falsehood from the Trump White House is one of the most serious yet. In repeated interviews, both Vice President MIKEPENCE and National Security Adviser Michael Flynn—I should be saying now, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn—said that Flynn did not speak with Russian officials about U.S. sanctions before President Trump took office. A new report shows that that is blatantly false. 
After the U.S. intelligence community overwhelmingly agreed that Russia had actively meddled in our 2016 Presidential election to tip the result in favor of Donald Trump, President Obama announced strong sanctions against Russia, including expelling 35 Russian diplomats or agents from U.S. soil. When Vladimir Putin responded by saying that they would not expel any U.S. officials in Russia—what many expected he would not do—a lot of red flags were raised. A new report now shows that, in the 24 hours that followed, Michael Flynn communicated with Russian Government officials about the sanctions and may have actively undermined U.S. foreign policy weeks before Donald Trump even took the oath of office. And now we know that last month the Justice Department informed the White House of Flynn’s deception of the Vice President and of the American people in the days immediately following the inauguration. Mr. Speaker, this is outrageous, and the fact that President Trump did not immediately fire Michael Flynn as soon as this came to light is stunning. I guess he was too concerned about crowd size rather than a deeply compromised national security adviser. Mr. Speaker, getting rid of Flynn is not enough. President Trump must stop the blatant and dangerous falsehoods coming from his White House. We need a full and independent and bipartisan investigation not only under the purview of the intelligence committees; we need to have a full investigation out in the open so the American people actually know what happened and know how many others were involved in Flynn’s undermining of our national security. Who knew what when? Was Donald Trump aware of these unauthorized talks with Russia while President Obama was enforcing sanctions? The American people deserve the truth. They deserve transparency. They deserve this Congress to actually do proper oversight. One of the most troubling parts of all this is that the American people would have been completely in the dark if it were not for the hardworking journalists and patriotic U.S. officials who helped bring this outrageous scandal to light. Now, more than ever, we need to support freedom of the press, to hold President Trump and his White House accountable. The Republicans in Congress need to start doing their job by exercising the strong oversight needed. President Trump needs to know that he answers to the American people and he and no President is above the law. Mr. Speaker, America’s hardworking families deserve a Congress that puts them first and a President and a White House that tells the truth instead of spreading falsehoods to stir up fear and advance a dangerous and extreme agenda. We can have policy disagreements, but you have to tell the truth. You can’t just make stuff up. As we are seeing with this administration, alternative facts are contagious. The White House is rapidly losing the public’s trust, and every day that Congress fails to hold the Trump White House accountable, we are losing the public’s trust as well. Members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have a responsibility to stand up for the truth and hold the President and his White House accountable. We are here to serve the American people, and they need to know that we are fighting for them, not serving as a rubber stamp for this administration. I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule, and I reserve the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the gentleman from Massachusetts’ remarks. We are not here today to talk about Russia, but I do remember about a month ago when we were on this floor counting electoral college votes, my colleague from Massachusetts objected to the Electoral College votes from my home State of Alabama because of Russian interference. I want to put his mind at rest. As a Representative of Alabama, I think I can say with complete confidence that the Russians had no influence over the Presidential vote in the State of Alabama last November. We get our electoral information like most people in America do: from watching FOX News or something like that. But in the fall, in Alabama, we are also paying real close attention to college football. So far from letting Russian influence have anything to do with our vote in Alabama, we were doing what most people in America were doing and paying close attention to college football. We gave no more credence to what the Russians think about our political votes in Alabama than we do to what they think about our college football teams. But let’s get back to the substance of his remarks. He says that there is no debate. This rule provides for at least 2 hours of debate, perhaps more if we get into motions to recommit. And the truth of the matter is, under the Congressional Review Act, the actual form of these laws are prescribed by statute. We have no control over what can be in them. We can either vote for them or against them. And we are going to have clear debate—over 2 hours, maybe more—whether we are going to vote for or against it. There are people who are going to vote for them, and there are people who are going to vote against them, and people are going to have reasons for doing each. That is standard order here in the House. I think the American people would agree, on these sorts of fundamental things when you know what is simply in them, that is plenty of debate. He calls these regulations that we seek to overturn ‘‘consumer protections.’’ But remember what I said earlier: They take these employer plans, these IRA plans that are forced by the government, they take them out from the protections of ERISA. They take consumer protection away from the people that have these plans. So far from being consumer protection regulations, they are anticonsumer protection regulations. They are antiworker. So what is really going on here is this is not some effort—or was some effort by the Obama administration—to protect workers. It is an effort to try to get government more involved in people’s lives, and the people of America don’t want the government more involved in their lives. The gentleman mentioned that there are 55 million people in America today who don’t have a retirement plan. Every one of those 55 million people have access, if they choose to get it, to an IRA. Anybody can set up an IRA. You don’t need your employer to set it up for you. You sure don’t need the government to set it up for you. There are plenty of people around the country that will help you set it up, and it is pretty easy, pretty simple. Maybe some of these people, or a lot of these people that don’t have them, don’t want them. So why would the government come in and tell them you have got to have them unless your real interest here is in empowering government and not protecting consumers? I will leave it to you to make the decision what the real motive was here. b1245 Now, the gentleman talked about the fact that these come to us without going through the committees of jurisdiction; but, as I said earlier, because the form of these bills are prescribed by statute, there is really nothing for the committees of jurisdiction to do. But he will be glad to know that I am informed that, after we come back from the Presidents Day week break, there will be a number of bills coming to the floor that will have, in fact, gone through the committees of jurisdiction, including bills, I predict, that will both repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. So there is going to be plenty of things coming through regular order to this floor. But as we go through the Congressional Review Act process, we are pretty constrained in what we can say and not say in these bills, and we are simply following that which is prescribed by statute. As I said earlier, we can all decide, based upon that statutorily prescribed form for what we do, whether we are for it or we are against it, whether we want to force workers in America to get some government forced type IRA and take them out from the protections of ERISA, or 
whether we want to let them have their freedom and keep the protections of ERISA. We want to keep freedom for the American people. We want to keep freedom for the American workers, and we sure want them to keep the protections they have had for over 40 years under ERISA and not take those protections away from them so that we can force something down their throat from some governmentbureaucratrun plan. Getting back to what we are here to talk about today, we are here to reverse illconsidered regulations in the waning days of the Obama administration that hurt the American workers. By adopting this rule and by adopting these two pieces of legislation, we protect the American workers. I hope all of us are here to do exactly that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The gentleman is correct, I did rise to object to certifying the electoral college vote. Part of it was because I was appalled by the unprecedented Russian interference in our election system. I would urge the gentleman to read—maybe he doesn’t want to read the classified version of the report—the unclassified version of the report. It is pretty outrageous. That is why so many of us have been calling for an independent bipartisan commission to investigate this. But the other reason why I objected was because of voter suppression. I would say to the gentleman that that is an equally serious issue, that there is still voter suppression in the United States of America, and it is something that we need to deal with. I worry very much under the Republican majority and under this White House that we are going to see more of an effort to restrict people’s right to vote. Now, the gentleman is trying to paint a rosy picture about what we are doing here. I mean, we have had 13 closed rules, 6 structured rules, zero modified open rules, zero open rules. By the end of this week, we will be a third of the way to breaking the record for the Republicans’ most closed Congress in the history of the United States, and we are still in February. My friends have outdone themselves in terms of closing up this process, of shutting people out from participation. The fact of the matter is, as I mentioned, these protections that the Republicans want to repeal went through a long process, lots of review within the agencies, lots of public commentary, a long time to develop these protections. Now, if the Republicans aren’t happy with it, one of the things they might do is they could bring up these rules in the form of legislation where we could have an open process, and people can amend and add and change and do whatever they want to do to make it better, if that is what they want to do. But that is not what they are interested in. It is all about a press release. This is mindless legislating. When committees of jurisdiction do not do their job, do not hold hearings, do not do markups, and all of a sudden the Rules Committee just reports something out and sends it to the floor under a closed rule, that is mindless legislating. By the way, I am on the Rules Committee. I don’t think that we have yet had a single bill come before the Rules Committee that went through committee. I am happy I am on the Rules Committee. At least you see a little action going on, but I feel bad if you are on any of these other committees. This is a lousy way to do business, and I am shocked that my Republican friends come to the floor and defend the indefensible. This is not the way this House should be run. This is the kind of process, as I said at the opening, you would expect to see in Russia, not here in the United States Congress. Different ideas should be debated. People ought to have an opportunity to have their voices be heard. But yet here, in this House of Representatives—which will break records in terms of being the most restrictive Congress, I think, in history—the name of the game is to try to shut people out. I think that is wrong. I think my Republican friends should be ashamed of the way they are conducting themselves in this Congress. This is not right. I just point that out because I think it is important for people to note that, by the end of this week, my Republican friends will be a third of the way to breaking their own record for the most restrictive Congress in history, with the most closed rules. That is something that I don’t think anyone should be proud of. But it is the new norm here: shut everything down, shut everybody out. I think that results in bad legislation and, again, mindless legislating like we are doing here today. Mr. Speaker, we are all deeply concerned, as I mentioned in my opening statement, with the reports from our intelligence community regarding potential foreign interference in our most recent election. Everybody should be. Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask people to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative SWALWELL ’s and Representative CUMMINGS ’ bill which would create a bipartisan commission to investigate foreign interference in our 2016 election. With the revelations about General Flynn coming to light, and all that we know about his dealings with the Russians, this is extremely timely. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. SWALWELL ). Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. MCGOVERN for his work on this issue. I love my country, and I don’t doubt that every one of my colleagues in this Chamber also loves this country. I admire every man and woman who has so bravely fought to defend it. After all, this is a country, this is a democracy worth defending. That is actually what defeating this previous question would take us to, the question of is this democracy still worth defending. This past election, our democracy was attacked. The attack was electronic, and it was nearly invisible. It came from a foreign adversary in Russia, ordered by Vladimir Putin. It was intended to help Donald Trump. Most concerning, the public intelligence report about this attack, the last finding is, Russia intends to do this again. They are undertaking a lessonslearned campaign so they can attack the United States again and attack our allies, the best check against Russia through the NATO alliance. Yesterday, the President removed a rotten plank in what is a compromised platform, Michael Flynn. In 2015, he went to Russia and sat next to Vladimir Putin, was paid for it, and, The New York Times reported yesterday, did not disclose that in the proper way he is supposed to to the Department of Defense. Because Russia attacked us, President Obama issued sanctions against Russia on December 28. Michael Flynn called Russia, its Ambassador, five times, at least five times, and discussed those sanctions, likely in violation of the Logan Act. He lied about it, lied to the Vice President about it, who went on national TV and defended Michael Flynn, saying it never happened. But here is what we also learned. We learned that 3 weeks ago the White House knew, because acting Attorney General Sally Yates told the White House, that Michael Flynn had lied and had put himself in a position where he could be compromised through blackmail by the Russian Government. Yet, despite knowing this, the White House allowed Michael Flynn to remain as the National Security Adviser, receive security briefings at the highest level, and advise our President on our security. All of the arrows continue to point to the Russian Government. We have more questions today than we did yesterday about whether there were any personal, political, or financial connections between President Trump, his family, his businesses, his campaign, and the Russian Government before the election and whether there are any efforts right now going on to pay back the Russian Government. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman. Mr. SWALWELL of California. All of the arrows continue to point to Russia. It is not disputed that Russia carried out this attack. It is not disputed that it was ordered by President Putin. It is not disputed that they sought to help Donald Trump. It is not disputed that Donald Trump admires President Putin and can’t say a single bad thing about him. Despite disparaging our allies in Australia and Mexico, he can’t say a bad thing about Putin. In fact, he wants to ease some of the sanctions against Russia and wants to roll back the influence of NATO. Of course, while all of this is going on, the President will not show us his tax returns. With all of those arrows pointing to Russia, the American people deserve to know what was the political, personal, and financial relationship between the President and his team and Russia. The only way to get there is to have an independent, bipartisanappointed commission. Defeating the previous question and bringing up the Protecting Our Democracy Act will get us one step closer. I believe that my Republican colleagues—who love this great country as much as I do—can join us, and this can be a bipartisan quest to say that never again will we allow a foreign adversary to interfere in our elections. Mr. BYRNE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, when I was a young lawyer, an old lawyer one time gave me a piece of advice that I was fortunate to never have to follow. He said: Son, when you are strong on the facts, pound on the facts. When you are strong on the law, pound on the law. If you are weak on the facts and the law, pound on the table. What we just heard is pounding on the table about Russia, and that has nothing to do with the two bills that are covered by this rule. Nothing in the bills that underlie this rule has anything to do with Russia. But because there is not a good argument against the rule, there is not a good argument against these bills, we are pulling up something else and pounding on the table. Let’s get back to the rule and the underlying legislation. This legislation will reverse two regulations that hurt working people in America, period, end of sentence. Far from being a press release, as my colleague from Massachusetts talked about, this bill is going to pass not only this House, it is going to pass the Senate, and, yes, it is going to be signed by the President of the United States. Two of the Congressional Review Act bills that have already come through this House have passed the Senate and, I am told, are going to be signed by the President this week. These aren’t press releases. These aren’t messaging bills. These are pieces of legislation that are going to become law and protect American workers after an attempt by the Obama administration, as it is going out the door, an attempt by them to take ERISA rights away from American workers through a regulation. I would think everybody in this body would be outraged, after 40 years of bipartisan support for ERISA, that we would think it is okay for anybody to take away workers’ ERISA rights. It is not. What we are doing today is the right thing to do, not if you are for Big Government. But if you are for the American worker, this is the right thing to do. Rather than pound on the table, let’s work together, pass this rule, pass this underlying legislation, and do the right thing for the American worker. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1300 Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, there is one similarity with Russia and what we are doing here today, and that is the process. This is completely closed. This is totally undemocratic. There is no opportunity for amendment. There is no opportunity for different opinions to be presented here. So, again, this process is deeply flawed. Again, my friends on the other side of the aisle may want to defend it, but I will tell you this is unprecedented. With the number of closed rules that we have seen, you are going to break all records. My Republican friends also have the distinction of presiding over the most closed Congress in history. This will outdo that because they are moving in such a restrictive and closed way. This is not right. The idea that we are going to repeal protections with an upordown vote without having the committees of jurisdiction even do a hearing, even to weigh the very points of view on this, to bring these bills to the floor like this in a way that would not allow people to improve these protections is outrageous. But this is the new norm here. Everything is shut down. And the gentleman is right that the previous question maybe is a little bit off subject from the two underlying bills here, but as the gentleman knows, we are currently debating the rule. This is a tool used to set the House’s agenda and to prioritize consideration of legislation. For that very reason, this is, in fact, the appropriate time for us to explain to the American people what legislation we would like to prioritize and what agenda we would like to pursue in this House. Because the fact of the matter is, if we offer amendments to the Rules Committee by a 9–4 vote, we are turned down. We are shut out all the time. So this is our only opportunity to be able to bring some of our priorities before our fellow Members in the House and to be able to let the American people know that some of us in this House are horrified by Russian interference in our election. It is unprecedented what they did. Anybody who sat through any of the briefings or even read the unclassified report, I don’t know how you could not be horrified by the deliberate attempt to impact our elections. And yet, we can’t even get oversight in this House. The wagons have all circled around the President. You can’t do anything that will make him uncomfortable. Well, the fact of the matter is this is about more than making a President of the United States uncomfortable. This is about defending our electoral system, defending our democracy. And the gentleman from California, in arguing in favor of voting ‘‘no’’ on the previous question so we can bring up a bill that would allow there to be an independent bipartisan investigation of Russian interference on our election I think is even more important, given what we know about what happened with General Flynn. Many of us said, when he was being considered for the top national security spot in the White House, that this was a bad choice. Why? Well, because this is a guy who regularly peddled in conspiracy theories, whacky conspiracy theories. Members of the intelligence community, members of our Defense Department regularly said, when he was being considered, that this was a bad choice. My Republican friends said nothing. Now we realize just how bad a choice this was and how bad the President’s judgment was in allowing a man like this to be elevated to such a high position in the White House. There are serious questions that need to be answered here. I would say to my colleagues, rather than trying to dodge and rather than trying to hide and rather than trying to frustrate attempts to get to the truth, there ought to be a bipartisan effort, similar to the 9/11 Commission, where people come together and, in an open, transparent way so the American people know what is going on, are able to get to the truth. That is what we are trying to do here. We have no other means to be able to get our views heard—certainly not in the Rules Committee. Every amendment we offer is turned down. So I would say to my colleagues, vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. Let us be able to bring up the SwalwellCummings bill and have a vote on it. If you don’t want to do an investigation, then vote ‘‘no.’’ But this is important and, I would argue, more important than the underlying bills, given what we are faced with. This is serious business, and it is about time my friends on the other side of the aisle treated it as serious business. I will just close, Mr. Speaker, by saying that I have served here now for 20 years, and I have gotten to know some of the finest people in this Chamber, both Democrats and Republicans. I know there are a lot of Republicans who believe, as we do on the Democratic side, that we need to find out 
what happened and we need to get to the truth. We don’t want to see more attempts to block investigations. I hope that those Republicans would join with us and vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question because, if you vote ‘‘no,’’ we get to bring this up, we get to vote on it, and we still get to vote on the underlying legislation. This doesn’t slow anything down; this doesn’t stop anything; but it allows us, at this very important moment, to be able to debate something that I know a lot of people in this country are very concerned about. Mr. Speaker, again, vote ‘no’ on the previous question, and vote ‘‘no’’ on this closed, restrictive Putin rule. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I agree with my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) that this is, indeed, serious business. Looking out for the workers of America is perhaps the most serious business that we do. We have heard a lot of speechifying about trying to do the right thing for the average person in America. On the way out the door, the Obama administration promulgated two regulations that attempt to force government tight retirement on people when they don’t want it and take away their consumer protection rights under ERISA. That is very serious business. But instead of having a debate about that, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle tried to switch the subject to something else because they don’t want to have to defend the indefensible. These two regulations that these two CRA bills would reverse would take away protections for American workers. This debate is not closed. I completely disagree with that assertion. We had a full debate on this yesterday afternoon in the Rules Committee. We devoted an hour of debate to it right now. Of course, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen to chew up most of their time, instead of talking about this rule and the underlying legislation, talking about something else; but that is their right if that is what they want to do. If they had some serious debate that they wanted to have on this rule and the underlying legislation, we wouldn’t be talking about Russia. We would be talking about these bills. We would be talking about these regulations. If this rule is adopted, we will have at least 2 hours of debate here on the floor on the bills themselves, and perhaps more if there is a motion to recommit. There is plenty of debate here. There is plenty of time to decide that you are for the American workers and protecting their consumer protection rights under ERISA or you are against American workers—either/or. It doesn’t have anything to do with Russia. It has nothing to do with the Presidential election. It has everything to do with whether you stand with the workers of America or not. I stand with the workers of America. I think the vast majority of the people in this body want to stand with the workers of America. If they do, I hope that they will vote for this rule and vote for the underlying legislation so that we can reverse these two regulations. Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 116 and the underlying joint resolutions. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 116 O FFERED BY  MR. MCGOVERN  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign Interference in the 2016 Election. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 356. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, a parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MCGOVERN. My parliamentary inquiry is, are there any amendments that have been made in order under this rule? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will not interpret the measure while it is pending. Mr. MCGOVERN. Can the Speaker respond to whether this is a closed rule, which means that no amendments are in order? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will not characterize the measure. Mr. MCGOVERN. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 428, RED RIVER GRADIENT BOUNDARY SURVEY ACT, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 42, DISAPPROVING RULE SUBMITTED BY DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELATING TO DRUG TESTING OF UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION APPLICANTS Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 99 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. R ES. 99 Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 428) to survey the gradient boundary along the Red River in the States of Oklahoma and Texas, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources; and (2) one motion to recommit. SEC. 2 Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 42) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to drug testing of unemployment compensation applicants. All points of order against consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means; and (2) one motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of two important measures. First, the resolution provides for consideration of H.R. 428, the Red River Gradient Boundary Survey Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee, and provides for a motion to recommit. In addition, the resolution provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 42, providing for congressional disapproval of a rule issued by the Department of Labor with regard to drug testing. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, and provides for a motion to recommit. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 428 is a product of months of negotiation between the States of Texas and Oklahoma and the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Tribes in my district. I am happy to have been able to work with my friend Mr. THORNBERRY to come up with a fair and equitable solution which all interested parties have agreed to. As you may know, the Red River serves as the State line separating Oklahoma and Texas. Over time, the river has moved, as much as a mile in some areas, causing landowners’ properties to be affected. Instead of working to resolve this, for nearly a century, the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, has been unwilling to survey a small portion of the Federal land along a 116mile stretch of the Red River between Oklahoma and Texas. H.R. 428 would direct the survey to be completed, using the gradient boundary survey method that was mandated by the Supreme Court, so that ownership of the land, which has been under dispute, can be effectively resolved. b1315 In addition, Mr. Speaker, the rule provides for the consideration of another Congressional Review Act resolution, which would overturn a Department of Labor rule related to drug testing for those applying for unemployment insurance. In 2012, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act made a number of reforms to the unemployment insurance program, including overturning a 1960sera Department of Labor ban on the screening or testing of unemployment applicants for illegal drugs. The 2012 provision allowed, but did not require, States to test unemployment insurance applicants who either, one, lost their jobs due to drug use or, two, who were seeking new jobs that generally required new employees to pass a drug test. Unfortunately, after 4 years and a now finalized rule, States are no closer to being able to implement this sensible policy. Instead, because of the Department of Labor’s overreach, three States which have enacted necessary State law changes to implement this commonsense policy are actually now precluded from moving forward with this sensible, bipartisan policy. Mr. Speaker, most States already limit unemployment insurance benefits or individuals who refuse to take or fail an employer drug test or who have previous employment issues with drugs. We should empower States, employers, and prospective employees who are looking for work and overturn this onerous regulation. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for yielding to me the customary 30 minutes for debate. I rise to debate the rule for consideration, which bundles together two completely unrelated pieces of legislation. One is a joint resolution disapproving of a Department of Labor rule that relates to the drug testing of unemployment compensation applicants. The other, as the gentleman just described, is the Red River Gradient Boundary Survey Act. There are many more important issues, in my opinion, that face this country at the moment, and for the life of me, I cannot figure out why my colleagues across the aisle think that ceding Bureau of Land Management survey authority over federally owned land to the States and impugning the integrity of those who rightfully seek unemployment insurance are on the same list of important matters this body should be addressing. First, I would note the odd events that brought us here today as we operate, once again, under a closed rule. I just heard the debate on the previous rule, and I was illuminated by the gentleman from Alabama, on the other side, who indicated that the rule wasn’t closed because we had a debate in the Rules Committee yesterday for 1 hour. A closed rule is a closed rule. It means that other Members of this body do not have an opportunity to have their amendments heard and/or made in order. We are now entering our 13th of these closed rules in a body that claimed that it was going to have open rules and regular order. On February 3, Congressman MCCLINTOCK wrote to Chairman Sessions, asking that the Red River Gradient Boundary Survey Act be heard under a structured rule, which still isn’t an open rule. An amendment deadline was set, and two germane amendments with no budgetary issues were submitted. Nevertheless, my Republican colleagues shut down the process and reported a closed rule. As of today, twothirds of all of the rules issued this session by the Rules Committee have been closed rules. We should not be conducting the people’s business this way. I call on my Republican colleagues to put their unfounded fear aside and let this body operate under regular order, under open rules, or, at the very least, under structured rules. 
I am dismayed to see, even when the Republican chairman of a subcommittee asks the Republican chairman of the Rules Committee for a structured rule, that the Republican leadership sees fit to ignore that request and continue this closed process—stifling ideas and debate before they can even get started. It is this kind of shifting decisionmaking that sows distrust and disappointment in the American people when they survey how business is conducted in their House. However, it is not just this kind of duplicitous behavior that undermines this institution, but, as I mentioned moments ago, a complete lack of an ability to get our priorities straight. We still have plenty of folks who are looking for jobs. We have plenty of people who are terrified that they will soon lose the health care that keeps them and their children living healthy and productive lives. We have plenty of people who are understandably concerned that our immigration policy has taken a deep dive into the shallow end. But we don’t come here to address these important issues. Instead, my Republican colleagues bring to the floor, week after week, legislation to undermine wellthoughtout agency rules and make it increasingly difficult for our agencies to carry out their duties. The fact that we need to come here today and discuss the efficacy of having the Bureau of Land Management manage our Nation’s land is beyond me. For nearly 100 years, the Bureau of Land Management has conducted uncontested surveys, and now we are supposed to believe that, all of a sudden, the agency is not following the appropriate standard. If folks don’t like the survey methods or think the wrong standard is being used, then one needs to go through the court system. One does not engage in the unprecedented measure of ceding to the States the Federal Government’s legitimate authority over Federal land. The second completely unrelated resolution, H.J. Res. 42, overturns a Department of Labor rule regarding the drug testing of Americans who apply for unemployment compensation. Under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, States were given the authority to conduct drug tests on unemployment insurance applicants under two circumstances: if the applicant were terminated from a previous job due to unlawful drug use or if the only available, suitable work were in an occupation that regularly conducts drug testing. The rule in question clarifies that occupations that ‘‘regularly conduct drug testing’’ include occupations that are specifically identified in State or Federal law as requiring an employee to be tested. Put another way, if a State thinks a job warrants a drug test, all it needs to do is add the job to a list. The rule strikes a balance, preserving deference to States while providing commonsense clarity to the law. This is how things should be done—that is, the regulations that were in force until now, at least. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, common sense is not put to much use around here these days. Republicans want to repeal the rule because, one would have to assume, it does not go far enough in embarrassing those people who are simply trying to obtain unemployment insurance during a difficult time. Let us be crystal clear in that the only purpose this repeal can serve is to embarrass folks, because there is no evidence linking those who seek unemployment insurance to increased rates of drug abuse. Be that as it may, Republicans still insist on expanding expensive and offensive drug screenings. Today, once again, we see the Republicans engaging in the Trumpian exercise of creating alternative facts. In today’s example, we have a resolution that is based on the blanket assumption that unemployed Americans use drugs. It further implies that Americans who apply for unemployment benefits are to blame for being unemployed. This implication is as unfounded as it is offensive to those hardworking Americans who find themselves unemployed due to no fault of their own. And what do these hardworking Americans get for their troubles—a Congress dedicated to ensuring that new and wellpaid jobs are there for them tomorrow? Not at all. Instead, they get a Republicanled Congress that is bent on subjecting them to unconstitutional, offensive, and expensive drug tests. Like it or not, facts still matter. Here is one: a conservative estimate by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration puts the cost of drug testing at $25 to $75 per test. Because Federal law prohibits charging applicants for these tests, States would have to absorb the cost of testing thousands of unemployed workers. In the State of Texas, for instance, that would translate to, approximately, $30 million for a single year of testing. A while back, we spent a lot of time around here talking about unfunded mandates, and somehow or another, this one, I guess, doesn’t fit in that category. Mr. Speaker, arbitrarily testing Americans who apply for unemployment compensation runs contrary to our Constitution and is a solution in search of a problem. Being unemployed is not a sufficient reason to be subjected to a governmentoperated drug test. Proposals like this blame unemployed Americans for being unemployed. It is illegal and it is a huge waste of money. We have got some real problems that we need to address in this Congress. At some point, this Congress will need to get to work. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Obviously, the gentleman and I have some disagreement here, but let’s talk for a minute about the form of what we are doing. The gentleman is correct in that this rule covers two different pieces of legislation that don’t have anything substantive in common. However, the legislation itself will be debated separately. We will have one debate on the OklahomaTexas issue, which involves the boundary between those two States and the tribal interests that are also intimately part of that. We will have a separate debate on the rule. That is the appropriate way to proceed. There is no reason to have a separate rule for each one of these debates, but it is appropriate, as the gentleman suggested, to have two different debates because they are two different subjects. I am going to disagree with him—and I am probably being parochial in this sense—for, if you live in Oklahoma, we actually think the border between Oklahoma and Texas is pretty important. This is an issue that, frankly, was dealt with legislatively last year. This body did not vote out the bill. I actually opposed it last year because it did not take care of the tribal interests involved and they had not been suitably dealt with. We amended the bill. Actually, I should say it was brought up, but it was not taken up by the Senate. We changed it, but we kept working for many months. Chairman THORNBERRY  is the person who deserves most of the credit here of trying to bring the parties together. Also, just by way of explanation so everybody is clear, this does not settle the issue. This doesn’t force anything on the Federal Government or the two States or the tribes. It simply creates a common database. The two States have been asking for a complete survey of the contested area for many years. The BLM has refused to do that. You simply can’t sort through this problem of a shifting border—set well over a century ago—with conflicting tribal interests if you don’t have a common set of data here. So that is all that is being done here. I can assure you that, certainly, the tribes in question would not have consented to go forward if they had thought they were having a solution imposed on them. What they think they are getting is a database that will allow them to determine exactly what their interests and rights here are and, hopefully, negotiate that with the two States in question; but, if necessary, they will litigate the issue. b1330 So we see this as a reasonable effort to bring parties together where there is a great deal of confusion through nobody’s fault. And we think the BLM has been lax here and, frankly, may well be claiming things beyond its authority. But the survey, again, will hopefully take care of that. So I hope that eases the concerns that people have. 
In terms of the drug rule, we see this as an issue where Congress made its intent in 2012 very clear, that is, we wanted States to have options to make these decisions for themselves. We think the Department of Labor rule made that more, rather than less, difficult. We can argue over the merits of any individual treatment of people that have used illegal drugs or what the appropriate testing measure is or whatever. I happen to think those decisions are best made at the State level where you have got interested parties that are more knowledgeable about local conditions than us dictating a one size fits all. So we just simply disagree on that. Finally, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ) mentioned some concerns about the speed with which we are acting and also the form with which we are acting. The form, frankly, is basically dictated by statute. The Congressional Review Act dictates the manner in which we can bring these items on rules to the floor, the timetable which we can operate under. If we alter that over here, then, frankly, we lose privilege status in the Senate and the chances of succeeding actually diminish pretty greatly. We think, in this case, the issues are pretty clear. These aren’t really things that need to be amended. We need to decide whether or not the regulation is appropriate or not. If you think it is, you should vote in favor of keeping the regulation as it is and against this effort. If, on the other hand, you would like to see decisionmaking devolve down to the States and where we think better decisions will be made, then, you should vote in favor of the rule and the underlying legislation. So, again, I don’t think these issues are overly complex. I do think this is an important time to deal with them. Again, we have a limited period of time on the Congressional Review Act. We have a certain format. We think we are abiding within both that timeframe and that format. On the OklahomaTexas border issue, it is a knotty issue. It has been around for decades. There have been multiple efforts to deal with it. Most of them have faltered because we have not had the various parties arguing from a common database as to what their positions are. We have asked the Bureau of Land Management repeatedly to survey the affected area. They decided they didn’t want to do that. In this case, Congress says: Look, we have two sovereign States and three sovereign Indian tribes here that have a concern. We want them to be able to work it through. We want them to draw on a common set of data. So we are going to essentially make sure that that happens and hopefully we can avoid a protracted court case between the States and the Indian tribes and actually resolve an issue that needs to be had. There are literally thousands of people along this border that are not certain whether or not they own the land that they have actually been farming, in some cases, for generations. There are three Indian tribes that have historic rights to this land that predate, frankly, the existence of Texas as a State and certainly the existence of Oklahoma as a State. They want to make sure their mineral rights issues and their land issues are appropriately handled, and they want to preserve their rights going forward if they want to litigate. Again, they need this kind of data to make those sorts of determinations. I commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ). I, again, look forward to working with my good friend from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ) on these issues. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. While we are discussing these matters that my colleagues want to discuss that I don’t think are paramount or issues that are vital to America’s security, there are a plethora of issues that we could be discussing, and rightly should be. Toward that end, one of the things that the minority is given as an opportunity is to offer a previous question to the matter that is on the floor at this time. So I exercise that prerogative by asserting that the National Security Council was established in 1947 to encourage candid discussions between the Federal agencies charged with keeping America safe to ensure they would provide the President with the best policy advice possible. For this very reason, security experts on both sides of the aisle agree that partisan politics have no place in the Council’s deliberations. With this in mind, it is deeply troubling that President Donald John Trump would promote Steve Bannon, his chief political adviser, to a full seat on the Council’s Principals Committee, while simultaneously relegating the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence to a lower status. At the very least, this sends the very dangerous signal that the Trump White House intends to let political calculations influence its decisionmaking on the life anddeath matters of national security. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative STEPHANIE MURPHY ’s bill to prohibit political advisers from regularly attending National Security Council meetings. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY ). Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, I introduced H.R. 804, legislation designed to ensure that the deliberations and decisions of the National Security Council are not unreasonably influenced by partisan politics. The bill has garnered nearly 130 cosponsors, including the ranking members of the House Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, and Intelligence Committees. It is my hope that the bill will obtain support from my colleagues across the aisle because the principle it seeks to vindicate has long enjoyed bipartisan backing. The motivation for my legislation was President Trump’s directive formally authorizing his chief political adviser, Stephen Bannon, to attend all meetings of the NSC and its main subgroup, the Principals Committee. This aspect of the President’s directive generated concern from respected military and intelligence professionals across the ideological spectrum. For example, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman JOHN MCCAIN characterized Mr. Bannon’s appointment as a radical departure from precedent. Former White House Chief of Staff, Defense Secretary, and CIA Director Leon Panetta observed that the last place you want to put someone who worries about politics is in a room where they are talking about national security. And the exchairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Michael Mullen, asserted that every President has the right and responsibility to shape the National Security Council as he sees fit, but partisan politics has no place at that table. My bill would amend the 1947 law in which Congress created the NSC and established the statutory members of the Council. It would add simple language to provide that no individual whose primary or predominant responsibility is political in nature shall regularly attend or participate in meetings of the NSC or the Principals Committee. I want to emphasize that while I may disagree with President Trump and Mr. Bannon on a range of matters, this bill is not about any specific individual. The prohibition in my legislation would apply whether the President or political adviser in question is Republican or Democrat and irrespective of their particular party views or personal attributes. At its core, this bill is about fidelity to a deeply American principle: the principle that the servicemembers in our allvolunteer military, the quiet professionals in our intelligence community, and the men and women who protect our homeland should never have their lives disrupted or placed at risk because of a national security policymaking process that is contaminated by partisan politics. The President is free to obtain political and policy advice from whomever 
he wishes. However, he should not be free to place a political adviser on the most vital national security policymaking body in our country. Congress created the NSC, and Congress can and should set reasonable parameters governing its membership. I respectfully urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and to support H.R. 804. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Actually, I listened with a great deal of interest to the debate from my friends on the other side. None of it had very much to do with the rule or with the underlying legislation that we are going to discuss shortly, so I don’t pretend to be an expert on the issues. I do point out, simply in passing, that it really is up to the President of the United States as to whose advice he or she wants to take. Frankly, you know, to say that there aren’t ‘‘political people on the National Security Agency,’’ with all due respect to a Chief of Staff that I admire profoundly, I think Leon Panetta is one of the great Chiefs of Staff to ever serve any President, but I would tell you that he is a pretty political guy. He was in this body, and one of his jobs was to help make sure the President of the United States was reelected. So there was a political dimension to what he did. I don’t know Mr. Bannon. I have never met him. I don’t pretend to be familiar with him or his thinking. I do know that he is a valued adviser to the President of the United States. And if the President of the United States is going to seek advice from somebody— and it may be in these areas of national security—frankly, personally, I would prefer them to be part of the National Security Council, simply to have the educated debate of some of the very best professionals that we have and so that their opinion, when they advise the President, is fully formed. Again, I see this as the President’s decision, not some enormous departure. On occasions, Mr. Axelrod, who was not a chief of staff who was primarily a political counsel, did sit in on national security meetings at the request of the President. So, again, we can have this argument. I am not sure it is particularly relevant to the legislation. But at the end of the day, I want anybody advising the President of the United States—and he gets to make that choice—to get the best information they can possibly receive so that that advice is wellinformed. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER ), who is here to offer some important thoughts about some of the issues that are involved in the underlying legislation. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule providing for consideration of H.J. Res. 42, which disapproves of the rule submitted by the Department of Labor on drug testing of unemployment insurance applicants. In 2012, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act was passed into law. This bipartisan reform allowed, but did not require, States to administer drug tests to those applying for unemployment insurance benefits. Unemployment insurance applicants are required by law to be able and available for employment, and drug testing is one of the most effective ways to ensure applicants meet this requirement. This law was also intended to reassure employers and taxpayers who fund the unemployment insurance program that those claiming benefits were truly ready to be hired and work. In the years following the passage of this law, the Department of Labor failed to issue a rule to implement it. But in the final months of the Obama administration, the Department of Labor issued a final rule that severely limited States’ ability to drug test unemployment insurance applicants. In issuing this rule, the Department of Labor acted outside their authority and went against the clear intent of Congress. H.J. Res. 42 would provide for disapproval of this rule through the Congressional Review Act. This is needed to remove this overreaching rule and allow for the original intent of the law to be fully implemented. States are in the best position to determine how to efficiently and effectively administer unemployment insurance programs, and should be allowed to drug test applicants if they choose to do so. Reform of the unemployment insurance program is of particular interest to me. Last Congress, I introduced the Ensuring Quality in the Unemployment Insurance Program Act, which would allow States to choose how to implement drug testing on unemployment insurance applicants. I thank Chairman BRADY and Chairman COLE for their attention to this very important issue, and I look forward to working with them to enact meaningful reforms to the unemployment insurance program. I urge my colleagues to support the rule and this resolution. b1345 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ), my good friend, who is the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule. Drug testing people who are simply applying for unemployment insurance is harassment. I am outraged on behalf of the workers across this country, workers in my congressional district, who could be subjected to insulting and unnecessary testing when they have earned the right to apply for unemployment insurance. This is a strategy to throw up barriers to collecting unemployment insurance. It is an intimidation tactic with no basis in reality. States should not be allowed to impose additional obstacles to cut back on applications. These jobless workers are often unemployed through no fault of their own. Their jobs were taken away by corporations who have moved their jobs overseas in order to get a tax break. And in addition to that, we have a Tax Code today that supports them moving overseas. Or they may have lost their job because of a flawed trade agreement which, as we have seen in the past, has lost jobs and depressed wages. We ought to be dealing with a tax code that penalizes companies that move their jobs overseas, not people who just want to do an honest day’s work or collect the unemployment insurance that they are entitled to. People want to work in this country, and it is often tiresome to listen to the ways that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle demean working people, people who struggle every day. We are all identified by the jobs that we have. We take pride in the work that we do. People don’t want to be on unemployment. What they want to do is to say to their kids: Be proud of me. This is my job. This is what I do. I want to be your role model. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. HASTINGS. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. Ms. DELAURO. What we ought to do, again, let’s penalize those companies that send their jobs overseas. Let’s do something about those flawed trade agreements which have lost over 800,000 jobs or more. That is just from the NAFTA agreement. Let’s do something else for working people in this country. Or you know what? Perhaps we ought to be drug testing the CEOs of companies who move their mailboxes overseas, export jobs, and who are in the business of hurting American workers. And, by the way, they are getting massive tax breaks at taxpayers’ expense. I strongly oppose this rule and this resolution. American workers deserve better. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to point out for the record, Mr. Speaker, that actually this rule that we are trying to repeal, the measure we are trying to instate, doesn’t force drug testing on anybody; and that is not going to happen in any State, unless the people in the State decide that that is something they want to do. I am quite content to let people in any State make that decision. I think in my State, I am pretty certain that the people who I am privileged to represent would be very upset if they thought somebody was receiving unemployment compensation while they were on drugs, because they think 
that is going to make it pretty hard for that person to ever get back into the workforce, and they want to be able to identify that. They don’t want to incentivize it. Other people may have a different opinion, and that is legitimate. It is a big country. That is why our Founding Fathers adopted a Federal system, so I wouldn’t begrudge another State that saw it differently. What we are trying to avoid here is a onesizefitsall or this body and any administration dictating to every State what they ought to do. Frankly, I would suggest that my good friend’s remarks suggest that is the concern, that they actually want to decide in Oklahoma what we would do. We are not trying to decide in Connecticut what our friends would do. We are just thinking this ought to be down to the States. That was the intent of Congress. When this was written, it was to empower the States to allow them to pursue policies they thought were appropriate. Frankly, if they do that and they pursue different policies, which they may well, we may actually learn something out of this. Again, that is part of the genius of our system, having 50 different laboratories out there. But let’s not have a bureaucracy decide that it will circumvent the will of the Congress of the United States and write a rule that is clearly meant to undo the intent of a legislation that was passed across this floor with bipartisan support. Again, we just disagree on the issue, but, for the record, we are not trying to impose our beliefs. We are trying to let every State do what that State thinks they ought to do. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, through you, I ask of my good friend from Oklahoma whether or not he has additional speakers. I do not, and I am prepared to close. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I am certainly prepared to close if my friend is. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we are here debating one rule for two entirely unrelated and unnecessary bills. To make matters worse, in the process of doing so, my Republican colleagues have shut out my fellow Democrats and some of their Republicans, even after presenting two germane amendments, even having the opportunity to have those amendments debated on the floor of the House of Representatives, the people’s House. What are you afraid of? By not making in order germane amendments with no budgetary effect, even after the chairman of the pertinent committee asked that a structured rule be provided that would have allowed for those two germane amendments to be offered, the majority is silencing the dulyelected representatives of millions of Americans. We have more important things to address here in the people’s House. Continuing to undermine the dedicated work of our Federal agencies, continuing to govern not based on the reality of the situation but on how you feel things are, and then shutting out the voices of millions of Americans through their representatives from the legislative process is shameful and no way to govern. The American people deserve better. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out again that, while my friend is correct, we have two different pieces of legislation under a single rule, and those legislations, as my friend points out, are not particularly related. As a matter of fact, they are not related to one another in any way. Each piece of legislation will receive a separate debate and a separate vote on the House floor. There was simply no reason to have two rules when one would suffice for two bills that basically need to come into the same format, in our view. I also point out that, when we are talking about the vote under the Congressional Review Act, we are actually following a form prescribed in statute, and we are moving at a pace that the law dictates and that, frankly, is necessary in order to retain the privileged status of the legislation in the United States Senate. So nothing unusual here, other than we are actually being pretty productive and undoing a lot of rules that, frankly, we think were misguided and rushed into the final days of the last administration. My friends are free to disagree with that, but I think the issues are pretty clear, pretty easy to decide, and don’t require a great deal of amendments. On the OklahomaTexas issue, and that is something I know a little bit about since it affects my district, last year, when we considered this legislation, we actually did have an amendment. It was my amendment, and my amendment that probably made it unacceptable in the Senate. But I was indulged by my chairman of the Rules Committee, and for the very important reason that we actually make sure that the tribes have an opportunity to be at the table. In this case, they do. Mr. THORNBERRY has worked very hard, and so there is no dispute between the delegations in Oklahoma, the delegations in Texas, the interests of the various Indian tribes. Everybody agrees that we need a common set of information, a common survey that we can all trust to, frankly, work out the differences here that have multiplied over a century as the border has literally shifted. So that is the appropriate thing to do. We don’t need a lot of amendments on that. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support the rule. H.R. 428 is a fair and equitable solution which all interested parties have agreed upon and which can provide certainty that many landowners have sought along the OklahomaTexas border. In addition, H.J. Res. 42 undoes a regulation that should have never been made in the first place. By preventing implementation of this regulation, we can ensure that those actively looking for work are provided with the support necessary to reach that goal. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to take a point of personal privilege. This is the last time my good friend and my staff member, Mr. Waskiewicz, will be on the floor with me. He has been with me for 61⁄2years. He has made a smart career move and is moving on to the Budget Committee, a more august position. But I have had the good fortune, as I know my friends have and we all have, to have very many wonderful staff members over the years. I have never had a better staff member than Steve Waskiewicz, never had a better friend, never had a harder worker, never had anybody who was more selfless in putting the interests of our office and the constituents whom we are privileged to represent ahead of all else. So I want to commend and thank him publicly and on the record for his wonderful service. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule and the underlying bill. I strongly oppose this rule because it makes in order H.J. Res. 42, a bill disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to drug testing of unemployment compensation applicants, an effort to impose drug testing as a condition of receiving unemployment insurance and other forms of public assistance. I oppose this rule because it would repeal a Department of Labor rule intended to implement a bipartisan agreement on implementing a provision, in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, that allows states to drug test unemployment insurance (UI) applicants in certain circumstances. In 2012, Congress approved a bipartisan compromise on drug testing unemployment insurance claimants. The agreement permitted states to drug test UI claimants in cases where: 1) an applicant has been discharged from their last job because of unlawful drug use; or 2) an applicant who ‘‘is an individual for whom suitable work (as defined under the State law) is only available in an occupation that regularly conducts drug testing (as determined under regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor).’’ Congress therefore mandated the Department of Labor to define through regulation those occupations that regularly conduct drug testing. The final Department of Labor (DOL) rule, which would be repealed by H.J. Res. 42, defined ‘‘occupation’’ as a position or class of positions that are required, or may be required in the future, by state or federal law to be drug tested. Some members of Congress have criticized the regulations as being too narrowly drawn, but in fact, they track the bipartisan legislation very closely. It seems that what is really at issue is a desire to conduct broader drug testing of UI applicants. 
Any proposal that seeks to expand the ability of states to drug test people for unemployment insurance should be vigorously opposed. States already have the ability to administer drug testing and this change would needlessly shift employer costs to the states. State UI programs already penalize jobrelated drug use. Virtually all states treat a drugrelated discharge as disqualifying misconduct even if it is not explicitly referenced in their discharge statutes. Twenty states also explicitly deny benefits for any job loss connected to drug use or a failed drug test. In addition, six states (Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin) have passed legislation equating a failed or refused preemployment drug screen with refusing suitable work. Employers already have testing as a tool to screen out people who use illicit drugs, at no cost to states. Proponents of drug testing argue that states want to be able to drug test UI applicants. However, only three states (Texas, Mississippi and Wisconsin) have enacted laws permitting state drug testing of UI claimants, consistent with the federal regulation, with all three of these states delaying implementation until after the final DOL rule targeted by H.J. Res. 42 was issued. Suspicionless drug testing of government benefit recipients likely violates the Fourth Amendment. Generally, governmentmandated drug testing not based on individualized suspicion is unconstitutional. Drug tests historically have been considered searches for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment. For searches to be reasonable, they generally must be based on individualized suspicion unless the government can show a special need warranting a deviation from the norm. However, social insurance or governmental benefit programs like UI, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Housing Assistance do not naturally evoke the special needs that the Supreme Court has recognized in the past. Indeed, when states like Michigan and Florida have tried to impose mandatory suspicionless drug testing on all TANF applicants or recipients, they have been stopped by federal courts that have found such testing to be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment. These court battles also imposed substantial legal costs for states. Stateadministered drug testing is a poor investment of public funds. Claims that testing will save taxpayer money are built upon the assumption that the tests will return a high number of positive results. However, studies show that individuals who receive public benefits use drugs at rates similar to the general population, and the vast majority of such individuals do not use drugs. Most individuals, in fact, refrain from using drugs on a regular basis. Ten states have spent substantial amounts of money in recent years to set up and administer drug testing systems for TANF recipients, but have identified only a few claimants testing positive. Drug testing is also costly and prone to returning falsepositives. Drug tests that do come back as positive easily identify marijuana use but often miss other drugs that ordinarily clear out of the body within a few days. Tests do not indicate if a person is impaired, or whether they are using less than they have in the past. Working people paid for this insurance policy, and jobless workers earned the right to access UI through their service to their employer. Proposals to drug test UI beneficiaries needlessly stigmatize and punish jobless workers and their families who are trying to get back on their feet. If legislators have genuine concerns about drug use, there are far better ways to respond than targeting and stigmatizing the unemployed. I urge you to oppose H. Res. 99, the Rule governing debate for H.J. Res. 42 and any legislation that seeks to expand the ability of states to condition the receipt of unemployment insurance and other forms of public assistance on a drug test. For these reasons and more, I oppose this rule and the underlying bill. I would also like to include the following list of organizations actively opposed to H.J. Res. 42:

The material previously referred to by Mr. HASTINGS is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 99 O FFERED BY  MR. HASTINGS  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 804) to amend the National Security Act of 1947 to protect the National Security Council from political interference, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority members of the Committees on Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 804. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he 
then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Chairman BISHOP  
for not only yielding me the time, but for his patience and diligence and understanding this issue, and I also want to thank Subcommittee Chairman MCCLINTOCK for the work that he has put into it. The Natural Resources Committee has conducted hearings on this issue. They have reported out bills related to this issue in the last two Congresses, and last Congress, the whole House voted for a bill that deals with this issue. I am grateful to Chairman BISHOP and Subcommittee Chair MCCLINTOCK for all of that effort. Mr. Speaker, this bill is just a small sliver of what this House has passed before. This bill requires the Federal Government to do what the Federal Government should have done long ago, and that is to conduct a survey along the Red River following the instructions of the United States Supreme Court. That is all this bill does. It does not dispose of any land; it does not alter the rights or claims of any State, any tribe, any individual. It just says the Federal Government has a responsibility to know what the Federal Government is supposed to be controlling. They have never, ever conducted a survey of this area, and so this bill says: You will have a survey conducted using the method that the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held is a method you ought to use. I am a little taken aback, Mr. Speaker, on why that should be controversial. We could go on at some length about how this came to be. It is interesting, historically, and we could go into a variety of details and so forth; but, again, the bottom line is the Federal law currently says the Federal Government has a responsibility to inventory and ascertain where Federal land is. Yet the Bureau of Land Management not only has never done it in close to 100 years after the Supreme Court decision, the Bureau of Land Management has said they never intend to. They will never conduct a survey of this 116mile area. So this bill, as I say, is very simple. It says the Bureau of Land Management shall commission a survey, jointly agreed upon by Texas and Oklahoma, tribal and other interests a full part of that, but there will, once and for all, be a survey to determine where the Federal claim is and where the Federal claim is not. Now, part of the reason that is so important is because the Bureau of Land Management has, especially in 2013, come out and made a variety of claims that has thrown in doubt the proper title and ownership of land that has been in families for generations, that people have paid taxes on for generations. That has put a cloud on title of private landowners, and it does not help that cloud when the Bureau of Land Management says: We will never conduct a survey to determine exactly where the claim is. So everyone, Mr. Speaker, every State, every tribe, every local government, every individual—even the Federal Government and the BLM itself— deserves to know where the claims rightfully are and where the claims are rightfully not. First step is information. That is all this bill does. I think it is pretty clear that we should at least take this step. Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, Federal ownership of the land along the Red River dates back to the Louisiana Purchase. Over time, gradual changes in the course of the river have created uncertainty regarding Federal interests in the area as well as confusion about the exact boundary between Texas and Oklahoma. Further complicating the matter, Native American Tribes have mineral and other interests in the area impacted by the precise ownership of the land in question. In fact, as noted in the Supreme Court case of Oklahoma v. Texas, a 1923 case, the decision was the boundaries were changed due to accretion and erosion. It is important to note that the gentleman from Texas does not dispute the criteria set forth by the Supreme Court in Oklahoma v. Texas. Moreover, in 2000, Congress passed the Red River Boundary Compact, which shifted the boundary line between the States, but the location and status of lands in the public domain remain unchanged. Along the 116mile stretch, a portion of the land in the Red River area is still under Federal ownership because it has never been disposed of under the authority of Congress. In 2013, the Bureau of Land Management set out to revise the Federal resource management plan for Federal lands—not private lands, Federal lands—in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas. As part of that process, the BLM began to survey the lands to determine the extent of all ownership claims. According to the 2014 testimony from the Deputy Director of the BLM, Steve Ellis, the survey process the BLM intends ‘‘to identify, with certainty, and propose management alternatives for lands which fall within the public domain but have never been patented, reserved, or disposed.’’ According to that same testimony, the BLM estimates that approximately 30,000 acres of public land exist along the Red River between the north fork of the river and the 98th meridian. They also estimate that as many as 23,000 of those acres may be overlaid by private ownership interests. One of the most significant and advantageous parts about the process for updating land use plans is that it includes steps along the way that allow for public input, analysis, and informed decisionmaking. Once the survey is complete, the BLM has a variety of statutory authorities the agency can use to resolve conflicting claims, including the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Color of Title Act. H.R. 428, the bill before us today, has a troubled history. Flaws in the bill have prevented it from becoming law for several years. Some of those shortcomings have been addressed, but others remain. H.R. 428 would halt the planning and survey process in its tracks. The bill would strip the Bureau of Land Management of its survey authority along the 116mile stretch of the Red River, and it would force the Federal Government to accept the survey completed by the States of Texas and Oklahoma. Prohibiting the Federal Government from surveying its own land is unprecedented and unwarranted. What is also troubling is that, in stark violation of Republican policy against authorizations without an offset, this legislation authorizes the expenditure of $1 million in Federal funding to pay the States to complete the survey. It is important to note that allowing State governments to dictate the outcome of this process is a terrible precedent, and forcing the American taxpayers to pay the States for those surveys adds insult to injury. b1515 Parts of this case are currently in the Federal court of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The parties include the State of Texas, BLM, and plaintiff landowners; and they are in mediation working to resolve these very complicated issues. The nature of that lawsuit is a quiet title action. I include in the RECORD a minute order dated Tuesday, January 10, 2017. At the bottom of the order it reads, in relevant part: ‘‘Case did not settle but parties are continuing to work on settlement. Court will continue to monitor and assist mediation efforts.’’

Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, this bill would undermine the progress of the judicial branch and instead prohibit the Federal Government from surveying its own land. It also would force the American taxpayers to pay the States for these surveys. Shifting this authority, as we said earlier, is unprecedented and would cause more confusion. We should allow the parties to resolve this conflict, and Congress should stay out of it. What is troubling is that the bill is being proposed as something that brings the parties together. This mediation is doing that. More importantly, when you look at the bill itself, the question has to be asked: Where is the Department of the Interior? Where is the BLM? Let us not forget, it is the Department of the Interior that has the fiduciary duty to the tribes. The question really is: Can or should Congress abdicate its fiduciary obligation that is owed to the tribes by doing this survey? H.R. 428 does not warrant consideration by this body. We clearly have more important issues facing this Nation. Congress should get out of the way and allow the current BLM process to play out. This bill is a waste of our valuable time and taxpayers’ dollars. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK ), chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources’ Subcommittee on Federal Lands that deals with this area. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman THORNBERRY for working through three congressional sessions to do justice to the property owners along the Red River. The injustice that this bill corrects is galling. In 1923, the U.S. Supreme Court established rules for determining the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma, which established property rights over this land. For nearly a century, the Federal Government recognized and respected the property lines established by this ruling. Property owners purchased and sold this land and, in some cases, passed it down from generation to generation. These property owners, in good faith, dutifully paid taxes on their lands year after year, invested in these lands, maintained them, cultivated them, and improved them. Nearly 100 years later, in 2013, the Bureau of Land Management announced that it was arbitrarily changing these longestablished and settled boundaries and claiming ownership of 90,000 acres of land. This outrageous claim clouds property rights along this vast territory. It is based on the flimsiest of pretexts: a 2009 survey of some 6,000 acres out of the total 90,000 in dispute. This survey ignored the 1923 Supreme Court decree that originally established the boundary lines, and it then extrapolated the results of this limited survey to justify this land grab over the entire region. In other words, BLM laid claim to these lands with a guess based upon a fraud. The BLM has since scaled back its claim to 30,000 acres, a testament to the flimsy process with which it has upended the lives of every property owner in the region. The Red River Private Property Protection Act tells the BLM to back off. It authorizes a comprehensive survey of all of the disputed acreage to be conducted jointly by the two States directly affected and in consultation with the tribal governments involved. It requires that the survey be conducted on the longstanding criteria established by the Supreme Court, rather than the recent and illegal invention of the BLM. Upon the completion of the survey, the States of Texas and Oklahoma, in coordination with federally recognized Indian tribes, will review and approve the survey to ensure its accuracy and impartiality. Without this act, title to the farms and homes will be clouded for decades while the matter drags on through the courts. That is the course that the gentlewoman suggests we should follow: drag this on for years, if not decades, while these property owners languish in uncertainty. Meanwhile, the BLM’s assertion of regulatory jurisdiction would have devastating impacts on local homeowners and businesses and make it much more difficult to encourage economic development in the region. This measure is a scaleddown version of the bill passed by this House in 2015, in order to address concerns expressed by the American Indian Nations involved. Mr. Speaker, government exists to protect our natural rights, including our property rights, and this bill realigns our government with its stated purpose and its stated promise. I urge its speedy adoption. Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I think it is very important for us—though they have made light of the fact that this has a history, beginning with the Louisiana Purchase—that this is not a new issue. There are a series of subsequent treaties with foreign governments in 1819, 1828, and 1838, which set the south bank of the river as the southern border of the United States and the northern border of what is now the State of Texas. In 1867, when a portion of this public domain was reserved for the KiowaComancheApache (KCA) Reservation, the middle of the main channel of the river between the 98th meridian and the north fork of the river was established as the reservation’s southern boundary. The remaining land between what is now called the medial line and the southern bank retained its status as public land, which continues through the present. In a series of decisions in the 1920s, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted a method known as the gradient boundary method for determining the location of the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma along the southern bank of the river. In giving certainty to the boundary’s location and the extent of tribal holdings, the Court’s decision also provided a basis for clarifying private land ownership on each side of the river. In 1981 and 1984, two separate Oklahoma landowners argued in the United States District Court that, under riparian law, changes in the river’s location had expanded their private holdings while reducing the acreage of the Texas landowners whose properties faced them across the river. In both cases, the district court followed the Supreme Court’s established principle concerning the location of public and private lands. Private property in Oklahoma extended to the center of the river while private property in Texas stopped at the ordinary highwater mark on the southern bank, with the remaining land being part of the original public domain located in Oklahoma. In 2000, the State legislatures of Oklahoma and Texas, along with tribal leaders from the neighboring KCA Tribes and Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations, attempted to resolve these remaining issues by agreeing to the Red River Boundary Compact. Congress later consented to the compact, and, in so doing, agreed to move the jurisdictional boundary between the States from the south bank gradient line to the south bank vegetation line. The BLM began updating its resource management plan for public lands in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, which includes the area along the Red River, in 2013. The BLM doesn’t full know the extent of public domain, and that is why they are trying to do the survey. The resource management planning process would update the current RMPs covering this area, which were developed in 1994 and 1996, and establish a longterm plan articulating the BLM’s objectives and strategies for maintaining the health and productivity of public lands in the region. As we discussed earlier, in 1923, the United States Supreme Court also interjected into this and set the criteria. We can disagree on some of these issues, but we can at least agree to get 
our facts straight. We do know, Mr. Speaker, that this has been an ongoing process and this has gone back for different administrations. I think the question becomes: Why is it necessary to do this now? What is it that is happening now? They are in court. They have been in court. They have availed themselves of the court process. No one disagrees with the United States Supreme Court decision. So the question we should all ask ourselves is: Why now? Why take out, in this bill, my amendment that was rejected by the Rules Committee which would have eliminated that portion which says basically the Federal Government has no say in the survey? So why would we abdicate that major responsibility? We not only have responsibility to the tribes listed, but there are also different kinds of tribal lands, which we must take into account. So the question is: Why abdicate it? If as was stated earlier that what we are talking about is just a bill that says to the BLM to do the survey, then why does it contain within it a statement that says it has no right to concur or to approve? I think that it would be a different situation if this was a bill that said: hurry up and do your survey. But that is not what this bill says. This bill says the States of Texas and Oklahoma will do it—actually, Texas will do it in consultation with Oklahoma and specific tribes. Why doesn’t it say, if what we want is a survey, that BLM do the survey? I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA ), chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources’ Subcommittee on Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, you know when we swear to uphold an oath to our country and to our States, a lot goes with that responsibility. We have a very sacred covenant in protecting private property rights, the cornerstone of the founding of this Nation. So to see that after many decades or even centuries of people feeling secure in their property, in their land, how can one government agency come along and defy two entire States in a process they have used, the gradient boundary survey method, in this case, along the Red River between Texas and Oklahoma? How can you have one rogue Federal agency coming in and saying we supersede what these two States and decades and decades of tradition and security that these families have had along here is completely wrong? That is why H.R. 428 would send the right signal and give certainty back to these families. We are talking about a court process. Well, for private parties to have to go to a court, it is not the same as the government with its endless resources, endless time to slog through court in this case after 8 years. This is a lot of wear and tear on families when their property and their longtime traditions are in question here. I go back to a case some years ago, the Kilo v. New London decision, where it was deemed that government can just take property if it was deemed beneficial to the government or to the tax base, indeed, trampling on property rights. At least, in that case, you can count on that there might be some compensation for having that land taken. Will that even happen here? They are over a mile off in some of their surveys where the BLM believes the land line is. So the true border needs to be made certain and needs to be respectful of Texas and Oklahoma in their process in this property right discussion. Indeed, an 8yearlong nightmare, imagine what this does to families. It happens in my district as well when regulators come in and decide they are going to change the water rights. It is not even good for their health. People, when they are going through this legal process, it is painful for them. So H.R. 428 is a very important method of doing, through the gradient boundary survey, a fair way—one that is recognized by Texas and Oklahoma for many decades as the correct way— to survey and finally put this issue to rest after many, many more years than what it should have been. Indeed, private property rights are the cornerstone of part of why this country was even founded. Why do we continue to do this to the families who have, in good faith, paid taxes, made their land payments, and been part of the fiber of Texas and Oklahoma around the Red River for so many, many years? b1530 Instead of confusion, let’s give them certainty. I urge us to all support H.R. 428 and go to a survey method that is fair and recognized by two States, not by one Federal agency that wishes to override that process. Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is very interesting because we seem to be confusing what is at issue here. If what is at issue here is a survey process, then there is no question. The survey process is set up in the United States Supreme Court decision of Oklahoma v. Texas. No one disputes that that should be it. Neither is it disputed that BLM cannot illegally claim private property and, in fact, it does have a process by which it can sell that private property. First, under Section 203 of FLPMA, the BLM may sell public lands for private fair market value if, through the planning process, the public land has been determined to be difficult and uneconomic to manage; the land was acquired for a specific purpose but no longer fulfills the Federal purpose; or disposal may serve important public objectives which cannot be achieved prudently on land other than public land. Under Section 206 of the FLPMA, the Secretary of the Interior can also conduct land exchanges of equal value with the same State so long as the public interest is well served. Mr. Speaker, the reason why there is a compact of 2000 on this specific issue is because the States can’t do it without the concurrence of Congress. What is being proposed here, in terms of the survey, is really using a Federal standard. Again, the question is: Why? More importantly, Mr. Speaker, there are tribal lands involved; not only the tribes noted, but also different types of tribal lands, private tribal lands different from that which is held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior, and we are abdicating that responsibility. We have a fiduciary duty to these tribal lands, and it should not be treated basically with, well, if we don’t agree, maybe we can come forward and say we don’t agree. That is not what this is about. They are beginning the process. They are in mediation. The courts have been the mechanism by which landowners have views, and there is one going on. So why not let the process go? It just seems to be out of Congress’ authority to simply abdicate the responsibilities that we have and say: The States can do it. And then we pay for it. Now, that makes no sense. We need to be able to say to those that we have a fiduciary obligation to, and others, that we have done our job; that the Federal Government has done its job. They are in the process. So the question I have again is, why now? Why now? This has been going on since way—I read through all the different treaties and the different types of cases that came up since 1923, Oklahoma v. Texas. So why now? Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ), who understands this, who is coming from that State, and who also serves as the vice chairman of the entire Resources Committee. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to the chairman of our committee. I appreciate the question asked by my colleague across the aisle: Why now? The answer to the question, why now, is that this Federal Government has not done its job. This Congress has not done its job in complying with the aspirations of the Constitution. When you have disagreement between documents, as we did between the Louisiana Purchase on the south border of the Red River, and Oklahoma going to the middle of the Red River— and, of course, the Red River changes as time goes on—then the Federal Government should have long since stepped in and said: Here is the land we are talking about. Here is where the borders will actually go. 
I am amazed at times, we talk in terms of agencies, of bureaus, of departments, as if they are some independent country that deserves a place at the United Nations making policies and making executive decisions all their own. These people work for us. The Bureau of Land Management does have some folks that don’t understand that. They think they are an entity unto themselves, and they make policy. Well, that is not what the Constitution set up. In fact, the Constitution, in the preamble, as my friends know, says: ‘‘We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility. . . .’’ This is what this bill is trying to do. Now, last Congress, my friend, MAC THORNBERRY , had a bill that went ahead and took care of the issue, once and for all, and it was going to sell the land, and this dispute could be over. But since friends in the Senate were not able to come to a conclusion and they still just could not figure out what an appropriate disposition was, then my friend, Mr. THORNBERRY , has come back with this bill. It is consistent with what every good parent will tell the child: Before you make a decision, gather all the evidence and information you can, then make a more educated, informed decision. That is all this bill does, Mr. Speaker. It says, we are going to do a survey now. We are going to figure out what land we are talking about. And since the BLM has said we are not even going to even survey that land, we are going to leave it in dispute. We are not going to establish justice. We are going to worry about ‘‘just us’’ at the BLM. We are not going to ensure domestic tranquility. We are going to create chaos, because when we create chaos, then we benefit. We get more land, we put people in jail. Well, this is a simple bill, for heaven’s sake. It says we are going to do a survey. We are going to see what we have got. That is all the bill does. Why now? Exactly. That is a great question. This should have been done 100 years ago or more than 100 years ago. It wasn’t, so it is time to do it now and ensure domestic tranquility. So all of the parties involved—not the BLM; they are not a party—the Federal Government, the Government of Oklahoma, the Government of Texas, and all the owners involved can, once and for all, have domestic tranquility. Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I respectfully disagree. In the year 2000, when the Red River Compact was approved by Congress, and because of the nature of a compact and because of the requirements of our United States Constitution, which I know my colleagues abide by, it is a different situation. This could have been addressed if they wanted it addressed, but that is not what was done. It is not over 100 years. We have intervening facts, like the compact of 2000, which afforded Congress the opportunity to look at this and, more importantly, the States the opportunity to decide. Now, what did they do? They disagreed on the highwater mark. They did not go into these specific issues. I am sure it is not something that occurred within the last 17 years. This is something that existed all along. So I call everyone’s attention to the compact of 2000. Last year’s bill, H.R. 2130, contained in there the following statements: The Secretary disclaims any right, title, and interest to the land located south of the south bank boundary line in the affected area. It also said that surveys conducted by the Bureau of Land Management before the date of enactment of this act shall have no force or effect in determining the south bank boundary line. So to say that they didn’t do anything—or it was being done—the law that was attempted to be passed, it passed out of the House. The bill that passed out of the House contains in it specific language that they are saying they don’t want any of that to apply. So, Mr. Speaker, we come back to, I guess, why? Why? The authority to survey and approve or disapprove the sale or transfer of public lands belongs to the Federal Government acting on behalf of the American people. The Bureau of Land Management has held the authority to examine the accuracy of these surveys and make revisions, when necessary and, in this instance, an ongoing process to make changes began in 2013. It is not like nothing has happened. It has been ongoing. The BLM has the tools and authority to resolve this survey problem, and Congress should just get out of the way and allow the process to play out. Instead, my colleagues across the aisle want to use the situation as an excuse to make progress on their larger goal, alienating public land. Just last week, they voted to repeal the BLM’s efforts to update their resource management planning process. BLM’s new rule increased the opportunities for the public to engage in the management of public lands and help the agency respond more efficiently to changes taking place in the environment and across the landscape. By repealing BLM’s planning rule, Republicans are ensuring that more disputes like Red River will develop, more public land will be lost or destroyed, and more litigation will ensue, all costing taxpayers more money. So, Mr. Speaker, when we talk about H.R. 428, it is just the latest step in a very unpopular, antipublic lands campaign. Americans across the country have equal ownership and right to access and to enjoy all the resources. Whether it is a national park in Montana, a national park in Hawaii that has a volcano, forest lands in Pennsylvania, or wetlands in Colorado, the opportunities afforded through these resources belong to us all, regardless of hometown, education, means, or experience. Despite the fact that we are talking about a 160mile stretch of the Red River, by cutting away at the authority and management tools Federal agencies have at their disposal, this bill furthers my colleagues across the aisle’s national public lands agenda and threatens the multipleuse principle that governs all BLM lands, all while costing the taxpayers the money. It is like adding insult to injury. Not only do we pass a law, but we are also paying the States to do the survey. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Hawaii has 111⁄2minutes remaining. Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to conclude by acknowledging that I have read all of the various statements and the cases about the property owners along the Red River. I do understand that providing them with certainty and assurance that their property rights are not threatened is a goal that many share. However, it would be unprecedented and would only further complicate matters to transfer the Federal survey authority over public domain to the States. This is not the way our public lands should be managed. There is a transparent, objective process to determine ownership along the Red River. This bill subverts that process and sends $1 million in Federal taxpayers’ money for a State purpose. This is neither fair nor just outcome. With the long, complicated history and various ownership claims along the Red River, BLM has to be allowed to complete its planning process and land survey. It also needs the right to have a say, which this bill, H.R. 428, eliminates that right. Congress should not determine the outcome of what essentially amounts to a threeway property dispute by conceding Federal authority to a State. BLM has its tools it needs. We just need to get out of the way and let them do their work, which they have been trying to do over the years; and we do know 2013 has begun the process. I urge my colleagues to reject the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1545 Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Now, in summary of what we have heard today, this situation is a result 
of a silly and suspect survey that has slapped the citizens with uncertainty and soured them for the security because seizing citizen sites has taken place. The question was asked: Where is BLM? That is a good question. Where is BLM? They started this problem 8 years ago and have yet to do anything to try and solve the problem. That is why this bill is here before us because BLM has not done their job. Using a poor survey process, they have simply put people who have done nothing wrong in doubt of their ownership of their property which they have had for generations and have been paying taxes on for years. Yet, in 8 long years, BLM has done nothing to solve the situation to give them the certainty so they know where they stand. That is why the private citizens went to court. The only reason it is in court is because these private citizens were so frustrated with BLM taking so long to do something that could have been done within a matter of weeks, and yet it is now 8 years into a process simply because BLM used a flawed survey. Instead of using the gradient boundary survey method that the Supreme Court suggests, they did something else which brought them to the unusual conclusion that BLM actually owned 90,000 acres of land on this riverbank that they have never had in their history. Later, they realized that was an unusual claim, so they lowered it down to: I own 30,000 acres of land—but 30,000 acres of land that has been in private property for years, for generations, they have been paying taxes on it, and now their land is in limbo. They can’t do anything simply because BLM has refused to do its job. It is not just here in Texas. Go across the State boundary to Louisiana where Lake Bistineau has the exact same problem with the exact same survey problems from the same agency, BLM. Go all the way to Colorado with Elkhorn Ranch. Once again, survey problems done by BLM which placed claims on private property that are exorbitant and yet moves at a snail’s pace to try and solve the problem. One of the first issues I dealt with when I came to Congress was Hyde Park, and, once again, the Federal Government—this time it was the Forest Service—taking claim on lands that had been, for generations, in private property and refusing to try and work with the property owners to solve the problem. That is what has been going on for 8 long years with the boundary line between Texas and Oklahoma. Why are we coming here with a bill? Simply because you have got to solve the problem. You have got to fix the problem for people. I have to also say something. The misrepresentation of the BLM planning rule that was presented is a total misrepresentation. In fact, when we removed that rule, the 2.0 planning rule, we did it because people want to have their voices heard and are eliminated if that planning rule goes into effect. That is why it has to stop, so this type of situation does not happen again. Some people have said this may be an unprecedented concept. Actually, our realization that somebody has to handle the situation by actually allowing Oklahoma and Texas to pick qualified surveyors, do the survey—and do the survey—and then coordinate with the tribes so they come up with a process, that is exactly what should have happened in 2009. Because BLM didn’t do it, we are going to bring a bill to make sure they actually get something done. This has been supported by the Texas and Oklahoma Farm Bureaus, the Texas General Land Office, Texas Southwest Cattle Raisers Association, and the people who live in this area who want to have some kind of conclusion so they can have their property rights respected. Now, it has been said what we are doing is unprecedented—perhaps. What we are doing is trying to solve the problem to help people; and if it takes an unprecedented action by Congress to solve people’s problem and let them move on with their lives, then that is the responsibility of Congress. We are the ones who establish what the policies should be, not some executive branch agency of government. It is our responsibility. We are doing exactly what the people expect us to do by saying 8 years of unexpected and unanswered questions is far too long. Solve the problem and help people so they know what is their private property and what is not their private property and they can move on with their lives. If that is unprecedented, then it is about time we did something that is unprecedented. That is important. That is why this bill is here, and that is why this bill is here now. It is coming at the beginning of the session because we cannot wait longer for the BLM to actually do what they should have done in 2009. Now, Mr. Speaker, I want you to realize we are here on Valentine’s Day. There is nothing special about that, but this is an issue where there has been no love lost. In fact, the landowners along this river have been simply soaked. But deep in the heart of Texas—all right, I know it is a boundary line, but I have got to get the heart in there some way. Deep in the heart of Texas, we are coming forth with a bill that is showing that the love for people who have paid their taxes and lived on this land for generations is not forgotten and that BLM has committed a crime of the heart with this land grab. Indeed, Chairman THORNBERRY has passionately defended the interests of his constituents who just want to know the government loves them. That is why this bill is here. That is why it needs to be supported, and that is why I urge you to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.

PROVIDING FOR A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS TO RECEIVE A MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a privileged concurrent resolution and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the concurrent resolution, as follows: 
H. C ON. RES. 23 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That the two Houses of Congress assemble in the Hall of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, February 28, 2017, at 9 p.m., for the purpose of receiving such communication as the President of the United States shall be pleased to make to them. 
The concurrent resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. 
AMERICAN HEART MONTH (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today, there will be a lot of focus on hearts, and I would like to talk about heart health. February marks American Heart Month, which is an annual awareness 
campaign for the number one killer in the United States—heart disease. The first American Heart Month was declared in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. While the death rate from heart disease has dropped considerably since the 1960s, we still have much work to do. More than 17 million deaths a year are attributed to heart disease and stroke. But studies show that 80 percent of cardiac events and strokes are preventable. What is truly important for Americans to know is that heart disease is within their control if they have a family history where a loved one has suffered, or even died, from heart disease. The good news is that the risk of heart disease can be lowered through a healthy lifestyle and regular checkups. It is my hope that all Americans will take their heart health seriously and educate themselves on how to lead a healthy life in the spirit of American Heart Month. 
PROVIDENCE COLLEGE CENTENNIAL (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, on February 14, 1917, the Diocese of Providence, the Dominican Friars of the Providence of St. Joseph, and the State of Rhode Island established Providence College. Like our great Nation, Providence College was founded on principles of tolerance and acceptance. Its charter states that no student shall be denied admission or honors due to religious opinion. One hundred years later, Americans would do well to follow this example. Led by Reverend Brian Shanley, the president of this outstanding academic institution, Providence College continues to enrich the lives of its students and the State of Rhode Island. It is a leader in research and academic excellence, and its scholars encourage young people to question the world around them and serve their communities. The Ocean State is fortunate to be home to such a venerable institution. As a lifelong Rhode Islander, I am so proud to celebrate its centennial and recognize its continued success today. Happy 100th anniversary, Providence College. 
b1645 NORTH KOREA IS A TERRORISM STATE (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, when I met with Admiral Harris of Pacific Command last year, I asked him which nation’s threats concerned him the most. He quickly replied: North Korea. Proving Admiral Harris correct, North Korea illegally launched yet another menacing ballistic missile. This was a hightech, prefueled rocket that can be launched quickly. This type of rocket has a range of about 1,800 miles—thus, making it an immediate threat to South Korea and Japan as well as our troops that are stationed there. North Korea has even bigger plans. Kim Jongun reportedly plans to develop submarines from which to launch the missiles, which could threaten the United States. The last administration pursued an ignorant strategy called strategic patience. That policy clearly failed. North Korea’s program is now stronger than ever. Kim Jongun’s threats continue to grow bolder and bolder with no repercussions. Once upon a time, the United States had North Korea on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. It is time to put little Kim back on that list because he is a world terrorist and a threat to world peace, and he has earned that distinction. And that is just the way it is. f 
ACCESS TO COUNSEL ACT (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I introduced my first bill, H.R. 1006, the Access to Counsel Act; and it was a great pleasure to work with my colleague in the Senate, Senator KAMALA HARRIS , who introduced that companion version. The legislation is a direct response to the President’s misguided Muslim ban. In the chaos following the release of the executive order, people across the country were detained at airports and denied opportunities to consult with hundreds of attorneys who were there ready to provide legal support. Some of these people were deported without any access to due process. Even now, we are getting reports of people who are literally relinquishing their legal permanent resident status without consulting with anybody because they don’t understand what they are signing. Detention and deportation without due process happens far too often, even though due process is a right that we hold so dear as Americans. For years, we have heard these cases of people being denied the right to counsel, and my bill, the Access to Counsel Act, ensures that anyone who is detained by CBP or held in ICE custody will get access to counsel. This is a commonsense measure, and I know that there are many who are fearful of what will come next. I want them to know that we will continue to fight for their rights and for their access to due process. CELEBRATING THE ELIZABETH TAYLOR AIDS FOUNDATION (Ms. ROSLEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROSLEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate The Elizabeth TAYLOR AIDS Foundation for its efforts and commitment to transform the lives for those living with HIV/ AIDS. Since its creation in 1991, this foundation has advanced Elizabeth Taylor’s dream to create a future free of HIV/ AIDS by supporting organizations delivering care and services for people living with this disease. Today, the Foundation remains a leading player in the fight to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic by providing grants to global programs that seek to fund education, to raise awareness, and to create innovative treatments for patients. As the cochair of the Congressional HIV/AIDS Caucus, I have had the opportunity to work with this foundation over the years to help improve the lives of patients and advance research efforts that can lead to a cure for this terrible disease. I celebrate The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, and I look forward to continuing to work with it to realize our common dream of an AIDSfree generation in the U.S. and, indeed, throughout the world. 
CONGRATULATIONS UCONN WOMEN’S BASKETBALL TEAM (Mr. COURTNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, at 11 p.m. last night, the UConn women’s basketball team once again stunned the sporting world and, really, the Nation by winning their 100th straight win against a very good team, the University of South Carolina. Again, Mr. Speaker, the UConn women just continue to defy the laws of gravity. They have won 11 NCAA titles, again, shattering all records before them, and the 100th win was exceeding the last record which the UConn women set a number of years ago in terms of consecutive wins. Coach Geno Auriemma has an extraordinary program, which has almost a perfect record of graduation. These are true student athletes. Last night, Gabby Williams, Napheesa Collier, Kia Nurse, and Crystal Dangerfield once again made us proud in the State of Connecticut to be the home of real champions. Again, congratulations. You are in unchartered waters now at 100 wins and counting, and we look forward to more success in the future. Go Huskies. 
UPDATE ON OROVILLE DAM (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, well, it has been national news, the situation going on in northern California, where the Oroville Dam is. Obviously, there has been some damage and destruction to the main concrete spillway, as well as the situation with the lake rising and finally going for the first time in 48 years over the emergency spillway. The dam itself, the earthen structure, 770 feet tall is solid. The emergency spillway is being evaluated, but so far it looks stable itself. It is the issue of the soil in front of it that needs to be stabilized during these days where there is dry weather, where it can be stabilized with rock and concrete. So what we need to know is: Why did this happen? This would be what we do later on. First, we need to take care of the emergency situation, the State resources and Federal resources pulling together to make sure people are safe and that the dam remains sound and that we don’t lose the structure. It looks good. I think things are stable for right now. We also need prayer for no more rain for a while, or at least not overwhelming amounts of rain. So it looks good. We just need patience also from the people that are in the flood plain that have been evacuated to listen to their emergency personnel and follow with that so that they are kept safe during this time of the emergency. So I think good efforts are underway, and we will investigate later on what went wrong. 
COMMITMENT TO CIVILITY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GALLAGHER). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the RECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, today a bipartisan group of 46 freshman Members of this 115th U.S. Congress, representing red and blue States from coast to coast, released a document that we have entitled the ‘‘Commitment to Civility.’’ This evening, I am grateful to be joined on the floor by 21 different leaders of our class, representing diverse districts in 15 different States across our great Nation to speak to this important and very timely issue. This commitment document was created in early January following our initial meetings together as a class. We discussed our mutual intent to serve the best interest of the country, and to return to statesmanship that was revered and modeled by the great leaders of our history. I drafted this document to memorialize our Members’ agreement to, among other things, work towards restoring collegiality and civility in the Congress; encouraging more productive dialogue; and building consensus and strengthening the public’s trust in America’s institutions. This document is not intended in any way as a criticism of anyone else in any other Chamber or branch of the government. Rather, it represents the mutual commitments of the Members of our class that we have made among and between ourselves. As we teach our own children, we often have no control over what others may do, but we are ultimately responsible for our own actions. Personally, I want to say how encouraging it is to work with others from across the political spectrum who want to lead by example and work to restore civility in our public discourse. There may never have been a more important time for that very important effort. I am one who is regarded as probably being among the most conservative Members of the Congress, and I will never deviate from my core principles. However, I am mindful to always remember that while some of my colleagues and I may have very different ideas and core political philosophies, at the end of the day, we are all Americans and we are all made in the image of God; thus, we believe we should act accordingly. Before my esteemed colleagues come to share their thoughts on this important subject, I would like to introduce and read into the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD , the document we refer to as the ‘‘Commitment to Civility.’’ It reads as follows: ‘‘As new Members of the United States House of Representatives and as individual citizens we recognize the gravity of the responsibility we have been given and the significance of this moment in the history of our extraordinary country. ‘‘America remains the most free, most powerful and most prosperous nation in all the world, and yet we face significant challenges. Among these challenges has been an increasing division in and coarsening of our culture fueled too often by the vitriol in our politics and public discourse. One result has been a loss of trust in our institutions and elected officials. ‘‘We believe there is a better alternative. ‘‘Although we represent both political parties and a wide range of individual views across the political spectrum, our common and sincere aims are to serve the needs and interests of the American people, to work with one another and the leaders of our respective parties to encourage greater confidence in our institutions, and to set an example of statesmanship for the younger generation of Americans that will follow. ‘‘To this end, we are dedicated to showing proper respect to one another and all others, encouraging productive dialogue, and modeling civility in our public and private actions. While we may vehemently disagree on matters of law and policy, we will strive at all times to maintain collegiality and the honor of our office. ‘‘We believe that a leader can be cooperative and conciliatory without compromising his or her core principles, and we will remember that our political rivals in Congress are not our enemies—but rather our colleagues and fellow Americans. We also believe that maintaining a spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation will help make government work more efficiently and effectively, help build consensus and restore the public trust, and, ultimately, serve as a positive influence on society at large. ‘‘For all of these reasons, we hereby pledge our names to this Commitment to Civility on this 10th day of January, 2017, in Washington, D.C.’’ The document is signed by 46 incoming Members of the 115th Congress. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I am delighted to yield to 21 different leaders of our class, representing both political parties and 15 different States across our great land. Each will express their own thoughts on this important subject. I begin by yielding to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. BARRAGA ´N). Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman MIKE JOHNSON from Louisiana, for helping coordinate this effort. When I got here to Washington for orientation, I will never forget very early on, one of my colleagues, Congressman JODEY ARRINGTON from Texas, came up to me and said: I want to introduce myself. And he did. He was the first Republican that came up to me and said: I want to get to know you on a personal level. I want to be your friend because we are going to be working together. I have to tell you how impressed I was that somebody was reaching out across the aisle because they wanted to develop a personal relationship, knowing that we would be able to work together. Later on, I got to meet the rest of my colleagues at Harvard, where they have a bipartisan program that is a wonderful program and gives you an opportunity to help build these relationships, which I think is so important, especially today in our time. We just got off one of the ugliest elections in history where it really felt as if civility disappeared. Today it 
sometimes still feels that way, which is why I think this is such an important effort. As Members of Congress, we need to set an example of statesmanship for younger generations of Americans to follow. We must remember that every person should be respected. Somebody yesterday said something that really struck a chord. It is not that we need to agree on everything or that we need to agree all the time, but we need to learn to disagree better. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ). b1700 Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the freshman class’s commitment to civility. Before the Revolutionary War, a 16 yearold George Washington copied 110 rules for civil behavior out of his school book. The last of Washington’s rules of civility, as they are now called, is this: ‘‘Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.’’ Conscience: That should be our guide in everything we do, both here in Congress and back home—for me, in Michigan’s First District. Conscience is why, as a Member of the freshman class of the 115th Congress, I have made a commitment to open and civil debate. We are facing many challenges in our country. And the folks here and back in Michigan, all across the land, on both sides of the aisle, have many different ideas about where we need to be and what we need to do to get there. That is democracy at work. Being civil means that the best and most effective ideas have a real chance to be heard. If we truly desire to move forward as a country, we have to do it together. We must treat each other with dignity and respect. We must be civil. This freshman class has dedicated itself across party lines to setting the example for ourselves and for our colleagues here in Congress and for all of our constituents. Mr. Speaker, I will uphold these standards, and I trust that my colleagues will also do the same. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the general for his service to our country. I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SUOZZI ). Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the freshman class’s effort to encourage civility in this Chamber and in our political discourse generally. Americans are divided. Hate speech and hate crimes are spiking. Fake news is increasing. Terrorism threatens the world, and 60 million refugees are displaced across the globe. The public is convinced that elected officials don’t seem to get much done regarding the shrinking middle class, immigration reform, climate change, gun violence, and a whole bunch more. What should we do? Love thy neighbor: That may seem like a simplistic public policy prescription, but love thy neighbor is a concept that can be found across many traditions. If we are going to get Republicans and Democrats to actually come together as people of goodwill in search of the common good, it is going to require us to rely on some shared principles. Faith and religious beliefs are the most effective, existing sources of commonality that may be relied upon. If people of different political philosophies actually believed that their opponents were similarly motivated by a common set of values to love thy neighbor, I believe we would get a lot more talking and problemsolving and, yes, less yelling and screaming. Even nonreligious Americans have a fundamental belief in the religion based concept of love thy neighbor. Discussing issues civilly and rooted in shared faith and values will result in more good work being accomplished. The good news is that, during the first 6 weeks, I found that many of my colleagues seemed genuinely inspired by their faith and their values. Maybe if we all agree to be civil and recognize that many of us here are motivated by the same command to love thy neighbor, we might be a little more effective. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER ). Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I come from a place called Wisconsin. Besides having the world’s best cheese and football franchise, we are known for being good neighbors. You may have heard of the phrase ‘‘Wisconsin nice.’’ Well, that is a real thing, as any Bears or Lions or Vikings fans who have come to Lambeau Field and been greeted, not with jeers, but with a, welcome, it is good to have you have found out. The disparity between how we do business in Wisconsin and how business gets done or doesn’t in Washington, D.C., couldn’t be wider. Well, I am of the humble opinion that the world needs more of what we do in Wisconsin and less of how Washington, D.C., traditionally operates. At a time when politics seems more deeply divided than ever, further debased by an endless media cycle that rewards vitriol and scandal, at a time when faith in our basic institutions is diminishing, I think the overwhelming majority of the American people are looking for something better. They sent us here to fight for our ideas, not to demonize the other side in a cynical attempt to get on TV or fundraise. The American people voted against the politics of the past, which only seeks to divide us and stir up controversy. We can do better. We must do better. That is why I salute all of my colleagues for joining in this effort. I believe we, the freshmen Members of the 115th Congress, can be different. I believe that, through working together, we can break through the politics of the past and offer something better for the American people. I believe we can prove there is still room for civil, serious discourse in our political system. Now, a commitment to civility doesn’t mean we are going to agree on everything. I suspect there will be legitimate battles ahead, but let it be a battle of ideas not political theater. I intend to come armed to that fight with all the weapons I have at my disposal, foremost among them, my fervent belief in my conservative ideas. And I don’t expect to convert my Democratic friends, but I expect them to come armed with their ideas, and I intend to listen. In that process of serious debate, maybe—just maybe—we will learn something from one another and find ways to fix our Nation’s problems together. Imagine if we were able to do that. Well, I am looking forward to trying. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL ). Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I too am honored to be part of the 115th Congress, the freshman class, a group of people who want to work together. I think back to my campaign the last two years, and one of the most common concerns I had from people were: Why can’t people in Congress get along? Why can’t you respect each other? What I saw day after day was the left and the right yelling at each other and the press throwing gasoline on top of that fire. I remember, growing up, my dad had a saying: If you don’t have something good to say about somebody, then don’t say it. That is always something that I have taken to heart. I think back to my sixth grade teacher, Mrs. Tyner. Her word for the entire year was ‘‘respect.’’ She taught us to respect ourselves and respect each other, and that is what I would like to bring to the 115th Congress, is respect for each other, for each other’s points of views, and never question someone’s intentions or motivations. I believe in iron sharpening iron and coming up with better ideas together. I believe in defining problems together, to talk about the problem, and then discuss solutions together. The hope is that you and I, my friends across the aisle and down the aisle, together we can come up with better solutions for this country. I believe that national defense is not a Republican or a Democrat issue. I believe the economy is not a conservative or a liberal issue. I think these are American issues that we need to fight to make better. I certainly don’t think that health care is a Republican or Democrat issue. My pledge is to work with civility, to work with respect toward my colleagues across the aisle and down the aisle. I look forward to making America a better place to live. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. CARBAJAL ). Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recommit myself to work first and foremost for the interest of the American public, regardless of political ideology. I am under no illusion about the overwhelming partisanship that permeates this Congress. But I believe that, as vigorously as we debate our policy differences, we should also commit to upholding the principles of civility and respect to encourage productive discourse. To this end, we must work together, when at all possible, to advance the policy that serves our constituents and our country. In this effort, I reflect on my service in the United States Marine Corps. We did not first stop to question whether our fellow marine was a Democrat or a Republican. We counted on each other to protect and defend our country. That is the approach to service we should aspire to in this distinguished legislative body. On the issues of national security and to provide for the needs of the American people, there is no doubt in my mind that there is more that unites us than divides us. I look forward to working with my colleagues here today to do just that. In the infamous words of President Kennedy: ‘‘Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer.’’ Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ). Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my fellow freshmen of the 115th Congress and commit to civility. The 435 of us represent 320 million Americans. With a population that large and that diverse, we are going to have our differences. We are going to disagree which direction the Nation needs to go. With a free and open democracy, we all have that right. Vigorous discussion makes us stronger. However, despite our differences, we are all still Americans, we want what is best for our country, and we must keep our debates respectful. We are all Americans first before we are Republicans, Democrats, Independents; and we can’t forget this. As Americans, we do have major issues facing us; and the world is looking to us to be leaders and find solutions. We must remain civil to each other to achieve this goal. Let’s not forget that ISIS will never ask if we are Republicans or Democrats. The unemployment line doesn’t ask if we are Republicans or Democrats either. The Federal deficit doesn’t care if we are Republicans or Democrats. These are shared issues, and we are all in this together. Politics is a contact sport, or so I am told. It has been that way since George Washington was President and Thomas Jefferson funded an opposition paper against him, all the while serving in his Cabinet. Still, today, character assassinations are a common occurrence in our political landscape, and it is wrong. Americans are at our finest when we work toward our common goals respectfully. I spent nearly 30 years in the Air Force, and, during that time, I was fortunate to hold five commands. It didn’t matter to me or our mission if a subordinate or a teammate was a Republican or Democrat. We fought in Iraq, stood up missile defenses in Israel, and conducted missions worldwide as Americans, not as Republicans or Democrats. In the Air Force, we were all Americans, we are all airmen, and we all had one common goal. We need more of that on Capitol Hill. We are all Americans, we are all Members of Congress, and we all care about the future of our country. One day, like all of us, I will meet our Creator. And when I do, I believe He will not care about what political party I associated myself with, but He will care how I treated my brothers and sisters. Let us agree to be a bright light on how to treat each other while we debate the issues we care about. Let us, in the 115th Congress, all agree to work together, be civil to each other, be respectful with each other, and remember we are Americans before we are Republicans or Democrats. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. PANETTA ). Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON ) for this opportunity. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to discuss our commitment to civility, a promise that I have made to my constituents at home and a promise that I have made to my colleagues here in Washington, D.C. Prior to my being sworn in, during my campaign of 2016, the number one question I heard and I received from the people in my district on the Central Coast of California was: Why would you want to go to Washington, D.C., right now? I heard that over and over and over. I heard that people were dissatisfied with the dysfunction in Congress. I heard that they were disgusted with the partisanship of Congress. I heard that they were disheartened with our system of government. And I believe that it is that sentiment that lent to the denouement of November 8. I admit I was disappointed by the Presidential election, and I believe that partisanship that was displayed during that election continued in Washington, D.C. It started when I got here for new Member orientation. When we got here as freshmen, Republicans and Democrats, we were automatically split up. I did not get to know my fellow freshmen Republican colleagues here in D.C. It wasn’t until we went on to Boston and Virginia that we actually took time to get to know each other, where they are from, and what they were about. What I can tell you—the thing that I say that gives hope to so many people—is that my freshman class heard the exact same things during this past election: That it is time that we get things done and that we do it together. Now, I believe that once we get past these turbulent times at this point, I do hope we can work together on issues that affect our country, be it immigration reform, investment in our infrastructure, and ensuring that our health care is not just accessible but affordable. b1715 But I also realize, as many of you, that that is easier said than done. Yet I believe that to get things done in Congress, you have to treat it like a marathon and not a sprint, and I believe that we begin this race by building relationships. My predecessor, Congressman Sam Farr, spent 23 years representing the place I call home on the central coast of California. He will tell you that for most of that time he was in the minority, yet he was able to get numerous things done; and he will tell you that the way he was able to do it is by relationships, with Democrats and Republicans. I can tell you that Sam’s predecessor would say the exact same thing; and I can tell you that Sam’s predecessor and his three roommates, whom I was able to live with back in the eighties, would all say the same thing, that it is the personal chemistry amongst people here in Washington, D.C., that will lead to our ability to compromise professionally. That is what we must develop. That is why I am honored and pleased to enter into this commitment of civility, for that is the first ingredient to that chemistry that we must strive for. And I believe that this commitment that we have all taken to each other, to our communities, and to our country, that will lead to our constituents’ confidence, not just in Congress, but in our democracy. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. LEWIS). Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join in this commitment to civility. First off, I want to thank all of my freshmen colleagues on both sides of the aisle for participating today and going through the orientation and getting to know one another. It was a wonderful experience. I had the pleasure of talking with many of them over the last few weeks, and they share many of the same goals as I do, as this entire body does. I agree with many of my colleagues on many issues. I can safely say I also disagree with some of them on a few issues. But while we may disagree, we do not assume that they are acting in bad faith. Rather than dismiss those who disagree with us, we must use that disagreement to challenge ourselves to be better. 
You see, this process isn’t easy, and addressing the issues our Nation is facing isn’t easy either. In fact, I would argue, our ability to get things done, why we were sent here, rests on the ability to participate in productive political dialogue and discourse. So substituting sincere communication, honest debate with grandstanding or a political ambush or shouting louder than somebody else is too clever by half, and it will not get the things done that we need to get done. Shouting louder than your neighbor doesn’t accomplish anything other than silencing your neighbor. In fact, that is not progress; that is an affront to free speech and the ability to listen to all of those around us. It doesn’t help, when we shout over each other, help you understand your neighbor’s beliefs, and it doesn’t help your neighbor understand your beliefs. Now, I am reminded of this quote that gets used all too often these days: While I disapprove or might disapprove of what you say, I will defend to the death your right to say it. So we may disagree with each other, we may even disapprove of what somebody else says, but it is important to know, it is always important to let each other say it. Freedom of speech is not limited to the loudest among us; it is a right afforded to all of us. Of course, this commitment to civility doesn’t mean we don’t believe in the essence of free speech or the right and necessity to disagree with one another. We will. It simply means that we will do it in way that respects the rights of everyone. We believe, and so should those who oppose our policies, that the right to speak also entails the right to be heard. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ). Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address our commitment to civility. Let me quote: ‘‘Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment. It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos.’’ President George W. Bush spoke these words at his first inaugural address in 2001. It was a time for new beginnings then, and it is a time for new beginnings now. I cannot think of a more wellintentioned way to begin the 115th Congress than to join my awesome freshman class, from both sides, in committing to work together civilly to unify and further strengthen our great Nation. Through this commitment, we promise to put people before politics, to thoughtfully advocate for the needs of our communities, and to renew confidence and trust in our political system. Although we may disagree on a number of issues, this commitment we make to each other today ensures that we will work together to always promote a positive and constructive discourse in our critically important work as representatives of the American people. This job is not about any one of us individually, but about the hundreds of thousands of people we represent throughout our districts. As a Representative of the people’s House, we are expected to provide positive leadership, a strong voice, and to set the example for the American people. The ability to agree to disagree and to voice our differences is a critical part of the unique freedoms we cherish as Americans, but we must always do so respectfully. Malicious discourse is a disservice to those who risked their lives to fight for our freedoms and everything that our great Nation stands for. It is truly unfortunate that the tone of political discourse throughout our Nation has become so contentious and hostile. It is detrimental to fostering an open and productive dialogue and the unity of our Nation. The commitment our class makes today solidifies this promise to work together peacefully to provide leadership and inspiration to the American people, while further promoting the freedoms and individual rights that make our Nation the greatest in the world. We must look at 2017 positively, as a time for new beginnings. In the wake of new leadership, we are provided with a new opportunity for a fresh start and the chance to advance our shared mission of putting the American people first. It is my hope that the efforts of our great freshman class today, which, I argue, could be one of the greatest of this august body’s history, will inspire people throughout the Nation to turn toward civility and to always treat each other with respect, despite our differences. I thank my freshman colleagues who have all accepted—almost all have accepted—this particular commitment, and I especially would like to thank the gentleman from Louisiana for leading us on this very important issue. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER ). Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to add my voice to the chorus of new Members of the 115th Congress. It is fitting that we make this commitment on Valentine’s Day. It is a holiday to show appreciation and also love, and I think that is what this is really about. It is about our love for our country and our love for our friends and families and neighbors. It is also about civility, and to me, civility is not about the what. We can all disagree on the what. Civility is about the how. It is about our tone. It is about our tenor. It is about the words that we choose to use, and it is about respect. As freshmen, our class is special. I feel we are special. Just like Claudia said, we are actually awesome. And it was really telling that, at one of our retreats, orientations, we came together and we asked if we could just be alone, no staff, no one else in the room—just us. We actually said: Let’s try to find common ground. Who here has a port? Who here has served in public life? Again, our goal wasn’t to find ways to divide, but to find ways to come together. If we expect civility from others, including our children, then we need to model it. Our signatures on this document show our commitment to civility, to caring, and, most of all, to getting things done. That is what America wants, and that is what America deserves. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER ). Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent the people of Pennsylvania’s 16th Congressional District and to serve the community in which I grew up. I was very pleased a few months ago to come to Washington and join the new Member orientation. It was a great opportunity for all of us to meet our new colleagues on both sides of the aisle; and I must say, as has already been mentioned, I was impressed. As we got to know one another and talk about our vision for this upcoming Congress, we all agreed we wanted to work together as much as possible. We decided we wanted to work to find common ground. Today, across Pennsylvania and across America, finding common ground between Republicans and Democrats looks and sounds nearly impossible. We here in Congress may disagree on the issues, we may disagree on the solutions, but that is good. That is good because the purpose of this Chamber is to be a deliberative body. It is good because, collectively, we represent a wide range of issues across the political spectrum—we are supposed to—and, in fact, we are even expected to disagree, but we must always do so in a civil and respectful manner. We must understand that, while we may disagree on the issues and solutions, we share, all of us, the common goal of serving our constituents and of improving their lives. We must understand that just because we may disagree with one another, that doesn’t mean the other side is unAmerican or out to get us. Arthur Brooks, President of the American Enterprise Institute, calls this ‘‘political motive asymmetry.’’ Brooks says: ‘‘A majority of people in our country today who are politically active believe that they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate.’’ Now, I know I might disagree with some of my colleagues, but I can tell you, they are not motivated by hate. If we are to be successful in this Chamber and in discussions in our communities across the country, we must rid our discourse of this political motive asymmetry. Then we will be able, together, to find solutions more easily to the problems that we face. I am hopeful that our freshman class, along with the rest of our colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle, will be able to do what is stated in our commitment to civility: ‘‘make the government work more efficiently and more effectively, help build consensus and restore public trust, and, ultimately, serve as a positive influence on society at large.’’ We here in Congress are charged with an enormous task. In today’s divisive and heated public discourse, we must be an example to our constituents by showing respect for one another at all times. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. KHANNA ). Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the freshman initiative on civility. I thank Congressman JOHNSON  for his leadership. I want to echo the remarks of Congressman SUOZZI and Congresswoman BLUNT ROCHESTER about getting things done. We have disagreements on many issues. I don’t think I voted with the Republicans on almost any issue since I have been in this body. On economic issues, I come from a perspective of economic populism and a very different perspective than Members on the other side. But we also have areas of common agreement. Congressman GALLAGHER  and Congressman ARRINGTON have talked about term limits, and that is an area of potential agreement. Congressman ROONEY has talked about getting PAC money out of politics. Congressman WILLHURDhas talked about cybersecurity and tech jobs. So my view is that, in areas where we disagree, we should disagree with spirit and conviction, but that doesn’t mean that there won’t be areas where we can agree. And on a personal note, Congressman FITZPATRICK represents the district where I was born and where my parents are, so I have to be civil, certainly, to him and the other side. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. CRIST). Mr. CRIST. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this important document as well. Friends, we may have vastly different views on how best to create a more perfect Union, along with different styles and different temperaments, but we all share a commitment and, frankly, a responsibility to bring the voice of the people to Washington, D.C. I am honored to represent much of Pinellas County and my hometown of St. Petersburg, Florida, and I promise to fight for the needs of my home. But I pledge to do so in keeping with what is known as the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have done unto you. This is a rule that I strive to live by every single day. Poll after poll shows that Floridians and, frankly, all Americans are fed up with the divisiveness and rancor of Washington. As we move forward debating the issues of the day, let us be mindful of the words of President Abraham Lincoln: ‘‘Though passions may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.’’ b1730 I am proud that our freshman class— yes, this awesome freshman class—has put forward its commitment to civility. It states that, despite our political differences, at the end of the day we must work together to move our country forward, putting people over politics and treating one another with mutual respect and much more grace even when we may disagree. I thank, again, the gentleman from Louisiana and the gentlewoman from California for their leadership and for their friendship, putting people over politics. God bless you all, and God bless America. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ). Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all the members of the freshman class—members of both political parties and of every political background—who have joined us tonight in signing the commitment to civility pledge: love thy neighbor, no exceptions. Seeing 46 Republicans and Democrats make this public commitment is encouraging for this Chamber and for the constituents that we serve. We can all agree that our Nation is facing some serious challenges. From increasing opportunity in an evolving economy to keeping our families safe from threats at home and abroad, the list in front of this body is heavy enough, and the last thing we need is to make that problemsolving even tougher. A statement made on the Senate floor last week offered a stark message: it is simply not possible to exist as a nation when half of its citizens hate the other half. If we are willing to end friendships or block our family members because of Facebook posts, we are not heading in the right direction. Despite the incredible responsibility entrusted to each of us by those whom we represent, this Congress has not been immune to the hardening of political division. However, we must not accept our current discourse as the new normal. Yet there is hope. There is hope because the Members standing with me tonight and those who have joined our pledge are willing to say, first and foremost, we are Americans, and the person I may disagree with—even vehemently—is still an American. Just because someone has different viewpoints or policy priorities or a different letter next to their name does not make them our enemy. This Congress can and must play a part in restoring the civility and respect that makes productive dialogue possible. I am not saying we’ll agree on everything, but a spirit of mutual understanding, mutual respect, and mutual cooperation is the bedrock for making our government and our communities work. Whether we are elected officials, moms, dads, neighbors, community leaders, students—or anyone—we must remember that there is more that unites us than divides us. That is a commitment I am willing to make my colleagues and constituents this evening. Again, I want to thank my colleagues, the gentleman from Louisiana and the gentlewoman from California, for all their work. I look forward to working with our awesome freshman class going forward. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank all these colleagues. We were anticipating remarks from Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas, Mr. C OMER of Kentucky, Mr. RASKIN of Maryland, and Mr. LAWSON of Florida, but their schedules have suddenly taken them away this evening. Mr. Speaker, I will close. As you can see, our commitment to civility is sincere and important to each of us and, we believe, to the Congress and to our country. As we said at the outset here, there may never have been a more important time for a commitment like this. Perhaps it is appropriate that our hour happened to be assigned here on this Valentine’s Day. I am reminded, as I close, of the biblical admonition given to us in Philippians, Chapter 2, Verses 3 through 4. It reads as follows: ‘‘Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility, value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.’’ Mr. Speaker, if we can do these things, we will do well by our exceptional Nation. I thank all of my esteemed colleagues for participating tonight and all those who signed this commitment. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
RESIGNATION OF MICHAEL FLYNN AND RUSSIAN INFLUENCE (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, the resignation of President Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is the third Trump senior adviser to resign amid allegation of ties to Russia and the Kremlin. Two others were attached to the Trump campaign: his manager, Paul Manafort, and Russian energy adviser, Carter Page. Meanwhile, Russia’s Putin is the same KGB thug he always has been, continuing to invade countries in eastern and central Europe and propagating a war in Syria as well as a bloody war against Ukraine. The American people deserve to know the full extent of Russia’s financial, personal, and political grip on the Trump administration, and Congress 
should meet its constitutional responsibilities to protect our national security and to protect our Nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic. The American people need to know whether Russian creditors or their intermediaries are helping prop up the Trump commercial empire. This Congress needs to do its job, conduct hearings, subpoena witnesses, and bring truth to the American people about the Trump administration’s ties to Russia. 
HONORING DR. THOMAS FREEMAN OF TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is a commemoration of African American History Month. It is a vital month. It is a month that tells America’s history. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute a distinguished American, Dr. Thomas Freeman, who has been a faculty member at Texas Southern University now for more than half a century. Dr. Freeman is the leading orator of the university, the leading storyteller. He is the instructor of the Honorable Barbara Jordan, my predecessor. He taught her the skills to be able to sit before the Judiciary Committee during the impeachment of Richard Milhous Nixon and say, ‘‘We, the people.’’ He is the individual that has taught and tutored decades of students—tens upon tens—from a school that is a historically Black school and called and taught his students to be successful in debates around the world. He is a history maker. He is now close to 100 years old. He is deserving of honor and tradition. I close, Mr. Speaker, by saying, in our community, he is the tiller and the holder of the values of the Constitution. I know that he deserves honor on this floor. Dr. Freeman, I salute you. You deserve the honor and recognition as a great American. 
CALIFORNIA WATER INFRASTRUCTURE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GALLAGHER ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I see a couple of my colleagues have arrived and would like to speak, so I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ). 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) for the exemplary act of civility in allowing me and another latearriving colleague to be part of the freshman class presentation about our collective commitment to promoting and practicing civility both within our class and within the Congress of the United States as long as we are here. It is a great honor to be part of the freshman class of the 115th Congress. I am thrilled to make this commitment to civility—and even friendship—across the aisle with whatever Republican colleagues are willing to hang out with a liberal constitutional law professor. Despite my great passions as a liberal and a progressive, I dedicate myself to civility for three reasons, and I think they are all consistent with my political values and beliefs: First, I am a middle child, and so it is in my nature to try to bring people together. If you study the theory of birth order advanced by Frank Sulloway in his great book ‘‘Born to Rebel,’’ you will find an exemplary middle child in Reverend Martin Luther King who believed in the power of love for reconciling different views in society, and you will find a theory of the effectiveness of nonviolent struggle for progress and change, a theory that doesn’t try to wish away or blink away real conflict that people have but embraces conflict as the possibility for uplifting everyone in the process. Second, I am from the great State of Maryland, one of the original middle States tucked between New England and the South. In Maryland, we have a habit of working across party lines for the common good. Many of the big bills that I introduced in the Maryland Senate I introduced with Republican friends, like my friend Senator David Brinkley. We did the medical marijuana program together. He is a fellow cancer survivor and felt very strongly about that. I did a number of criminal justice reform measures, including abolishing mandatory minimum drug sentences, with a Republican colleague named Michael Hough in Frederick County, who lives within my congressional district. I even introduced a bill which succeeded for fiscal transparency in government, putting up all government expenditures over $10,000 online within 48 hours, with Congressman ALEXMOONEY  from West Virginia, although then he was a State senator in Maryland who served with me in Annapolis. Third, as a law professor, I believe that all of our ideas, passions, and feelings about politics are refined, perfected, and improved through the process of political dialogue, testing, and questioning. So I know that our Republican colleagues make us stronger on the Democratic side of the aisle, and I hope that we make them stronger, too, that we all grow together and that we are able to improve each other’s ideas, change each other’s minds sometimes, and work on issues of common concern like infrastructure, which I think is a pressing problem that we can gather consensus around in this body, like the environment and the perils of climate change. Our greatest Presidents have always called us to civility. George Washington invited Americans to place our patriotic love of liberty first above partisan and sectional feeling. Thomas Jefferson said that we are all Republicans, we are all federalists at a time of great division in the country. In his first inaugural address, President Lincoln said: ‘‘We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.’’ So the bonds of affection might seem like a romantic dream given the divisions and polarization in the country today, but I do think that, if at least we start with civility and respect, maybe we will be able to attain the level of recovering the bonds of affection that should unify all of us as Americans. The word ‘‘party’’ comes from the French word ‘‘partie,’’ a part, and we have got to remember—each of us, all of us—that our party is just one small part of the whole, and we are all here to try to advance the common good. With that, again, I want to thank the Congressman for his very gracious offer of the time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Those are wonderful comments, and I am sure they are going to last through the entire 115th Congress because our colleague from Kentucky would like to echo many of those. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of Kentucky (Mr. COMER ). Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. Mr. Speaker, I am so glad to join with 55 other of my freshman colleagues to pledge the commitment to civility. We all took different paths to get here. We are all from different parts of the United States. We all have different backgrounds and different stories. But one thing we all did to get here in this freshman class is we campaigned hard, and we listened to our constituents. Whether our constituents were conservative or liberal, whether they lived in the city or in small towns, they all shared a frustration about Congress. b1745 They shared the frustration that Congress was at gridlock and both parties fought. Many times, people filed bills, knowing they would fail, just so they could get before a TV camera and grandstand and blame the other party. When I got to Congress, I didn’t know what to expect. The first thing that we did was attend a retreat. We got to know each other. I left that retreat inspired because, Mr. Speaker, I believe that this freshman class is committed to trying to work together to accomplish things that we agree on. There are issues that we will never agree on, but there are issues we do agree on. We do agree that we need to create an environment where every American has access to a goodpaying 
job. We do agree that we need to have a military that protects its citizens. There are so many issues that we agree on. I pledge to work with this freshman class in the future to try to create a working environment in which we can put every American first and try to accomplish things to work together. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I welcome Mr. RASKIN and others who spoke before me as they consumed their Special Order hour in a very unique way, which is not often seen here on the floor, and that is a colloquy between our Republican freshmen and Democratic freshmen. I want to take up issues that I know were covered by many of the freshmen as they discussed their hopes and dreams about what we might actually be able to accomplish in Congress. Let me start with a photo. This is the largest waterfall in California, and I dare say the largest waterfall in the entire United States. It is not a natural waterfall. It is actually a manmade waterfall. With all of this turbulence and enormous churning of water below, it is a failure of a manmade spillway in California. This is the Oroville Dam that has been much in the news over the last several days. As many probably know, California suffered through a 5year drought. As a Representative of the great Sacramento Valley of California, my Sacramento Valley and my State of California suffered mightily. That drought tore apart communities, seriously injured the economy of California, and the health of many businesses. So we went from famine to feast, and we are suffering serious indigestion as a result of the feast of water that we presently have. Oroville Dam was built in the 1960s and completed in 1968. This is the spillway presumably capable of carrying well over 150,000 cubic feet of water. What you see here is the result of a failure right here in the concrete in that spillway, resulting in a massive hole in the spillway and this extraordinary churning and erosion over here on this side. This went on for some time. The operators of the dam, the Department of Water Resources in California, said: Well, we are going to have to shut this down and take a look at the problem. They did. And the problem was, while they were expelling 100,000acrefeet of water, there was 200,000acrefeet of water coming into Lake Oroville. I am going to take a few moments to explain this and then explain how California has successfully dealt with what could have been a serious tragedy. Oroville Dam is the highest dam in California, some 770 feet high. The concrete spillway that I just showed you the picture of the largest waterfall in the Nation—not as high as Yosemite Falls, which is over 1,200 feet—is 700 feet down here to the river. It is 770 feet, actually. Right here is where the damage occurred. This is the emergency spillway, which was never to be used. When this dam was built in the 1960s, they said: Well, we will build the regular spillway, but we will put this emergency spillway in here. This is a 30foothigh concrete wall. Below it is the natural Earth and dirt of the Sierra Nevada mountains and foothills. They shut down the spillway and 200,000 cubic feet of water comes into the reservoir. The reservoir rapidly rose to the point of where it was going over the top of the emergency spillway. Lo and behold, when you run 12,000, 15,000 cubic feet of water per second over the top of that spillway, you hit the dirt on this side and it drives down the river with incredible erosion. This entire area was eroded. But most importantly, the erosion moved back towards the base of that 30foot high concrete wall, jeopardizing the integrity of that 30foothigh barrier against millions upon millions of gallons of water stored in the reservoir. All of this occurred on Sunday, 3 days ago. The call went out from the Department of Water Resources, Oh, my, we have a potential problem, as they observed the potential erosion against the foundation of that 30foot high wall. They said it is possible that that erosion could cause a catastrophic failure of the 30foothigh wall, sending down into the river channel a 30foot tsunami, the result of which would be a catastrophe downstream. This might be a little hard to observe, but I am going to give it a try. Here is the dam right here. Adjacent to the dam is the town of Oroville, just downstream from the dam. Then, the Feather River continues down through my district, Marysville and Yuba City. This is all farm county up here with some significant towns like Gridley in this area, and Live Oak further down, which I represent. This area is represented by my colleague, DOUG LAMALFA , who represents the northern San Joaquin Valley. The reservoir is here. The spillway is here. There is a 30foot wall of water cascading down the emergency spillway, hitting the river and spreading out 30 miles across the Sacramento Valley, all the way to the west side of the valley where the Sacramento River is. This red area is 100 feet deep in 1 hour. The city of Oroville faces a catastrophic event: 100 feet of water above the community within 1 hour of the breaking of that 30foot wall on the emergency spillway. It spreads out. Over here it is still 10 feet deep, 30 miles away. Of course, the water is going to flow down the river also. Two communities down here of 150,000 people, within 7 hours, would be facing water that would be 10 feet deep. That is why they called for an emergency evacuation Sunday afternoon around 6 o’clock. Nearly 200,000 people left this area, all the way over to the west and all the way down some 30 miles down river, moving out to high ground up north to Chico, up into the Sierra foothills, and down towards Sacramento. The water continued to spill over the emergency spillway. The Department of Water Resources, seeing the erosion, reopened the gates on the main spillway and sent 100,000 cubic feet of water down the spillway, creating an incredible but not lovely waterfall. Fortunately, the water flowing into the reservoir very quickly diminished, from a couple hundred thousand acre feet on Saturday and early Sunday to around 40,000 acrefeet toward Sunday evening and on into Monday. So the mathematics began to work in favor of the communities and in favor of the entire region. Slowly, the level of the lake began to recede and eventually the water no longer flowed over the top of that emergency spillway. Nonetheless, you still had 30 feet of water behind that spillway and you had the integrity of the spillway in question. They continued to reduce the water level in the lake and, marshalling resources up here, began to find a solution to the problem. When the sun came up Monday morning, the engineers went out and said: Oh, my. There were four specific areas of serious erosion against the base and the foundation of that 30foot wall with 30 feet of water still behind it. They decided to take emergency action to bring in by helicopter 100,000pound bags of rock to stack in those four eroded areas. Downstream, the communities of Marysville, Yuba City, Gridley, Live Oak, and other small communities were literally ghost towns. People were sheltering in various churches, fairgrounds to the north, fairgrounds to the west, east, and south. Nearly 200,000 people had moved out. As this water receded and the emergency response began to take hold, people looked at this situation and said: Maybe this was the great would have, could have, and should have—would have, could have, should have. Maybe when the dam was built, a concrete apron should have been built on the downside of that emergency spillway. Maybe in 2005, when this entire project went back for relicensing by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the call by the environmental community to concrete the down slope should have been taken into account and should have been done in 2006, 2007, but they decided it wasn’t necessary or it was too expensive or whatever reasons, and so it was not done. It will be done now. The cost of repair to the main spillway and to the emergency spillway will probably be over $200 million. So the question arises for all of us: Do we want to wait until there is a disaster to take cautionary steps to put it back together, or do we want to get ahead of these potential disasters? It is a question for all of us here. It is a question for the Congress and the 
Senate and the President. It is called infrastructure. You heard some of our colleagues earlier on from the freshman class talk about their desire for infrastructure improvements. Here is a prime example. Unfortunately, not the only example, but I want to share with you what actually is happening down river by the communities of Marysville and Sutter County. There are 70 miles of river downstream from this point that has been in the process of significant levee improvement. Some $700 million has been spent over the last 5 to 6 years by the community, by the State of California, and by the Federal Government to bring the levee on the west side of the Feather River to a 200year status. It is nearly completed, but not completely completed. There is another piece to be done even as this flood event takes place. But a community stepped forward. It is called SBFCA. The Sutter Butte Flood Control Agency has undertaken that work—good for them—in the city of Marysville, which is a community surrounded on all sides by 20, 30foot high levees. The Feather River and the Yuba River come together at that point at Marysville, a community that has seen catastrophic flooding in the past. b1800 That community, too, together with the State of California and the Federal Government, Army Corps of Engineers, and the Yuba County Water Agency have been in the process of rebuilding and enhancing the levees around that community. These are positive examples. Further down, the State of California has put together a flood control program for the entire Central Valley, from Mt. Shasta on the north all the way to the Tehachapi Mountains on the south, an extraordinary 600, almost 700mile stretch of the most fertile land in the world and major communities like Sacramento, with millions of people at risk of flooding. Different communities putting together their own flood control programs, reaching out to the Federal Government over the years, providing Federal assistance together with the State assistance to control the flooding that has been historic in California. We need to continue this. We are not nearly finished yet in California. We are going to spend the $200 million here, and this will be concrete in the years ahead, and this main flood control system will be rebuilt. But this problem is not just floods. We have seen the flood of Katrina in Mississippi where we discovered that, oh, my, the levees really could not handle a major hurricane. I will share a story of my own. When I was deputy secretary at the Department of the Interior, we were studying major storms, what would happen in a period of climate change, would we see stronger hurricanes. This was in the mid1990s when I was there as number two in the Department of the Interior. We anticipated a major hurricane coming across from Cuba into the Gulf area and hitting New Orleans. We were so concerned about this that Secretary Babbitt said: John, I want you to go down to New Orleans. I want you to talk to the local officials down there. I remember sitting in the editorial office of the newspaper, The TimesPicayune, sitting there telling them, showing them the map and saying: Here is what we believe could happen, and we, the Federal Government, together with the community, need to enhance your levees. A decade or so later, I was sitting in California. I looked at the television set, and I said: Oh, my God, it is precisely what we predicted in the mid 1990s, and it came to pass. These are the lessons of history. Here is another lesson of history. This is the Interstate 5 Bridge, the last bridge before you get from the United States to Canada. Interstate 5 goes from the Mexican border all the way through California, through Oregon, Washington, and then into Vancouver, British Columbia. This is a bridge that collapsed. How many other bridges have we seen collapse? We have seen the bridge collapse in Minnesota, and people died. We have seen rail bridges collapse. In California this last week, the main Union Pacific Railroad going north and south between Sacramento—well, all of northern California—way down to southern California over the Tehachapis, the Union Pacific Railroad Bridge just south of Sacramento collapsed. The rail cars, at least a day ago, were still sitting there in the water as they were busily trying to repair that rail bridge. A good third of all the bridges in the United States do not meet safety standards and are subject to collapse, and in some cases deadly collapse. As we go through all of this, we need to be aware of the extraordinary need that our Nation has for infrastructure improvements. I think some of us remember the comments of our former Vice President Biden when he landed in LaGuardia, New York, and made a comment about that facility. I won’t repeat it here because I am sure my New York friends might find that to be somewhat degrading. But it was a comment that was well deserved about the quality of that airport. The unfortunate part is that that is repeated in airport after airport around the United States: inadequate, old, not up to standards, and very poor in providing the efficient transportation that we require. We can go on and on. We can talk about the highway system. The Department of Transportation estimates that we need over $836 billion just to maintain and bring up to standards the American highway system, both highways and bridges. The public transportation system has a $90 billion backlog for public transit for the state of good repair. This isn’t expansion. This is just to have good repair for what we need in our transit systems. We can go on and on. Bridges, $20 billion. As I said, one in three of the bridges in the Nation—it is actually one in four—are structurally deficient and functionally obsolete. Sixtyfive percent of our Nation’s roads are in less than good condition. Our rail and bus transit systems face a $90 billion backlog, as I just said. The 59 busiest ports in the United States only operate at 35 percent of capacity because the channels are filled with silt, and modern ships are unable to enter those ports. The FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration, has identified a need for $32 billion for improvement of our airports. It goes on and on and on. America does not want to face this kind of devastation, with the failure of dams. I don’t have the exact number of dams in the United States—I think there are some 83,000—but a good percentage of those dams are structurally deficient from many different ways. Obviously, Oroville Dam was one of them. It didn’t have a sufficient spillway to handle the extraordinary flows of the river. Another one central to California’s water system is the San Luis Reservoir, a 2millionacrefoot reservoir south of Sacramento, east of San Jose, that is central to the water supply of California, both for southern California, for the San Joaquin Valley, the farmers there, as well as for Los Angeles. The Oroville Dam is the key dam for the California water system, which supplies water to Silicon Valley, to the San Joaquin Valley, as well as to Los Angeles. We have work to do all across this Nation, and we can do it. There is a lot of talk going on about the infrastructure program. Our new President has suggested a trillion dollar infrastructure program, somehow financed with private investment. Now, I don’t know how that would work in repairing a dam such as Oroville or San Luis. I am not sure how a private investor would fit into that, but undoubtedly there are models in which there can be public private partnerships. But that will not suffice. There are programs that have been suggested by my colleague here in the House, by Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. D EFAZIO has what he calls ‘‘a penny for progress.’’ It is a program that would provide nearly a trillion dollars of infrastructure investment for highways over a 10year period. We would borrow the money, and then pay it off with a onepenny increase in the excise tax for gasoline and fuel as it would keep pace with inflation. A novel idea, one that probably would work if we could find the votes for it. Over on the Senate side, the Senate minority leader, Mr. SCHUMER , has introduced a $1 trillion package of all 
types of investment in infrastructure, and it is a project that deserves our attention. It is a project that would provide significant money for highways. In his proposal, he would create 15 million jobs over the next 10 years for investment in many different kinds of infrastructure. He has something that I have talked about here on the floor now for 7 years. We call it Make It In America, Buy America, use our tax money to buy Americanmade products, bring our manufacturing back. If you are going to use rebar to rebuild that spillway, then use American steel. If you are going to put a pump in this dam to drain some facility, buy an American pump. After all, it is our taxpayers’ money. It is my money. It is your money. Use the Buy America principle. He has a couple of other principles that I think are very important. He wants protections for American workers, and this is both life and health and safety protections but also wage protection, the DavisBacon and the prevailing wage programs, all of which I think pull up the bottom with good working wages for men and women in the construction industry. Also, make sure that there is an opportunity for minority and womenowned businesses, and of course the environmental protection. These are kind of the principles of his program, which I happen to think are appropriate. So what would he spend the money on? He would suggest that we spend $210 billion repairing the roads and bridges. Now, remember, that is about onequarter of what the Department of Transportation said is needed for the backlog, but, nonetheless, that is a good start. For roads and bridges, $210 billion over the 10year period. That is 1.3 million new jobs. He would also want to spend $110 billion for new water and sewer systems. Not bad when you talk about places like Flint, Michigan, and the contaminated water in their water supply. In our own Central Valley of California, we have numerous communities that have inadequate water and, in many cases, water that is contaminated with various chemicals, both natural and from the business environment. Senator SCHUMER suggests that we spend $180 billion to expand and replace our rail and bus systems. That is more than just the transit programs. I suppose that is to make sure that the Union Pacific bridges don’t collapse. He would also have $200 billion for vital infrastructure projects. These would be the most critical, the high priority projects across the Nation. I would suggest to the Senator, Mr. Speaker, that the Senator might consider rebuilding the spillways on the Oroville Dam. He would also invest $75 billion on American schools so that our schools are new and modern and meet the needs of our students, another $70 billion on the ports. Remember, I was talking about this earlier, about the ports that are inadequate. This feeds back to what Mr. DEFAZIO has suggested, that we have the harbor maintenance fund. These are fees that are collected on every good that arrives or every container that arrives at our ports, and that money be spent on the ports, both in the water as well as on the dock. That money, unfortunately, is not spent just there. It winds up in the Treasury for who knows what purpose. So we would bring that money back to spend on our ports, modernizing them. Keep in mind that Panama, the new Panama Canal, has been expanded, bigger ships, deeper draft, so we need to dredge these ports, we need to build the wharves, the docks that can handle them. Senator SCHUMER would also recommend that $100 billion be spent in energy infrastructure to meet the needs of a modern energy system that is not dependent upon coal and oil but, rather, renewable sources of all kinds. And broadband, which is exceedingly important. In my district, which stretches 200 miles up the Sacramento Valley, broadband is not available. So these are infrastructure investments that I would think all of us should agree on, that we need to build a modern infrastructure for a modern economy and a growing economy, and along the way create as many as 13 million jobs to do that, a project that would go forward over the 10year period ahead of us. So we have got the President suggesting a trillion dollar program, publicprivate partnerships, of which I suspect there are some right there, we have got Mr. DEFAZIO with a financing program for highways and transit systems and ports, and we have Senator SCHUMER on the other side with a trillion dollar program that would deal with virtually every part of the infrastructure, from broadband communications to ports, highways, bridges, and the like. So we have, I think, an opportunity here in this Congress to address a critical need for America’s future, not only for the safety of Americans so that all Americans can avoid the kind of catastrophe that California came very, very close to having on Sunday, with the collapse of a 30foot dam on Lake Oroville, creating not this, but something that would be several times bigger than this cascading down the river and inundating communities to the depth of 100 feet or more. It doesn’t have to happen. We should never be pennywise and poundfoolish. We should never delay these infrastructure investments because we know that bridges will collapse, and along with it the transportation system. b1815 We know that dams are in jeopardy. We know that our highways are filled with potholes. We know that many of our airports are ancient and, in many cases, decrepit and certainly not up to modern safety standards and certainly passenger convenience. We know that our ports need to be dredged and new wharfs and docks built. We know that we need to have intermodal systems so that we can efficiently move cargo from the ports to the trucks, to the trains, and across the country. We know the needs. The question for all of us is: Are we ready to meet those needs? I would suggest to you that we can. We can do creative financing, as Mr. DEFAZIO has suggested. There is a role for publicprivate partnerships in all of this, as the President has suggested. There is also a place in all of this for us to make choices about how we spend the taxpayers’ money. This is one that I want to bring to the attention of Americans. We are in the process of making a choice to spend $1 trillion over the next 20 years or so to rebuild our entire nuclear arsenal. All of it. All of our nuclear bombs, all of the ICBMs in the silos in the upper Midwest, new submarines with new intercontinental missiles with new bombs on top of those missiles, new stealth bombers such as the new B–21, new cruise missiles with new bombs. All of these things. New, fast, stealthy, unobservable, extraordinarily dangerous because the rules of the old Cold War or the old nuclear standoff don’t apply. One trillion dollars for what purpose? We need to ask that question and we need to make choices. There are many other choices that we will be making here. Choices about building a $30 billion wall rather than repairing the bridges, in this case to Canada. Choices about nuclear weapons. Our job—your representatives here in Congress—is to make choices that are wise, choices that protect you, choices that give all of us an opportunity to have good, wellpaying jobs, a modern infrastructure on which the private sector can then grow and prosper, and men and women can earn a good middle class living. Or we can make choices on things that really do not provide any of those benefits. It is about choices. It is about being prepared for tomorrow. It is about avoiding collapsed bridges and reservoirs that might fail and send a cascade of water down upon the communities. So I ask my colleagues to consider, to ponder the needs of your communities, and to make choices that are wise, that look to the future, and build a solid foundation that won’t fail when that 30 feet of water presses up against that foundation. Choices. I hope and I pray we make wise choices. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we had a resignation now that seems to be the big news of the day of a Cabinet member of the Trump administration. It is interesting to have seen this Indivisible movement arise. The Daily Signal points out: ‘‘ . . . Ties to George Soros, Sows Division Against Trump, GOP Lawmakers.’’ ‘‘Democrats who used to work on Capitol Hill are helping to disrupt Republican lawmakers’ town hall meetings across the country through a nationwide effort to oppose and ‘resist’ President Donald Trump’s agenda.’’ And it goes on to talk about some of the leftists who are trying to do that. And another article that says that the Indivisible team is trying to mimic strategies of the Tea Party. But it was quite a difference. The Taxed Enough Already Party was grabbing hold of American principles, constitutional principles, principles that brought about the revolution and served the country well for over 200 years; and that we are supposed to have a government that works for us, not works us; takes away our religious freedom, tries to take away Second Amendment freedom, tries to take away freedom of religion; tells us we can’t say anything negative about anything they care about or they will try to destroy us, our business. And there were people that were shocked. And then on top of it all, add a lot more tax. And as the President told Joe the Plumber, in essence: We need to take your income and spread it around the country. I had some friends here during the inauguration. I took them to the Lincoln Memorial. And, of course, on the south inside wall is the Gettysburg Address. On the inside of the north wall is the second inaugural that is so profound. Mark Levin’s father has a terrific book about it. What an amazing speech. Lincoln is talking just shortly before his assassination. But the second inaugural, the war is winding down, it is about over, and there is so much hope abounding. He was not bitter. He was an amazing man, our first Republican President. He talked about the Nation and about how both the north and south both read the same Bible and both pray to the same God. He points out that the prayers of both could not be answered, the prayers of neither have been fully answered. But he points out that it might seem strange that a group of people would invoke God’s name to wrench their bread out of the sweat of other people’s brow. But I heard enough from people in the Taxed Enough Already Party, this group that arose that—wait a minute— basically are saying when the President says, I am going to take your money that you made and spread it around, he is basically saying, Look, I am going to be the most powerful man in the world, and certainly in this country, and my principles dictate; I need to take what you work for and spread it around to other people. Is that a way of wrenching your bread from the sweat of others? It is interesting. But anyway, this group had 17 show up at an office. Obviously, they were more interested in publicity than a meeting, because all they had to do is call and we make sure they have a meeting and somebody is there to meet them, even though I am here in Washington when they demand to meet. Apparently groups all over the country are following this Sorosfunded effort to try to destroy the country, disrupt the country, and create anarchy and mayhem wherever they can. Fortunately, in east Texas, people realize we can’t quite go as far as some groups do because nobody would accept it. I have got some constituents that are asking legitimate questions. But what we go back to is what really gave strength to this movement, objecting to what was being done in the Obama administration, was when we had a President and a Speaker who were saying: We know that a majority of Americans don’t want this ObamaCare, Affordable Care Act. It is hard to call it affordable care because it is such a misnomer. But we see the polls. A majority of the American people don’t want it, but we are going to stick you with it anyway because it is part of our agenda. That is what was really bothering people. The thing is that this socalled Indivisible and groups like this are terrific at coming up with names that are anathema to what they really are. So you have a group called Indivisible, and their goal is completely dividing and destroying the constitutional principles of America. But the thing is, a majority didn’t want ObamaCare passed. It was shoved down their throats, even though most of the people in this body here had not even read it. I read it. It scared me. I am still asking for answers. Why did President Obama need a commissioned and noncommissioned Presidential officer corps that he could call up. Initially, it sounded like a medical emergency group, but then it said they would be trained. It didn’t say with weapons or with what. And it said the President would be able to call them up for any international emergency, and it didn’t mention the word ‘‘health’’ or ‘‘medical’’ on that. So, anyway, there is just so much in there that we didn’t need. Most of Americans didn’t want it and didn’t like it. And it took away people’s health insurance from them. I was talking with thousands of people in my district. I love to do telephone townhalls with my district. This was one segment. About a third of the district last night was represented in this group, and I will have others coming up in the future. But it is very helpful to me because I can talk to people that you wouldn’t see, you wouldn’t hear, wouldn’t see or hear you if you had 40 people come to a townhall, like sometimes do. And since we know that there are groups out there that have instructions to create mayhem, disrupt, accuse them of racism—it is in the documents that we are seeing—whatever they bring up, charge racism, corruption, and something else, we can have a telephone townhall and I can find out what people are thinking that I otherwise wouldn’t hear from. I thought about doing a mailer to mail to as many in my district that I could, but the costs were just so dramatic. I could do it, but why spend $100,000plus of taxpayer dollars just to find out what my district is thinking? I think the best indication of what people in each congressional district in the country are thinking is what happened in the November election. That is the ultimate poll that anybody could ever take. And I have having been talking about for 6 years that ObamaCare needed to be repealed, that it takes away choice, that it is costing more money. You don’t get to keep your doctor, you don’t get to keep your insurance policy; and so many thousands in my district did not. b1830 And so it was very helpful to hear from people, for example, how many believe the government needs to be more involved in health insurance, and I think that was at like 97 percent. There were thousands of people that had been called. But anyway, it gives me feedback. It was interesting to note that this group, this indivisible group, the websites had gotten some information about the messages going back and forth, and one of them is, when we demand that they have a townhall that we can disrupt and they say we are going to have a telephone townhall because we can reach a lot more people, people that are invalids or homebound, seniors that couldn’t get out to a personal townhall meeting can participate in the telephone townhall. They are saying how do we respond to that when there are so many more people they can reach and hear from and it helps the disabled to do these telephone townhalls, how do we respond to that? And they really didn’t get a good answer, last I saw. But it is important for every Representative to know where their district stands, where their people stand, and I continue to believe that I am the most fortunate Member of this 435seat body because of whom I get to represent. I had an opponent last year raising Cain about I was on national media so much, and I mean, when I think about it, why would national media want me to be on? It is certainly not my looks, certainly not because I have such an incredible voice. You know, I would love to have a voice like James Earl Jones, or I was just so moved at the Senate Chaplain speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast a couple of weeks ago. I would love to have a voice like I think maybe God’s voice may sound like 
some day when I get to hear it, but I don’t. I don’t have a voice like that. This is what I have got. I don’t put on any airs. Why would any national media want to have me on? And I think it would have to have something to do with the fact that I represent extraordinary people in Texas where sense is very common, just so much common sense, and I think a lot of the country likes hearing about the way threefourths of my district thinks. I think I reflect that district, and that is why, basically, threefourths of the district voted for me. It is not because of the way I look or sound. Even people that can’t stand me in that 25 or 26 percent, they know I am going to stand up and do what I told people I am going to do. It is just that some people don’t like it. Some years back, one guy wrote that I was a moron and misspelled ‘‘moron.’’ If he is listening, Mr. Speaker, he needs to know there is no E in moron. But in any event, it is interesting to see how frantic things have gotten and how destructive some of the forces in this country have gotten in trying to bring down the principles that made us great, and it is quite disconcerting. That leads me to a point I want to discuss, which we had the news, the tragic failing of the dam in California. We will continue, those of us who believe in the power of prayer, to pray that there will be no loss of life, despite the negligence of the California government in refusing for over 12 years—apparently, at least 12 years—to heed the warnings that this dam was going to be failing at some point. They needed to do something. We just need to pray that the negligence that occurred in the New Orleans area in diverting money away from shoring up the levee would not end up having the mass cost of loss of life in California. But as we continue to have people try to disrupt our congressional districts, continue to try to make so much noise, create so much anarchy that it creates an inability to govern properly—despite the fact it isn’t going to work—this President, this administration, and this Congress is not going to be diverted from what needs to be done. This article came out today from the Free Beacon, by Adam Kredo: ‘‘Former Obama Officials, Loyalists Waged Secret Campaign to Oust Flynn.’’ Now, I hadn’t known Flynn before. I don’t believe I had met him before maybe last September. I might have, but I don’t believe I have before that. But I had a chance to visit with him at that point with, at that time, Donald Trump, now our President. He is an interesting man. He has served his country well. But there are issues that are coming out now about discussions with Russians. It would seem to me, if President Trump had an intelligence community and had people in the government service around him, the career people that were really wanting to help the country—rather than the Democrats or President Obama as he went out—that were really interested in helping the best interests of the United States of America, they would want the President to have all of the information that anyone in any of the upper echelons or anywhere in the departments that work for President Trump— wouldn’t they want their boss to know or have the most accurate information? Apparently, there was information out there that didn’t come to light until President Trump had selected his National Security Adviser. He had been sworn in as the National Security Adviser, and they were on a roll. And of course, one of the things General Flynn was concerned about, something that is a deep concern of so many of ours in this body, was the outrageous Iran treaty that got treated like it wasn’t a treaty. It was, indeed, a treaty. It never got ratified by the Senate, but it was, indeed, a treaty. It had all of the things in it that treaties would have. But this article goes on: ‘‘The abrupt resignation Monday evening of White House national security adviser Michael Flynn is the culmination of a secret, monthslong campaign by former Obama administration confidantes to handicap President Donald Trump’s national security apparatus and preserve the nuclear deal with Iran, according to multiple sources both in and out of the White House who described to the Washington Free Beacon a behindthe scenes effort by these officials to plant a series of damaging stories about Flynn in the national media. ‘‘The effort, said to include former Obama administration adviser Ben Rhodes—the architect of a separate White House effort to create what he described as a proIran echo chamber— included a small task force of Obama loyalists who deluged media outlets with stories aimed at eroding Flynn’s credibility, multiple sources revealed. ‘‘The operation primarily focused on discrediting Flynn, an opponent of the Iran nuclear deal, in order to handicap the Trump administration’s efforts to disclose secret details of the nuclear deal with Iran that had been long hidden by the Obama administration.’’ Mr. Speaker, I want to insert here, some of us went down to the classified area of the SCIF where we can review classified information and we reviewed what was available about the Iran deal, but we found out there was a lot of secret stuff that the administration would not allow us to know: what he had given away, what he had done, potential bad judgment in going so far out of the Obama administration’s way to placate and assist the largest supporters of terrorism in the world. Obviously, what this article is talking about, some secret parts of the agreement, those are things that we were certainly not allowed to read no matter who you were in Congress at the time. But this says: ‘‘Insiders familiar with the antiFlynn campaign told the Free Beacon that these Obama loyalists plotted in the months before Trump’s inauguration to establish a set of roadblocks before Trump’s national security team, which includes several prominent opponents of diplomacy with Iran. The Free Beacon first reported on this effort in January. ‘‘Sources who spoke to the Free Beacon requested anonymity in order to speak freely about the situation and avoid interfering with the White House’s official narrative about Flynn, which centers on his failure to adequately inform the president about a series of phone calls with Russian officials. ‘‘Flynn took credit for his missteps regarding these phone calls in a brief statement released late Monday evening. Trump administration officials subsequently stated that Flynn’s efforts to mislead the president and vice president about his contacts with Russia could not be tolerated. ‘‘However, multiple sources closely involved in the situation pointed to a larger, more secretive campaign aimed at discrediting Flynn and undermining the Trump White House. ‘‘’It’s undeniable that the campaign to discredit Flynn was well underway before Inauguration Day, with a very troublesome and politicized series of leaks designed to undermine him,’ said one veteran national security adviser with close ties to the White House team. ‘This pattern reminds me of the lead up to the Iran deal, and probably features the same cast of characters.’’’ And we know from news that has come out since the Iran deal was made by this administration, we know that some of the same placaters that enabled North Korea to develop nuclear weapons in the Clinton administration were involved in negotiating this deal with Iran. The deal with North Korea was to stop them from getting nuclear weapons, and so my interpretation of the deal was basically this: They promised them: We will give you everything you need to develop nuclear weapons in North Korea if you will just sign a piece of paper that says you won’t do that. The Clinton administration, some of the same people that ran to do a deal with Iran, they jumped on that. And so what happens, North Korea uses what we provided them to help create nuclear weapons. Big shock. So it is a big shock that the Obama administration would send at least one of those original people to be the top negotiator with Secretary of State John Kerry, who never saw a Genghis Khan that he couldn’t work with, and they work out a deal. We still haven’t found out all of the arrangements, all of the things that were done; but we know that there is, apparently, something so sinister about what this country has done, bent over backwards to provide for Iran or allow Iran to do, that the Obama administration could 
not allow rightthinking American people to know what it had done for Iran and against Israel and the United States’ best interests. But if you believe the best interests of the United States are to weaken the United States, if you believe that the United States has been the biggest problem in the world for the last 100 years, then you would think, well, then if we make a deal with Iran that weakens the United States, may even lead to our demise, the world is a better place. So it is ultimately for the good of the world because the United States is certainly weaker than it has been in decades, going back to preWorld War II military strength. The Chinese economy, it was announced at one point, may have exceeded ours. I am not sure that is true. b1845 Anyway, countries around the world that are threats to world peace have gotten stronger. ISIS has gotten stronger during this President’s term, in fact, came into being under President Obama and got quite strong, thousands upon thousands of lives lost. In Afghanistan, he took a war that he told people—the voters in 2008—was the important war. And what should have been just a housekeeping operation under his leadership and with his rules of engagement, it cost about four times more American military lives than were lost in the height of the Afghan war for 7
1⁄2years under President Bush. It must be something in the leadership there when one President loses four times more military members than the prior President in the same length of time and the latter President being when the war was supposed to be basically over. This article points out that: ‘‘Flynn had been preparing to publicize many of the details about the nuclear deal that had been intentionally hidden by the Obama administration as part of its effort to garner support for the deal, these sources said. ‘‘Flynn is now ‘gone before anybody can see what happened’ with these secret agreements, said the second insider close to Flynn and the White House. ‘‘Sources in and out of the White House are concerned that the campaign against Flynn will be extended to other prominent figures in the Trump administration.’’ Well, Mr. Speaker, I can inject here: Whoever these sources are that are concerned the campaign against Flynn be extended to other prominent figures, I can guarantee them that people in and outside the United States Government right now, as I speak, will do everything within their power—some of these characters will—to prevent President Trump from getting us back on track to making the world a safer place, to getting Iran back in the little box that President Carter let them out of. They are going to go after lots of people. It is not going to be limited. This apparently is a campaign that is going to be ongoing. Apparently, General Flynn messed up and wasn’t completely honest when he should have been. A President has got to be able to trust his security adviser. That kind of goes without saying. The President has to be able to trust those people. It takes me back to September when I was talking—it was right before General Flynn walked up, actually ironically. But I was telling: Look, I like President George W. Bush. He is a good man. He is a smart guy. He is a lot smarter than people give him credit. He is one of the wittiest people you can ever have a conversation with, but something that hurt him—and I wanted Donald Trump to understand this— something that hurt him was that he was such a nice guy. After the election was over, he made it known, in essence, that everything that happened in the past is bygones. What is happening now, from now on, we are going forward. The trouble is he had people doing bad acts, even crimes like having FBI files at the White House. Chuck Colson went to prison a year and a half for having one. The Clinton administration had nearly a thousand; nobody did a day. I said, you have got to clean out these departments, these agencies where Bush didn’t clean them out. You have got to or they are going to undermine you the whole time you are President. And it looks like we are seeing that right now. So, Mr. Speaker, I just encourage all my colleagues to let’s give the Trump administration the chance to help get this country safer, freer, and just a better place to live. It is not going to happen while people are undermining the President from within his own administration and a little cabal that has those ties in this administration. It is time to clean house, and General Flynn is not who I am talking about. I yield back the balance of my time. 
FROM DESEGREGATION TO RESEGREGATION The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GARRETT ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 30 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on May 17, 1954, Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the shock that was felt across the Nation. This was done when, on behalf of a unanimous Supreme Court, he announced: ‘‘We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.’’ These 24 words, Mr. Speaker, had a farreaching impact upon our Nation. These words ushered in an era of de jure desegregation that has changed the course of history that has created a new sense of destiny, and literally these 24 words opened doors that were closed to many persons and created new opportunities. Mr. Speaker, before I go on, let me thank the many cosponsors of H. Res. 79, which recognizes the significance of Black History Month, and H. Res. 17, which honors the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP, on its 108th anniversary. I thank the many cosponsors and the many persons who have worked on these issues. I have a staff that has worked tirelessly to make sure that we have these resolutions prepared, such that they could be filed timely. I am grateful to my staff. One such staff member is with me tonight. My legislative director, Ms. Amena Ross, is in the Chamber with me. I am appreciative that on Valentine’s Day she has chosen to be here as opposed to where she probably could be and will probably be going shortly. Mr. Speaker, given that in this month, the month of February, we celebrate Black history as well as the founding of the NAACP, I think that it is appropriate for me to speak on the topic from desegregation to resegregation. Mr. Speaker, it can happen. Mr. Speaker, while Brown v. Board of Education has not produced the utopian society many hoped for—it has not ended the de facto segregation that many prayed for. It has not engendered the quality education for all children and has not transformed public schools into perfect schools or equal schools— I still contend and firmly believe that we are a much better nation with Brown v. Board of Education than without it. Mr. Speaker, I think that it is important for us to give empirical evidence of these words that I have just spoken, my positions, if you will. I would like to do so by allowing the words of a Southern judge. I would like to allow his words to speak for themselves. This is a message that was delivered by a Southern judge on October 4 of 1957. Mr. Speaker, I shall not call his name. I do not want to embarrass his family. But he was the vice president of a bar association. He was a circuit court judge. He received his BA from a prestigious institution, and he taught sociology. Mr. Speaker, please hear now his words so that people may understand why Brown v. Board of Education was so important to so many in this country. These are his words: ‘‘Segregation in the South is a way of life. It is the means whereby we live in social peace, order and security.’’ Mr. Speaker, I trust that many people can understand why persons of my generation are concerned when we hear the terms ‘‘law’’ and ‘‘order,’’ terms that indicate law enforcement will take law into its own hands by some standards. In fact, there was law and order at the Edmond Pettus Bridge on 
Bloody Sunday, but there was not justice at the Edmond Pettus Bridge. Many people seek justice when they look for law enforcement to enforce and maintain order. They look for justice as well. He goes on to say: ‘‘Ninetyeight percent of both races prefer segregation.’’ He is now speaking for people that we now call African Americans. At that time, they were called Negroes. ‘‘Integration is urged by the NAACP, a few Southern mulattoes’’—this is a means by which lightskinned African Americans were separated from the darker African Americans. He says that ‘‘ . . . a few Southern mulattoes, Northern Communistfront organizations and leftwing labor groups who would use the unsuspecting Negro as their tool.’’ It is remarkable that someone would think that people yearning to be free would see those who are lending a hand as persons who are using them as tools. He goes on to say: ‘‘It does not work any economic hardship nor deprive the Negro of any of his constitutional rights.’’ He is talking about segregation. Then he goes on to say: ‘‘The Negro has made great strides and the Southern white man is largely responsible for these advancements.’’ This is a judge. One can only imagine what it must have been like to appear before him if you were Black. He goes on to say: ‘‘If in the South the Negro was permitted, as he is in some Northern States, to obtain the ballot by simply reaching 21 years of age, it would mean that no qualified white man in many counties throughout the South could ever hold public office. It would also mean that in the halls of Congress, seats now held by competent white representatives would be held by ignorant, incompetent Negroes.’’ These are the words of a judge shortly after the Brown decision. He explains: ‘‘An exhaustive study of the program and results of integration in the schools of Washington, D.C., which the NAACP and other left wing groups’’—thank God for the NAACP and leftwing groups—‘‘fostering integration said would be a model for the rest of the United States to follow, clearly reveals that the average white student who was integrated in the class room with the Negro has been retarded two to three years in his educational progress. Therefore, it is not to the best interest of America that the white children, particularly in certain congested sections, be retarded three years in their educational advancement.’’ He then states later on in his speech that ‘‘ . . . we have already, by constitutional amendment, authorized our legislature as other Southern States will do, to abolish the public schools if the Negro and white children are ever integrated therein. Make no mistake about it, we will abolish our public school system and establish private schools for our white children, and we will still provide and see that the Negro is educated separately. It will cost dearly, but we will do it.’’ Finally, he concludes with these words. This is a judge. These are facts in the sense that these are statements that he had made. The history is there for those who wish to read it. He indicates that: ‘‘ . . . As long as we live, so long shall we be segregated, and after death, God willing, thus it will still be!’’ b1900 Mr. Speaker, I call this to our attention because it is important for us to understand what the horrors of segregation were really like; that this was not something that persons of African ancestry enjoyed; that segregation caused many persons more than an inconvenience. It really cost a good many people their lives. So I thank God, Mr. Speaker, for the NAACP, for labor unions, and for people of goodwill of all hues who worked hard to make sure we arrived at this point in our history. I thank God for Brown v. Board of Education, but I also understand that the Brown case, Mr. Speaker, was as much about fate as it was about facts. I contend that, but for the intrusive hand of fate, the Brown decision could have been, at minimum, a partial endorsement of segregation. Unfortunately, because the Chief Justice at that time, whose name I shall not mention—I need not embarrass his family—was a notorious supporter of the doctrine of segregation. However, Mr. Speaker, after arguments were made in the Brown case in 1952, and before the decision was announced in 1954, fate intruded, and the Chief Justice suffered a heart attack from which he did not recover. A conservative President then had the duty to appoint a man to the new seat as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. President Eisenhower appointed a man who participated in the World War II internment of Japanese Americans. This was Governor Earl Warren. He was appointed as the new Chief Justice. With this appointment, many persons thought that little would change on the Supreme Court. However, when Warren achieved a unanimous decision outlawing segregation, President Eisenhower is said to have stated that this was one of the biggest mistakes that he made by appointing Warren to the Supreme Court as his Chief Justice. The Brown decision, Mr. Speaker, was little less than a minor miracle, and it has had a remarkable impact on our society. I probably stand here today because of the Brown decision. At the time the decision was rendered, there were two African Americans in Congress. Today we have approximately 50 African Americans in Congress. The Brown decision has made a difference in the lives of people. Integration of schools has been of benefit to young people. I have an article that I would like to read from. It is styled: ‘‘The Benefits of Socioeconomically and Racially Integrated Schools and Classrooms.’’ This is from the Century Foundation, a reputable organization. In the general sense, here is what the article addresses: It indicates that students in integrated schools have higher average test scores. Students in integrated schools are more likely to enroll in college. Students in integrated schools are less likely to drop out. Integrated schools help to reduce racial achievement gaps. Integrated classrooms encourage critical thinking, problemsolving, and creativity. Attending a diverse school can help reduce racial bias and counter stereotypes. Students who attend integrated schools are more likely to seek out integrated settings after they leave school and enter life. Integrated classrooms can improve students’ satisfaction and intellectual selfconfidence. Learning in integrated settings can enhance students’ leadership skills. Finally, of the many things—and I have not cited them all—diverse classrooms prepare students to succeed in a global economy. Mr. Speaker, there is little question in my mind and in the minds of many that integration has made a difference in the lives of people in this country. Integration has not only been of benefit to us in classrooms, but the truth is that we live in a society wherein integration has allowed us, by virtue of Brown v. Board of Education, to sleep where we sleep, to eat where we eat, to live where we live. Brown v. Board of Education has had farreaching implications beyond that of the classroom. In fact, the economic order, the political order, and the social order were positively impacted by Brown. So, Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear that I believe we have to, in this country, protect the integration and desegregation that society has produced. I see that I have another colleague present. Mr. Speaker, can you give me the amount of time that I have left? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 14 minutes remaining. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I assure my colleague that I will provide ample time. Continuing, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned about the resegregation of our society. I believe that it can occur, and I believe that we must guard against it. I believe that the voucherization of public school funding has been and continues to be the enemy of desegregation and integration. Allow me to explain. After the Brown decision, as I have indicated, many States sought to repeal the requirement that they maintain a public 
school system, and many did. After the Brown decision, vouchers were seen as a means by which public schools could be privatized, so that the public school system would exist with private tax dollars that were in the form of vouchers, and would allow people to still go to the schools of their choice. ‘‘School choice’’ was one of the watchwords of the day. After the Brown decision, in 1955, thereabouts, Milton Friedman, Nobel Laureate, proposed that vouchers be used to allow children to go to the schools of their choice, allow their parents to have this opportunity to send their children to the schools of their choice. Mr. Speaker, these vouchers, had they been used as proposed, would have continued to perpetrate segregation and perpetuate it for years to come. These vouchers were not used, thank God. I regret to say, however, that many States are currently proposing voucher systems that can lead to the resegregation of society. We have a duty to protect the gains that have been made, that have been fought for by the NAACP, by labor unions, by people of goodwill of all hues. We have got a duty and an obligation to protect these gains, and not allow our country to slip back into a dark past that no one wants to relive. I would hope, Mr. Speaker, that as we continue our progress, we will remember the past that we have been able to extricate ourselves from. And in so doing, it is my desire that we give special attention to these attempts to use tax dollars, to voucherize tax dollars so that public schools can be privatized with tax dollars, which can lead to separation, which can lead to the resegregation of society. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I have my colleague, the Honorable JIMCLYBURN  present from South Carolina. He is known as a historian par excellence. I am so honored to yield to him so that he may speak on the subjects related to Black history and the NAACP. I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN ). Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, have been the topic of a great deal of discussions recently, and I rise, as part of the observance of Black History Month, to recognize and celebrate one of them, Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina. Similar to the many Historically Black Colleges and Universities across the Nation, Allen University’s contributions to my home State of South Carolina and the Nation are immeasurable. Founded to offer education and opportunity to formerly enslaved African Americans, HBCUs have been central institutions in AfricanAmerican communities for generations. In 1870, 5 years after the end of the Civil War, the clergy of the African Methodist Episcopal Church set out to create an institution to educate newly freed slaves and train clergy for the AME Church. The Church purchased land in Cokesbury, South Carolina, and named the new college Payne Institute in honor of AME Bishop Daniel Payne, a native of Charleston, South Carolina. Bishop Payne had become the first Black college president in the United States at Wilberforce University in 1863, which he had helped found. In 1880, Bishop William Dickerson sought to relocate the college to Columbia and acquired land on which the campus sits today. The institution was renamed Allen University after Richard Allen, the founder and first bishop of the AME Church. Higher education remained segregated in South Carolina until the early 1960s. The University of South Carolina, also in my district, only a mile away from Allen, for example, admitted its first African American in 1963, 2 years after I graduated college. Throughout the Jim Crow era, Allen University offered degrees in law, education, and theology, and at one time also offered elementary and high school classes. Several of its buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places, forming the Allen University Historic District. Arnett Hall, the oldest building on campus, was constructed in 1891 by the students themselves. It was named after Benjamin W. Arnett, an early leader of the AME Church, who served on Allen University’s Board of Trustees. The Chappelle Administration Building, which houses the Chappelle Auditorium, was designed by John Anderson Lankford, known as the dean of Black architects, and completed in 1925. It was named after William David Chappelle, the greatgrandfather of comedian Dave Chappelle, and a graduate of Allen University, who later served as its president. Chappelle Auditorium is one of five buildings in Columbia designated a National Historic Landmark. This historic campus has been central to the Waverly neighborhood and the AfricanAmerican community in Columbia. Black artists, such as Leontyne Price, Langston Hughes, and Brook Benton, all appeared at Chappelle Auditorium. In 1947, the Reverend James Hinton, thenpresident of the NAACP of South Carolina, held a rally at Chappelle, which was attended by Reverend Joseph A. DeLaine, an Allen University alumnus. Inspired by the event, Reverend DeLaine organized families in Summerton, South Carolina, to petition their school district to provide buses for Black students who, at the time, were forced to make a daily walk of 9 miles to school. b1915 This case, Briggs v. Elliott, was the first of the five cases that became Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. It is no exaggeration, Mr. Speaker, to say that Allen University was the birthplace of the movement that overturned ‘‘separate but equal’’ and brought an end to legal segregation in America. Allen University will remain central to the struggle for civil rights. In the early 1960s, Allen University students led demonstrations at segregated lunch counters and participated in many of the marches in Columbia during that period. National leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Roy Wilkins, and Ralph Abernathy visited Allen during these demonstrations, often staying on campus when they came to town. Today Allen University is a liberal arts institution still operated by the AME Church. It has graduated many notable elected officials, including State Representative William Clyburn and his wife, Beverly Dozier Clyburn, who retired from the Aiken, South Carolina, City Council several years ago. Retired State Senator Kay Patterson is also a graduate. Two of Allen’s alumni, former Senator Clementa Pinckney and Tywanza Sanders, were among the nine who were murdered during the attack at Emanuel AME Church in 2015. Several of its historic buildings, like Arnett Hall and Chappelle Auditorium, have been restored recently with Federal funding from the HBCU Historic Preservation Program, which this body in its collective wisdom voted unanimously last year to reauthorize. I plan, along with my friend Representative GREEN and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, to reintroduce that bill this year. I am hopeful that we will repeat the unanimity this year and that the Senate will support our efforts. Allen University has made an indelible mark on our society over the past 147 years. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in honoring its great contributions to this great Nation. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I thank Mr. CLYBURN for those wonderful comments. They were most edifying, and I am sure that a good many people have acquired a better understanding of Allen University. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I will simply say this in my last 2 minutes. I am grateful that the NAACP was there not only for me, but for this country. The NAACP filed and won many cases, but Brown v. Board of Education has to be one of the most outstanding pieces of litigation that it engaged in. Of course, you can’t talk about Brown without mentioning the Honorable Thurgood Marshall, who was the lead counsel in the Brown case who went on to become a Justice on the Supreme Court. The Brown case has transformed American life. It desegregated and integrated American society, the economic order, and the political order as well. I am blessed to be here because of 
Brown v. Board of Education, and my hope is that we will understand that desegregation and integration are here now—and we will fight for them—but we have to also understand that we can go from desegregation to resegregation. We must be careful, we must vigilant, and we must protect the gains that we have made. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES AT THE VA The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ) for 30 minutes. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor this evening primarily to talk about issues and opportunities at the VA and the successful confirmation of our new Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Dr. David Shulkin, but I would be remiss in not thanking my colleague from Texas (Mr. GREEN ) for his powerful words about the NAACP and the profoundly positive impact that they have had on this country and on our ability to make the most of the potential that we have in every single community in the United States. Mr. GREEN is well aware of the inordinate pride that I have in the community I represent of El Paso, Texas, and how the first chapter of the NAACP was started in El Paso, Texas, through the good work of Dr. Lawrence Nixon, who also has the distinction of having been the man who effectively desegregated voting in the State of Texas, ending the allWhite primary which had prevailed following Reconstruction in our State, much to our lasting shame. But to our immense pride, he was the man and our community was the place where that successful fight began. As Mr. GREEN also knows, because I had the pleasure and honor of joining him in a Special Order not too long ago, El Paso also was the home of Thelma White, who, along with some other young, courageous El Pasoans, had gone to the allAfricanAmerican high school, Douglass High School, in El Paso. They attempted to enroll in Texas Western College, now known as the University of Texas at El Paso, but were denied entry simply based on the color of their skin. Thanks to the NAACP and one of their most promising attorneys, Thurgood Marshall, they were able to take this case to a Federal bench, in fact, the bench of R.E. Thompson, who also happens to be an El Pasoan, whose ruling not only ruled in their favor, but effectively desegregated higher education in the State of Texas at that time and forever more. So I just want to add my thanks and my support for an outstanding organization and the very positive impact that they have had on the State that I call home and the community that I am so lucky to serve and to represent. I thank the gentleman from Texas for staying just a little bit longer. Mr. Speaker, I am also here today to thank my colleagues in the Senate, who, 100–0, yesterday confirmed the President’s nomination of Dr. David Shulkin to be the next Secretary of the VA at what I think is the most critical moment in the history of that critically important organization. We all know of the severe challenges that the VA and the veterans whom it purports to serve face today. We know of the challenges in serviceconnected disability claim wait times—in the appeals that are made to those claims when the judgment or the ruling is not in favor of the veteran in question or there is an error in that judgment or some additional information needs to be added—and wait times in appeals that last not days or weeks or months, but measured in years. We know about challenges in wait times for those veterans who are seeking to get an appointment with a primary care physician, a specialty care physician, or, I think most critically, at a time when 20 veterans a day in this country—and that is a conservative estimate, 20 veterans a day—are taking their own lives, severe wait times to see a mental health care provider. Those are among the most important challenges that we as a Congress and those of us who serve on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee face today. So, again, I am grateful for the Senate’s work on this issue in confirming Dr. Shulkin. I have got to say, despite some deep disagreements, differences, and disappointments with the current administration, I am grateful to this President for the public good he has done in nominating Dr. Shulkin, a man who has served in previous roles as CEO of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, chair of medicine at Drexel University College of Medicine, and beginning in the summer of 2015, the Under Secretary for the Veterans Health Administration, where he hit the ground running and began working on the challenges before us, providing solutions to them nationally and in our individual congressional districts on the ground working with the teams there both at the VA, in the public and private sector, and with the various Representatives who brought these issues to his attention. So I could not be more grateful for his service, and I want to speak about that a little bit more. I also want to acknowledge that we have some excellent leadership on both the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee and here in the House, where Dr. PHILROEof Tennessee is taking the helm as the chairman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee—he, himself, a medical doctor; he, himself, a veteran; and he, himself, someone who chose to serve on the committee as just one member of that committee in the years leading up to his selection by his colleagues as a chairman. I know from talking with him that he has big plans, significant and defined goals, and he is willing to work on a bipartisan basis to make sure that we achieve them. I am really looking forward to the ability to work with him. He is joined by returning Members who have sought position on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Now, for those who don’t know, for too long, the Veterans’ Affairs Committee was seen as a backwater or a basement. It wasn’t a place where an aspiring Member of Congress with ambitions went to do her or his work. This was a place they were relegated to when they couldn’t make it on to a bigger or better committee. That was the old conventional wisdom. These days, I am proud to report, the Veterans’ Affairs Committee is a place of distinction, where Members serve with pride, where we ask to join that committee, as I did after I was elected in 2012, so we can tackle some of the most difficult challenges before this Congress and, certainly, this country: how we ensure that we deliver the best care to the 20 millionplus veterans who have put their lives on the line and served this country in a way that no other American has, in a way that ensures that we have the America that so many of us take for granted, veterans whose service dates back to World War II and leads up to those who are just returning from Afghanistan, Iraq, and many places all over the world where we have U.S. servicemembers stationed in more than 140 countries today. Ensuring that we fulfill our obligations to them, whether it is post9/11 GI Bill educational and workforce benefits, whether it is access to quality and consistent health care or ensuring that we quickly, effectively, and successfully respond to claims made after there is a serviceconnected disability incurred in service, we need to get these things right. The future of our country depends on it, our honor depends on it, and the commitments that we have made and the obligations that we have incurred as a country to these veterans, all that depends on our successful completion of that work. So I am grateful for the Members who have chosen to serve on that committee; I am grateful for our chairman; and I am grateful for our ranking member, Mr. TIMWALZof Minnesota, who also happens to be the highest ranking enlisted servicemember to ever serve in the Congress as a command sergeant major, someone who has asked to be on that committee, who has written significant legislation, has ensured that the Clay Hunt SAV Act, for example, became law, which gives us a better opportunity to reduce veteran suicide, which I think is the most critical issue that we can address, that we reduce the number of veterans who are taking their own lives and provide more resources and more help. I will say this about Mr. WALZ: He is someone who puts his country above 
party, the work that he has to do above his own selfadvancement, and I think it is with that attitude, with that character, and with the bipartisan group of House Veterans’ Affairs Committee members that we are going to see great work come out of this committee, great leadership come from Mr. WALZ and his chairman. I am so glad that Mr. WALZhas decided to spend part of his Valentine’s Day evening with me on the floor of the House talking about the great work that lies ahead for us when we try to serve the veterans of this country. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. WALZ). Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from El Paso. I very much appreciate, always, the story and the passion that you have for that great community and look at the leadership that comes out of there. I certainly know in your work for veterans your name will be added to that list. The passion, the willingness to solve problems, the willingness to find and make the tough choices to fulfill this Nation’s commitment to our veterans is something I am just proud to serve alongside you. I would echo the gentleman’s comments, having the opportunity today to witness the swearing in of Dr. David Shulkin as our next VA Secretary, being there with Vice President PENCE  along with Senators ISAKSON and TESTER on the Senate side and Dr. R OE, of whom you spoke very accurately, Mr. O’ROURKE —a true gentleman, an impassioned advocate for veterans, and a nononsense legislator, exactly what we need. b1930 You just have to watch the sense of cando spirit up there and see Dr. Shulkin and his family—with young children—and the sacrifice that goes into public service. This is a gentleman who could make far more money and probably have a lot less headaches if he would continue to serve in the private sector. He chose not to do that for all the right reasons. I think it probably brings us to the message that Mr. O’ROURKE is delivering. This is something that unites this country more than anything else: the care and service to our veterans. It doesn’t matter your political persuasion, it doesn’t matter where you fall on the spectrum, it doesn’t matter what you necessarily think of the wars or the conflicts that we are engaged in, but the care for those veterans is something that my folks in Mankato, Minnesota, your folks in El Paso, folks in Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Seattle, and every small town in between want us to get right. They want us to use the data to deliver the benefits that were earned. They want us to get it right to show that this Nation’s commitment is not something that is fleeting or comes and goes. I think most people understand this is a complex issue. Again, I was reading recently—to put this into perspective—when they make this promise, when they raise their hand to serve this Nation, they are in it for the long haul. The Veterans Benefits Administration is still paying out $73 a month to the daughter of a Civil War veteran. 152 two years after the end of that conflict, this Nation still needs to keep its commitment. So, when you go to war, it comes with a long tail attached to it. That long tail attached is doing what President Lincoln asked us to do: care for those who bore the battle, their widow, and their orphan. I think it is within that spirit that I would encourage our constituents, Mr. Speaker, to take an eye and look at what is happening with veterans’ issues. When they don’t believe anything can work, and they believe everything up here is a fight and that we couldn’t agree it is Tuesday today, that is simply not the case. We have good, smart people working for solutions to difficult problems who are in the best interest of this Nation, the best interest of our veterans, and the best interest of taxpayers. I would encourage people not to make rash generalizations. When people say, Oh, nothing works in the VA, that is not true. Many things work in the VA, and many things work very well. But when they don’t, that is an abject failure. When one veteran is left behind or a situation like Phoenix arises, no, that is not good enough, and we can do better. But we have an attitude that we don’t need to keep this commitment to the VA, that we don’t need to do that, or somehow that we are not already using our resources in the private sector. The gentleman, I am sure, will talk about it, but last year, 31 percent of all healthcare needs were delivered in the private sector in feeforservice. When that makes sense, when it is most efficient, when it is most convenient for the veteran, we should deliver that, but with an understanding the VA has a core mission to do research into extremity injuries or things that would not happen, outside of industrial accidents or war. The VA needs to be there. The VA needs to be there to train physicians. The VA needs to be there to make sure we keep that accountability, instead of telling a veteran: You are just on your on. Good luck getting your care. It is in that spirit that I, too, am hopeful. I think it needs to be said to our constituents, Mr. Speaker, and it goes through administration after administration, whether you like the administration or not, the commitment to veterans has to be there. They have got some of it right; they have got some of it wrong. I think there is a responsibility that, in the first choice of this administration in dealing with veterans, I believe they might have picked the one person in this country best suited to do the job for veterans. That says a lot. I think it is important to stress that point, understanding that that Secretary can’t do it alone. Congress writes the laws. This House authorizes the money to make that happen. We have oversight responsibility, and we have partners in our veterans service organizations who are there to help, whether it be the American Legion, whether it be the VFW, the DAV, the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. These are all folks out there who want to keep that commitment to want to help. The gentleman spoke true, and he spoke true from the heart that, at that one time, people may not have seen service on the VA Committee as something as a prize position. The folks who have found themselves there are committed to this, above everything. They are committed to it above party. They are committed above their own personal advancement. On both sides of the aisle, there is a camaraderie that is rarely seen in the press, that is rarely seen by the general public about getting this right. I think there is much that can be restored. If anything, I oftentimes say how we conduct ourselves in this people’s House of Representatives must be a direct reflection on the sacrifice that gives us the right to self govern. Those who paid the ultimate sacrifice were doing it so that citizens could elect their Representatives to debate the issues of the day in a free and open democracy. So just the exercise tonight of having the opportunity and the privilege to share a little of the floor was given to us at great sacrifice. We need to conduct ourselves in a bipartisan, resultsoriented manner that honors that commitment. I thank the gentleman from El Paso and look forward to his leadership as our ranking member on subcommittees that are coming up on issues that will affect employees at the VA and delivery of care. I know they are in good hands. As I say it again, I love the stories of El Paso from such an impassioned son of El Paso. I think your constituents should be proud you are there. Mr. O’ROURKE. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota and the ranking member of the full committee of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee for being here tonight and talking about not just our challenges, but some of the hope and opportunity that we have ahead with this new Secretary for the VA, this new leadership on the committee, and this renewed commitment from this Congress and this country to do the right thing by her veterans. I am so glad, Mr. Speaker, that he mentioned the necessity to ensure the longtime health and viability of the VA. There has been some talk about privatizing the VA and of just essentially asking our veterans to go find their own doctors and their own medical providers in the communities in which they live, no longer having the VA as the core of the delivery of care that they have depended on for so long. I think it is important that Secretary Shulkin, in his confirmation 
hearing, said that he would never be part of privatizing the VA, at least not on his watch, at least not during his tenure. While there are opportunities to capitalize on care in the community, as the ranking member said, only at the VA will we have doctors, nurses, providers, and frontline staff, many of whom are, by the way, themselves veterans who have uniquely cared for other veterans, know the signs to look for when we are trying to reduce veteran suicide, know specifically how to treat posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, traumatic amputations—the kinds of conditions that don’t typically occur in the civilian population and that we don’t see at our general privatepublic hospitals, but are unique to the VA and unique to military medicine, where we uniquely will ensure that our veterans and military retirees get worldclass care from those who are uniquely trained to deliver that to ensure the best outcomes. While we should never shy from the shortcomings or the challenges within the VA—and there are plenty of them— I think it is really important to reiterate how often we are successful in seeing veterans whose care depends upon a doctor or a provider at the VA who leaves that appointment grateful for the time that they were able to spend there, grateful for the care they received, and grateful for the fact that there is a VA. This last week, on Friday—it was a few days early—we took some Valentine’s Day cards made by elementary school students at LBJ Elementary in El Paso to veterans at the VA. I was joined by Colonel Mike Amaral, the new permanent director of the El Paso VA, formerly chief of staff at William Beaumont Army Medical Center. We shook hands with veterans, shook hands with frontline staff, shook hands with nurses and providers at the VA, thanking them for their service, wishing them an early happy Valentine’s Day. To each veteran either coming in or leaving the VA, I asked them what their experience was like in either making an appointment, if they were on their way in, or how their appointment went when they were on their way out. As the ranking member knows, the veterans who we represent are never shy about sharing the truth and the facts of their experience with the VA. We hear the good, we hear the bad, we hear the ugly. At the El Paso VA on Friday, for every veteran who had been seen by a doctor, the story was a positive one. For every veteran going in to see a doctor, the story was a positive one. It doesn’t mean that every single veteran’s story in El Paso is positive. Let’s acknowledge that some appointments are dropped. Sometimes the phone isn’t answered. Sometimes an appointment is made and the doctor is not there to see the veteran. All of those circumstances are unacceptable. I know Colonel Amaral feels the way I do. I know Secretary Shulkin feels the way I do. I know every single Member of Congress feels the way I do. But let’s remember that the vast majority of veterans are able to be seen, are getting great health care at the VA, and, for the most part, when they are referred to care in the community when a doctor is unavailable at the VA, when a psychiatrist is not able to see that veteran for a behavioral health appointment and referred to a provider in the community, most of those right now are working well. Not perfectly, not all the time. There is work before us that we must do, and it is critically important, but I am making the point that the VA needs to maintain the core of delivery of care to our veterans. We can add to that core the providers in our communities, public hospitals, private hospitals, clinics, doctors, those who want to step up at not great profit to themselves. The rates that they are reimbursed are just at or less than Medicare, but they do it because they want to do their part to continue to serve this country, to serve veterans who stood up, put their lives on the line, and ensured that we have the United States that we are so grateful for today. So I think that is a positive situation on which we can build with the right team here in Congress, at our local VAs, and with our new Secretary. I will tell you a story about Secretary Shulkin. Shortly after he was named Under Secretary of Veterans Health Administration, I brought to his attention the suicide crisis that we have in El Paso among El Paso veterans, in Texas, and in the United States, where we now know that today, by VA’s latest estimate, 20 veterans are taking their own lives. The old estimate was 22. It was based on incomplete data. All 50 States’ basis for the new numbers shows us that we are at 20. That is too many. It is unacceptable. It has to become our number one priority. Unless it is, we won’t reduce that number, we won’t save more lives, we won’t prevent more preventable deaths. I shared with Dr. Shulkin that, after hearing from veteran after veteran after veteran, while generally their care received in the VA was excellent— when they were there, they were treated like a king or a queen—too often, when they were seeking a behavioral health appointment, mental health care appointment, maybe related to posttraumatic disorder, maybe a Vietnamera veteran who had successfully bottled his trauma, experiences for 40, 45, 50 years who was now coming to terms when he reached certain crossroads in his life with that trauma and needed to speak to someone, too often they were not able to get in to see somebody at the VA. So we conducted a scientific, objective, thirdparty survey of veterans in El Paso, and we found—with a margin of error less than 4 percent, so this is pretty conclusive—that more than a third of veterans in our community could not get in to see a mental health care provider when, at that time, the prescribed 2 weeks, not within 30 days, not within a year. Just not ever. We know for a fact that care delayed becomes care denied. It leads to terrible outcomes. At a minimum, unnecessary suffering for that veteran; at worst, preventable deaths. Veterans taking their own lives. So I brought this issue to Dr. Shulkin’s attention. I told him this community had rallied around our veterans in El Paso, Texas, and that the VA providers there, the public hospital, University Medical Center; Del Sol Hospital; Providence Hospital; Mentis Neurological Rehabilitation Center, another private facility; all of these folks wanted to come together to see if they could fill the gap in care and coverage that the VA was unable to meet. But we needed some leadership from the VA. We needed them to take a chance on a model that had never been tried before. We wanted Dr. Shulkin and the VHA to get behind a pilot program in El Paso that would allow us to take some of these matters into our own hands, where, despite the best intentions and significantly increased funding from the VA in El Paso, we still weren’t able to see veterans who desperately need care. Dr. Shulkin reviewed the proposal with us, made some suggested changes, and within 4 months of having been sworn in as Under Secretary of VHA, he was able to help us get this pilot program approved, underway, with a collaboration with Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso, after finding that the best performing VAs in the country are associated with academic teaching institutions. He made that partnership with Texas Tech possible. He made referring care out into the community where we didn’t have the doctors in the VA possible. He ensured that at the VA we continue to concentrate on those areas of excellence—on service and combat connected disabilities and conditions that we don’t see in the general population that, more than anything else, makes the case for the VA: for strengthening the VA, for ensuring that it is not there just today, but forever. As long as we have a country, we should have a VA that performs at the high levels in those areas where veterans need it most—posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, traumatic amputation, military sexual trauma—those conditions that are unique to service and to combat. b1945 So I am really encouraged that we have him now as the Secretary of the full VA. I am really encouraged that we have the leadership like Mr. WALZ and Dr. ROEin the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs in the House. I am really 
encouraged by the leadership that we see on the Senate side, and I have got to tell you—and I am sure that Mr. WALZ would agree with me—we have leadership out in every single community in this country, from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, from the Vietnam Veterans of America, from the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, from the Disabled American Veterans, from the Paralyzed Veterans of America, from every single veterans service organization, too many to mention in the time that I have allotted today, who put the pressure, provide the solutions, make trips up to Washington, D.C., as they will this next week, to ensure that they are holding us accountable for the terrific responsibility that we have before us, and that we perform against that responsibility and that we perform against the goals that we have set—very ambitious, but achievable goals—for this country and every single veteran who has served who lives in this country who we have a sacred obligation to today. I am encouraged that this committee, this Congress, this country works on a bipartisan—or let’s just say a nonpartisan—basis to get that work done. We are introducing two bills tomorrow, for example, both with Republican cosponsors. The first bill is the Veteran Prescription Continuity Act with Representative MIKE COFFMAN  from Colorado and Representative WALTER JONES from North Carolina. That bill, if made into law, will ensure that veterans who were dependent on the care provided in part through prescriptions prescribed while they were Active Duty servicemembers at a military treatment facility are still able to receive those prescriptions as veterans. A lot of folks don’t know this, but we don’t have a unified formulary between DOD and VA. Some veterans, some prescriptions get dropped along the way. Here is a nobrainer, quick bipartisan fix to that part of the problem. The other bill is the Mental Health Care Provider Retention Act, also introduced with WALTER JONES from North Carolina. This ensures at a time of crisis when it comes to veteran suicide that if you are an Active Duty servicemember and you are receiving good treatment at a military treatment facility for posttraumatic stress disorder, for example, or other mental health issues, that if the VA cannot continue that care because we don’t have enough psychiatrists or psychologists—we are 45,000 clinical positions short in the VA today—if you are getting good care in the Department of Defense military treatment facility and there is not that care for you on the VA side as you transition out and separate in a given community like El Paso, that you will be able to continue to receive quality mental health care treatment at that military treatment facility. Again, this isn’t going to solve every access problem. It is not going to, in itself, reduce or solve the suicide crisis we have amongst veterans, but it is a commonsense, bipartisan approach that makes things a little bit better, that ensures that we have more access for more veterans and begin to take more steps toward reducing veteran suicide. Mr. Speaker, I am very encouraged today by the opportunities before us, by the leadership that is ready to take on that work, and with the opportunity I have to join these leaders to ensure that we fulfill every commitment that we have to every veteran in America. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f
