FAREWELL SPEECH (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, it has been the honor of my life to have served 10 years in this body, and I want to take this occasion to thank the amazing and talented staff that has worked both in our congressional office here in Washington as well as in Ft. Collins and Boulder and in Adams and Summit Counties. I want to thank all of the interns who have lent their services over the last decade, on behalf of the people of the Second Congressional District, hopefully providing them with a great experience that furthers their interest in public affairs. And, of course, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. The men and women I have come to know and have worked with in the last decade have been some of the most important relationships of my life. I truly believe that there is no problem so large that the deliberative and thoughtful minds in this body can’t rise to the occasion and solve all the pressing issues. It has been sad to see that, all too often, things stand in the way of that progress, whether it is partisanship, yes, but not only partisanship, the role of the special interests, and the increasingly divided electorate that we have nationally. 
But I know that the men and women of this body and in the next Congress, the 116th Congress, will hopefully come together to solve a lot of the pressing issues that affect our country and the world. Whether it is making sure that kids grow up with a good education, that families have access to affordable healthcare, or protecting our environment for ourselves and future generations, I know that the men and women in this body will be able to rise to that occasion. It truly has been an amazing honor to have worked with so many terrific people from all over this country, authentically representing their constituents and their districts. I look forward to taking this decade of service to our Nation with me throughout the rest of my life, wherever I go, to help inform the decisions I make to do the very best job that I can, every day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the honor of serving in the United States Congress for a decade. I look forward to continuing to work with future United States Congresses.

PRAYER The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today’s opening prayer will be offered by Dr. Tommy Middleton, director of the Baptist Association of Greater Baton Rouge, from Baton Rouge, LA. The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer: Good morning. Let’s pray. Father, we are grateful for this life and health and strength that You have given us so that we may serve You and serve others, so thankful for Your hand of blessing and favor that is rested upon this Nation. And, O God, may that continue. So, Lord, we pray for these Senators, that, Lord, You would give them wisdom in the decisions they make and the crafting of legislation; Lord, that You would give them compassion as they deal with others—fellow Senators, legislators, elected officials, constituents; and that You would give them courage to make decisions based upon truth. Although there might be opposition, Lord, may they stay people of truth. Father, I do pray that You give them discernment so that in the deliberations they make, they will judge a righteous judgment. Finally, O Lord, that we would walk in humility, realizing that the decisions we make, the course of our walk, our actions in our lives will be judged by those who have elected us here, but more than that, we will be judged by You, Almighty God. Lord, we pray, we desire, we seek Your help, and, as Your Word says, our help is in the Name of the Lord, the maker of Heaven and Earth, and in that Name, the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen.
