Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of a native son of Baltimore, Maryland, Mr. Reginald F. Lewis. Let me also acknowledge the presence of many of the Lewis family members in the gallery, including his mother, Carolyn; widow, Loida; daughter, Leslie; and brother, Anthony. From November 30 to December 1, 1987, 30 years ago, Mr. Lewis negotiated the $985 million leveraged buyout of Beatrice International Foods. At the time, it was the largest leveraged buyout of an American company’s overseas assets, and it led to the creation of what the New York Times identified in 1993 as the largest corporation in the United States led by an African American. Mr. Lewis’ accomplishments changed the face of American business forever and opened new doors of opportunity on Wall Street. His substantial philanthropic gifts have also continued to benefit Baltimore and, indeed, the Nation. They help young Americans of color to dream bigger, and in Lewis’ own words, to ‘‘keep on going, no matter what.’’ I invite everyone to join me in celebrating and honoring Reginald Lewis’ memory and extraordinary accomplishments. 
CONGRATULATING NORTH HUNTERDON WOMEN’S CROSS COUNTRY TEAM (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an important athletic achievement in New Jersey’s Seventh Congressional District. The North Hunterdon High School women’s cross country team won the State Meet of 
Champions. The North Hunterdon Lions are an historic and distinguished program, winning seven State cross country championships over the years. I commend these young women on their athletic achievement. I can only imagine how proud their parents and families must be. It is encouraging that the hard work of these young women has been rewarded with success. Their perseverance and commitment should be commended. I also express my heartfelt congratulations to their coach, Sean Walsh. With Coach Walsh’s steadfast leadership, the North Hunterdon women’s cross country team was able to realize its full athletic potential. And these young women are distinguished academically as well. Congratulations to all who were involved. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, last week, FCC Chairman Pai circulated his plan to extinguish the most important technological achievement in modern history: the free and open internet. His plan guts the 2015 open internet rules and removes the FCC as the cop on the beat to protect consumers online. Without protections against blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization, there will be nothing to stop ISPs from slowing or blocking a website or charging consumers more to access certain content. It would allow ISPs to pick winners and losers by charging small businesses tolls to reach potential customers online, and they will be able to control the flow of information on the internet. Millions of Americans cheered for the 2015 rules to protect the open internet, rules that have been upheld by the courts. With those rules in place, ISPs have been less likely to mess with content. Meanwhile, investment in the online ecosystem continues to grow with innovative new apps and more buildout of broadband. I stand here in opposition to Chairman Pai’s plan, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. The internet belongs to all of us, not just the big ISPs. SHERIFF HARVEY GJESDAL RETIRES (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sheriff Harvey Gjesdal of Douglas County, Washington, for his significant contributions to the safety of the constituents in the Fourth District and to congratulate him on his recently announced retirement. Sheriff Gjesdal has served in Washington State law enforcement for over 30 years. He began his career in 1985, at the Garfield County Sheriff’s Office, and he spent 8 years in the Bellevue Police Department before landing in Douglas County in 1995. He was promoted to sergeant in 2000 and elected to his current position in 2006. Additionally, he served in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve for 26 years, where he was activated four times, including two tours in the Middle East. For the last 22 years, Sheriff Gjesdal has been promoting safety and building strong relationships in central Washington. I am thankful for his leadership and compassion, and I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating him on a successful career. f 
TAX BILL (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, today 9 million children are at risk of losing their access to healthcare and millions of parents are losing sleep as funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program expires. Community health centers across the country are at risk of steep cuts, forcing them to lay off medical professionals and turn away thousands of patients as their funding expires. DREAMers, who know no other home than America, are at risk of deportation as their DACA status expires. Military families, who serve a nation at war, are at risk of going without pay as government funding expires. But instead of passing legislation to ensure children have access to healthcare, to keep community health centers open, to protect our DREAMers, and to support military families, the majority is too focused on cutting taxes for the wealthiest individuals in America. This is a shameful failure to act in the best interests of the American people. 
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS MONTH (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, today kicks off International Human Rights Month, a celebration of the inalienable rights to which everyone is entitled. This coming year marks the 70th anniversary of the date the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations, a document which has been translated into more than 500 languages. This week, we examine the perils of human trafficking, which, at its core, is a violation of fundamental human rights and is far too prevalent around the globe. As vice chair of the International Religious Freedom Caucus, I am saddened by the atrocities occurring around the globe in which people of all faiths are persecuted. We cannot turn a blind eye to injustice. America must remain a beacon of principled courage, recognizing and promoting the basic human rights of all people. If we remain silent in the face of these transgressions, we neglect that moral imperative, and we do so at the peril of civil society. f 
REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN (Mr. GOMEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, from California to New York and everywhere in between, the Republican tax scam steals from working class families to give the top 1 percent and large corporations a massive tax break. The Republican plan eliminates deductions like State and local taxes, mortgage interest rates, medical expenses, and student loan interest that working families rely on. This bill will only increase income inequality in our country, where the rich get richer and those in the middle class and those struggling to get into the middle class are left further and further behind. I can’t believe anyone would vote for such a bill. Either you know what is in it and you don’t care about the consequences of your vote, or you don’t and you will still vote for it anyway. I don’t know which one is worse. To the Republicans who care about the deficit only when Democrats are in power, you have lost all credibility when it comes to this issue. I hope the American people will remember who voted for this bill. 
ORGANIC PRODUCTION IS GROWING IN PENNSYLVANIA (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week I had the opportunity to meet with a number of organic farmers to discuss the upcoming farm bill and its impact on organic production. In recent years, organic production has continued to grow in Pennsylvania, 
Pennsylvania being the second largest State for organic production, and in many other States. There are a number of programs authorized in the farm bill, including Beginning Farmers and Ranchers, that help provide financial assistance and planning assistance for new farmers and farms. Access to programs such as these is essential for supporting the next generation of farmers and growing American agriculture. As it relates to organic, the farm bill contains numerous provisions and programs tailored to organic producers. This includes conservation assistance through EQIP Organic Initiative, the Market Access Program, Organic Agriculture Research and Extension, and competitive grants. The Horticulture title also includes the National Organic Certification Cost Share, marketing and data collection, the Organic Program, and the Organic CheckOff Program. Mr. Speaker, supporting agriculture of all forms through the farm bill is critically important for the industry, rural communities, and, quite frankly, all Americans. 
b0915 HELP VETERANS EXPOSED TO TOXIC BURN PITS (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, Congress must act to help our veterans exposed to burn pits and must act now. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the military used burn pits to get rid of huge piles of trash, exposing our men and women in uniform to toxic chemicals and carcinogens in the air and soil—veterans like my constituent and my friend Jennifer Kepner, a mother who died from pancreatic cancer in October 2017. That is why I urge a vote on H.R. 1279, the Helping Veterans Exposed to Burn Pits Act that I support and cosponsor. This bipartisan bill will create a center of excellence within the VA that will help diagnose, treat, and rehabilitate veterans who were exposed. Veterans will be served by staff with specialty expertise needed to address the kinds of health conditions those exposed now suffer. This bill also directs the VA and DOD to establish a program to train their health providers to treat veterans exposed and to study the longterm effects of exposure. So I urge all of my colleagues to support this critical bill and bring it to a vote immediately to help save our veterans lives. 
PRESERVING ACCESS TO MANUFACTURED HOUSING ACT OF 2017 Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 635, I call up the bill (H.R. 1699) to amend the Truth in Lending Act to modify the definitions of a mortgage originator and a highcost mortgage, to amend the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 to modify the definition of a loan originator, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 635, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–42 is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is considered read. The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: H.R. 1699 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2017’’. 
(a) M ORTGAGE ORIGINATOR DEFINITION .—Sec tion 103 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1602) is amended— (1) by redesignating the second subsection (cc) and subsection (dd) as subsections (dd) and (ee), respectively; and (2) in paragraph (2)(C) of subsection (dd), as so redesignated, by striking ‘‘an employee of a retailer of manufactured homes who is not described in clause (i) or (iii) of subparagraph (A) and who does not advise a consumer on loan terms (including rates, fees, and other costs)’’ and inserting ‘‘a retailer of manufactured or modular homes or its employees unless such retailer or its employees receive compensation or gain for engaging in activities described in subparagraph (A) that is in excess of any compensation or gain received in a comparable cash transaction’’. (b) LOAN ORIGINATOR DEFINITION .—Section 1503(4)(A) of the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (12 U.S.C. 5102(4)(A)) is amended— (1) in clause (iii), by striking ‘‘and’’ at the end; (2) in clause (iv), by striking the period at the end and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and (3) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(v) does not include a retailer of manufactured or modular homes or its employees unless such retailer or its employees receive compensation or gain for engaging in activities described in clause (i) that is in excess of any compensation or gain received in a comparable cash transaction.’’. 
Section 103 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1602) is amended— (1) by redesignating subsection (aa) (relating to disclosure of greater amount or percentage), as so designated by section 1100A of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, as subsection (bb); (2) by redesignating subsection (bb) (relating to highcost mortgages), as so designated by section 1100A of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, as subsection (aa), and moving such subsection to immediately follow subsection (z); and (3) in subsection (aa)(1)(A), as so redesignated— (A) in clause (i)(I), by striking ‘‘(8.5 percentage points, if the dwelling is personal property and the transaction is for less than $50,000)’’ and inserting ‘‘(10 percentage points if the dwelling is personal property or is a transaction that does not include the purchase of real property on which a dwelling is to be placed, and the transaction is for less than $75,000 (as such amount is adjusted by the Bureau to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index))’’; and (B) in clause (ii)— (i) in subclause (I), by striking ‘‘or’’ at the end; and (ii) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(III) notwithstanding subclauses (I) and (II), in the case of a transaction for less than $75,000 (as such amount is adjusted by the Bureau to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index) in which the dwelling is personal property (or is a consumer credit transaction that does not include the purchase of real property on which a dwelling is to be placed) the greater of 5 percent of the total transaction amount or $3,000 (as such amount is adjusted by the Bureau to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index); or’’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. HENSARLING ) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 1699, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act. It is an important bill that is cosponsored by a bipartisan—I repeat, bipartisan— group of members, and it was approved by the Financial Services Committee with a strong bipartisan vote of 42–18. In fact, this proposal has a long track record of bipartisan support with a similar bill having passed the last Congress with votes from both Republicans and Democrats. I want to thank my colleague, Representative BARR, the chairman of our Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee for his leadership in introducing this legislation and for leading congressional efforts to help Americans, particularly those of lower and moderate incomes, to help them achieve a greater level of financial independence and being able to achieve their American Dream of homeownership. Here is the problem, Mr. Speaker. Under the CFPB’s regulations, many smallbalance manufactured home loans are now being considered ‘‘high cost.’’ This means that many people, particularly those with lower and moderate incomes who want to buy a manufactured home, aren’t able to buy that home. Their access to credit is being unfairly restricted through no fault of their own. Lenders are leaving the market. Five County Credit Union in 
Maine, Zia Credit Union in New Mexico, Manhattan Bank in Montana, and the list goes on and on and on. Lenders are leaving the market. As we know, many consumers who live in rural areas, including those in the Fifth District of Texas who I have the pleasure and honor of representing, they just don’t have access to rental options or other affordable housing. So the CFPB rules are unfairly penalizing rural residents and working families, many of whom happen to be retirees, single moms, working families, veterans, and they simply want to buy a manufactured home that they can live in. They are being denied that opportunity. So here in Washington, inside the very elite beltway bubble, there is simply not an appreciation for manufactured housing and the role that plays in our vital affordable housing component. But let’s listen to what the American people tell us outside of the beltway. A 75yearold retiree from Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, said he purchased a manufactured home because ‘‘it was affordable, and it was in a desirable location.’’ A 57yearold single mom from Albuquerque, New Mexico, purchased a manufactured home. She said: ‘‘It provided the best value for the money. There were no other housing options available. I searched for over a year to find affordable housing. All of the site built homes in the area were over $100,000, which was out of my price range.’’ Manufactured housing is within the price range of many working Americans. A 28yearold single mom of two from Jenera, Ohio, she had been renting. She wanted her own home. And when she purchased it, she said, she ‘‘found this, allowed us to own a home for less than we would have to pay to rent another.’’ Stories like this are commonplace all over America, Mr. Speaker. And it is why it is so important that we recognize the rights of our fellow citizens to give them the opportunity of affordable housing. You can’t protect consumers by protecting them out of their homes. Manufactured housing is affordable housing. So we have a regulation from an agency that is supposed to be protecting consumers, but, instead, it is preventing families from purchasing affordable housing. We must change that. We have to pass this bipartisan bill, H.R. 1699. With just a few minor clarifications to the definition of mortgage originator, loan originator, and high cost mortgage, this bill will ensure that consumers of smallbalance mortgage loans have access to the mortgage credit they need. These minor technical clarifications will help preserve consumer choice and financing options for those seeking to buy a manufactured home. Now, some on the other side of the aisle will say: Well, this eviscerates important consumer protections. Well, number one, loans under this bill will still be covered by the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the ability to repay rules, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and all of the consumer protection laws passed by the various States. So let’s support working Americans. Let’s support affordable housing. Let’s support Mr. BARR’s H.R. 1699. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1699 which would undermine the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and eliminate consumer protections for some of the country’s most vulnerable borrowers. Mr. Speaker, the title of this bill paints it as a measure that purports to preserve access to manufactured housing. So I want to be very clear about what this bill is and what it is not about, and who will win and who will be harmed if this bill is signed into law. This isn’t about regulatory burdens, reducing access to credit. The lending volume in the manufactured housing industry has gotten back to where it was before the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau put new regulations in place. This isn’t about credit unions and community banks not being able to enter the manufactured housing market. Many credit unions already underwrite mortgage loans and chattel loans for manufactured housing. But what H.R. 1699 is about is onestopshop megainstitutions like Clayton Homes, owned by billionaire Warren Buffett, which has almost half of the market share for manufactured housing lending. His manufactured housing empire profits in every imaginable way in this sector from producing housing, to selling housing, to originating the loans that take advantage of vulnerable customers and leave them with virtually no way to refinance. This bill makes it easier for financial titans like billionaire Warren Buffett to earn even more profits at the expense of some of the most vulnerable consumers in this country. I show this ad because they would have you believe that Clayton Homes is separate from all of the other entities that they have under Clayton Homes. One would think that, simply, Clayton Homes is the seller of these mortgages. But they are under different names. They are under Vanderbilt. They are under HomeFirst. They are under Benjamin Moore, and they are under Oakwood Homes. So sometimes people think perhaps, if they are not getting the kind of service that they want when they are looking for a mortgage, that they will go to some other place other than Clayton. But they end up literally going to other entities owned by Clayton Homes. This is a Warren Buffett bill. This is a Clayton bill. And to tell you the truth, this institution is not in the business of originating legislation for one particular business. This is what this is all about. And I will show you how they do it. They have different names on their operations, but the ads all look the same. ‘‘We will beat the match. We will beat the match.’’ Same ads for Tru Value and the other entities owned by them, but they all belong to Warren Buffett and Clayton. This bill, again, would harm manufactured housing consumers who are typically more vulnerable than the average homeowner. They are lowincome buyers, rural buyers, minority buyers. And reports from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Manufactured Housing Institute, and the Center for Public Integrity have all shown us that this measure would not create access to affordable housing; but it would, instead, allow an incredibly profitable industry to make even more money at the expense of lowincome and rural homeowners, even if the industry itself asserts that it has been growing and highly profitable, even in the years after DoddFrank, and the Consumer Bureau’s mortgage protections have been in place. So just take a look at this. If you take a look back what was happening in 2003, where they had 18 percent share in the market, now they have 39 percent. This is all Clayton, 39 percent. And their portfolio includes about $12.5 billion in customers. So I would like to just reiterate again that this is about Warren Buffett and this is about Clayton. Let me just share with you that Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett has also been touting its postDoddFrank Act profitability of manufactured housing. Clayton Homes is Berkshire’s highly profitable manufactured housing subsidy, and it earned a total of $744 million in 2016, a 33 percent increase over 2014. Yes, that is a 33 percent increase after the DoddFrank Act rules were in place. Unfortunately, this is the same Clayton Homes that was the subject of a multipart Seattle Times and Center for Public Integrity joint investigation. Mr. Speaker, The Seattle Times did a scathing series on Clayton. I include in the RECORD these articles that were done by The Seattle Times. Everyone should avail themselves of this damaging information. 
[From the Seattle Times] THEMOBILE HOMETRAP: HOW A WARREN  BUFFETT EMPIRE PREYS ON THE POOR (By Mike Baker and Daniel Wagner) 
FIRST OF A SERIES  EPHRATA , GRANT COUNTY .—After years of living in a 1963 travel trailer, Kirk and Patricia Ackley found a permanent house with enough space to host grandkids and care for her aging father suffering from dementia. 
So, as the pilot cars prepared to guide the factorybuilt home up from Oregon in May 2006, the Ackleys were elated to finalize paperwork waiting for them at their loan broker’s kitchen table. But the closing documents he set before them held a surprise: The promised 7 percent interest rate was now 12.5 percent, with monthly payments of $1,100, up from $700. The terms were too extreme for the Ackleys. But they’d already spent $11,000, at the dealer’s urging, for a concrete foundation to accommodate this specific home. They could look for other financing but desperately needed a space to care for her father. Kirk’s construction job and Patricia’s Wal Mart job together weren’t enough to afford the new monthly payment. But, they said, the broker was willing to inflate their income in order to qualify them for the loan. ‘‘You just need to remember,’’ they recalled him saying, ‘‘you can refinance as soon as you can.’’ To their regret, the Ackleys signed. The disastrous deal ruined their finances and nearly their marriage. But until informed recently by a reporter, they didn’t realize that the homebuilder (Golden West), the dealer (Oakwood Homes) and the lender (21st Mortgage) were all part of a single company: Clayton Homes, the nation’s biggest homebuilder, which is controlled by its secondrichest man—Warren Buffett. Buffett’s mobilehome empire promises lowincome Americans the dream of homeownership. But Clayton relies on predatory sales practices, exorbitant fees, and interest rates that can exceed 15 percent, trapping many buyers in loans they can’t afford and in homes that are almost impossible to sell or refinance, an investigation by The Seattle Times and Center for Public Integrity has found. Berkshire Hathaway, the investment conglomerate Buffett leads, bought Clayton in 2003 and spent billions building it into the mobilehome industry’s biggest manufacturer and lender. Today, Clayton is a many headed hydra with companies operating under at least 18 names, constructing nearly half of the industry’s new homes and selling them through its own retailers. It finances more mobilehome purchases than any other lender by a factor of six. It also sells property insurance on them and repossesses them when borrowers fail to pay. Berkshire extracts value at every stage of the process. Clayton even builds the homes with materials—such as paint and carpeting—supplied by other Berkshire subsidiaries. 
CLAYTON ALWAYS PROFITS  More than a dozen Clayton customers described a consistent array of deceptive practices that locked them into ruinous deals: loan terms that changed abruptly after they paid deposits or prepared land for their new homes; surprise fees tacked on to loans; and pressure to take on excessive payments based on false promises that they could later refinance. Former dealers said the company encouraged them to steer buyers to finance with Clayton’s own highinterest lenders. Under federal guidelines, most Clayton mobilehome loans are considered ‘‘higher priced.’’ Those loans averaged 7 percentage points higher than the typical home loan in 2013, according to a Times/CPI analysis of federal data, compared to just 3.8 percentage points for other lenders. Buyers told of Clayton collection agents urging them to cut back on food and medical care or seek handouts in order to make house payments. And when homes got hauled off to be resold, some consumers already had paid so much in fees and interest that the company still came out ahead. Even through the Great Recession and housing crisis, Clayton was profitable every year, generating $558 million in pretax earnings in 2014. The company’s tactics contrast with Buffett’s public profile as a financial sage who values responsible lending and helping poor Americans keep their homes. Berkshire Hathaway spokeswoman Carrie Sova and Clayton spokeswoman Audrey Saunders ignored more than a dozen requests by phone, email and in person to discuss Clayton’s policies and treatment of consumers. In an emailed statement, Saunders said Clayton helps customers find homes within their budgets and has a ‘‘purpose of opening doors to a better life, one home at a time.’’ (Update: After publication, Berkshire Hathaway’s Omaha headquarters sent a statement on behalf of Clayton Homes to the Omaha WorldHerald, which is also owned by Berkshire.) FIRST , A DREAM  As Buffett tells it, his purchase of Clayton Homes came from an ‘‘unlikely source’’: Visiting students from the University of Tennessee gave him a copy of founder Jim Clayton’s selfpublished memoir, ‘‘First a Dream,’’ in early 2003. Buffett enjoyed reading the book and admired Jim Clayton’s record, he has said, and soon called CEO Kevin Clayton, offering to buy the company. ‘‘A few phone calls later, we had a deal,’’ Buffett said at his 2003 shareholders meeting, according to notes taken at the meeting by hedgefund manager Whitney Tilson. The tale of serendipitous dealmaking paints Buffett and the Claytons as sharing downtoearth values, antipathy for Wall Street and an oldfashioned belief in treating people fairly. But, in fact, the man who brought the students to Omaha said Clayton’s book wasn’t the genesis of the deal. ‘‘The Claytons really initiated this contact,’’ said Al Auxier, the Tennessee professor, since retired, who chaperoned the student trip after fostering a relationship with the billionaire. CEO Kevin Clayton, the founder’s son, reached out to Buffett through Auxier, the professor said in a recent interview, and asked whether Buffett might explore ‘‘a business relationship’’ with Clayton Homes. At the time, mobilehome loans had been defaulting at alarming rates, and investors had grown wary of them. Kevin Clayton was seeking a new source of cash to relend to homebuyers. He knew that Berkshire Hathaway, with its perfect bond rating, could provide it as cheaply as anyone. Later that year, Berkshire Hathaway paid $1.7 billion in cash to buy Clayton Homes. Berkshire Hathaway quickly bought up failed competitors’ stores, factories and billions in troubled loans, building Clayton Homes into the industry’s dominant force. In 2013, Clayton provided 39 percent of new mobilehome loans, according to a Times/CPI analysis of federal data that 7,000 home lenders are required to submit. The next biggest lender was Wells Fargo, with just 6 percent of the loans. Clayton provided more than half of new mobilehome loans in eight states. In Texas, the number exceeds 70 percent. Clayton has more than 90 percent of the market in Odessa, one of the most expensive places in the country to finance a mobile home. To maintain its downtoearth image, Clayton has hired the stars of the realityTV show ‘‘Duck Dynasty’’ to appear in ads. The company’s headquarters is a hulking structure of metal sheeting surrounded by acres of parking lots and a beach volleyball court for employees, located a few miles south of Knoxville, Tenn. Next to the front door, there is a slot for borrowers to deposit payments. Near the headquarters, two Clayton sales lots sit three miles from each other. Clayton Homes’ banners promise ‘‘$0 CASH DOWN.’’ TruValue Homes, also owned by Clayton, advertises ‘‘REPOS FOR SALE.’’ Other nearby Clayton lots operate as Luv Homes and Oakwood Homes. With all the different names, many customers believe that they’re shopping around. Housesized banners at dealerships reinforce that impression, proclaiming they will ‘‘BEAT ANY DEAL.’’ In some parts of the country, buyers would have to drive many miles past several Claytonowned lots, to reach a true competitor. GUIDED INTO COSTLY LOANS  Soon after Buffett bought Clayton Homes, he declared a new dawn for the moribund mobilehome industry, which provides housing for some 20 million Americans. Lenders should require ‘‘significant down payments and shorterterm loans,’’ Buffett wrote. He called 30year loans on mobile homes ‘‘a mistake,’’ according to notes Tilson took during Berkshire Hathaway’s 2003 shareholders meeting. ‘‘Home purchases should involve an honesttoGod down payment of at least 10% and monthly payments that can be comfortably handled by the borrower’s income,’’ Buffett later wrote. ‘‘That income should be carefully verified.’’ But in examining more than 100 Clayton home sales through interviews and reviews of loan documents from 41 states, reporters found that the company’s loans routinely violated the lending standards laid out by Buffett. Clayton dealers often sold homes with no cash down payment. Numerous borrowers said they were persuaded to take on outsized payments by dealers promising that they could later refinance. And the average loan term actually increased from 21 years in 2007 to more than 23 years in 2009, the last time Berkshire disclosed that detail. Clayton’s loan to Dorothy Mansfield, a disabled Army veteran who lost her previous North Carolina home to a tornado in 2011, includes key features that Buffett condemned. Mansfield had a lousy credit score of 474, court records show. Although she had seasonal and parttime jobs, her monthly income often consisted of less than $700 in disability benefits. She had no money for a down payment when she visited Clayton Homes in Fayetteville, N.C. Vanderbilt, one of Clayton’s lenders, approved her for a $60,000, 20year loan to buy a Clayton home at 10.13 percent annual interest. She secured the loan with two parcels of land that her family already owned free and clear. The dealer didn’t request any documents to verify Mansfield’s income or employment, records show. Mansfield’s monthly payment of $673 consumed almost all of her guaranteed income. Within 18 months, she was behind on payments and Clayton was trying to foreclose on the home and land. Many borrowers interviewed for this investigation described being steered by Clayton dealers into Clayton financing without realizing the companies were one and the same. Sometimes, buyers said, the dealer described the financing as the best deal available. Other times, the Clayton dealer said it was the only financing option. Kevin Carroll, former owner of a Clayton affiliated dealership in Indiana, said in an interview that he used business loans from a Clayton lender to finance inventory for his lot. If he also guided homebuyers to work 
with the same lender, 21st Mortgage, the company would give him a discount on his business loans—a ‘‘kickback,’’ in his words. Doug Farley, who was a general manager at several Claytonowned dealerships, also used the term ‘‘kickback’’ to describe the profitshare he received on Clayton loans until around 2008. After that, the company changed its incentives to instead provide ‘‘kickbacks’’ on sales of Clayton’s insurance to borrowers, he said. Ed Atherton, a former lot manager in Arkansas, said his regional supervisor was pressuring lot managers to put at least 80 percent of buyers into Clayton financing. Atherton left the company in 2013. During the most recent fouryear period, 93 percent of Clayton’s mobilehome loans had such costly terms that they required extra disclosure under federal rules. Among all other mobilehome lenders, fewer than half of their loans met that threshold. Customers said in interviews that dealers misled them to take on unaffordable loans, with tactics including lastminute changes to loan terms and unexplained fees that inflate loan balances. Such loans are, by definition, predatory. ‘‘They’re going to assume the client is unsophisticated, and they’re right,’’ said Felix Harris, a housing counselor with the nonprofit Knoxville Area Urban League. Some borrowers felt trapped because they put up a deposit before the dealer explained the loan terms or, like the Ackleys, felt compelled to swallow baitandswitch deals because they had spent thousands to prepare their land. 
PROMISE DENIED  A couple of years after moving into their new mobile home, Kirk Ackley was injured in a backhoe rollover. Unable to work, he and his wife urgently needed to refinance the costly 21st Mortgage loan they regretted signing. They pleaded with the lender several times for the better terms that they originally were promised, but were denied, they said. The Ackleys tried to explain the options to a 21st supervisor: If they refinanced to lower payments, they could stay in the home and 21st would get years of steady returns. Otherwise, the company would have to come out to their rural property, pull the house from its foundation and haul it away, possibly damaging it during the repossession. They both recall being baffled by his reply: ‘‘We don’t care. We’ll come take a chainsaw to it—cut it up and haul it out in boxes.’’ Nine Clayton consumers interviewed for this story said they were promised a chance to refinance. In reality, Clayton almost never refinances loans and accounts for well under 1 percent of mobilehome refinancings reported in government data from 2010 to 2013. It made more than onethird of the purchase loans during that period. Of Washington’s 25 largest mobilehome lenders, Clayton’s subsidiaries ranked No. 1 and No. 2 for the highest interest rates in 2013. Together, they ranked eighth in loans originated. ‘‘If you have a decrease in income and can’t afford the mortgage, at least a lot of the big companies will do modifications,’’ said Harris, the Knoxville housing counselor. ‘‘Vanderbilt won’t even entertain that.’’ In general, owners have difficulty refinancing or selling their mobile homes because few lenders offer such loans. One big reason: Homes are overpriced or depreciate so quickly that they generally are worth less than what the borrower owes, even after years of monthly payments. Ellie Carosa, of Napavine, Lewis County, found this out the hard way in 2010 after she put down some $40,000 from an inheritance to buy a used home from Clayton priced at about $65,000. Clayton sales reps steered Carosa, who is 67 years old and disabled, to finance the unpaid amount through Vanderbilt at 9 percent interest over 20 years. One year later, Carosa was already having problems—peeling paint and failing carpets— so she decided to have a market expert assess the value of her home. She hoped to eventually sell the house so the money could help her granddaughter, whom she adopted as her daughter at age 8, attend a local college to study music. Carosa was stunned to learn that the home was worth only $35,000, far less than her original down payment. ″I’ve lost everything,″ Carosa said. ‘RUDEST , MOST CONDESCENDING ’ AGENTS  Berkshire’s borrowers who fall behind on their payments face harassing, potentially illegal phone calls from a company rarely willing to offer relief. Carol Carroll, a nurse living near Bug Tussle, Ala., began looking for a new home in 2003 after her husband had died, leaving her with a 6yearold daughter. Instead of a down payment, she said, the salesman assured her she could simply put up two acres of her family land as collateral. In December 2005, Carroll was permanently disabled in a catastrophic car accident in which two people were killed. Knowing it would take a few months for her disability benefits to be approved, Carroll said, she called Vanderbilt and asked for a temporary reprieve. The company’s answer: ″We don’t do that.″ However, Clayton ratcheted up her propertyinsurance premiums, eventually costing her $803 more per year than when she started, she said. Carroll was one of several Clayton borrowers who felt trapped in the company’s insurance, often because they were told they had no other options. Some had as many as five years’ worth of expensive premiums included in their loans, inflating the total balance to be repaid with interest. Others said they were misled into signing up even though they already had other insurance. Carroll has since sold belongings, borrowed money from relatives and cut back on groceries to make payments. When she was late, she spoke frequently to Clayton’s phone agents, whom she described as ‘‘the rudest, most condescending people I have ever dealt with.’’ It’s a characterization echoed by almost every borrower interviewed for this story. Consumers say the company’s response to pleas for help is an invasive interrogation about their family budgets, including how much they spend on food, toiletries and utilities. Denise Pitts, of Knoxville, Tenn., said Vanderbilt collectors have called her multiple times a day, with one suggesting that she cancel her Internet service, even though she homeschools her son. They have called her relatives and neighbors, a tactic other borrowers reported. After Pitts’ husband, Kirk, was diagnosed with aggressive cancer, she said, a Vanderbilt agent told her she should make the house payment her ‘‘first priority’’ and let medical bills go unpaid. She said the company has threatened to seize her property immediately, even though the legal process to do so would take at least several months. Practices like contacting neighbors, calling repeatedly and making false threats can violate consumerprotection laws in Washington, Tennessee and other states. Last year, frequent complaints about Clayton’s aggressive collection practices led Tennessee state officials to contact local housing counselors seeking information about their experiences with the company, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations. TREATED LIKE CAR OWNERS  Mobilehome buyers who own their land sites may be able to finance their home purchases with realestate mortgages, which give them more federal and state consumer protections than the other major financing option, a personalproperty loan. With conventional home mortgages, companies must wait 120 days before starting foreclosure. In some states, the foreclosure process can take more than a year, giving consumers a chance to save their homes. Despite these protections, twothirds of mobilehome buyers who own their land end up in personalproperty loans, according to a federal study. These loans may close more quickly and have fewer upfront costs, but their rates are generally much higher. And if borrowers fall behind on payments, their homes can be seized with little or no warning. Those buyers are more vulnerable because they end up being treated like car owners instead of homeowners, said Bruce Neas, an attorney who has worked for years on foreclosure and manufacturedhousing issues in Washington state. Tiffany Galler was a single mother living in Crestview, Fla., in 2005 when she bought a mobile home for $37,195 with a loan from 21st Mortgage. She later rented out the home. After making payments over eight years totaling more than the sticker price of the home, Galler lost her tenant in November 2013 and fell behind on her payments. She arranged to show the home to a prospective renter two months later. But when she arrived at her homesite, Galler found barren dirt with PVC pipe sticking up from the ground. She called 911, thinking someone had stolen her home. Hours later, Galler tracked her repossessed house to a sales lot 30 miles away that was affiliated with 21st. It was listed for $25,900. 
CLAYTON WINS CONCESSIONS  The government has known for years about concerns that mobilehome buyers are treated unfairly. Little has been done. Fifteen years ago, Congress directed the Department of Housing and Urban Development to examine issues such as loan terms and regulations in order to find ways to make mobile homes affordable. That’s still on HUD’s todo list. The industry, however, has protected its interests vigorously. Clayton Homes is represented in Washington, D.C., by the Manufactured Housing Institute (MHI), a trade group that has a Clayton executive as its vice chairman and another as its secretary. CEO Kevin Clayton has represented MHI before Congress. MHI spent $4.5 million since 2003 lobbying the federal government. Those efforts have helped the company escape much scrutiny, as has Buffett’s persona as a man of the people, analysts say. ‘‘There is a Teflon aspect to Warren Buffett,’’ said James McRitchie, who runs a widely read blog, Corporate Governance. Still, after the housing crisis, lawmakers tightened protections for mortgage borrowers with a sweeping overhaul known as the DoddFrank Act, creating regulatory headaches for the mobilehome industry. Kevin Clayton complained to lawmakers in 2011 that the new rules would lump in some of his company’s loans with ‘‘subprime, predatory’’ mortgages, making it harder for mobilehome buyers ‘‘to obtain affordable financing.’’ Although the rules had yet to take effect that year, 99 percent of Clayton’s mobile 
home loans were so expensive that they met the federal government’s ‘‘higherpriced’’ threshold. DoddFrank also tasked federal financial regulators with creating appraisal requirements for risky loans. Appraisals are common for conventional home sales, protecting both the lender and the consumer from a bad deal. Clayton’s own data suggest that its mobile homes may be overpriced from the start, according to comments it filed with federal regulators. When Vanderbilt was required to obtain appraisals before finalizing a loan, company officials wrote, the home was determined to be worth less than the sales price about 3o percent of the time. But when federal agencies jointly proposed appraisal rules in September 2012, industry objections led them to exempt loans secured solely by a manufactured home. Then Clayton pushed for more concessions, arguing that manufacturedhome loans tied to land should also be exempt. Paul Nichols, thenpresident of Clayton’s Vanderbilt Mortgage, told regulators that the appraisal requirement would be costly and onerous, significantly reducing ‘‘the availability of affordable housing in the United States.’’ In 2013, regulators conceded. They will not require a complete appraisal for new manufactured homes. 
Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, the investigation found that Clayton locked one disabled veteran in Tennessee, Ms. Dorothy Mansfield, into an expensive loan even though the required monthly payment would leave her with only $27 a month to cover the rest of her living costs. Worst, it was a nodocumentation loan, meaning that no one even bothered to verify Dorothy’s income. The investigation also found that Clayton Homes’ inhouse lender, Vanderbilt Mortgage, charged minority borrowers substantially higher rates, on average, than their White counterparts. Unfortunately, this appears not to have been an isolated incident as Federal data reveals that Vanderbilt Mortgage typically has charged African American borrowers who make more than $75,000 a year more than White people who make only $35,000 a year. Other Clayton Homes borrowers were quoted inexpensive loan terms only to see interest and fees rocket once they had put down a nonrefundable deposit or paid out large amounts of money to prepare their land for installation of the manufactured home. b0930 Just like subprime mortgage loan borrowers who were preyed on before the financial crisis, many consumers who purchased manufactured housing were convinced to take out highcost loans based on false promises that they would be able to refinance to lower rates in the future. Former Clayton Homes salespeople have confirmed that they have pressured customers to use Claytonaffiliated financing even if it wasn’t the best deal, and some even received kickbacks for putting customers into more expensive loans. Under this bill, some of our most important consumer protection laws that prevent this kind of steering, like the Truth in Lending Act, the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act, and the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, would no longer apply to manufactured housing retailers and salespeople that offer credit to borrowers, even if those salespeople do the same things traditional loan originators do, like referring customers to a creditor or assisting them in applying for credit. So, if enacted, H.R. 1699 would allow abusive lenders to charge over 14 percent interest before consumer protections are triggered—more than four times what the average borrower is paying on a home loan. In the coming years, this number could very well grow to 16, 17, and likely 18 percent as interest rates rise back to normal. Even worse, the bill also makes it legal for Clayton Homes sales personnel to steer borrowers toward highcost loans, loans from other parts of the Clayton conglomerate that are not in their best interests, a practice that Congress banned for all loan originators after the financial crisis. Mr. Speaker, when it comes to manufactured housing, consumers are already exposed to significant risks, high interest rates, the inability to refinance and, in many cases, depreciation that starts as soon as the manufactured home is sold. Nevertheless, the House is considering a bill that rolls back key protections for these already financially vulnerable consumers. It would do away with a number of protections current law attaches to many highcost loans, such as stiffer penalties for badacting lenders, additional disclosures for investors and consumers who purchase highcost mortgages, mandatory counseling so that borrowers know what they are getting into, and even the ability for borrowers to have their loan rescinded if lenders don’t follow the law. It would do away with all of this. As the Consumer Bureau noted in its study of the manufactured housing industry, individuals who apply for manufactured housing loans ‘‘include customers that may be considered more financially vulnerable and thus may particularly stand to benefit from strong consumer protections.’’ Now, in addition to the Consumer Bureau’s report, investigative reporting has provided names and stories of individuals who have fallen victim to the market practices and policies described by the Consumer Bureau. Finally, when a nearly identical measure was considered by the House last term as H.R. 650, the Obama administration issued a veto threat and said they ‘‘strongly oppose’’ the bill because it would ‘‘put lowincome and economically vulnerable consumers at significant risk of being subjected to predatory lending and being steered into more expensive loans even when they qualify for lower cost alternatives.’’ This bill rolls back consumer protections amidst evidence that the manufactured housing industry needs more oversight and is, at its heart, a dangerous giveaway to a sector that already profits handsomely at the expense of vulnerable borrowers. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this ripoff bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, before the morning is over, I hope to have some additional time to yield to the ranking member so she can continue her diatribe against President Obama’s favorite billionaire and Democrat financier, Warren Buffett. Until then, Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR), who is the sponsor of the legislation and the chairman of the Financial Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1699, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act. Homeownership, for many, is part of the American Dream, but overbroad and burdensome regulations arising out of the DoddFrank financial control law are limiting the ability of Americans to realize that dream. A onesizefitsall regulation issued by the CFPB makes it harder for lenders to offer mortgages to hardworking Americans who simply want to buy a manufactured home. By expanding the range of loan products considered ‘‘high cost’’ under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the CFPB has failed to recognize the unique nature of manufactured housing loans. Due to the increased legal liabilities and stigma associated with making these socalled highcost mortgages, many lenders have simply stopped making these loans altogether. In fact, according to the government’s own Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, origination of manufactured housing loans of $75,000 or less has plummeted by 22 percent since this regulation went into effect. This data clearly showed that there is a negative impact of these Federal rules on the availability of credit for manufactured homes. While virtually all mortgage market segments have been growing in the last few years, HMDA data clearly shows continued declines in small dollar loans for manufactured homes. As a result, this regulation is harming low and moderateincome families, particularly in rural areas, and existing homeowners are harmed because they will not be able to sell their homes. These regulations are hitting Americans in rural areas of modest means the most. Take, for example, the hospital worker in Kentucky. And, yes, Mr. Speaker, this is about the hospital worker in Kentucky, not Warren Buffett. This hospital worker applied for a loan of $38,500 to finance a manufactured home. He had an 8 percent down payment. His monthly income was $2,200 per month—plenty to cover the allin 
housing costs of $675 per month. The payment he would have been investing in his own home would have been less than what he was spending on rent. But he couldn’t get financing. He contacted his local banks and credit unions, but they no longer finance manufactured homes. This is not about Warren Buffett. This is about helping lowincome Americans achieve the American Dream. The reasons for this crippling lack of credit are unaccountable, unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and their ‘‘highcost’’ loan regulations and the definitions of mortgage originator and loan originator established in the DoddFrank Act. These regulations fail to take into account the unique circumstances associated with manufactured housing and the fixed costs associated with the purchase of any home, large or small. They fail to recognize the simple, mathematical fact that fixed costs on smaller loans translate into higher percentages of the total loan. They fail to recognize that even if interest payments on manufactured homes are more than your average home, the payments are still more affordable than the allin cost of a sitebuilt home or even rent in many markets. This is especially the case when one considers that purchasing a manufactured home as opposed to renting allows these owners to build equity leading to financial stability for their families. This bipartisan bill, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act, recognizes the unique nature of manufactured housing, something that bureaucrats in Washington don’t know anything about. They don’t know anything about what goes on in rural America. This fixes these government caused problems by modifying the definition of loan originators and mortgage originators to exclude manufactured housing retailers and sellers from the definition of a loan or mortgage originator, so long as they are only receiving compensation for the sale of the home and not engaged in loan offerings. The legislation also increases the thresholds for highcost loans to accommodate manufactured home purchases of up to $75,000. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 20 seconds to the gentleman from Kentucky. Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the additional time. Mr. Speaker, it accommodates manufactured home purchases up to $75,000 while maintaining the tough restrictions on lenders to prevent any borrowers from being taken advantage of. Yes, that is right, this preserves those consumer protections. As Members of Congress, we have an obligation to protect the American people from regulations that harm their ability to purchase an affordable home for themselves and their families. We need to end government policies under the guise of consumer protection that are actually protecting Americans right out of homeownership. It is not consumer protection, Mr. Speaker, when you deny people affordable housing. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue and I applaud both Democrats and Republicans who support this commonsense solution. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, what you just heard was a description of what some who represent some of these rural communities are doing for them or not doing for them. They say: Vulnerable consumer, you can have a loan at 18 percent. We know you can’t afford it, and we will just come and repossess your manufactured housing when you can’t pay. For the chairman, I will take all the time that he would yield to me to continue this discussion and let people know exactly what is going on. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. ELLISON), who is a true Congressional Progressive Caucus champion and a senior member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I come to this conversation based on people I know who live in manufactured housing. A lot of folks call it mobile homes or trailer parks. We call it manufactured housing. But I have walked those places, sat in those rooms, and just been with my neighbors, friends, and constituents who live in manufactured housing. I appreciate them tremendously. They are wonderful folks. The folks I know are just part of those 17 million people who live in manufactured housing. If Congress got rid of manufactured housing, the national homeownership rate would fall about 6 percent. So manufactured housing, no doubt, is important and is an affordable alternative for many people. But that doesn’t mean the lender can rip them off. That doesn’t mean the lender can pick their pockets, and that doesn’t mean that the lender can let some big monopoly reach in the borrower’s pockets and take their money away from them. Just because the loan payment on manufactured housing might be lower than rent doesn’t mean they get to up the skim. They have still got to be fair to people. Look, for folks who are watching this debate, it is important to understand what we are really talking about. I am going to boil it down as best I can. We are saying: If you live in manufactured housing and if the loan is going to be extra high in the interest rate, if the interest rate is 6
1⁄2or 81⁄2above the annual percentage rate, which could bring you as high as the ranking member said, 18 percent, then certain things kick in for you. If they are going to charge borrowers that kind of interest rate, the law says we are going to look out for them by saying that the lender has to explain the consequences of default—it will ruin the borrower’s credit—that the lender has to disclose the loan terms in the monthly payments, that the lender has to ensure that the borrower receives homeownership counseling. And this is really important: under another regulation, the lender is forbidden from being the dealer and steering that person to a lender. In the case of Clayton Homes, they are both. They will sell the borrower the unit and give them the loan. They will say: Hey, do you know what? We are going to sell you a nice new unit here. Don’t worry about borrowing or where to look for a loan. We got you covered. We are in that business. They are a monopoly. What is happening here, Mr. Speaker, is that all those protections that a highcostloan borrower is about to face this legislation takes away. That is all we are talking about here. We are saying that if a borrower is going to get a highcost loan, then he should get certain protections. The borrower should get information and counseling. People should tell the borrower what is going to happen if he defaults. They are saying: Hey, man, that is getting in the way of my money. We don’t want you telling them what their rights are because that is interfering with the millions and millions that we are going to get off of them. A dumb consumer works out for our monopoly just fine, a smart one not so much. That is what this is all about. Now, I want to just say—giving my friends on the other side of the aisle the best of intentions—that we do have a philosophical debate here. We believe that the problem—if there is one—of people lending in this market is not that there are consumer protections, but it is that there is a huge monopoly. If the Congress wants to fix the problem of manufactured housing lending, then break up that monopoly. If the Congress wants to get more entrants into the market and get some downward competition in price, then break up the monopoly. b0945 But if the Congress just tells the monopoly you can charge these people more now, you don’t have to give them the protections, you don’t have to inform them, you can steer them, and you have got to get a really highcost loan before they get any protections, then all that is going to do is benefit the firm that is already occupying this market space. The firm that already sells the unit and gives the loans, the one that has all the advertising set up, the one that has all the sales force set up, the one that has all the infrastructure already set up, the monopolists will be the ones who will benefit from this legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Minnesota an additional 30 seconds. Mr. ELLISON. The theory of this legislation is that consumer protection is why you have seen some entrants, some lenders, not be in this space. Our knowledge and our facts indicate that it is because we have got a big, giant monster that controls the whole market. If Congress wants to do something for manufactured housing residents, we can do it, we can do it now, and we urge Members to vote ‘‘no’’ on this piece of legislation. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER ), chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit. Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) for his continued commitment to issues surrounding the availability of affordable manufactured housing. He has been a patient champion on this and many other issues that impact Americans seeking access to mortgage financing. The legislation we consider today amends the Truth in Lending Act to specify that a retailer of manufactured housing is not a ‘‘mortgage originator’’ subject to requirements under that act. Similarly, the bill specifies that such a retailer is generally not a ‘‘loan originator.’’ So what do we mean with regard to these technical concerns? They mean that more people in Missouri and Kentucky and every other State will have access to manufactured housing. Certain regulations stemming from DoddFrank constricted credit for manufactured homes. This legislation would help consumers by restoring access to financing that is currently blocked. If you want more access to credit, if you want more competition, you need to support this. What has happened is that the rules and regulations have constricted the ability of banks and credit unions to be able to make these kinds of loans. Housing options in rural America aren’t necessarily the same as those offered in other parts of the Nation. Our rural communities can face a severely limited affordable housing stock, making the availability of and financing for manufactured housing all the more important. That may not be significant to every Member of this body, but it is certainly important to me and my constituents. Roughly 10 percent of them live in manufactured housing. It is important to the more than 20 million Americans living in manufactured housing today and the many Americans who will turn to manufactured housing to fulfill their housing needs. As someone whose first home was actually a manufactured home, I can tell you that this is extremely important to lots and lots of people in communities in my district. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have suggested this legislation will dilute consumer protections. In reality, this bill maintains consumer protections. H.R. 1699 allows, for example, continued CFPB oversight of manufactured housing loans, requires that consumers be provided with the full litany of disclosure requirements, and maintains the ‘‘ability to repay’’ requirements established in DoddFrank. The idea that this legislation guts consumer protections, Mr. Speaker, is simply not true. There has also been the charge that this legislation would help retailers that originate mortgages. To be clear, H.R. 1699 does not exempt parties that are actual mortgage originators. If a retailer is compensated for acting as a mortgage originator, the legal requirements that apply to other mortgage originators will still apply to them after passage of this bill. Manufactured housing provides not just a housing alternative, but an opportunity for individuals and families to become homeowners. This legislation ensures manufactured housing remains available and affordable, without eroding important consumer protections. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important measure. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY ), a member of the Financial Services Committee. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Congresswoman WATERS , for standing up for consumers. As I stand here today, first, let me just say I echo all of the comments of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and I, too, rise in opposition of H.R. 1699, a bill that would put the lowest income and most vulnerable consumers at risk of becoming victims of predatory lending. This bill would increase the chances of consumers being steered into higher cost loans when they could otherwise qualify for lower cost alternatives. As an aside, it is quite interesting to sit here and listen to my colleagues on the other side have such great interest in affordable housing and lowincome residents, and yet, as I have sat on the Financial Services Committee, I have watched them repeatedly cut funds to the budget for lowincome residents and not stand up for some of the statements when former Director Richard Cordray came in to talk about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and what they have done to stamp out this type of predatory lending. It is also quite interesting, and I would be remiss not to mention, that last week President Trump appointed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, to lead the Bureau, yet he is the same man who spent years trying to eliminate this organization, a man who did not stand up for lowincome, affordable housing. Mr. Speaker, I will end by saying I think we need someone who can stand up for consumers, and I am pleased to hear my colleagues say that they believe in consumer protection and that they are going to advocate for those with low income and they are going to stand up against predatory lending. So it should be interesting, as we move forward. Mr. Speaker, I am in opposition to H.R. 1699. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ), chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this subject to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I suspect I might be one of the few Members of Congress whose first house was a manufactured house. Not only that, but I represent a district where 50 percent of the homes are manufactured housing. I think that it is important that we kind of separate the two discussions. If the CFPB were looking at the abuses and going after the abusers that I have heard talked about from the other side, there might not be a discussion today, but that is not what the CFPB did. What the CFPB did is say that all balloon notes are bad. I can’t find any bank, from the East Coast to the West Coast, that will come into New Mexico and lend $33,000 for a used mobile home and put it on a 30year note. You can tear up a mobile home within days. So balloon notes are simply made in order for people to come in and check. They didn’t use them to maybe put bad adjustments and higher interest rates or anything. They just want to be able to look. So they generally put these loans on a 5year basis. At the end of 5 years, if everything is good, we continue to roll it. We don’t start from scratch. We don’t charge you prejudicial interest. But all balloon notes were made illegal by the CFPB. They were declared to be prejudicial in their nature when they weren’t. Qualified mortgages were another way that they shut off the lending for the manufactured housing in our district. Ownerseller financing was another way. What happens in New Mexico, somebody will buy a trailer house, a manufactured home. They will live in it, pay for it, buy another one, and over their lifetime accumulate 10 or 15. Then, when they retire, they begin to sell one at a time. If you sell more than one or two, the CFPB said: You are now a brokerdealer, and we are not going to let you operate unless you become licensed. So it shut off much of the access of just one seller selling to another. We brought the CFPB in. We brought Kelly Cochran, about 5 years ago, to 
walk through these and say: Please, we understand what you are trying to do. No one wants to be protecting those who are violating consumer rights, but just get it within its lane. Kelly Cochran was there for almost an hour and admitted that she was not aware of the many things brought up that were ontheground problems. They never changed them. Mr. Cordray continued to assert that he had solved all the problems, when he had never solved any of the problems. Most of the banks in New Mexico— and I live right on the Texas line—in that region of Texas and New Mexico, just quit offering to finance manufactured housing. That meant the people who needed it the most had no access to credit. We discussed these items in the open hearings many times with the CFPB Director, Mr. Cordray, and it just seemed like they could never get focused on those. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New Mexico an additional 15 seconds. Mr. PEARCE. This bill today is simply saying that we have people with a need, and they have to be able to get access to loans to finance houses to live in. It is the way I began. It is the way I want other people in New Mexico to begin. Let’s just restore order to the market. That is what we are trying to do. Mr. Speaker, I support the bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to deal with two things quickly in my 2 minutes. I want to deal with the CFPB’s directorship, but let me start with clarifying a few things. First of all, manufactured housing is the cornerstone of affordable housing in this country. Nobody argues that. Manufactured housing is in every State in this Union. In my State of Georgia, it accounts for 12 percent of all the affordable housing units. In some States, it is even higher than that. I just simply want to clarify why I support the bill. It is because of two things: One, it is because of the devastating Federal regulations that are on it for these hundreds of thousands and millions of customers. What it is doing is making the American people unable to purchase manufactured housing. I think we have to look at that. It is also eroding the home values of existing owners of manufactured housing. Our bill simply moves to correct it by doing three things: we just simply do some technical clarifications to the definition of ‘‘mortgage originator,’’ ‘‘loan originator,’’ and ‘‘highcost mortgage.’’ Let me just say this. I was an original sponsor of DoddFrank. What we put in there, we made sure that mortgage protection and DoddFrank is protected in here, including anybody steering anybody into any kind of loans with predatory implications. So all that is in there. This is a great debate. There are two sides to it. But when you look at it, it is the millions of Americans who are suffering from the inability to get the mobile homes, the inability to keep them, and all we are doing is simply making these minor adjustments. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. I do want to clarify about the CFPB Director, and I want the American people to listen to me. In section 1011 of DoddFrank, paragraph 5, it states this: the Deputy Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Board shall be appointed by the Director and serve as acting Director in the absence or unavailability of the Director. We wrote this. This is the law. We must abide by it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ROTHFUS ), the vice chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit. Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1699, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act. As the vice chairman of the Financial Institution Subcommittee and the cosponsor of this legislation, I urge my colleagues to support its passage. Representative BARR’s bipartisan bill—and I really appreciate the comments from Mr. SCOTT, my colleague from Georgia on this bill—will remove misguided barriers that block access to affordable manufactured homes while preserving consumers’ protections. It is important to keep in mind that the challenge of finding affordable housing is not exclusively an urban problem. Housing affordability is a challenge in many rural areas, including parts of my district. b1000 Manufactured homes can be a solution to this affordability challenge. They can give many low to moderate income families the chance at homeownership. The fact is, Mr. Speaker, the current regulatory environment is taking competition out of this market to the detriment of consumers. Nationwide, 22 million Americans live in manufactured homes. In my State of Pennsylvania, manufactured homes comprise almost 5 percent of the housing stock. Manufactured homes account for 73 percent of all new homes sold under $125,000, and the average income of a manufactured home purchaser is less than $40,000 per year. The manufactured housing business also sustains thousands of families. Sixteen thousand workers in Pennsylvania are employed in this industry. Unfortunately, the misguided rules from Washington threaten to choke off access to manufactured housing. The Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act will address these harmful rules that are making manufactured homes unaffordable for perspective customers while preserving important consumer protections. It is important to keep in mind that the Truth in Lending Act and State consumer protection laws will still apply after enactment of this legislation. Representative BARR’s bill is narrowly focused, common sense, and a bipartisan effort to target a specific challenge facing perspective purchasers of manufactured homes. The bill will preserve access to this affordable option for millions of Americans. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ), a member of the Progressive Caucus who is always on the side of consumers. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the lady for yielding to me and for her continued advocacy for all consumers, particularly the lowincome consumers who are affected by this legislation. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1699, a bill that guts consumer protections for buyers of manufactured homes. For years, the manufactured housing industry has preyed on lowincome households, pushing them into highinterest mortgages. Under this bill, buyers of manufactured homes would effectively get less protection than any other home buyers. On top of that, the bill would encourage higher interest rates on loans for manufactured homes, taking a bigger bite out of families’ paychecks. This manufactured housing bill is actually part of a multiprong attack on safeguards implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. President Trump has placed OMB Director Mick Mulvaney at the CFPB to destroy it from within, while Republicans in Congress are chipping away at consumer protections from the outside. Americans deserve better. I really urge my colleagues to stand up for consumers and vote ‘‘no.’’ You know, it is easy to go after those people who live in these trailer parks who are trying to make their way, who are struggling to make ends meet, and this bill adds another layer of problem for them by allowing for higher interest rates. It is just wrong. We should be voting ‘‘no.’’ Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
from Maine (Mr. P OLIQUIN ), the land of moose, maple syrup, and lobster, a distinguished member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. He forgot pine trees, but that is okay. Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled to stand up and support H.R. 1699, Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act, and I salute Congressman ANDY BARR from Kentucky to bring this forward. Maine, Mr. Speaker, has some of the highest homeownership rates in the country. We love our homes in Maine. I represent the rural part of our State, and in our State, Mr. Speaker, we have times of the year where the weather is pretty tough. If you are building a home that is not manufactured in a warehouse, sometimes you literally cannot build that home because of the weather, the snow, and the cold, and what have you. But there is nothing more important, Mr. Speaker, nothing more important than making sure moms and dads across America and across Maine have an option, have as many options as possible to house their kids, to take care of their kids, and make sure they are safe. Manufactured housing, in many parts of the country, is the only affordable option. Now, H.R. 1699 makes a small, technical change such that folks who want to get into a home and want to take part in the great American Dream of homeownership have the opportunity to get a loan to do this. Government, Mr. Speaker, is supposed to help our families, not get in the way. Here is an example of us being able to remove an unnecessary restriction that hurts our families and prevents them from having an opportunity to get in their first home. We need more options, not less, Mr. Speaker. Let’s help our families and not get in the way. I salute Mr. BARR for this great bill. I am fully in support of this. Let’s help our families get into manufactured homes if this is what they want and this is what they can afford. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First, let me just say that I recognize some of the issues in the way that have been described by the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ), and I think that he is on the right track in how we can deal with giving assistance to those who want to own manufactured housing and assistance to those who want to own more than one manufactured house and are looking toward their retirement, and I support that. He has given a new definition to me for balloon payments and how it works in this industry, and I want to work with him to get something done. What I want to do is separate out the fact that these owners of manufactured housing need some protections in law. We don’t want to strip out all these protections for them. They deserve to be treated fairly. If they are going to be charged high interest rates, they deserve to have the protections that everybody else has. I mean, it is not fair that some of us can buy homes at market rate, at 4.25 percent or whatever, and they have to pay 18 percent because they are considered a high risk, and they can’t even refinance these homes. I want to show you some of the advertising from Clayton where they talk about ‘‘Repos Available.’’ They have got plenty of them because they repossess these homes. And I just want to say that, in addition to this monopoly of Clayton’s, the way that they treat people when they fall behind in their payments, they don’t want to do loan modifications—they don’t do them, really. As a matter of fact, they hire these people off the street, basically, who come and harass these homeowners and treat them extremely bad, and they talk to them about the fact that they want this mortgage, they want this money paid, and they will tell them— we have got documentation where they tell them: Don’t pay your medical bills. You pay, or we are going to come and repossess this. I want to tell you, I have the greatest respect for the least of these. Whether you are in the urban area, whether you are in the rural area, you deserve the respect and support from your government. And I want you to know, for those who represent these areas, let’s stop being on the side of the people who exploit them, and let’s get on the side of the consumers. In this last election, we heard a lot about the fact that people in small towns and rural areas were upset with their government and felt nobody cared about them. I want them to ask the people who represent them: Whose side are they on? Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), a distinguished member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. I want to congratulate my friend, ANDY BARR, for bringing this bill back to the floor of the House to be on the side of the consumer, to be on the side of affordable choices, to be on the side of truly affordable housing in so many areas where there is no alternative. Many in the urban areas of our country, the East and West Coast elites who make financial policy, have no understanding of living out in the country. They don’t realize we don’t have stick built alternatives in many rural areas of our country. As a former community banker down in Ashley County and Chicot County, Arkansas, the most affordable, best alternative for many of our families is a manufactured home, working with a relative for a plot of land. DoddFrank has made that unaffordable and unavailable. And to that point, I want to say I got a letter from a pal at the Army National Guard who said: I was turned down on a loan that would be cheaper, larger, and better for my family. It was better than the house, the 60 yearold house, that he was renting. That is why we need this bill, and I thank the chairman for bringing it to the floor today. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ), another distinguished member of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. Mr. Speaker, 22 million Americans live in manufactured homes. The majority of these homes are in rural America. In fact, more than 6 out of 10 manufactured homes are located in rural areas. In my home State of Minnesota, manufactured homes are the State’s largest source of affordable homeownership. Unfortunately, a provision in Dodd Frank has put homeownership out of reach for these Americans. Specifically, DoddFrank and the CFPB modified the criteria and expanded the types of loans from lenders to manufactured home buyers, which are considered to be ‘‘high cost.’’ As a direct result, lenders are struggling to make these loans because of a high legal risk associated with this ‘‘high cost’’ definition, ultimately harming lowincome buyers in Minnesota. The consumers are being harmed in Minnesota and around the country. This is why Republicans and Democrats have come together in support of H.R. 1699, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act, authored by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR), our friend, to help millions of Americans become homeowners. This legislation provides clarity and certainty regarding the changes made by DoddFrank and the CFPB. H.R. 1699 will ensure that home buyers in rural and lowincome areas are able to afford manufactured housing and are not unfairly targeted by the very agency that was created to protect them. Mr. Speaker, when it comes to achieving the American Dream, government should not be standing in the way. As Members of Congress, it is our duty to stand up for and against this continued overreach, support the American Dream, and vote ‘‘yes’’ for H.R. 1699. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK ), a distinguished member of the Financial Services Committee. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time. Clearly, Mr. Speaker, the overregulation of DoddFrank, coupled with unfettered agencies like the CFPB, have hurt Americans from Wall Street to Main Street. But today, Mr. Speaker, I am not here to talk about Wall Street or Main Street but a little twolane street in Cassville, Georgia, named ‘‘Mac Johnson.’’ Cassville is a rural community that has a small post office, a little country store, and a lot of hardworking people who call it their home. Many of the people who live in Cassville work at one of the many factories in the local area. While these hardworking Americans are not the upper middle class, they are the backbone of America’s economy. And like 22 million other Americans, many of them live in a manufactured home. Along Mac Johnson, you will find a number of manufactured homes—some on individual lots, some on farmland, and some in quaint, little mobile home parks. As it is across the Nation, almost half of those living in these homes have incomes of less than $30,000 a year, and many are retired or disabled. Historically, manufactured homes have allowed families, who couldn’t afford the cost of a traditionally constructed house, the ability to achieve the American Dream. However, the CFPB has expanded enforcement of regulations that were designed for mortgage lending on traditional homes to include manufactured home retailers. This has made it much more difficult for consumers to obtain financing for these homes. b1015 Mr. Speaker, this bill reins in Federal regulations just enough to give needed relief to the manufactured housing industry and allow families access to these affordable homes. I fully support this bipartisan bill, which gained the support of twothirds of the Financial Services Committee industry, and I commend my colleague from the great State of Kentucky for bringing this bill forward. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. CROWLEY), the chair of the Democratic Caucus. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding me this time. This bill before us today, H.R. 1699, as I understand it, would eliminate the safeguards for manufactured homes that were put in place to protect consumers through the DoddFrank legislation, which included the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The American people are looking at us and asking: What is Congress doing? After everything went down after the 2008 crash, we saw how irresponsible folks on Wall Street were, many within the banking industry, the nonbank banks, and what they were doing. And the answer here is to take away even further protection for the American consumer. The attack on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an attack on everything America stands for. More than 12 billion in illgotten gains have been returned to the American taxpayer through the CFPB. The CFPB stands up for them when others have let them down. So, naturally, from its inception, the Republicans have done everything they possibly could to kneecap this important agency. Now a Republican White House is attempting to destroy it from the inside out. The Great Recession brought millions of Americans a foreclosure notice and a pink slip, through no fault of their own. They were victims of a financial system that didn’t look out for consumers. There weren’t enough referees on the playing field, but they did look out for big banks. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky). The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, will Mr. HENSARLING yield that time he promised to yield me so I may yield it to Mr. CROWLEY ? Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, regrettably, I don’t have enough time for the ranking member. On this side of the aisle, we are fully subscribed. I have lots of Members who wish to speak in favor of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD), yet another distinguished member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. I thank my friend, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR), for his leadership on this vital issue. Mr. Speaker, in regulation and in life, one size simply does not fit all. A requirement that works for one type of business may not work for another type of business. Right now, the law treats those who make loans on manufactured houses similarly to those who are refinancing mortgages on their homes. The reality is that these are completely different transactions. Buying a $20,000 manufactured home is simply not the same as financing a $200,000 home with a 30year mortgage. The borrower is in a different position with very different needs. The lender is making a loan that is often secured differently for a much smaller amount, but with similar paperwork and similar costs. The Federal Government, since Dodd Frank, has been treating both of these transactions similarly from a regulation perspective. It has hurt borrowers trying to buy a piece of their American Dream. In The Wall Street Journal, lenders suggested that they would not make these loans if they continued to suffer under this faulty regulation scenario. One lender says that about onethird of its sales—6,100 homes—would be affected. That is 6,100 American families who would lose out on homeownership, on building equity, and on making an investment instead of paying rent. The bill simply says: Look, the person making a $20,000 loan on a manufactured home is not the same as a bank or a mortgage broker originating a 30year fixed rate mortgage and should not be treated in the same way. It is a commonsense solution, and that is why it has gotten bipartisan backing. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 30 seconds remaining. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, you have heard the debate on this bill, and I think everyone can easily recognize that we, on this side of the aisle, are trying to protect our most vulnerable consumers. People who live in manufactured housing and mobile homes in trailer parks need to be respected and given the same protections as anybody else with a mortgage. I would say to those who are here supporting a bill that would allow interest rates on these mobile homes and on this manufactured housing to increase with no protections are putting their constituents at risk. Mr. Speaker, I ask for a big ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF ), a member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2017, legislation of which I am proud to be an original cosponsor. In west Tennessee, where I am from, and in other rural areas across the country, there is no doubt that manufactured housing is a critical and affordable option for many families. In fact, more than 8
1⁄2million families— that is roughly 22 million Americans— have chosen this option because of the affordability and the value. Where I am from, one out of ten west Tennesseans has chosen manufactured housing as the best option to make their home. For this reason, our legislation is essential to protecting consumer choices and financing options for those seeking to buy a manufactured home, while also leaving in place important consumer protections. In fact, close to 60 percent of new manufactured homes sell for less than $70,000, and are usually available at lower monthly payments than what it 
costs to rent. Manufactured homes are offered as a fixed rate, fixed term option. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this commonsense, bipartisan legislation, which will allow many Americans seeking the American Dream of owning a home to continue to have access to affordable manufactured housing. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN ), a member of the Small Business Committee. Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of H.R. 1699. I spent 40 years of my career developing land and actually buying manufactured housing, which makes it possible for families who cannot afford a stick built home, in many cases, to be able to buy a manufactured house. I have seen firsthand the critical role that manufactured housing plays in the development of local communities and the ability for a family to buy their first home. As we have seen far too often, regulatory overreach by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has impeded and stopped, in many cases, the ability for consumers to receive financing for manufactured housing, and has placed unnecessary requirements on retailers. This legislation addresses this overreach by making commonsense reforms to increase the availability and financing for manufactured housing, while maintaining important protections for consumers. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 2
1⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, what we have heard this morning, unfortunately, is an assault on affordable housing from too many people on the other side of the aisle. We have Washington elites who are deciding that lowincome people are too stupid to make decisions for themselves. We have too many people on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, who want to take them out of their affordable homes—manufactured homes—and are saying: No, go rent, go find someplace on the street. Here is the reality: when Washington elites at the Orwellian named Consumer Financial Protection Bureau decided to make these manufactured housing loans ‘‘high cost,’’ we saw a 22 percent drop in these type of loans being made. But what we know is that this is vital for so many working Americans. I heard from one consumer in Windsor, New York: 
I was falling behind on my own sitebuilt mortgage payments. I was drowning in debt. I needed a cheaper housing alternative that would meet the needs of my family. The manufactured home payment cut my overall housing expense by 57 percent. Mr. Speaker, that is just one example. I have story after story from consumers who this is their only option for affordable housing. But too many of my friends on the other side of the aisle say: No, no, we can’t allow you to do that. You might pay a little higher interest rate. Well, here is a news flash, Mr. Speaker: their monthly payment is lower and they get to own their own home. Washington elites have tried price controls before. They have been tried since the dawn of man, and it always leads to shortages. We don’t want to shortchange working Americans for affordable housing. We want to protect the vulnerable in society and we want to allow them to have affordable housing. That is why it is so important that today we pass H.R. 1699. Protect affordable housing, protect freedom, and let’s vote this in today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, thank you to Chairman HENSARLING and Congressman BARR for working with me to make housing more affordable for Arizona families. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1699, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act. Manufactured housing is an important form of affordable housing in Arizona, particularly for rural and underserved communities. More than 300,000 families in Arizona live in manufactured homes. Low and moderateincome families count on manufactured homes as an affordable choice. Just last week, we had the honor of working with Habitat for Humanity to help Ed, a Vietnam veteran living in Tempe, spread gravel and improve his front yard. Ed first moved to the Valley in 1950 and bought a manufactured home a few years ago. If Ed wanted to use his VA eligibility to purchase a home, the realtor would be able to connect Ed with a number of lenders who offer VA home loans. However, if Ed wanted to purchase a manufactured home, he would be instructed to go to a table by himself and sift through the countless brochures and loan programs to decide which lender is best. This is a daunting and discouraging process for most borrowers, especially for firsttime homebuyers. Current regulations harm existing manufactured homeowners and potential buyers by curtailing consumer access to manufactured home loans or assistance in the homebuying process. These regulations unintentionally make it more difficult to match borrowers with lenders who can help them in a timely and efficient manner. H.R. 1699 is a commonsense fix for Ed and the hundreds of thousands of Arizonans who own or are looking to own manufactured homes. The bill ensures that regulations give homebuyers more options, better advice, and greater confidence when buying a new home. The bill also amends the definition of a high cost mortgage and corresponding thresholds to ensure that consumers of smallbalance mortgage loans will have the opportunity to access mortgage credit. It was a privilege to meet Ed and thank him for his service to our country. We should make it easier, not harder, for veterans and fellow Arizonans like him to purchase a home of their choice. I urge members of both parties to join me in supporting H.R. 1699. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 635, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. MOTION TO RECOMMIT  
Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. In its current form, I am. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. Maxine Waters of California moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1699 to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Add at the end the following: 
SEC. 4. PROTECTING CONSUMERS FROM EXCESSIVE HOUSING COSTS AND PREDATORY LENDERS. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—No lender or other person may make use of the amendments made by this Act if the lender or person has either been— (1) found to have committed or engaged in an unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice under Federal law in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service; or (2) convicted of fraud under Federal or State law in connection with a residential mortgage loan or the extension of any loan in connection with a manufactured or modular home. (b) DEFINITIONS .—For purposes of this section, the terms ‘‘State’’ and ‘‘consumer financial product or service’’ have the meaning given those terms, respectively, under section 1002 of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 
Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, my amendment is simple. It would prevent bad actors from being able to use the exemptions in the underlying bill and evade the consumer protections in the Truth in Lending Act. If a lender has committed or engaged in an unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice under Federal law in connection with any transaction with a 
consumer for a consumer financial product or service; or if they have been convicted of fraud under Federal or State law in connection with a residential mortgage loan or the extension of any loan in connection with a manufactured or modular home, they cannot avail themselves of the bill’s decreased scrutiny. As I have already mentioned, Clayton Homes has nearly a monopolistic grip on manufactured housing lending. In 2010, Vanderbilt Mortgage—Clayton’s lending arm—paid a $2.8 million settlement to home buyers in North Carolina, after the State attorney general and commissioner of banks accused them of fraud for utilizing inaccurate information to obtain loans for consumers and for inflating the prices of manufactured homes. b1030 This is the type of abuse that my amendment seeks to address. Making sure that lenders who have engaged in abusive practices abide by the rules set forth in DoddFrank and carried out by the Consumer Bureau is especially important now that the Trump administration is attempting to undermine the independence of the agency. After the illegal move to install Mick Mulvaney as acting Director and then his quick move to freeze all the hiring, the supervision, and new regulations at the Consumer Bureau, it is clear that abusive financial institutions that simply rip off consumers will have free rein to continue harming them. That includes not only conglomerates like Clayton Homes, but repeat offenders, such as Wells Fargo, an institution that has illegally modified mortgages, charged fraudulent mortgage rates, and steered borrowers into predatory mortgage loans. American families deserve better. At an absolute minimum, a lender who has already proven that they cannot be trusted to originate responsible loans should not be awarded with diminished standards, particularly in an industry like manufactured housing, which is typically the only affordable option for many financially vulnerable consumers. Mr. Speaker, time and time again, my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle talk about how they are for Main Street America and for the rural communities that Democrats have forgotten. So why is it that they want to allow bad actors to prey upon rural families? According to the Housing Assistance Council, while manufactured housing only makes up 6 percent of all housing nationally, it makes up 14 to 15 percent in rural and small town communities. We need to be doing more to help rural families, not making it easier for bad actors to just rip them off. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, this is a vaguely worded and unneeded MTR. We continue to hear from our friends from the other side of the aisle that we don’t have sufficient consumer protections in place, but I wonder how denying a lowincome family access to credit to buy an affordable home is somehow construed as consumer protection. I wonder how denying a lowincome family the ability to own a home at a lower cost with a lower monthly payment somehow can be construed as consumer protection. I wonder how a policy that has led to a 22 percent drop in the availability of manufactured housing credit can somehow be construed as consumer protection. Only in Washington could you have such an absurd result, but I have good news for all Members of the House. After the passage of H.R. 1699, guess what. Manufactured housing loans will still be subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. They will still be subject to the Fair Housing Act. They will still be subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. They will still be subject to the Truth in Lending Act. They will still be subject to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. They will still be subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. And the list, Mr. Speaker, goes on and on and on. What we have heard is an attempt again by Washington elites to take away affordable housing. No one who votes against H.R. 1699 ought to be able to look themselves in the mirror and claim they are an advocate for affordable housing, not when they take it away, not when we have seen a 22 percent decrease after the actions of the elites at the socalled Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It shouldn’t be done. It is time to reject this motion to recommit. It is time to stand for low and moderateincome Americans. It is time to stand for affordable housing. It is time for us to vote for H.R. 1699. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5minute votes on: Passage of the bill, if ordered; and Agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal, if ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—yeas 193, nays 227, not voting 13, as follows:

RECOGNIZING PERKASIE’S 108TH COMMUNITY CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTING (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, this Saturday evening, Santa Claus will arrive in the Borough of Perkasie atop a borough electric truck to light the town’s Christmas tree and, in doing so, continue a tradition over 100 years old. Since 1909, residents of this small borough in upper Bucks County have gathered together to participate in the community tree lighting ceremony recognized as the oldest tree lighting in the Nation. While a lot has changed over the generations, community leaders, elected officials, and local residents have kept this annual event’s unique, smalltown charm and enshrined it as a timeless Christmas ritual. Now in its 108th year, this official start to the holiday season continues to serve not only as a source of pride for the people of Perkasie, but also an example of what makes the communities across my district special and an honor to represent. I am proud to recognize Perkasie’s 108th community Christmas tree lighting and join in the celebration of this enduring holiday tradition. 
THE GOP TAX PLAN (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, the GOP tax plan is more than a bad deal for most working class and middle class Americans. It is a tax scam. Many families that will be hit the hardest by this tax plan are New Yorkers. It will cost New Yorkers a total of $17 billion, and they are my constituents. Repealing the State and local tax deduction, also known as SALT, is an assault on my constituents. My district will have the highest tax increases in the Nation without SALT. Mr. Speaker, repealing SALT means that 760,000 New Yorkers residing across the State will have their taxes increased. This is a bad deal for them and all Americans. This will mean an average of almost $5,000 for middle class families. Investing in education, firefighters, police services, and many other essential services keep our cities running. They are not an option. City services are not a luxury, and we should not be punishing taxpayers who pay for them. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this tax scam and negotiate a better deal. 
WATER IS LIFE (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, when the sun barely peeks over the sky, millions of women and children across the developing world wake up and make their daily, dangerous walk in search of the necessity of life: water. They walk for miles in waterscarce regions to a well or polluted river for water. During these long walks, they are often put at risk of sexual abuse and assault. Also, bad guys control the wells and abuse women in return for the sometimes polluted water. The timeconsuming search for water results in rape, pregnancy, child kidnapping, and high educational dropout rates. Access to water, sanitation, and hygiene prevents disease. It also improves the safety and security of women and children across the entire world. It is encouraging to see our Nation and Congress recognizing water as the global security crisis that it is and the need to build capacity to clean water. With our Godgiven resources, we have it within our power and our duty to help others access clean water—the key to life. And that is just the way it is. 
WORLD AIDS DAY (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, today is the 29th World AIDS Day. Let us commemorate those who lost their lives and commit to reducing the 37,000 new HIV infections that occur each year in the United States. In my hometown of Newark, New Jersey, new HIV cases have been rising among young people under the age of 25. According to experts, the rise in new HIV/AIDS cases among young people in Newark is linked to the opioid crisis. Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of discussion lately about the opioid crisis, but we forget that it is linked to so many other issues—mental health access, poverty, communicable disease, joblessness, and the list goes on. Congress can help end the opioid crisis and the HIV/AIDS crisis here in the United States soon. But to do that, we must increase funding for healthcare access, mental health treatment, antipoverty programs, disease control, education, and access to HIV PrEP medication. 
RECOGNIZING MICHAEL MCDERMOTT of HOMER, NEW YORK (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Michael McDermott of Homer, New York. Mike is a veteran of the United States Navy, having served from 1964 through 1967, including 13 months of service in Vietnam. When Mike returned home from the Navy and Vietnam, he became active in the Homer community serving as a village trustee for 6 years and mayor for 6 years. Mike’s true passion has been as an advocate for his fellow veterans through his service at the American Legion Post 465 in Homer where he has been a member for over 34 years. During his time with Post 465, Mike has served in many roles, including commander for 13 years. He also served as commander of the Cortland County American Legion. Mike is also involved in State and national leadership for The American Legion. He serves on the National Security Council for The American Legion and with the National and New York American Legion Press Associations. Most importantly, Mike continuously gives back to Cortland County’s and Homer’s veterans, hosting a veterans service fair and supporting veterans’ causes throughout the village and county each and every year. We are grateful to compassionate citizens like Michael McDermott throughout our communities, and we are grateful for their service and dedication to our Nation’s veterans. Thank you to Michael McDermott from a giving and warm community. We appreciate his service. f 
WORLD AIDS DAY (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate World AIDS Day. The theme this year is Increasing Impact Through Transparency, Accountability, and Partnerships. First, I would like to thank Leader PELOSI for her steadfast commitment to fighting HIV and AIDS and for guaranteeing strong United States leadership in this area. As the cofounder and cochair of the bipartisan Congressional HIV/AIDS Caucus with my good friend, Congresswoman ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN , we have seen significant progress that we have made in the global fight against HIV. Year after year, Congress has come together in a bipartisan way to stop the spread of this disease. From PEPFAR and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria— which I was very proud to help write— to the Ryan White CARE Act and the Minority AIDS Initiative, the United States has been a global leader in committing the critical resources needed to end this disease both here at home and abroad. Partly due to our efforts, over 20 million people around the world have access to lifesaving antiretroviral treatment. Twenty million people getting lifesaving medicine is more than the population of the State of New York. So in memory of those who died much too soon, let’s recommit ourselves to ending AIDS by 2030 and realizing an AIDSfree generation. f 
70TH ANNIVERSARY OF NATIONAL URBAN SECURITY TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY (Mr. DONOVAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the 70th anniversary of the National Urban Security Technology Laboratory, also known as NUSTL. Located in New York City, NUSTL has been a critical asset in protecting our homeland since 1947. It began as a lab to measure radioactive fallout. Now as part of the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Directorate, it has been transformed into a oneofakind testing and evaluation laboratory for the first responder community. I have had the opportunity to visit NUSTL and saw firsthand the impressive work being done on a daily basis. It is constantly developing and testing new tools that ensure the brave women and men on our front lines can protect our homeland, and it is critical they have the resources needed to continue their innovative work. I thank the dedicated women and men of NUSTL for their services. Congratulations on this important anniversary. I look forward to continuing to celebrate your remarkable accomplishments for years to come. 
OPPOSE SENATE TAX BILL (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the Senate’s version of the tax reform bill because this bill will hurt the central coast in California. By fully repealing the State and local tax deduction, 177,000 households in my district that deduct an average of $23,000 each year will be hurt. By repealing the student loan interest deduction, low and middleincome students in my district will find college further out of reach and will be hurt. By allowing individual tax cuts to expire on people earning less than $75,000, over 140,000 households in my district will see their taxes go up and they will be hurt. Now, with confirmation that the tax cuts will not pay for themselves but will add over $1 trillion to our debt, this tax reform bill will be a tax burden bill not only for my constituents in my district, but for all of our constituents in our Nation. Worse, this bill will hurt 
not only my two daughters, but all of our sons and daughters. That is why I oppose the Senate bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
NO FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES (Mr. CULBERSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, over a year ago, Kate Steinle, a young woman in San Francisco, was murdered by a criminal illegal alien and died in the arms of her father. At that time, as chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations, I swore that I would do whatever it would take to cut off every dollar of Federal money to every sanctuary city in America. I persuaded the previous Attorney General to put that policy in place. Thankfully, with President Trump’s election and the appointment of our new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, they moved aggressively to enforce existing laws, secure our border, and restore respect for the rule of law in this great Nation. It is appalling and outrageous that a jury in San Francisco acquitted the killer who murdered Kate Steinle. This should renew our zeal as the Representatives of the people of this country to restore respect for the rule of law by cutting off every dollar of Federal money to every sanctuary city in American and to do whatever it takes to protect our citizens from criminal aliens who enter this country illegally and then commit crimes against the people of this great Nation. What happened in San Francisco is an outrage, and I will not rest until we cut off every dollar to every sanctuary city in the United States of America. 
TAX SCAM (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, the Republican tax scam picks clear winners and losers, yet our colleagues are rushing it through Congress faster than President Trump can retweet British racists. Let’s be clear: the winners in this tax scam are the country’s wealthiest, including Donald Trump, his family, and his billionaire cronies in his Cabinet. Meanwhile, students, middle class families, homeowners, and seniors across this country are the losers. They are left holding the bag. Californians get an especially raw deal because my Republican colleagues want to impose an unfair double tax on the State and local taxes that we pay. There is more bad news for Californians. Homeowners will be hit by a new cap on mortgage interest deductions, students will have to start paying taxes on student loan interest, graduate students will lose taxfree tuition waivers, and biotech companies who focus on ultra rare diseases will see their tax credit disappear. The Republican tax bill is unbelievably bad and historically unpopular, for good reason, but it is not too late for my Republican colleagues to stop it. f 
REMEMBERING ROSA PARKS (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Rosa Parks, who, 62 years ago today, changed the face of the United States. On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks refused a bus driver’s orders to give up her seat on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama. This simple act led to a bus boycott that helped to energize the civil rights movement. Reflecting on that day, Rosa Parks once said: ‘‘The only tired I was, was tired of giving in.’’ She didn’t give up. She didn’t give in. Rosa Parks reminds us that we all must never, never give in when faced with injustice. Her brave actions have inspired all of us. Each and every one of us have an opportunity to stand up, sit down, or kneel for what is right. It is because of civil rights champions like Rosa Parks that future generations can grow up in a nation that is free and fair for all. 
REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN BAD TAX POLICY (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, the Republican tax plan that provides massive, permanent tax cuts to the largest corporations and tax increases for millions of middle class Americans is bad tax policy. Let’s be honest about what it does. This $1.5 trillion tax cut will trigger cuts to domestic programs in the amount of $150 billion every year, including $25 billion in cuts to Medicare, with 55 million Americans who rely on it being put at risk if this bill becomes law. Mr. Speaker, it is bad enough that this tax policy favors the largest corporations over middle class Americans, but to effect these kinds of massive cuts by tricking the American people in order to try to do it is shameful. We have to defeat this bill, prevent these massive cuts, and protect the 55 million Americans on Medicare from a $25 billion cut. 
SALT DEDUCTION (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I want to quote from one of my colleagues from California: ‘‘Eliminating the State and local tax deduction would assure that almost all of the bill’s tax cuts would be distributed to other States, leaving California with the bill.’’ That was from my Republican colleague, DARRELL ISSA. Mr. Speaker, he was right on this. The Republican tax plan is cruel in so many ways. But perhaps the worst provision specifically targets States like California, New York, and New Jersey. Our States have stepped into the breach left by the Federal Government. We have raised taxes to pay for infrastructure. We have raised taxes to pay for hospitals. We have raised taxes to pay for schools. Now the Republicans want to punish us? Mr. Speaker, this is a political game, plain and simple. Californians are smart enough to see through it. 
FACING A CRISIS IN OUR COUNTRY (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today, in Federal district court in Washington, Michael Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI, a felony. It is a strong indication that he is cooperating with the Mueller investigation concerning Russia and its involvement with President Trump and his team and the election of the President of the United States. We are facing a crisis in our country with our Constitution, our form of government, and the rule of law. I have filed a bill to amend the Constitution to not allow pardons of people from any President’s campaign team or family. I am also the sponsor of a bill that says you can’t fire a special counsel without cause. The special counsel would have the right to seek redress in court. We must be ready to protect Bob Mueller and the integrity of the rule of law in this country, for I foresee this President firing him, as Nixon did in the Saturday Night Massacre. We are repeating the horrors of Watergate and the shredding of our Constitution, common sense, and decency. 
ISSUES OF THE WEEK The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FERGUSON ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, as folks head back to their districts—and I will be doing so shortly—it is important to take a look at some things that have been rather important here in our country. 
The Department of Justice does need an investigation into the matters that have been raised and clearly were not handled properly regarding the Russian Uranium One program and the sale of a significant percentage of United States uranium, ultimately, to Russia. There appears to be collusion, for sure. It is still staggering to think that the person who accepted the role as special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, would accept that, knowing that he and the person that selected him as special prosecutor, Mr. Rosenstein, were involved in the Russian investigation that went on for a number of years and involved a person working undercover and clearly established for Director Mueller, as head of the FBI, and for Mr. Rosenstein, the U.S. Attorney, that Russia was trying to corner the market by acquiring American uranium. Yet, while you had a man like Jeff Sessions trying to go out of his way to ensure that nobody could say he acted inappropriately—I think it was done prematurely, but he recused himself— not wanting to be a burden to the President. As much as Attorney General Jeff Sessions was trying to be fair and avoid even the appearance of questions about him handling the Russian investigation, you had Robert Mueller and the Deputy Attorney General acting— or appeared to be—even more inappropriately than Jeff Sessions was acting, beyond the pale of honor, as they are two people involved in the investigation of Russia acquiring American uranium, even though it wasn’t just Hillary Clinton that signed off on it. It was also Eric Holder and some others. b1145 All that needed to be investigated, but not by the people who covered up the prior Russia investigation and saw to the sealing of many of the documents involving that investigation. In fact, Mr. Rosenstein’s name was actually on the motion to seal matters involved in that investigation. It seemed pretty clear that if you are going to go to the trouble of sealing an investigation like that, and the extraordinary measure of getting the person who is acting undercover, force him, threaten him, get him to sign a nondisclosure agreement under threat, seems to me that wasn’t an arm’s length transaction. That was done under coercion by the most powerful law enforcement people in the country at the time, threatening to bring down the full weight of the United States Government on the man who was working for them, helping them find the evidence that showed how Russia was acting so inappropriately and illegally trying to get hold of our uranium. Just when you think, ‘‘Well, just can’t be much more in the way of surprises,’’ The Daily Caller’s Richard Pollock has a story on November 30: ‘‘DOD Inspector General Opens Probe Into Alleged Retaliation by Obama Holdover.’’ It says: ‘‘The Pentagon’s Inspector General has launched a preliminary investigation into charges that James H. Baker, the Director of the Defense Department’s Office of Net Assessment, ONA, is retaliating against a whistleblower who warned of ‘rigged’ contracts to outside consultants, The Daily Caller News Foundation has confirmed. ‘‘The DCNF verified through two independent sources that the Acting IG, Glenn A. Fine, initiated a formal ‘Whistleblower Reprisal Investigation’ September 28 to look into allegations that Baker unleashed various reprisals against Adam Lovinger, a senior ONA official. Lovinger warned about potential sweetheart deals to politically connected outside contractors, including one with a woman Chelsea Clinton has referred to as her ‘best friend.’ ‘‘The IG is investigating Baker’s actions under Presidential Policy Directive19, an October 2012 directive designed to protect members of the intelligence community who report waste, fraud, and abuse. The directive pointedly states that it ‘prohibits retaliation against employees for reporting waste, fraud, and abuse.’ ‘‘Baker is an Obama holdover appointed by Secretary Ashton Carter in May 2015, who remains the ONA Director 11 months into the Trump administration.’’ I might insert here: This has got to be so frustrating to the President of the United States as the Senate Democrats continue to hold up efforts to get nominations confirmed so that he can start implementing the policies that he was elected to carry out. They are thwarting him by continuing to have Obama holdovers, even though that term apparently, we are told, offends our National Security Advisor McMaster—a guy who apparently can’t stand the President and is thwarting his efforts at every turn he can. But the guy is an Obama holdover. He should not be making calls, yet he is staying around, according to this information, to carry out vendettas against someone who was a whistleblower complaining of sweetheart deals to people, including Ms. Clinton’s best friend. Richard Pollock from The Daily Caller goes on to say: ‘‘Lovinger specifically protested $11.2 million in ONA contracts awarded over a decade to the Long Term Strategic Group, a company owned by Jacqueline Newmyer, a childhood friend of Chelsea Clinton. Clinton and Newmyer first met each other while attending Sidwell Friends School, an exclusive private Quaker school in the Nation’s Capital. They were in each others’ weddings, and, in 2011, Chelsea referred to Newmyer as her best friend. ‘‘Lovinger’s attorney, Sean M. Bigley, accuses Baker of continuing the . . . contract’’—with Chelsea Clinton’s friend—‘‘in the hopes it could help him in a Clinton Presidency. ‘‘‘We submit that Baker’s interest was his awareness of the LTSGClinton connection; his presumptive desire to exploit that to his advantage in the event of a Clinton election win; and the fact that contractors like LTSG served as a lucrative landing pad for ONA retirees,’ Bigley charged in a September 13 letter to Rear Admiral Kevin Sweeney, chief of staff for Defense Secretary James Mattis. ‘‘The IG’s decision to launch a preliminary investigation occurred as former highprofile national security officials are beginning to publicly weigh in about Baker’s allegedly retaliatory actions. ‘‘Richard Perle, Ronald Reagan’s former Assistant Secretary of Defense, told the DCNF of Lovinger, ‘He has been treated so badly. It’s a disgrace.’’’ He is talking about the whistleblower who pointed out this unseemly relationship and unfair awarding of contracts to the Clinton friend. Richard Pollock from The Daily Caller goes on to say: ‘‘Perle called Baker ‘a shallow and manipulative character that should have gone with the change in administration.’’’ Baker being the Obama holdover. In any event, it is just incredible when you think there surely can’t be any more shoes to drop about improprieties from the last administration. They just keep coming. But as a former prosecutor, former judge, former chief justice, what occurred in a decision by the jury in the Kate Steinle homicide is really extraordinary. You know, when I was handling cases as a felony judge, I know sometimes juries surprised me. But in this case, for a jury to find that he wasn’t—this person, this illegal alien who had been deported five times and who should have been deported the sixth, except San Francisco was protecting him, to the detriment of its residents, the jury comes back and says he wasn’t even negligent in firing the gun that killed Kate Steinle. I mean, that is just staggering beyond words. But when a verdict is seen that just goes against what the evidence shows clearly, I mean, it could have easily found that, yes, they don’t find him to be credible; but, of course, you had the judge—number one, you had the judge protecting him, going way beyond what would seem normal to many judges in order to protect this guy. His story was apparently that—well, actually he had several stories. So anytime a jury is presented with several different stories about how something happened coming from the same individual who is on trial, normally, is my experience in noticing, that if a jury finds that you lied to them about one thing, they seem to find it easier to find you guilty of what you are charged with. That often happens. Even sometimes when I might have been surprised that they could find someone guilty of the more serious charge, when there is a lesser included, like there was in this case—but it went back to where the jury felt like he had 
lied to us on this, so he is probably guilty of the crime. I mean, I am just talking from a practicality standpoint the way sometimes jurors look at things. But in this case, it didn’t bother the judge. And from what the jury was allowed to hear, that the judge didn’t obstruct, it should have been clear this was not an honest individual and that there is likely a very good chance he would lie to avoid a murder conviction, and that is why the different stories about how he came to shoot Kate Steinle as she walked along armin arm with her father. Just incredible. This story from John Diaz of the San Francisco Chronicle says: ‘‘As they awaited the verdict in the trial of Kate Steinle’s accused killer, her parents and brother had one overriding wish. It had nothing to do with the severity of the defendant’s conviction. ‘‘Above all, they wanted it to mark the end of a public profile they neither sought nor enjoyed. Each media interview, each exploitation of Kate’s name for political gain, each still shot of her smile on television only amplified the anguish of their loss. Yet they also wanted to convey their appreciation for the many strangers who, having heard their story, offered solace and assistance. ‘‘‘We just want to get this over with and move on with our lives and think about Kate on our terms. Nothing’s been on our terms. It’s been on everyone else’s terms,’ said Jim Steinle, who was strolling with his 32yearold daughter on a crowded San Francisco pier when she was shot and killed July 1, 2015. He, his wife, Liz Sullivan, and their son, Brad Steinle, sat down with the Chronicle recently at their longtime East Bay home for an exclusive interview they planned to be their last. ‘‘‘We have never had a second of anger—not a moment,’ Jim said. ‘Frustration, maybe, and sadness for sure, but no anger and no retaliation or vindictiveness or anything like that. We’re not that kind of people. Even if this guy gets 100 years in prison, it doesn’t solve anything; it doesn’t help anything. We would just like people to know . . . that’s the Steinles’ feelings.’ ‘‘They had decided not to attend court to hear the jury’s decision. ‘‘On Thursday, the verdict arrived: Jose Ines Garcia Zarate was acquitted of all murder and manslaughter charges. He was convicted merely of being a felon in possession of a firearm. ‘‘‘We’re just shocked—saddened and shocked . . . that’s about it,’ Jim said. ‘There’s no other way you can coin it. Justice was rendered, but it was not served.’ ‘‘Brad said he was ‘not surprised,’ considering the ‘epic failure’ that led Garcia Zarate to be released on the streets and end up with a loaded handgun on the pier that day.’’ b1200 ‘‘I’m stunned that they couldn’t even get him on using the weapon,’’ Brad said. It really is staggering. The jury could not find him guilty of even a negligent type homicide. Okay, you could have reasonable doubt, apparently. I don’t think most people would. But, in San Francisco, all they hear about from the media and elected officials is how the illegal aliens are the victims and not so much someone like Kate Steinle as a true victim. That sets a jury up to make an inappropriate finding. The Washington Examiner reports today, Anna Giaritelli: ‘‘Thousands of Twitter users on Friday were urging people to #boycottsanfrancisco after a jury there decided Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a five time deported Mexican man charged with shooting and killing Kate Steinle, was not guilty. ‘‘The Boycott San Francisco hashtag began trending on Twitter Friday morning as people vowed not to travel there or buy goods or services produced in the city.’’ Mr. Speaker, I don’t normally advocate any type of boycott, and I really don’t here. My thought is that people need to consider their own safety. When they are in dangerous places in the world, our State Department will issue a travel warning to Americans: Be careful. Try to avoid this area. It is not safe. It is dangerous. And I think that the Nation should have gotten a picture that in San Francisco they are far more concerned about making sure that illegal alien felons have a place for a hangout—a hideout. The HoleintheWall Gang would have been, apparently, very welcome there if they had only been illegal aliens, instead of simple outlaws. It is as if they want a monument in the Bay with a sign reading: Give us your outlaws, so long as they come in illegally. I have an article, also in the Washington Examiner by Anna Giaritelli. The headline is: ‘‘Trump: Kate Steinle verdict more reason to ‘Build the Wall!’’’ The President is exactly right; he is exactly right. I go back to the case of the gentleman who was, obviously, in the country illegally. I recall he had had nine DWIs. On a third DWI in Texas, it can be raised up to a felony. That is how he ended up in my court, but not on the third DWI. He had had many DWIs. It was not brought to the DA’s attention, because we had a terrific DA, but it just wasn’t brought to his attention that this guy already had so many DWIs. The immigration authorities hadn’t done anything, until, finally, he was driving drunk, hit another car, and did serious injury to people in the car. They were very loving, caring people. But he was clearly an alcoholic. So I sent him to prison, considering the safety of people in Texas. This guy was out there driving drunk that many times. It was a wonder he hadn’t killed somebody. He certainly would kill somebody if he was not stopped. And, since he had not been deported, I felt, considering the need for deterrence, for punishment, for public safety, all that dictated that I needed to send him to prison; so I did. I was shocked that, within about 6 months, he was in my court again. I recognized him, and I asked him what he was doing back in my court. He said that he was charged with another DWI as a felony. I said: But I ordered him to prison. How does he end up, just in a matter of a few months, being back in my court for another felony? And he explained that, about 3 months after I sent him to prison, he was picked up by the immigration authorities at the prison, taken to the border, ordered to walk across the border, and he did. And he said that he waited until they drove away, and then he walked back across the border and ended up back in Smith County, Texas. So, on that occasion, I thought: Man, they are going to only deport the man if I send him to prison. And we don’t have a wall. President Clinton certainly was not enforcing the border sufficiently during those years, so I thought: I still have to protect people here; so I will send him to a lockdown felony substance abuse facility where he is in a lockdown, he can’t go anywhere, a confined place, with others who are either drug addicts or alcoholics. I got a report 3 or 4 months after he went into the felony punishment for substance abuse defendants that the immigration authorities at the time picked him up and took him to the border. And if it happened the way that he was deported the time before, as he told me, they told him to walk across the border, he did, he waited until the border officials, the immigration officials, left, and then he came right back across the border immediately. The only thing I don’t know is where he ended up, if he continued to follow the trend and continued coming back into the country. A law enforcement officer said: Well, one thing for sure, he knows he doesn’t want to come back to your court because he is going to get locked up one way or another. So, in all likelihood, after the immigration officials drove away, he probably came back and went to somebody else’s county where he heard they didn’t have a judge like me who would enforce the law. But it put people at risk, and Americans have known that. And Candidate Trump promised to do something about it, and he sure is trying, but he needs Congress’ help. I still don’t have any doubt that, at some point, we are going to get concessions from Mexico that will pay for the wall, but it needs to be done for our own safety, our own benefit. And even though there are those who say that is an outrageous thing to do to Mexico, it actually is the kindest, best thing we could ever do for Mexico. Those who have been there—my wife and I honeymooned in Mexico—it is a 
beautiful, beautiful place, a wonderful place. We have vacationed there, certainly not in recent years. But it is incredible, the beauty that lies in different places in Mexico. And we know—from people there and from people who have come from Mexico into the United States: many of them I have gotten to know and love, people I went to church with, people who came legally—these are hardworking, Godfearing folks. And although it might be an over generalization, still the fact is that most of the people who emigrate to the United States from Mexico whom I have ever gotten to know—and it is a lot—they love God, they love their family, and they are hardworking. I also have to think an abundance of those three feelings are what made America the greatest, freest, most opportune country in the history of the world. I was reading again last night about Solomon’s reign in Israel. Israel didn’t even have the individual assets during that incredible wise man’s reign—well, wise until he started having so many wives. That will take anybody’s wisdom away from them. But an incredible place to have lived, with all of the advantages that were found in Israel, back during Solomon’s reign. But they didn’t have individual opportunity, individual assets, individual freedoms, like we have in America. And some people get to thinking—because they don’t know the history of the world—they get to thinking that: Gee, even if things don’t work out and we lose our freedom here in America, another America will pop up somewhere: a country that loves freedom to the extent that its own citizens will travel to other places in the world and fight and die for other people’s freedom. I mean, there has just never been a place like the United States of America. And I have mentioned him before, and I will mention him again. The gentleman from west Africa named Ebenezer, an older gentleman, who, with other west Africans, met with me before I left. My wife had been there with Mercy Ships. And, ultimately, at the end of our reception together, he pointed out and said: America has been getting weak, and we were excited when you elected your first Black President, but we have seen America get weaker and weaker. And you need to know and tell people in Washington that when America gets weak, we suffer. He said: You know, we are Christians. We all know where we are going when we die. But our only chance of having peace in this life is if America is strong. There has not been another country, that I can find, in the history of the world that fought for, not imperialism, as some ignorant of history have said about the United States. Obviously—it should be obvious—not imperialism, because people in Germany and France speak German and they speak French, and people in Japan speak Japanese. I mean, we were not out for imperialism, we were out for freedom. We liberated Kuwait under George H. W. Bush. We didn’t demand that they become colonies of the United States. They are an independent nation. In Bosnia, in so many places, we have spilled American blood for the freedom and benefit of others. There has never been a nation like this that had so many individual assets and opportunities. But whether or not they will continue has a lot to do with what this body does. A wall between us and Mexico—where it is appropriate, where it is needed— would be the best thing that we could do for Mexico because they have the natural resources, they have a better location for trade than the United States. They have hardworking, God fearing people. So why are they not one of the top ten economies in the world? b1215 It is clear the answer is corruption. Why is there so much corruption in Mexico? Because of the drug cartels and the drug money, the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars—billions, with a B, of dollars—that has gone to the drug cartels through the purchases of drugs, and, of course, they have gotten into bringing people across the border illegally. Border patrolmen have told me on many occasions I have been down there during the night that there is not an inch of the border between Mexico and the United States that is not under the auspices of some drug cartel. Some drug cartels, I was told, allow some Mexican gangs to carry out their jurisdiction and enforce their jurisdiction on that part of the border they control, but what the border patrolmen would tell me is that there is no one who comes across the border illegally in that drug cartel’s sector who does not pay or does not do something to get the permission of the drug cartel to come in; because they are all told, when they are brought in illegally, that for those who still owe money and have agreed to work in the city where you are ordered to go by the drug cartel, if you fail to keep paying the drug cartels the money you owe them, you keep selling drugs to repay the money or engage in prostitution to repay the money, if you fail to do that: We have people all over the U.S. They will come and they will kill you. This stuff is going on in the United States. When Woodrow Wilson was President, certainly not my favorite President, but even Woodrow Wilson, after a Mexican gang led by Pancho Villa came across the U.S. border one time too many and killed a bunch of American families, Woodrow Wilson said enough is enough. They didn’t have the wherewithal to build a wall where they needed it back then, so he sent American troops. Something new called the National Guard was also utilized. I have asked for the official number of U.S. troops that Woodrow Wilson, as President, sent to the border to enforce the border, and I have gotten anywhere from 15,000 to 150,000. I continue to get different figures. It may have been 75,000. Regardless, Woodrow Wilson sent American troops to stop people from illegally entering the country. He also sent a general after Pancho Villa. In the last administration, I have heard it said that no one has done more than the Obama administration to protect our border. I know no one said that intentionally misleading. They just were not aware that Woodrow Wilson sent potentially tens of thousands of American troops to the border so that nobody came across into the United States illegally to kill Americans the way Pancho Villa had done that invoked President Wilson into sending the troops. President Trump doesn’t want to have to send so many precious American lives to stand around the border protecting us. Why should they, when, in so many places, all we need is to build a wall and have it enforced the way Israel enforces its wall. The irony about the Israeli wall, as I have visited and been shown around their socalled wall, 75 percent of the Israeli wall that has saved an abundance of children’s lives who were being killed by Palestinian radical Islamists—they could walk across, right into a basketball court or a schoolyard, blow themselves up, killing as many children as they could; walk into a restaurant where innocent people were sitting, having pleasant times together, many families, and blow themselves up to kill as many Israelis as possible. They did a remarkable job of cutting the violence by building a wall, 75 percent of which is a fence. The difference is, though, that their fence is monitored 24/7, and nobody comes across without them noticing and having people on the spot before the person can actually get across. We could do that. If Israel can do that, we could do that. Although there are Mexican leaders who have appeared to have been outraged, they have to know deep in their heart that, if we build a wall and stop the flow of American money, billions of American dollars into Mexico’s drug cartels, they can’t fund the corruption; they can’t keep killing any police official that gets in their way, putting their heads on pikes to set an example for others that you don’t mess with the drug cartels in Mexico. If we bring that flow of billions of dollars to a tiny trickle, then Mexico can begin to experience the kind of success that they should be experiencing. We could be the best neighbor Mexico could ever have if we just help them by building a wall, stopping anything from crossing the border illegally, including drugs, and you would have people wanting to go to Mexico and live permanently from America if they could trust the law enforcement situation there, which they really can’t right now. 
I know there are plenty of Americans who have bought property there, but the restrictions on Americans buying property in Mexico is so significant, if we applied the same terms on Mexicans seeking to buy property in America, the whole of Mexico would be absolutely outraged that we were treating them the way they treat us. As this article in the Washington Examiner points out that President Trump said it, and he is accurate in saying it, the Kate Steinle verdict is one more reason to build the wall. I hope and I pray we won’t have to wait until more people are killed, as is occurring regularly, by illegal aliens. It doesn’t even have to be deaths. I mean, constituents of mine have been harmed by people who come into this country illegally, driving without a driver’s license or driving without insurance, hitting cars, whether they do injury to the occupant or not. I mentioned before, a girl weeping. She is in high school. She has to work. An illegal alien rammed her car, had no insurance, and she and her mom, single mom, could only afford the insurance for others, liability insurance; they couldn’t afford the insurance to cover themselves, so she couldn’t replace her car. If she can’t replace her car, she cries that: I can’t work, and my mother and I can’t live. How can you let people come in illegally and do such harm to Americans and wreck our lives? He even drove away in his car without a license, without insurance. He drove away in his car after he totaled hers. It is time that we did the job we took an oath to do. If we enforce the Constitution, the laws of the land, then Americans will be protected and we become stronger. Because of the idealistic nature of this Nation, it has assured the freedom of more and more people: first the people in our own Nation—the Constitution eventually came to represent what it said, all people were to be treated equally—and now to the point that, for 100 years, we have been in wars off and on that ensured freedom for others as well. It is time to build the wall. In the meantime, hopefully, we are about to have a major tax reform bill. I would like to have seen a flat tax across the board. You make more, you pay more. The more you make, the more you pay. That is not what we have done, but it is a reform. It will mean that even more poorer Americans pay no income tax, and the poorer working poor, fewer of them will pay any income tax, and people will pay less tax. The only rate that is not lowered in the tax proposal the House and Senate had was the wealthiest Americans. That was left at 39.6 percent. Some of us think we should have had a smooth, even percentage cut across the board for everybody. How could you argue that that was not fairness? Republican leaders thought: No. We will leave the highest rate on the wealthiest Americans. We will leave that percentage right where it is so we can’t be accused of taxing the poor to help the rich. Now, some will take the actual numbers of the amount of money that will be saved and say: See, people who are making more are saving more. Well, yeah. People who pay a lot more in income tax will save a little bit, but not nearly the percentage that people who are the working poor will save percentagewise. The best thing for the American economy will be the cut in corporate taxes. The corporate tax has been a gimmick by both parties for so many years, telling people: Oh, no. These rich, greedy corporations, we will make them pay. Well, that is hiding the ball, because the fact is no corporation can stay in business unless they pass on the cost of the corporate tax to their customers, their clients, for their goods and services. They have to pass on that cost or they can’t stay in business. They just can’t. We have the highest corporate tax of any industrialized nation in the world. China is a little less than half of our 35 percent. That is why President Trump was pushing so hard, as were many of us: Let’s at least take it to 15 percent. Whatever the percentage is, unless it is zero, it is a tariff on Americans’ goods and services. How insane for a country to put a tariff on its own goods and services so that it makes us less competitive in the world market. If you took away the 35 percent tariff called the corporate tax on American made goods, we could compete globally; but because we put such a huge tariff on our own goods, 35 percent, then our goods are far too often not competitive in the world market. b1230 If we make our own products competitive anywhere, people around the world, if American prices were more competitive, they would love to buy American products. When some of us went to China, talked to CEOs about why they moved there, I heard the number one answer being the corporate tax. I loved hearing them say: Now, our best quality control was in America. We have got better quality control. We have got better quality of workers. I love hearing that around the world. Yeah, the best workers are in America, best quality control for our products is in America, lowest margin of error among our plants is in America. We make good stuff. Those who take pride in what they do, that is an American way. People would love to buy them, but not when our 35 percent tariff we put on our own corporatemade goods are not able to compete as they would if we removed it. But at least at the 15 percent the President and some of us were pushing for—we would have undercut China’s income tax for corporations, and just even a point or two undercutting China’s income tax or corporate income tax would have brought so many manufacturing jobs back to America. I know there are elitists in America who say: Well, yeah, but those manufacturing jobs, those are not for classy countries like America. No, we have evolved upward into a service economy. We provide elegant services. We are not into manufacturing goods. We leave that to more developing nations. But the historical fact is clear: any powerful nation that cannot manufacture what it needs in a time of war will not be a powerful nation past the next war. Just as Jesus assured there will always be wars and rumors of war, we have to be aware. As long as we are in this world, we have to protect our country, protect ourselves, and it doesn’t matter if you are a Christian or not a Christian. Those who are Christian sometimes say: Oh, yeah, but Jesus said we have got to love our neighbors as ourselves. Blessed are the meek, his Sermon on the Mount and all. That is absolutely the way Christians are supposed to live, but when they are acting as the government, we are to be mindful of Romans, Romans 13. The government is to be an encourager of good conduct. We are not supposed to design programs to lure people away from their productivity, lure them away from their potential and that wonderful, awesome feeling of multiple employers wanting you to come work for them. Too many young people have never experienced that. I really believe, with a major tax cut like we have passed in the House, there will be more and more young people that will know that feeling. It is such a gratifying feeling when multiple firms want you to work for them. You can decide whether you want to be on your own, start your own business, or go to work for someone. It is just an awesome feeling. The economy has struggled so, never hit 3 percent growth in any year in the last 8 years, and now we have had 2 months backtoback where we hit over 3 percent growth. If we can do that, we are going to bring in more Federal revenue, even with the lower taxes. It is going to be great for America. People are going to see what it is like to have more companies wanting you. We do need to come to grips with the number of people we are allowing in this country, both illegally and legally. No country in the world allows a million people to come into its country legally like the United States does. We allow that many legally. I happen to be helping a fellow Texan who emigrated from Mexico, has been here on visas legally for 15 years. She is trying to get her citizenship. She has done everything she can legally, but it gets really frustrating for someone from Mexico who is following the rules, 
following the law, doing everything according to American law. That is the kind of person we want to come here, someone who has respect for the law. We are helping her try to get her citizenship, but, unfortunately, that part of our government is only now looking at applications from September of last year. Hoping not to have to get yet another visa, surely this greatest Nation in the world could move faster on applications for citizenship and visas. Surely we could at least work as fast as Third World nations that don’t have computers. Apparently, in some cases, we don’t. We owe it to all of those who have sought to come into America legally and to all of those who were born here, at least born here and are American citizens. The children of diplomats who are born in the United States are not U.S. citizens. Originally, when the 14th Amendment passed—and you can go back and look at the debate, back at the time— the advocates for the 14th Amendment were saying obviously there will be people who have children born in America whose children will not be citizens. They contemplated that would be diplomats from foreign countries who are in this country legally as diplomats of foreign countries. Their children would not be citizens, and they are not. They also contemplated that, if you snuck into this country illegally, certainly your children would not be citizens. That would be insane. Yet what they thought would be insane is the way things have been interpreted for far too long. We ought to be able to say who can come into the country legally and approve anybody who comes in, whether legally or illegally, for citizenship on our own terms. That is the way it needs to be if we are going to perpetuate this amazing blessing of a country. I didn’t deserve to be born here, but I was. And if we are going to continue to be a light on the hill that so many hundreds of millions of people around the world want to come to, then we can’t let hundreds of millions of people come here or it would overwhelm the country and it would no longer be a place anybody wanted to come. At that point, the greatest hope for peace in the world, the United States, would cease to be the United States we have come to know and love. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
RECOGNIZING WORLD AIDS DAY (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank you, and I want to extend my courtesies to the gentleman from Texas for his courtesy as well, Mr. AL GREEN . I stand here today because this is World AIDS Day. Since 1988, we have commemorated World AIDS Day. I have on my lapel, if you will, on my shawl, a red ribbon which symbolizes remembrance. Earlier today I called in to the Thomas Street Clinic, as I have celebrated with them for many years, and while I was in Washington, I wanted to give them the recognition as fighters against HIV/AIDS. It does not seem that long ago, but HIV/AIDS affected many around the world before the disease even made its way to America’s shores. Countless researchers, healthcare providers, politicians, and educators have contributed to the global initiative to contain and eventually eliminate its presence in all corners of the world. I remember going to Zambia on the first Presidential trip dealing with HIV/AIDS around the world. 38.6 million people worldwide were living with HIV at the end of 2005, and more than 25 million have died of AIDS since 1981. In December, we remember that, and that is what this day is: a day of remembrance, when an estimated 1 million to 1.2 million HIVpositive individuals live in the United States and approximately 56,000 new infections occur every year. Mr. Speaker, my district is impacted, upwards of 22,000 people. Texas is impacted. Today is a day of remembrance to honor those we lost and to commit to those we fight for. Mr. Speaker, established by the World Health Organization in 1988, December 1st is universally known as World AIDS Day. World AIDS Day serves to focus global attention on the devastating impact of the HIV/ AIDS epidemic. All governments, national AIDS programs, churches, community organizations and individuals are given the opportunity to display their commitment to fight this deadly disease. It has been more than 30 years since the first AIDS case was reported in the United States. It does not seem like it was too long ago, but HIV/AIDS had affected many around the world before the disease even made its way to America’s shores. Since then, countless researchers, healthcare providers, politicians, and educators have contributed to the global initiative to contain and eventually eliminate its presence in all corners of the world. Although HIV/AIDS is no longer a mysterious and mischaracterized entity, it is the most relentless and indiscriminate killer of our time. And though a diagnosis is no longer the sealing of an immediate fate, it is the beginning of an indefinite battle for life, adequate health care, and for social belonging. With an estimated 38.6 million people worldwide living with HIV at the end of 2005, and more than 25 million people having died of AIDS since 1981, December 1st is a date which serves to remind everyone that action makes a difference in the fight against HIV/ AIDS. Let there be no mistake, we are here to acknowledge that AIDS is a deadly enemy against which we must join all our forces to fight and eliminate. Americans should be reminded that HIV/ AIDS does not discriminate. With an estimated 1,039,000 to 1,185,000 HIVpositive individuals living in the U.S., and approximately 56,000 new infections occurring every year, the U.S., like other nations around the world, is deeply affected by HIV/AIDS. The detrimental effects of HIV/AIDS have also hit home. More than 65,000 people in Texas are living with HIV. Thirtysix percent more Texans are living with HIV today than just seven years ago. In 2010, studies showed that 1 in every 3 diagnosed persons in Texas were not getting proper medical treatment. We must make certain that every affected individual receive efficient medical treatment that will afford them long life. Not only is the state of Texas suffering from HIV and AIDS, but my district, the 18th Congressional District of Texas, has seen an increasing number of people living with the disease. In 2010, there were over 22,000 reported persons living with HIV (nonAIDS) in the greater Houston area, and more than 9,000 reported persons living with AIDS. This problem continues to escalate as there have been 1,700 new infections each year among individuals in Harris County, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. We must continue to fight a tough fight to reverse all of these costly and tragic trends. I will continue to sponsor and cosponsor legislation that addresses the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The fight is not over. We must continue to stand strong in our struggle to conquer some old and new challenges that we as Americans and members of the global community encounter. Today, Friday, December 1st, is World AIDS Day. And, we will focus on HIV/AIDS, prevention and awareness, and continue to fight for life. Together, we will help all of our friends, relatives, and children live healthy and full lives. f 
REASONS WHY PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP SHOULD BE IMPEACHED The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. BUCSHON ). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the leadership for this opportunity. I greatly appreciate any opportunity to stand here in the well of the Congress of the United States of America. I rise today, Mr. Speaker, because I do love my country. I rise because I want persons to know that there are certain things that are not being presented properly, and one of the things that is not being presented properly as it relates to impeachment is the notion that a President has to commit a crime to be impeached. I would like to talk about this for a moment and then address some of the issues associated with impeachment. 
A President doesn’t have to commit a crime to be impeached. Article II, section 4 of the Constitution of the United States of America is where we find information, if you will, on impeachment. It is stated in Article II, section 4 that a President can be impeached for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that a misdemeanor is defined as a misdeed. There is a definition associated with criminology, but when the Framers of the Constitution decided that impeachment would be a remedy for a President who might be styled a runaway President, they decided that ‘‘misdemeanor’’ would mean misdeed. In fact, we have had a President impeached for a misdeed. Andrew Johnson, in 1868, President, was impeached for the high misdemeanor, misdeed, if you will, of saying things that were unkind about Congress. He committed no crime. He breached no statute. He spoke ill will of Congress, and as such, he was impeached in article X of the Articles of Impeachment that were placed against him. I would like to share some intelligence from some others who have spoken on this issue. Gene Healy has spoken on the issue. He is with the Cato Institute, and his article is styled ‘‘The Overcriminalization of Impeachment.’’ In this article, he states explicitly, on the second page, for whose who might have a copy of it—I have filed this with the House previously—‘‘Impeachable offenses aren’t limited to crimes.’’ He indicates that that is settled quite well among constitutional scholars. He also goes on to say: ‘‘Had the Framers restricted impeachment to statutory offenses, they’d have rendered the power a ‘nullity’ from the start.’’ In the early Republic, there were very few crimes, and certainly not enough to cover the range of misdeeds—important word, ‘‘misdeeds’’— that would rightly disqualify public officials from continued service—misdeeds, misdemeanors. b1245 He goes on to say that it is important to get this straight because confusing impeachment with a criminal process can be harmful to our political health. It may lead us to stretch criminal law to get the President or his associates warping its future applications to ordinary citizens. It is important that we get this straight because a crime, obviously, can be an impeachable offense, but it can also be something that a person is not impeached for, a President is not impeached for, depending upon the severity, I suppose. But a President can also be impeached for the misdeeds committed while in office. One of the things that Mr. Healy addresses that I would like to point out that is important as it relates to why we have this belief that a President must be impeached for a crime is this: unfortunately, we have outsourced the investigative function associated with impeachment to some other body, to some independent agency, to the Justice Department, if you will. In so doing, we have given the impression that this is something that involves a crime. But the Framers of the Constitution thought long and hard about this, and they saw that there could be the appearance of impropriety, if we allowed the executive branch to investigate itself in the sense that the Justice Department is a part of the executive branch. So do you really want the executive branch investigating the President, who is the chief executive officer? There are times, such as what we have now, when you have the executive outsourcing the actual investigation to a third party. And my suspicion is that this can work quite well, but we should not conclude that because it is working, that because there is some functionality that seems to be positive for some, negative for others, that because it appears to be working that this is the only way that it can be done. We shouldn’t conclude that at the end of an investigation, if there is no finding of criminality, that an impeachment cannot go forward. Because notwithstanding the findings of a special investigator, or a special body that is assigned the task of investigating, we should not conclude that if there is not a finding of criminality that we cannot go forward with an impeachment. As a matter of fact, we can go forward with an impeachment while a body is performing this function, while a body is investigating. We can go forward before there is an investigation by a body. We can go forward after there is an investigation. The House of Representatives is the place where impeachment takes place. Any Member of the House of Representatives can bring Articles of Impeachment, and these Articles of Impeachment will have to be brought before the entirety of the House of Representatives. Impeachment is not limited to crimes committed, and a Member can bring Articles of Impeachment based upon the harm that a President is imposing upon society by virtue of the President’s acts, behavior, or misdeeds, if you will. The President can be impeached without committing a crime. I had the good fortune of being on a program with Chris Hayes last night. He is the host. He mentioned an article that is written by Ezra Klein. It is styled, ‘‘The case for normalizing impeachment. Impeaching an unfit President has consequences. But leaving one in office could be worse.’’ In this article that he has written, on the very last page he indicates that— by the way, I would commend this to persons to read in its entirety, but I am, for need of time, going to limit myself to excerpts. He indicates that: ‘‘Impeachment is not a power we should take lightly; nor is it one we should treat as too explosive. There will be Presidents who are neither criminals, nor mental incompetents but who are wrong for the role, who pose a danger to the country and the world.’’ This is true. It can happen. I will say more about the possibilities in just a moment. Then there is the article from The Times, a U.K. newspaper, that I would commend to persons, and it indicates that ‘‘MPs accuse Donald Trump of ‘spreading evil’ over Britain First retweets.’’ This is an article that I highly commend because it speaks of how things can extend beyond our borders that start within our borders. I will read some of the excerpts. It reads: ‘‘The Prime Minister said that Britain First, whose Twitter post the President retweeted, was a ‘hateful organization’ that ‘seeks to spread division and mistrust among communities.’ ‘‘She said the group stood in opposition to Britain, British values of respect, tolerance, and decency, and stressed that British Muslims were ‘peaceful, lawabiding people who have themselves been victims of attack, of terror by the far right.’’’ She went on to indicate, serving notice to Mr. Trump, that she would not shy away from tackling him if she thought these actions—excuse me—if she thought his actions misguided. She said: ‘‘The fact that we work together does not mean that we are afraid to say when we think the United States has got it wrong. And to be very clear with them, I am very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do.’’ We have been criticized greatly for the retweet that was inaccurate, a retweet that, quite frankly, could have been vetted. When you are the President of the United States of America, you have access to intelligence about things happening around the world. You can validate, you can verify, you can vet things that are presented to you. The President has access to the greatest intelligence operation in the world and could easily vet before tweeting. The information that was retweeted was not entirely correct, and it was hateful. It was designed to incite hate and it should not be the kind of thing that a President should retweet. I would like to also read the style of an article from Foreign Policy. This article is styled, ‘‘This Is How Every Genocide Begins.’’ This is by Daniel Altman. He indicates that Donald Trump’s retweeting antiMuslim propaganda videos in the most unAmerican—excuse me just a moment, please. I seem to be catching something. So please tolerate me if you would, Mr. Speaker. I thank the person who brought the elixir of life, water, over to me. 
Again, Donald Trump’s retweeting of antiMuslim propaganda videos is the most unAmerican thing he has done as President. And he goes on to explain that we have to remove this President and his administration as soon as possible. We have to do it by legal means, upholding the foundations of our democracy. We cannot expect help from the President’s silent Cabinet, or his toadies in Congress who seem more interested in maintaining their own power than saying a word against him. We have to use the only branch of government left to us, the courts. Now, he and I differ on this point. I do believe we can still bring Articles of Impeachment, but he concludes by saying this: The President is trying to generate panic against Muslims in America—and I am reparaphrasing— clearly putting them at risk of mob violence. He says he hopes that he will face the full force of the law before it is too late. I might also go back a page or two and read this from this article. He indicates that the first thing that is done when we are going to move toward some sort of mob violence is to target a group by demonizing it by a campaign of hateful information. He goes on to say: This is presented as legitimate information by people in positions of trust. This article, I commend to persons as well. Now, moving forward to our current situation. It is my opinion, Mr. Speaker, that a President who is unmindful of the high duties of his high office, a President who is unmindful of the dignities and proprieties thereof, a President who has brought shame and disrepute upon the Presidency, who has breached his trust as President to the manifest injury of American society, such that he creates hate and hostility, this President who sows these seeds of discord, this kind of President should be impeached. It is my opinion that a President who demeans a Member of Congress, as one example; who indicates that a Member of Congress performing duties as a Member of Congress, duties that were associated with a constituent, that such a Member of Congress is wacky; a President saying that a Member of Congress is wacky creates circumstances for the Member of Congress that are, to be very kind, quite unpleasant. A President doing this to a Member of Congress has caused a great deal of concern. The Member of Congress has had threats made. The Member of Congress has had to take on extra security with great care and protect the staff. This is the kind of thing that we don’t expect a Member of Congress to have to endure as a result of something a President might say. A President who indicates that there will be a ban on Muslims coming into our country, a President should not single out a religious group and indicate that they should be banned from a country. In doing this, the President singles out people such that those who are of ill will will look upon them as persons to be treated with some degree of disrespect and even horror. A President who talks about persons who have signed up to serve in our military and who have not done anything dishonorable, but who says that, because they are transgender persons, they are persons who are not acceptable in the military, this sends a signal to people that incites people to believe that the President sees these persons as less than persons who should be in the military, persons who should be treated in some way other than respectful as members of the military. A President who calls the mothers of persons who are professional athletes— SOBs is the term that was used; the ‘‘B’’ meaning that those persons were dogs, the mothers; calling them, the athletes themselves, sons of dogs—such a President is a person who is sowing seeds of discord. Such a President is a person who is inciting people to behave in a manner such that they would be antithetical to those persons who are the sons of persons that he had labeled as dogs. This is inappropriate behavior for a President. A President who concludes that persons who are members of the KKK, persons who are neoNazis, call themselves supremacists. Such persons, when they are said to be very fine people, is a means of legitimizing people who are hateful, who are bigots, persons who have ill will for others in society simply because of who the others are. A President should not legitimize them by calling them very fine people. This is a President who believes that the people of a given country who are subjects of the United States of America, but a President who indicates that these people want others to do things for them that they should be doing for themselves, or that they are a drain on the budget because they have been the victims of a force of nature. b1300 A President who says these kinds of things sends a signal that indicates that these persons are not persons who are the best that we have in American society, because they are citizens. Puerto Ricans are citizens. A President who does this is a President who is sowing seeds of mistrust and sowing seeds of discord. A President should not sow seeds of mistrust and discord. A President ought to be a unifying force within a country. A President ought to be the person whom we look to for some sense of stability. A President ought to be about the business of keeping a country together rather than creating chasms within various persons and groups within a society. This is what young people expect of a President—young people who are witnessing a President do things that bring about distrust and sow the seeds of discord are seeing something that is unusual and something that is not normal. We don’t want them to assume that what they are seeing is the norm. As a matter of fact, we need to let them know that this is not the norm. So, Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear that these kinds of activities that create hate and hostility and that sow seeds of discord are impeachable. These are the kinds of things that the Framers of the Constitution had in mind when they created Article II, section 4 of the Constitution. This is what Alexander Hamilton had in mind when he penned Federalist No. 65. Hamilton so much as indicated that impeachment would create a lot of discord within society. The act itself, he indicated, could be very partisan. He indicated that there would be rancor— probably not in that specific term—but he indicated that people would be discombobulated to a great extent. In so doing, he also went on to let us know that it is something that is necessary. It is something that has to happen when you have a President who has committed misdeeds such that that President can be removed from office, and it does not have to be for a crime. This is something that constitutional scholars recognize, but it is also something that some people, for whatever reasons, do not acknowledge. They don’t acknowledge it for reasons that I will allow them to explain. But the constitutional scholars, who have delved into this to levels that most people don’t have, acknowledged that Presidents don’t have to be impeached for crimes only. As a matter of fact, in 1804, John Pickering, a Federal judge, was subject to impeachment. He was impeached, and he committed no crime that was noted in the Articles of Impeachment. He was impeached for being intemperate. As I indicated earlier, and I think some things bear repeating, Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868. In the 10th article of the Articles of Impeachment, it was alleged that he demeaned Congress. He said bad things about Congress, and, as a result, he was impeached. Now, no President has been convicted. Impeachment is within the province of the House of Representatives. If a majority of the Members vote to impeach, a President is then impeached, and the action moves to the Senate where there is a trial in the Senate presided over by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. If the President is found guilty, then the President is impeached and can be removed from office. The impeachment is validated, and the President can be removed from office. But impeachment is something that occurs in the House of Representatives. It is something that each Member can bring before the House of Representatives. It is a responsibility that a Member of Congress can assume by virtue of being a Member of Congress in concluding that a President has committed impeachable offenses. 
These impeachable offenses need not be crimes. I keep emphasizing this because really that is what this time is to be used efficaciously for. We want people to know, in no uncertain terms, that a President does not have to commit crimes to be impeached, that any of the 435 Members of the House of Representatives can bring Articles of Impeachment before the body, and that when these Articles of Impeachment are brought before the body, the House has to act. How does the House have to act? The House of Representatives will allow the articles to be read once. Once they are read, there is a time set for them to be read a second time. I read Articles of Impeachment earlier, and I chose not to read them the second time. As a result, they were not read, and as a result of not being read, the articles were not acted upon by the body. This is something every Member can do. By the way, when I did it, I did it as a result of my conscious decision to do so without any influence from any person on the planet Earth. It was a decision that was made before I came without any influence from any person. I am saying this with the emphasis that I place upon it, Mr. Speaker, because there is some misinformation. I am not offended by the misinformation, I just want to correct the record. These things get confused, and I understand it. Most people are not familiar with how this process works. Moving along, once the time is set for the second reading, the articles are read the second time; and, thereafter, the articles may be voted up or down or there may be a request made that the articles be sent to a committee. If so, if a majority of the body concludes that they should go to committee, then they will, or there could be a motion or a request made to table the articles. If they are tabled, they will be tabled and likely not brought back before the body again. But if they are allowed to be voted up or down, if a majority of the Members conclude that impeachment is appropriate and say so by their vote, saying yes by their vote, then the President would be impeached, and it would go to the Senate. In the Senate, you would have to have a twothirds vote to convict. But if the request is to table the Articles of Impeachment, then those who do not favor impeachment can vote to table, because if you vote to table and that is successful, then you don’t have to vote to impeach. Those who do not favor impeachment can vote to have the articles sent to the Judiciary Committee. If they don’t favor impeachment, then you can vote to send it to the Judiciary Committee, and there won’t be a vote on impeachment. There can be other reasons. I don’t want to conclude that the only reason that a person would vote to table is because a person doesn’t want to vote to impeach, but these are the reasons that are ostensibly viewed as reasons for not voting for these various motions that can be made. If I bring Articles of Impeachment, my desire will be to have the articles voted up or down. If they are voted up or down, that would accord everyone an opportunity to show the world where they stand on the question before the House, which, of course, would be impeachment. If a motion is made to table or a request to table, then I would vote against that because I support impeachment. If a motion is made to send to committee, I will vote against this because I favor impeachment. This is important not only to me, but to my country. This is not about Democrats. It really is not. It is about the democracy. It is about government of the people, by the people, and for the people. It is about the Republic. It is not about Republicans. It is about whether we will be able to retain the Republic that we have. Many will recall that Franklin called to our attention that we have a republic when he addressed a certain person and indicated that you have ‘‘a republic, if you can keep it.’’ This is about keeping the Republic, Mr. Speaker. It is not about Democrats, and it is not about Republicans. It is about them in the sense that they are part of the House and they all have an opportunity to cast votes, but it is really not about something as simple as politics as usual. This is something to be taken seriously. I do take it seriously. It is something that the country is monitoring. The country, when polled, indicates its position on impeachment, and that position has been at 40 percent, some a little bit above and some below, depending on who is polling and how you poll, I suppose. But the country is aware of what is going on. People are paying attention, and we do have a duty to bring before this body what we, in good conscious, believe is appropriate. ‘‘Good conscious’’ is a good term. I believe in good conscious that there is a time to bring impeachment before this body. I repeat, I believe in good conscious that there is a time to bring impeachment before this body. I have expressed my position, and it is no secret. People know where I stand. People know that, as a Member of the Congress of the United States of America, I have made the position quite public. Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, people know what my position is. They know that I have been straightforward. I have not been nebulous. I have not been shy. I believe what I say, and I say what I believe. I believe that this country should not allow discord to emanate from the highest office in the land. I believe that this country should not allow the chief executive officer to incite hate and should not allow the chief executive officer to incite hostility. I believe that the chief executive officer ought to be a unifying force in a great country. I believe that if America is going to continue its greatness and move forward without persons who are labeled as wacky or persons being seen as less than other Americans by virtue of their religious practices or because of their sexuality, I believe that we have a duty when we believe that there is an impeachable offense, then we should bring this before the Congress of the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to serve the people of the Ninth Congressional District of Texas. The Ninth Congressional District of Texas is in Houston. I am honored to serve the people of Houston as well as Missouri City and Stafford. I am honored to serve, but I am a United States Congressman, and the Constitution of the United States of America addresses all of the people within the United States of America. So when I bring my views to the floor, when I stand in the well and make my comments, I am speaking for the people of the Ninth Congressional District. But I am also speaking for a good many people of the United States of America, and a good many people in the United States of America are of the opinion, Mr. Speaker, that impeachment is not only appropriate but necessary. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would like to announce that next week here in the Congress of the United States of America, I will bring Articles of Impeachment to present to this body such that Donald J. Trump will be impeached. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
ADJOURNMENT Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn. The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o’clock and 17 minutes p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday, December 4, 2017, at 6 p.m.
