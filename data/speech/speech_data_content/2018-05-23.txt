Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, too many working families still struggle to pay their bills, to take care of their families, and to save for their kids to go to college or to take care of aging parents. The middle class—households with an income between 67 and 200 percent of median income—is shrinking and income inequality is growing. Wage stagnation means more families will need safety net services like SNAP—food stamps—and housing assistance at a time when the majority in Congress is trying to cut those programs. What should we be doing? Consider this. Unions helped build the middle class. Unionized teachers, nurses, and firefighters have better access to paid holidays, paid sick leave, and retirement benefits, and less need for safety net services. When workers have the right to join together and have a voice in the workplace, it is also good for nonunion workers who benefit from those higher standards. Unfortunately, here in Congress and across the street at the Supreme Court, with the Janus v. AFSCME case, working families and organized labor are under attack. To grow our economy and reduce the need for safety net programs, we should make it easier, not harder, for workers to form unions and collectively bargain. Until we do, we will continue to see a shrinking middle class. 
RECOGNIZING 93RD BIRTHDAY OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL ALBERT ‘‘BUZ’’ STEBBINS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor today to recognize the 93rd birthday of a true American hero, Lieutenant Colonel ‘‘Buz’’ Stebbins. Just after Lieutenant Colonel Stebbins turned 20 years old, he graduated from West Point in 1945. He served as a pilot in the Army Air Corps and the United States Air Force for 28 years. During that time, Buz piloted scores of military aircraft, including the honor of taking delivery from Lockheed of one of the first C5A Galaxy cargo aircraft, the largest cargo aircraft in the world. He flew 70 missions to Vietnam in support of our troops engaged in that war. While stationed in Germany, he became a member of the Caterpillar Club, whose membership is restricted to those who have had to bail out of a disabled aircraft. During his military career, Colonel Stebbins also served as a professor of physics at both West Point and the United States Air Force Academy. Retiring in 1973, Colonel Stebbins chose to reside in the great city of Tega Cay, South Carolina, which is in my Fifth Congressional District. He became very active in the community, and was instrumental in Tega Cay being incorporated as a city in 1982. He has been honored by a number of organizations in the community, including Citizen of the Year, grand marshal of the Independence Day parade, and many more. Colonel Stebbins exemplifies the motto of the great school of West Point: Duty, Honor, Country. Buz, happy 93rd birthday on May 31. We look forward to many more years of you doing what you continue to do. f 
NATIONAL MARITIME DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of an extraordinary group of people. Yesterday was National Maritime Day, and I rise to bring attention to the House legislation that I recently introduced, H.R. 5879, the World War II Merchant Marine Congressional Gold Medal. I hear the cheers from all of my colleagues here on the floor as they line up to support this piece of legislation. Last year, my colleague, SUSAN  BROOKS , my good Republican friend, introduced this legislation. I am grateful to her and to Congressman DONYOUNG  of Alaska for their support of this legislation this year. This bill has obvious bipartisan support and bicameral support. Senator MURKOWSKI of Alaska is leading this bill in what some call the upper Chamber; we simply call it the Senate. During World War II, our Armed Forces relied upon the Merchant Marine to ferry supplies, cargo, manpower and womanpower into both theaters of operation: the Pacific and the Atlantic. They paid a heavy price for their service. The Merchant Marine casualty rate was the highest among all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. An estimated 8,300 merchant mariners lost their life during the war, and around 12,000 were wounded. But these brave men and women, who put their lives on the line to sustain our Armed Forces, were not even given veteran status until 1988, much less public recognition for their invaluable service. Today, I am going to meet with a group of World War II Merchant Marine veterans: Charles Mills from Texas, age 97; Eugene Barner from Kansas, age 92; and Robert Weagant from Illinois, age 92. I will also be meeting with families of other veterans who are no longer with us. I am meeting them to hear firsthand their stories of bravery and peril in the service of our Armed Forces. They deserve the recognition of a Congressional Gold Medal, and that is precisely what this legislation will do. I urge all of the Members of this House and the Senate to give our Merchant Marine veterans and their families the honor they deserve. I will also be discussing with these gentlemen and their families a piece of legislation that we introduced the day before yesterday, we call it the Energizing the American Shipbuilding Industry—taking a small percentage of the oil and natural gas that we are now exporting and requiring that that be on Americanbuilt ships with American mariners, so that we can maintain the extraordinary tradition of bravery and service that the World War II mariners showed this Nation. If we are successful in passing this legislation, we will be building some 50 ships, or more, in our shipyards all across America, providing jobs in the upper Midwest, where they build the great engines for these ships: the pumps, the pipes, and the electronic systems. We would also be providing some 1,800 jobs for the next generation of mariners. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues not only to support the Congressional Gold Medal for the World War II mariners, but support our effort to create mariners for the next generation, which, hopefully, will not be a war but, if it is, we know that we can rely on them, just as we did in World War II. f 
RECOGNIZING 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ROTARY CLUB OF MONROE, LOUISIANA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Rotary Club of Monroe, Louisiana. The Monroe Rotary Club started on June 1, 1918, and its centennial birthday marks 100 years of service, charity, and dedication from the members over the years. Today, the club has grown to over 140 members, and it is involved in service projects throughout the Monroe area. The Monroe Rotary Club promotes education, local economic growth, and clean water availability locally, nationally, and around the world just to promote the innate ability to drink clean water. Members of this club are the problem solvers that collaborate with the community leaders, many of whom are members themselves, to lead and continue to lead on issues that are facing the Monroe area. In this year alone, the Monroe Rotary Club has donated over 1,000 books to inmates at the Swanson Correctional Center, awarded 11 $250 scholarships to high school seniors, and donated 95 bicycles to children in need 
during the Christmas season. Their crowning annual event is a gumbo fundraiser, where they raise thousands of dollars for their service projects. In this year alone, they have raised over $8,000 that will be used to buy new playground equipment, send children to camp, and sponsor softball teams. I am always very proud to see people and organizations like these in the Monroe area, and in my entire district in Louisiana. Over the past 100 years, the Monroe Rotary Club has worked tirelessly to improve the city and the quality of life for those who live there. b1015 They inspire me and others by the changes that they direct, that they make, and the positive impact that they bring to the Monroe area. Today, not only do I congratulate them on their 100th anniversary, but I stand in recognition and certainly thanks for their century of service to the city of Monroe and the State of Louisiana. 
LOUIS ZAMPERINI POST OFFICE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ) for 5 minutes. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the life and legacy of an American hero, Louis Zamperini. Louis Zamperini was an Olympic runner who, while serving as an airman during World War II, was captured and held as a prisoner of war. Many remember Louis Zamperini as an inspirational symbol of resilience, athleticism, and service. The city of Torrance and the residents of our community in the 43rd Congressional District of California are especially proud and inspired by Louis Zamperini. Louis Zamperini was the son of Italian immigrants. He moved to Torrance, California, at the age of 3 and was a graduate of Torrance High School. It was during his tenure at Torrance High School that Zamperini’s abilities in track and cross country first gained notoriety. Nicknamed the ‘‘Torrance Tornado,’’ Louis Zamperini set the national high school record in the mile at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in 1934. His record time of 4 minutes 21.2 seconds was unbroken for 20 years. As a teenager, Zamperini qualified and competed in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Germany, where he finished eighth in the 5,000meter run. After the Olympics, Zamperini earned a scholarship to the University of Southern California, where he became one of the university’s most celebrated student athletes. Louis Zamperini enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps and served in World War II as a B–24 Liberator bombardier in the 372nd Bomb Squadron. During a rescue mission on May 27, 1943, Zamperini’s plane crashed into the sea. Zamperini spent 47 days adrift in a life raft fending off starvation and fighting to survive. The United States military believed he had perished in the crash and informed his parents of his death in June 1943. In actuality, Zamperini was captured by a Japanese patrol boat and held as a prisoner of war. Over the next 2 years, he was regularly beaten and starved. Louis Zamperini was finally liberated following the Japanese surrender in September of 1945. Zamperini became an evangelical Christian and gave inspirational speeches across the country. He also founded the Victory Boys Camp, a wilderness camp, to assist atrisk youth. Louis Zamperini passed away on July 2, 2014, in Los Angeles at the age of 97 years old. Zamperini was married for 54 years to his wife, Cynthia, who preceded him in death. He was survived by his son, Luke, his daughter, Cynthia Garris, and his grandson, Clay. People across the country are familiar with Louis Zamperini’s story, which was told in the 2010 book, ‘‘Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption,’’ by Laura Hillenbrand, which rose to number one on The New York Times Best Seller list. In 2014, director Angelina Jolie released a movie about Zamperini adapted from Hillenbrand’s book. Because of his remarkable athletic abilities and heroic service to our country, Louis Zamperini will forever be remembered as a hero and favorite son of Torrance. That is why I am so very proud to announce that today, in collaboration with California’s senior United States Senator, DIANNE FEINSTEIN , I have just introduced a resolution to rename the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1433 Marcelina Avenue in Torrance, California, as the Louis Zamperini Post Office Building. My legislation has the bipartisan support of the entire California delegation in the House of Representatives. Over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, as we honor the memory of the brave military servicemembers who have given their lives for our country, let us all reflect on the legacy of Louis Zamperini and countless other American heroes who have sacrificed to protect our ideals, our democracy, and our country. 
CONGRESSIONAL FOSTER YOUTH SHADOW DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Foster Youth Shadow Day. Today, I have Wini visiting us from Omaha, Nebraska. She is a junior at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, studying criminal justice, with a minor in communications. Wini is in Washington, D.C., along with more than 100 young adults participating in the seventh annual Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day. Currently, there are more than 400,000 youth in the foster care system, and we need to make sure the system is working well for all of our children. I look forward to learning from Wini so I can better advocate for these children in Congress as the newest cochair of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth. As a foster parent myself, I know how important it is for every child to have a safe, supportive, and loving family. Wini is an inspiration for all of us, as she wants to attend law school and continue using her voice as an advocate for young people. Thank you for being here today, Wini. I know you have a bright future ahead of you, because you have an indomitable spirit, you have heart, and you have character. f 
PROFESSOR SLOCUM AND THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE ) for 5 minutes. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the life and legacy of Rutgers Law School Professor Alfred Slocum. Professor Slocum was a titan in the legal and civil rights communities. While still a student at Rutgers Law, he spoke out on behalf of minorities and people of color. He worked with professors and other students to help create the Rutgers Law Minority Student Program, which is the most extensive and renowned program to train minority lawyers in this country. During his career, Professor Slocum served many roles in the legal profession and in the public service sector. He was an executive director of the Council on Legal Education Opportunity. He served as public advocate of the State of New Jersey in 1986 and, later that year, was appointed public defender. For 5 years, Professor Slocum championed the causes of the voiceless and the indigent. Then in 1990, he returned to law school, where he taught until retiring from the faculty in 2001. I speak for myself, for the city of Newark, and for the State of New Jersey when I say that Professor Slocum’s life was well lived. I ask my colleagues to join me in honor of this great man’s legacy. Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, Professor Alfred Slocum was a champion for the voiceless and for people in need. Mr. Speaker, the people who are in the greatest need in this country rely on our social safety net for food, for shelter, for healthcare, and for many necessities that help them scrape by. We cannot leave them to despair. These people are not just a statistic. They are not just an idea. They are human beings. They are Americans. 
They are people who just need a helping hand. I have said this before, but let me say it again. I have never met a person who wakes up in the morning and says, ‘‘I want to be poor today.’’ That is just not a reality. Let me add this. I have never met a person who wakes up at 5 a.m. to go to her first job, comes home at 1 p.m. to take a nap, and heads out to her second job at 4 p.m., yet still lives paycheck to paycheck, still relies on SNAP and Medicaid to make ends meet, but thinks to herself, ‘‘I like to struggle.’’ She does not exist, because that is just not how the world works. Programs like SNAP, Medicaid, housing assistance, our entire social safety net is a supplement that helps people struggle just a little bit less. Yet my colleagues across the aisle and their friends in the White House keep pushing the false narrative that people who rely on government assistance to make ends meet are just freeloaders who take advantage of the government handouts and buy drugs. The majority party and the 45th President keep pushing their callous, immoral narrative in order to tear apart the social safety net. Mr. Speaker, the United States Government should be making it easier for Americans to maintain a decent standard of living. We have to protect our most vulnerable and those who are in need. Let us end this administration’s war on the working poor and help make lives better for our constituents. The American people deserve A Better Deal. 
LET’S PUT OUR KIDS BEFORE CONGRESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. BARLETTA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, today, once again, we are going to debate what we need to do to stop these senseless attacks on our schools. Our schools are a place of memories. Think about it. We can all, every one of us, recite stories of when we were in elementary school. We all know stories about friends or things that happened in junior high school and in high school. Our life’s memories are filled back in those schooldays, those memories. The children today, the kids today, have different memories of school. No child in America should go to school afraid, and no parent in America should worry about their children, if they are going to come home safely, when they send them to school. As I stand here right now, outside these doors there are armed guards with machine guns, guard dogs, metal detectors to keep us safe. But today, once again, children will go to school across America and sit like sitting ducks in a classroom. When a crazed madman attacked my colleagues and friends at baseball practice, our response was instant. It was immediate. Democrats and Republicans, we all agreed we need more security for Congress, we need more money to secure our offices, to secure our staff to make sure they are safe. We even found money to provide security for us at home. People move pretty fast here when it is about themselves and their families. Why do we think that our lives are more important than the lives of any parent’s child in America? Why do we think we are more important that we can find security for ourselves so quickly? We should take every metal detector in this building and send it to some school tomorrow until we find the money to secure our schools like we did for ourselves. I read an article where root canals and colonoscopies have a higher approval rating than Congress. Maybe the American people will think differently if we put our kids before Congress. f 
b1030 HONORING SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIER AARON BUTLER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CURTIS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, this week, I had the privilege to speak to the parents of Special Forces Soldier Aaron Butler from Monticello, Utah. From the time Aaron was in the first grade, he wanted to join the military and serve our country. After a legendary career as a fourtime State wrestling champion at Monticello High School, Aaron joined the Utah National Guard. Within a few years, he was one of just four soldiers who graduated with honors from the Army Green Beret Special Qualification Course. Throughout his service, Aaron’s teammates and superior officers regarded him as a natural leader with an unmatched work ethic. He was tough and dedicated. He loved our country, and he took his responsibility to protect it seriously. On August 16, 2017, Aaron was serving as a staff sergeant in Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group of the Utah National Guard on his first combat deployment that should have ended in October. Tragically, an explosion occurred while he was clearing a boobytrapped building in Afghanistan, killing Aaron and injuring 11 teammates. His family, seven siblings, parents, and fiancee, as well as his teammates, were devastated. His hometown and the rest of our State mourned this tragic loss. His sister said that if Aaron had given his own eulogy, he would have said: I came. I lived. I killed bad guys. I died. Aaron and his courageous sacrifice will never be forgotten. Our country is forever indebted to the service of Aaron and countless others who make daily sacrifices to protect our country and keep us safe. And our country is, likewise, forever indebted to the families that have supported them. Like many others, I have been blessed by the dedicated military service of a family member. My father served in the Navy during World War II. I was reminded of his great service during a recent visit to the U.S. Naval Academy, where I had the honor to meet with a group of Utah cadets, and again during a visit with U.S. troops stationed in Poland and Abu Dhabi. This weekend, we will celebrate Memorial Day and take the opportunity to express our deepest and most profound gratitude to those who have fallen in the service of our country. I thank them, their families, and all those who are willing to serve. Our way of life and every ideal we hold dear has been built on the sacrifice of these heroes. This week, I am proud to speak in support of the proposals in the National Defense Authorization Act that will provide our troops with support to increase capability and capacity in a force that has been asked to do too much with too little for too long. In this, I am pleased to support a welldeserved pay raise for our troops and extend special pay and bonuses to servicemembers in highdemand fields, something our servicemembers and their families have more than earned. After heroically serving this country, our veterans deserve the very best that we can give them back home. This week, I was honored to support more than a dozen veterans bills that passed the House. These proposals will help improve the lives and honor the men and women who have served so selflessly. This legislation will help provide for disabled veterans who have been wounded in service. It will ensure our veterans have access to the care and resources they have earned. It will keep our homeless veterans off the street. It will ease educational burdens placed on our veterans by the Federal Government. It will protect our veterans from the dangers of opioid abuse. It will increase accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs to guarantee those brave individuals and their families receive the quality of service they deserve. This Memorial Day, we honor the dedicated generations of men and women who have fought for our country and ensured our freedom. May we all strive every day to live worthy of their sacrifice, and may God bless the United States of America. 
THE MEDAL OF HONOR The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. TAYLOR ) for 5 minutes. Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at 
the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty.’’ These are the words that begin every Medal of Honor citation, our Nation’s highest and most prestigious military decoration. They are uncommon but not as uncommon as the actions and sacrifice detailed in the narrative summaries of those awards. Of the estimated 50 million Americans who have worn a military uniform, 3,440 have received the Medal of Honor. The criteria for the award are profound, clear, and always deadly; indeed, almost all recipients sacrificing their lives to earn them. Their service is memorialized at military installations throughout the world. You can read of their bravery on walls, monuments, and headstones. Buildings, streets, ships, and forward operating bases bear their names in an attempt to honor, to inspire, and to remember. If you wear a uniform, you walk in the dark shadows of heroes every day. Today, Mr. Speaker, there are 71 living recipients. Tomorrow, there will be 72. Mr. Speaker, in the early morning hours of March 4, 2002, a helicopter attempted a landing on a mountain peak high in the Arma Mountain range of southeastern Afghanistan. The mission was reconnaissance. But, Mr. Speaker, war has no regard for the plans of men. War is violent. War is chaotic. War is unforgiving. And as the helicopter touched down, it was engulfed in a hail of lead and rocketpropelled grenades. The helicopter escaped, but one man remained: Chief Petty Officer SEAL Neil Roberts. He was alone. He was isolated, and he was surrounded. In a letter to his family, Roberts would write, ‘‘All the times spent in the company of my teammates were when I felt closest to the men I had the privilege to work with. I loved being a SEAL. If I die doing something for the teams, then I died doing what made me happy. Very few people have the luxury of that.’’ Mr. Speaker, men and women join the military for many reasons, but they do not join with a desire to die. There will always be moments of uncertainty and fear and hesitation, moments when fear turns the thoughts to your own safety, wellbeing, and survival. Every service issues a uniform. None of them issue courage. In those moments, where beliefs and resolve are tested, leadership illuminates the path. On March 4, 2002, Master Chief Special Warfare Operator SEAL Retired Britt Slabinski chose to lead. He led his men back into the fight, into overwhelming odds and superior enemy fire. There would be no element of surprise. There would be no tactical advantage, and despite the odds and despite the risk, he chose to lead. They assaulted trenches and bunkers and hardened machine gun nests. They took the fight to the enemy until it reached the brink of their own destruction. They did not run. They did not hide. They fought. Mr. Speaker, bravery is not motivated by fear, rage, hate, or the desire for awards or recognition. Bravery is motivated by love: love for an ideal, love for a country, and love for a teammate. Bravery is not a certainty; it is a choice. Master Chief Slabinski and his men chose to be brave. His actions, his personal courage, and his leadership are an example, not just to every sailor, soldier, marine, and airman, but to every American. His citation has earned its place among the other heroes who have received the Medal of Honor. Its ownership, its meaning, and its promise belong not just on the walls of every military installation but on the walls of every home in America. Master Chief Slabinski’s actions serve as a beacon, as a reminder of who we can become, of what we can accomplish when we, instead of running away, rise up and challenge our darkest fears, our worst enemies, or overwhelming odds. Mr. Speaker, long live the brotherhood. 
RECOGNIZING PENNSYLVANIA SCHOOLS THAT RANK IN THE TOP 100 IN THE STATE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ) for 5 minutes. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, we recently concluded Teacher Appreciation Week, and I am proud to stand with the teachers throughout our community in Bucks and Montgomery Counties. It is of utmost importance that we recognize their service and sacrifice for all of our young people. Recently, this has culminated in our district having several schools that ranked in the top 100 in the State of Pennsylvania for both standardized test scores and graduation rates. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the following schools now on the floor of the House: The New Hope Solebury High School, Council Rock High School North, Central Bucks High School East, Abington Senior High School, Council Rock High School South, Central Bucks High School South, and the Quakertown Community High School. I am proud to represent a community that produces such highachieving young adults, and I would like to thank our educators for the work they do in molding our future generation. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, May is Military Appreciation Month, and I am proud to stand here today to recognize the brave men and women in uniform who have served our Nation valiantly. As a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, I am in awe of the sacrifices made and risks taken by our Armed Forces every single day to keep our country safe. And I speak for all of my constituents in Bucks and Montgomery Counties when we truly say that we value the troops’ service and sacrifice, and we owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the 75 graduating high school seniors who were honored this month at Spring Mill Manor in Northampton by Our Community Salutes to recognize their enlistment in our Armed Forces. These exemplary young men and women received a certificate from Montgomery County State Representative Tom Murt, a veteran of the Iraq war, and received their first military coin. Mr. Speaker, as elected officials, we must continue to enact policies that ensure the wellbeing of all of our men and women in the military. There is no more important responsibility than serving those who have so bravely stepped up in times of crisis. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to stand up for our military this month and every month. And to all those who serve, we say: Thank you. NEW HOPE HOSTS A PRIDE PARADE  
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, last weekend in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, was the 15th Annual New Hope Pride Parade. This parade served as the culmination of a weeklong celebration of LGBT culture and achievements, and I am proud to recognize this event and our LGBT community in Bucks County and throughout our district. Currently, the New Hope Pride Parade stands as the only recognized event of its kind that crosses State lines between New Jersey and Pennsylvania. I would like to recognize board member Jennifer Wohl, under whose guidance the attendance at this event grew from 1,000 in 2003 to 15,000 last year. I would also like thank the president of New Hope Celebrates, Matthew Hanson, for his work in advancing equality in Pennsylvania and across our Nation. Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress, it is critical that we advocate for measures that will support equality for all American citizens. I will continue to do so as a Member of this House, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same with every single action we bring to this floor. We value them, Mr. Speaker. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. ISSA) at noon. 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day. During this week, the National Defense Authorization Act is being debated on the floor of the House. May all Members be imbued with Your wisdom, that the results of their deliberations might redound to the benefit of our Nation. Bless all those whose lives are dedicated to the defense and service of the United States, most especially those who serve in uniform in the Armed Forces. May they be safe in the execution of their duties, and their families blessed with Your comforting presence in their lives. Thank You, O God, for the privilege of being able to serve, and may all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Utah (Mr. STEWART ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. STEWART led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, which will accelerate the modernization of the F–22 fighter wing at Tyndall Air Force Base. This is one of only three F–22 training wings in the Air Force. We have the most highly trained and dedicated military in the world. But if we are not giving them the resources to maintain their planes and training them in the most realistic environments possible, we are doing them a disservice. Over the last year, we have begun to correct that problem and rebuild our military and invest in our servicemembers. Modernizing the training wing of F– 22s at Tyndall Air Force Base is another step in that process and is essential to the safety and security of the airmen we ask to achieve air superiority over battlefields all around the globe. We are giving certainty to our warfighters with this NDAA, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation. f 
INVEST IN NATION BUILDING IN AMERICA (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, there are 54,000 structurally deficient bridges in America. Every second of every day, seven cars drive on a bridge that is structurally deficient. Earlier this month, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli issued a report finding that our broken sewer systems are dumping billions of gallons of sewage into our lakes and rivers. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the Nation a D rating when it comes to infrastructure and estimates that it will cost $2 trillion just to bring our infrastructure to a state of good repair. Mr. Speaker, a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan over 5 years would create 34.5 million jobs, and infrastructure pays for itself with $1.60 of new economic growth for every dollar invested: this, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That is 6.9 million jobs each of the next 5 years and 575,000 jobs each month for the next 60 months. Mr. Speaker, it is time that we get out of Iraq and Afghanistan and invest in nation building in America, with American workers and for the American people. 
THE NDAA: REBUILD AND REFORM (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the National Defense Authorization Act passed the House Armed Services Committee with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 60 yes to 1 no. I am grateful for the leadership of Chairman MAC THORNBERRY , with Speaker PAULRYAN, promoted by Defense Secretary James Mattis. The NDAA being considered today provides a critical increase in topline funding to support troops and readiness 
recovery, consistent with President Donald Trump’s commitment to rebuild the military as he keeps his promises. This legislation makes major reforms to the Pentagon bureaucracy, while adding more military personnel to all services. The NDAA also includes the largest pay increase for the military in 9 years. As chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, I am grateful that this legislation promotes rebuilding the military and supports readiness recovery by rehabilitating and replacing wornout equipment, overcoming the crisis in military aviation, restoring America’s strength at sea, and rebuilding crumbling military buildings and other infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill that supports the men and women in uniform, along with military families, to promote peace through strength. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. 
ENDANGERED SALMON PREDATION PREVENTION (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, the Pacific Northwest is facing an unprecedented and growing problem of sea lions who are decimating our endangered salmon and steelhead runs in the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. Right now, in front of my district office in Oregon City, there are 24 sea lions sitting at the base of Willamette Falls gorging themselves on the spring salmon run. This is 127 miles from the Pacific Ocean, their natural habitat. This salmon buffet of endangered fish costs Northwest ratepayers nearly $1 billion a year: a third of our electric bill. We need to pass H.R. 2083, the Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act, now. I introduced this bill, along with my Northwest colleague, JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER . It will provide Oregon and Washington wildlife managers with the tools they need, that they requested, to quickly act to remove problem sea lions to protect these endangered fish. If we don’t act now, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife says that there is a 90 percent chance the Willamette winter steelhead run will go extinct in the next few years. Mr. Speaker, it would be unconscionable to let this happen. We know the problem, and it is identified. Let’s take action. 
RECOGNIZING COLONEL JAMES BROWN (Mr. STEWART asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel James Brown, a friend of mine, who has faithfully served the Tooele Army Depot and the United States Army. It is my honor to recognize the years of service Colonel Brown has given to our Nation prior to the upcoming change of command. Colonel Brown has been instrumental in expanding Tooele Army Depot’s mission of readiness, as well as ensuring a safe and secure worksite for its employees. I offer my sincere thanks to all those who served at the Tooele Army Depot, as well as those who have had the privilege to serve with Colonel Brown. I understand the sacrifices of our military men and women on behalf of our Nation. I am humbled by the work these men and women do every day to protect our freedom and our Nation’s freedom as well. And we have to remember their families because their families—their spouses and children— also sacrifice. Defending honor, duty, and country is the greatest service one can achieve in the United States military. Colonel Brown’s courage and dedication is enduring, and his work will continue to support generations to come. f 
HONORING LISA LA RUSSO (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our Nation’s emergency medical service workers. When crisis strikes, we turn to EMS workers. They are first on the scene to provide vital medical care when we need it most. Their lifesaving work requires skill, is often dangerous, and takes a great deal of courage. We rely on people like Lisa La Russo, a paramedic with American Medical Response in Riverside County and proud member of AFSCME Local 4911. Lisa has been saving lives for nearly three decades and, like many in her field, goes above and beyond in service to her community. Her work responding to emergencies compelled her to start Splash Medics, a nonprofit dedicated to the prevention of drowning injuries and deaths through education about water safety. I salute Lisa La Russo, her fellow union members, and all of the EMS workers across the Nation. They are the reason Americans rest assured that help is just a phone call away. 
ALL AMERICAN WEEK (Mr. HUDSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of All American Week, the annual celebration of the 82nd Airborne Division’s mission and the paratroopers who serve to uphold it. Based in my district at Fort Bragg— the epicenter of the universe—the 82nd Airborne Division is our Nation’s Global Response Force. These rapid reaction forces can mobilize, load, and deploy at a moment’s notice. It is truly incredible. There is ready, and then there is Airborne ready. As the old saying goes: When the President dials 911, the phone rings at Fort Bragg. Since its inception, the 82nd Airborne has, time and again, answered the call of duty when our Nation needs it most. As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of Fort Bragg, I am so proud of the 82nd Airborne’s legacy, of our paratroopers, and especially their families. As the Airborne spirit takes flight this week, I ask my fellow Americans to join me in praying for our servicemembers who are currently deployed and for their families. These heroes put country before self, and we are so grateful. God bless you. Airborne, all the way. f 
NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH (Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, May is National Foster Care Month, a time to renew our commitment to the thousands of children in our Nation’s foster care system. That is why I am proud to be a member of the Congressional Youth Foster Caucus, which is dedicated to strengthening our Nation’s child welfare system. Today, we are celebrating the Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day, a special day when more than 100 foster youth from across the country come to D.C. to spend a day with Members of Congress as we conduct our Nation’s business. I have the privilege today of hosting Esmeralda Masco, who is from my district in Stockton, California. Esmeralda is currently a student at Grand Canyon University, where she is studying public policy and aspires one day to become a civil rights lawyer. She is passionate about helping current and former foster youth and wants, one day, to open a resource center to help others in the foster care system to graduate and achieve their full potential. It gives me great pleasure to welcome Esmeralda and all of the participants in the Congressional Youth Shadow Day to our Nation’s Capital. 
b1215 ONLINE PLATFORMS THREATEN FREE SPEECH (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest threats to free speech is the ongoing politicization of online platforms. Some, which have millions of users, have allowed liberal interest groups to determine what content is available to the public. A recent example is the Southern Poverty Law Center being allowed to censor content that they deem hate speech. The SPLC has a ‘‘hate map’’ that lists over 900 organizations. These include prolife, religious freedom, and border security groups, all popular with the American people and all unfairly targeted by the SPLC. Why do online platforms empower the SPLC to suppress conservative views? There is only one answer: They want to promote their liberal agenda even if it means stifling free speech. This is a clear and present danger to democracy, and it represents another effort to control what the American people hear and see. 
NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH (Ms. BASS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, May marks National Foster Care Month, a time for our country to come together to acknowledge the half million people in our child welfare system. No one knows the child welfare system like the foster youth who have grown up in the system, and no one can raise their voices like foster youth voices. Today, the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth and the National Foster Youth Institute have brought together more than 100 young people from every corner of the country here, to Washington, D.C., to shadow their Members of Congress. The young people here today have traveled thousands of miles to share their stories, their challenges with abuse, trafficking, overmedication, or homelessness, but in addition, to share their successes with education accomplishments, mentorship, adoption, family unification, and community activism. With me here today, from Los Angeles, is Megan Simon. She is 24 years old, and she was placed in foster care when she was only 1 year old. She was raised by her grandparents, and she has two other siblings who were involved in the system. She is actively involved in the National Foster Youth Institute Leadership Corps, where she attends meetings every Thursday night. She is an advocate and someone who wants to use her pain and her experience to make changes in the child welfare system. She is a student at Los Angeles Trade Tech College, and she says that she is a leader, she is a survivor, and she is a winner, not because she wins every battle, but because she never stops fighting. Mr. Speaker, too often the government—us—forgets our children. I hope that today’s Shadow Day continues our fight to reverse that course. f 
HONORING THE FAYETTE HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to honor the Fayette High School marching band from my district for being selected to march in Washington’s upcoming Memorial Day Parade. The Marching Falcons found out in the fall that they had been selected to march in the parade, and their small community quickly rallied around them to raise the money they needed to go. Tomorrow they will board a bus, bright and early, to make the 14hour drive here. The band’s director, Alex Kirby, told me the group has put in many hours of practice. School has already let out for summer vacation, but the dedicated band members still show up for practice 5 days a week, even the seniors who have already graduated. I am so proud of this marching band and the dedication the students have shown in perfecting their music. I know that they will do a great job. Congratulations. 
DEMOCRACY REFORM (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, too many Americans feel that Washington is out of touch with their priorities. They feel that too few people have too much influence. Americans want the culture of corruption cultivated by rich lobbyists and massive corporations to end. Look no further than Big Pharma, the pharmaceutical companies. Since 1998, they have spent $4 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions. They employ 1,400 lobbyists, three lobbyists for every Member. No wonder the system seems rigged against commonsense solutions to lower drug prices. Americans are getting a raw deal when big money controls politics. Democrats offer A Better Deal for our democracy: a bold, comprehensive program to bolster our Nation’s ethics laws, overhaul our campaign finance system, and create more transparency and accessibility. Americans deserve a government that works for them. They deserve A Better Deal. I want to acknowledge Mimi Quin, with me today as part of Foster Youth Shadow Day. 
FOSTER YOUTH SHADOW DAY (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the hardships that many foster youth have had to endure and highlight the persistence and determination that they embody as they develop and transition to adulthood. In Arkansas, we have over 5,000 children currently in the State’s foster care system. As a member of the Foster Care Caucus here in the House, I am proud to cosponsor our resolution and have had the pleasure for the last 3 years to sponsor a former foster youth for Shadow Day here on the Hill. This year I am honored to host Stefan Specht, a former foster youth from my district. Stefan is currently enrolled with Job Corps to obtain a certification in office administration and plans on working towards a degree in business. Stefan is also a part of Immerse Arkansas, a vital program dedicated to helping foster youth with the difficult transition to adulthood. This program was a critical part of the changing point in Stefan’s life and giving him a place to belong. Many foster youth are not provided with programs like Immerse or a community to help support them in finding a career and home after they exit the foster care system. I am proud to be in this caucus and so proud to support our Shadow Day here on Capitol Hill. f 
LET’S PUT STUDENTS OVER SPECIAL INTERESTS (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, last year, the Republicans passed a corporate tax giveaway that adds $1.9 trillion to the deficit. I was proud to join all of my fellow Democrats in voting against that. Today I am here to talk about a new bill I introduced, the Students Over Special Interests Act. It shows what we could have done with some of that $1.9 trillion. I hear from constituents every day overwhelmed by student debt. For instance, Sam in Morrison, Colorado, a law enforcement officer, has been making student loan payments for years. Even at the age of 51, he has tens of thousands of dollars left. What my Students Over Special Interests Act does is it forgives all student debt. That costs less than the Republican tax giveaway. In addition, it increases Pell funding and reduces the deficit. Studies have shown that repealing student loan debt stimulates the economy, supports job growth, and takes something that is weighing down too many families. After forgiving student debt and making college more affordable, my bill still costs less than the Republican tax giveaway that they passed into 
law. I encourage the House to take up the Students Over Special Interests bill. 
JOYCE CLINE, PENN BRAD OIL MUSEUM YELLOW DOG WINNER (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor this year’s Penn Brad Oil Museum’s annual Yellow Dog Winner, Joyce Cline. Joyce has provided exceptional service to the cause of preserving the oil and gas heritage of the Bradford, Pennsylvania, region. She has been a dedicated member of the community who has given her time and leadership to many organizations. Joyce graduated from Lawrence Park High School in 1959 and was a teacher with the Bradford Area School District for 19 years. In 1974, she married Bill Cline. He owned a small oilproducing company, and Joyce began her journey in the oil industry. In 1982, she joined the Derrick Club of Bradford, where she served in various roles, including president in 1983 and 1984. Joyce and Bill became members of the Pennsylvania Independent Petroleum Producers Association in 1986, 1 year after the organization was formed. This turned into a lifelong commitment for the Clines. In 2012, Joyce and Bill were honored with the Gary Hovis Memorial Award for their service. Mr. Speaker, throughout her life, Joyce has shown her dedication to the industry. I wholeheartedly congratulate her on this outstanding achievement. 
CONGRATULATING THE 2018 GRADUATES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the recent graduates of the University of the Virgin Islands. Unfortunately, I could not attend the graduations last week due to the bad weather up here and the debate on the farm bill. Despite two hurricanes, no power, damaged classrooms, personal tragedies galore, revised class schedules, et cetera, UVI graduates lived up to their names. On St. Thomas, they were known as the Ambitious, Resilient and Hardworking Class of 2018; and on St. Croix, they were known as the Enriched, Elite and Educated Class of 2018. During the ceremony, honorary degrees were also awarded to former local elected officials and radio personalities, Holland Redfield II and Addie Ottley. The class of 2018 is made up of a diverse group of students. Whatever their individual plans, as a class, these UVI graduates have proven that they can take on anything life and nature have to offer. I commend the 2018 UVI graduates for their hard work. Additionally, I would like to commend Briana Winslow and Jermaine Ferguson, who are shadowing me today as young adults in the national foster youth care program. Their lives, their stories are an inspiration to us all, and I commend them for what they are going to be doing in the future. f 
U.S. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, President Trump and his foreign policy team made the right choice to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with the dishonest Iranian regime. This Iran deal was flawed from its inception, freeing up billions of U.S. dollars and relaxing sanctions in exchange for weak restrictions and little enforcement. Iran has taken advantage of this deal. In 2016, German intelligence found that Iran was secretly pursuing nuclear technology and equipment from German companies, violating the agreement less than a year after it was finalized. That same year, Reuters reported that secret exemptions had been created for Iran after the talks were over, allowing them to evade some restrictions and get relief from our sanctions even faster. Months after, another loophole in the agreement was exploited when Iran planned to buy 950 tons of uranium to make nuclear fuel since the agreement never placed a limit on how much uranium they could have. All of this more than demonstrates the ineffectiveness of this deal and the potentially catastrophic effects of trusting Iran, which has a long and detailed history of blatantly being dishonest. This is a bad deal for this country. 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GET A WARRANT TO ACCESS PRIVATE EMAIL ACCOUNTS (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, which would add the full text of my bill, H.R. 387, the Email Privacy Act. I want to remind my colleagues that this bill has been passed twice by the House, once on April 27, 2016, by a roll call of 419–0, and again by voice vote, unanimously, in the House on February 6, 2017. My legislation has a simple concept behind it: if the government wants access to content stored in our private email accounts, they should get a warrant. Currently, agencies can receive the stored email content of a user’s cloud email account by sending an administrative subpoena directly to the service provider. This creates a double standard, where paper communication has greater Fourth Amendment protections than electronic copies. This standard is outdated, as the law governing this issue has not been updated since 1986. Now our whole lives are in the cloud and stored online. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for accepting my amendment and Chairman GOODLATTE of the Judiciary Committee, and I urge all those in this process, House and Senate, to maintain the Housepassed language in the final version of the NDAA that we send to the President’s desk. 
b1230 PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5515, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019, AND PROVIDING FOR PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PERIOD FROM MAY 25, 2018, THROUGH JUNE 4, 2018 Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 908 and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alabama? There was no objection. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 908 provides for complete consideration of H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. The rule makes in order 168 amendments to go along with the previous 103 amendments made in order by yesterday’s rule. That means the full House will consider 271 amendments to this year’s NDAA. When you add in the 317 amendments considered in the Armed Services Committee, that means a total of 588 amendments to the NDAA will be considered this year. Mr. Speaker, for this year’s NDAA, a record number of amendments were submitted to the Rules Committee. I want to thank both the majority and the minority Rules Committee staff, our Rules associates, and the staff of the Armed Services Committee for the many hours they put into this open and deliberative process. As a member of both the Rules Committee and the Armed Services Committee, I have spent my fair share of time working on this piece of legislation. Like years past, I want to again highlight the bipartisan nature of our work. This year’s NDAA passed out of the Armed Services Committee on a bipartisan 60–1 vote. That bipartisanship will continue here on the floor, where 176 of the amendments made in order are minority or bipartisan amendments. The theme of this year’s NDAA is to reform and rebuild our Nation’s military. The bill supports an increase in topline funding for the military, as we continue working to reverse the readiness crisis we faced for at least the last decade. Any organization, including the military, is only as good as its people, and this NDAA authorizes a 2.6 percent pay raise for our troops, the largest increase in 9 years. This will help us retain and recruit the best and the brightest. The bill also calls for increases in the size of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Naval and Air Reserves, as well as the Air Guard. As vice chairman of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, I am pleased the bill authorizes construction of 13 new Navy ships. This is a muchneeded step, as we continue building towards a 355ship Navy. I am especially proud that this year’s NDAA includes many provisions important to my home State of Alabama. From Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville to the Anniston Army Depot to Fort Rucker in the Wiregrass to Maxwell Gunter in Montgomery to the Austal Shipyard in Mobile, this bill ensures that Alabama will continue playing a leading role in supplying, training, and supporting our Nation’s military. Sadly, we have lost far too many servicemembers to training accidents over the last year. The bill ensures improvements to military training and safety programs to help protect our servicemen and women. These efforts include repairing outdated equipment and ensuring the procurement of new firstclass capabilities. This includes additional Stryker A1 combat vehicles, Army armored brigade combat team vehicles, F/A–18E/F Super Hornets, C–130 Super Hercules aircraft, E–2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft, F–35 Joint Strike Fighters, UH– 60M Black Hawk helicopters, and advanced missiles. The bill continues to build on Chairman THORNBERRY ’s priority of reforming the Pentagon bureaucracy to make it more efficient and effective. This includes streamlining buying practices. From Russia to Iran to China to North Korea, the bill makes investments to ensure we are keeping up with our adversaries. The United States must stand ready to confront aggression around the globe, whether it is from major state actors or rogue terrorist organizations. Importantly, this year’s NDAA includes muchneeded investment in our nuclear deterrent and authorizations for the Missile Defense Agency. It authorizes funding for codevelopment and coproduction of missile defense and weapons systems with our key ally, Israel. All told, I am confident that this bill includes the reforms and funding levels necessary to rebuild and empower the greatest fighting force in the world. With this NDAA, we can hopefully continue to embody the strategy of peace through strength and support our servicemembers. Mr. Speaker, if you ever need a pick meup or a shot in the arm, I encourage you to spend some time visiting with our servicemen and women. These individuals come from all different walks of life and backgrounds. They all play different roles and have different jobs, but they are united by the common goal of defending and protecting the United States of America. I distinctly remember a conversation I had with a group of sailors from my home State of Alabama aboard the USS John C. Stennis a few years ago. After hearing about their various paths that led them to the Navy, I asked what I could do for them. One response was straightforward, but very poignant. She asked me to make sure the American people knew what they did and that we supported them. That is exactly what we do with this bill. We bring together Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, from different parts of the country, and we unite behind the common goal of supporting the men and women in uniform who protect the United States of America. With this bill, we can send a clear message to our sailors, soldiers, airmen and marines that the United States Congress has their back, that we are committed to the mission, and we will ensure that they have the right policies and the right resources to get the job done. This bill also sends a message to our friends and our adversaries that America is back, and that while we prefer peace, we will not hesitate to do what is necessary to defend our country and protect our interests. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting House Resolution 908, and for the 58th year in a row, let’s pass a bipartisan NDAA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, the National Defense Authorization Act is one of the most 
important items Congress considers. It is among the few authorizing bills we take up, and the only authorizing bill considered by the House every year. It is legislation designed to meet some of our most important obligations: increasing our military’s readiness, supporting our troops, and safeguarding our national security. But as critical as this measure is, the base bill is rarely perfect. That is why hundreds of amendments are submitted to the Rules Committee every year by Members on both sides of the aisle. Our meetings on this bill are usually the longest the committee holds all year because so many Members bring forward so many ideas. That is how the committee is supposed to function. And debating those ideas on this floor, even amendments we disagree with, is how the House of Representatives is supposed to work. That kind of process should not be the exception. It should be the norm. I know this may seem like a radical idea to the majority, but the world’s greatest deliberative body should regularly debate. Instead, this majority has developed a pattern: Every now and then they make a bunch of amendments in order on larger bills like this. But most of the time, they don’t allow any amendments on most bills. Roughly 55 percent of all the rules that the majority has implemented this Congress have been closed. So Members cannot do their job offering amendments here on the House floor to address the biggest issues we face. Under a closed rule, I will remind my colleagues, you can’t even fix a typo in a bill. Now, I know my Republican friends want to be congratulated for not considering this bill under yet another closed rule. After all, they broke their own record for closed rules this week, a sad milestone that makes this Congress the most closed Congress in history. This is the most closed Congress ever in the history of the United States of America. In fact, Speaker RYAN is the only Speaker in the history of our country to never have a truly open rule. But I think the American people hold the majority of this House to a higher standard. Just consider what Republicans have blocked from even getting a debate under this rule. The majority on the Rules Committee decided to block the bipartisan McGovernJonesLeeGaramendiKildeeWelch amendment. Now, this is a straightforward measure. It says that if the President and the Pentagon want to escalate the number of U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan in the next fiscal year, they need to send a report to Congress. We would then have 30 days to either disapprove of this escalation or allow it to move forward. It is simple, because all it asks is for this Congress to do its job, to stop abdicating its responsibility. It has been 17 years since Congress last passed an AUMF. We have been told year after year, Congress after Congress, that this is not the time to debate our role abroad. Well, Mr. Speaker, when is the time? We submitted this amendment to the Rules Committee last year during the FY 2018 defense authorization. But rather than making it in order, the majority moved forward with an alternative amendment that called for a report from the administration on our Afghanistan policy. The President signed that NDAA into law with that amendment. And guess what? Congress never got the report. It is more than 70 days past due. Clearly, asking for a study isn’t working. In fact, the President is ignoring it altogether. And over the last year, the administration decided to increase the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan by more than 4,000 additional servicemembers. That is on top of the more than 8,400 troops that are already there. The response from this majority has either been silence or to ask for a study. Mr. Speaker, I don’t need some study to tell me that this Congress needs to do its job. Issues of war and peace are among the toughest we consider, but we must take them up all the same. It is why we were sent here and it is what our men and women in uniform expect. Why is the majority afraid of a fair fight? Let’s debate whether President Trump should increase our engagement in Afghanistan even further. b1245 I am tired of being told that this is not the time for that vote because I believe it is past time. I have stood here year after year, Congress after Congress, as Speaker after Speaker told us to hurry up and wait. I remember when Speaker Boehner said it wasn’t right for the 113th Congress to be voting on an AUMF. We are now in the 115th Congress and another Speaker has told us the same thing. But again this year, a vote on an AUMF has been blocked. The majority also blocked debating amendments under this rule on other important issues, like striking the provision in this bill allowing for the transfer of machine guns between contractors and a separate measure to strike the provision here giving the President leeway to avoid implementing Russian sanctions. That is disappointing, and it is a disservice to this institution and to the people we represent. For all of the talk from the majority about how many amendments are included here, let’s not forget what is being blocked. This bill is incredibly important. It authorizes money for more than half of the Nation’s discretionary budget. That is about 54 cents of every tax dollar that pays for government programs other than entitlements. We should be having a robust debate on these issues here and now. Yes, we appreciate quantity; that is important. We want a lot of amendments made in order, but we would like quantity and quality. So substantive amendments like the issues that I just mentioned ought to be made in order. When it comes to our national defense, when it comes to debating the issues that are important to the American people, I want to let my colleagues know we Democrats aren’t cheap dates. We want to have our ideas presented and debated. And the American people aren’t cheap dates either. They can’t understand for the life of themselves why on issues of war and peace, on issues like our involvement in Afghanistan, which is now the longest war in history, why we don’t think it is important enough to debate that issue. We have men and women deployed in harm’s way, but we can’t be bothered on the House floor. We have roadblocks thrown in front of us so we can’t bring these amendments to the floor. We have a thousand excuses about why we can’t deal with some of these issues, why this is not the time. Enough. I mean, this is what we are here for. If you don’t want to talk about these issues, if you don’t want to debate these issues, leave, go into another business, but don’t take up space here in Congress spending all of your time trying to block these amendments from being brought to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I know a more open process is a foreign concept to the majority, but they should try it once in a while. This is the most closed Congress ever. Let’s let the sunlight in. Let’s have a process that is more accommodating. And on this defense bill, yes, there are a lot of amendments that have been made in order, but there were a lot of important, vital amendments that have been blocked, and I find that very disappointing. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let’s compare the records of the Republicans and the Democrats and who has the most open Congress. As of May 23 of this year, Republicans in this Congress have provided for consideration of over 1,130 amendments on the House floor. Over 520 of those, or 46 percent, were Democratic amendments; 430, or 38 percent, were Republican; and 170, or 16 percent, were bipartisan. In the 114th Congress, the GOP majority allowed over 1,700 amendments. In the 113th Congress, the GOP majority allowed over 1,500 amendments. In the entire 111th Congress, when the Democrats were in control, Speaker PELOSI , the Democrats, allowed less than 1,000 amendments to be considered on the floor. Who is more open? Democrats have highlighted the number of amendments not made in order in this Congress. However, in the 111th Congress when 
they controlled, their majority blocked nearly 3,000 amendments, with roughly 2,400 of those occurring in the very first sessions. Unlike our Democratic colleagues who shut the doors and refused to accept the late amendments from Members, Chairman SESSIONS of the Rules Committee has made it a point to ensure that every single Member has the opportunity to submit their amendments and come to the committee to share their thoughts and concerns, oftentimes late at night. Under this model of transparency and openness, the committee has spent countless hours listening and considering Member testimony. In fact, we have welcomed over 225 Members to testify at this Congress roughly 493 times and made in order over 1,130 amendments, including 521 from the Democrats, as I said. So I am glad to compare our record of openness with theirs. Let’s talk about the escalation in Afghanistan. There is a clear AUMF that authorizes what we are doing in Afghanistan. Under that AUMF, the military doesn’t have to come back to the Congress to say: Pretty please, can we put more soldiers into that country? I trust General Mattis. He knows what he is doing. He has a clear, legal authorization to do it, and I don’t think it makes any sense for him to have to come back to us. On the issue of the AUMF, which I know we will have more debate on during this rule debate, let me say one thing and say it clearly: I have cosponsored at least two AUMF bills, and those are in the Foreign Affairs Committee, not in the Armed Services Committee. We don’t have jurisdiction over that. I wish we did. In fact, I have cosponsored a bill with a Democratic colleague to put jurisdiction in the Armed Services Committee so we can get something done. So I would dearly love for the Foreign Affairs Committee to come forward with a bill, and I am happy to work with the gentleman to see that that takes place. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. MITCHELL ), the newest member of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am pleased to have the opportunity to join the House Armed Services Committee in time to participate in the review and markup of the fiscal year 2019 national defense authorization bill. I am pleased to participate in the investments this bill makes in our national defense. I would agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: They are not a cheap date. In fact, some of the amendments that my colleague mentioned were debated in committee and were defeated in committee. Apparently, we want to go through them multiple times; and unless they get everything they want, somehow they are going to protest. At some point in time, the process is what it is. The amendment is lost. I am pleased to participate in investments in defense, and in particular, the Stryker combat vehicle, a program that has a tremendous impact on combat readiness and capability of our Army. The Stryker brigade combat teams are some of the most frequently deployed units in the Army, and it exponentially increases the protection and lethality of our Nation’s soldiers. The most modern version of the vehicle, the Stryker A1, includes a double v hull that has already proven to protect soldiers from the most violent IED and mine blasts, as well as other upgrades to improve their mobility and communication capabilities. I am pleased with the House Armed Services Committee for seeing the wisdom of authorizing a total $360 million for the Stryker upgrades this fiscal year. That effort supports Army Chief of Staff General Milley’s plan to provide Stryker A1s to all brigade combat teams by 2025. I look forward to working with the chairman and over 250 Members of my House colleagues—across the aisle, by the way—who join me in a letter supporting the Stryker program and its continued efforts of development. Our soldiers who so often are deployed in harm’s way deserve every protection they can get, and we should provide that for them. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter to the Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , Washington, DC, April 12, 2018. DEAR SECRETARY ESPER : Thank you for your service to our nation and your robust efforts to increase the readiness and modernization budget of the U.S. Army. While you may have just begun, you are making remarkable progress on behalf of the American soldier and our national security. However, we would like to bring to your attention the continued budgetary challenges of the Stryker combat vehicle program. The Stryker vehicle is the Army’s most deployed and versatile combat vehicle and represents what may be the most successful Army acquisition program in recent memory from initial acquisition to the most recent upgrades. Yet there appears to be a disconnect between these facts and the Army’s FY19 budget request which once again neglects much needed Stryker procurement and modernization. In recent years, Congress has stepped in and ensured that the Army’s lack of budgetary commitment to Stryker did not prevent our soldiers in the field from receiving the safety and lethality upgrades necessary against the threats of today’s global environment. Congress has strongly supported both the conversion of flat bottomed Strykers to the more survivable DoubleV Hull (DVH) Stryker A1 version and the Stryker lethality (ICV) upgrade which adds a powerful 30mm cannon to the Stryker infantry variant. While we are pleased that the Army’s FY 19 modernization budget was increased by more than 14% from FY 18, we are perplexed why the Stryker program did not seem to benefit from this growth in investment funding, especially since it is our understanding that the Army has an operational requirement for additional brigades of improved Stryker (DVH) A1s. How can the Stryker fleet represent 30% of Army combat vehicles yet receive just 6% of the Army’s combat vehicle budget in FY 19? Congress has continually demonstrated our longstanding support for Stryker production and we request that you do the same by working with us in the FY19 defense budget process to develop a plan to sustain the Stryker program.

Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my colleague from Alabama, I appreciate the fact that he wants to defend what I think is indefensible, this process that the Republicans have implemented to run this House. I would be embarrassed to, but I know he has a job to do, and that is what he is doing. He talks about all of these amendments that were made in order. What he doesn’t tell you about is the over 2,000 amendments that they have blocked this session already, including a lot of Republican amendments that have been blocked, as well. It is always puzzling to me that the Republicans just kind of go along to get along, and they get shut out of the amendment process and they still vote for a rule. Maybe the day that they stop voting for these rules is a day that maybe we will see some changes. I also want to point out, and I don’t think he really appreciates this point and this is why this has become the most closed Congress in the history of the United States of America, that the majority of bills that have been brought to the floor are unamendable. They are totally closed. I can’t even offer an amendment to put a punctuation mark in a bill. I can’t change a comma. I can’t change the spelling of a word. The majority of bills have been totally closed, shut out to everybody. If that is the process that this majority wants to embrace, fine. I think that is the kind of process that we want to move away from because that is the kind of process that we see in authoritarian regimes, not in deliberative bodies like the United States Congress, not in the United States of America. The gentleman talks about that he trusts the administration on Afghanistan. Well, I don’t trust this President on anything, to be honest with you. I don’t know if he has ever been to Afghanistan, but I have, and the troops that I talked to in Afghanistan and those who are returning ask me the same thing over and over, and that is: What the hell are we doing? What is our mission? Now, if you think the mission is on target and everything is great, fine. Then vote to increase the number of troops there. But we ought to have a debate here on the floor on whether that is the right thing to do. On AUMFs, I am happy that the gentleman is cosponsoring a number of AUMFs. He says it is not appropriate to talk about it here in a defense authorization bill or a Defense Appropriations bill; that is a Foreign Affairs Committee bill, and we ought to deal with it there. When is the last time we have had a Foreign Affairs Committee bill that has been brought before us that we could amend to do an AUMF on? I don’t know. Maybe the gentleman may know when this AUMF is coming out of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I haven’t seen it. I have been waiting for years. They are in charge. They run this place. They control everything. So that is just another excuse, and it really is insulting to the men and women who put their lives on the line for this country. I mean, there is always an excuse why we can’t debate something. This has to stop, and I hope it stops soon. If not, maybe the elections will result in a change of leadership here. I hope that, if we have the privilege to take over, you see a much more accommodating process and, certainly, a process where important issues like this get to be debated. Mr. Speaker, the protests by thousands of teachers across the Nation have exposed not just low wages, but also severely dilapidated facilities. The 2016 State of Our Schools report determined that there is an annual State and local spending gap of $46 billion on school facilities. These facilities pose significant health and safety threats to more than 50 million students. In the richest country in the world, it is absolutely shameful that we allow our children to attend schools without heat and with dangerous mold, not to mention the thousands of schools lacking access to the connectivity necessary for digital learning. For this reason, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Education and the Workforce Committee member BOBBY SCOTT’s bill, H.R. 2475, the Rebuild America’s Schools Act. This legislation would provide the necessary funding to address critical physical and digital infrastructure needs in our schools, creating over 1.9 million jobs in the process. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. POE of Texas). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. As the Representative of Hampton Roads, Virginia, I support the significant increase in Navy shipbuilding in the NDAA. But while we consider national defense, we must also consider school construction. Yesterday, U.S. banks reported $56 billion in first quarter profits. At the same time, our teachers are being forced to go on strike for a living wage and adequate funding for our public schools. But when the majority pushed its tax bill through Congress, it was the banks, not teachers and not the schools, that received the biggest benefit. H.R. 2475, the Rebuild America’s Schools Act, would be a step forward in correcting our priorities by investing desperately needed funding into our public school infrastructure. This $100 billion proposal, which is barely 5 percent of what was spent on the tax cut for corporations and the wealthiest Americans, would go towards repairing crumbling public school buildings to ensure that every student has access to safe, healthy, and highquality learning facilities. Not only would this proposal improve school conditions and student academic outcomes, it would create jobs. Research from the Economic Policy Institute shows that for every $1 billion invested in school construction, 18,000 jobs are created. Therefore, a $100 billion Federal investment translates into about 1.8 million new jobs over the next decade. That is many times more than are projected from the $1.5 trillion tax cut. Last week, we honored the 64th anniversary of the Supreme Court landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that found separate is inherently unequal and ordered public education to integrate to provide equitable learning opportunities for all. Now, how can we now say that we followed the order in Brown when, just this winter, public schools in Baltimore were forced to close because they didn’t have heat? And how could we justify handing a massive tax cut to the wealthy and corporations while abandoning students and educators in public schools across the country? The answer is we can’t. The Rebuild America’s Schools Act would put us on a path to give students the safe and highquality education they deserve, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation. b1300 Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Virginia’s comments. He is the ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee in the House. I have the privilege of serving with him on that committee. I spent 8 years on the Alabama State Board of Education, 5 years in the Alabama State senate serving on both of 
our education committees, and 2 years as chancellor of postsecondary education for the State of Alabama. I care deeply about education. I know what it can do to better the lives of everybody in America. I find many of the comments the gentleman made with regard to this bill very interesting, and I hope there will be a time when we can take those up and consider them, but this is not that time. We are here today to talk about the defense of the United States of America. So, with all respect to the gentleman’s comments, I hope that he and I can sit down with others later and talk about that, particularly what is the role of the Federal Government versus what is the role of State and local governments. But today let’s talk about the defense of the United States. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DUNCAN ). Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama for yielding me this time. He is one of the great leaders in this Congress, and it is an honor to serve with him. Mr. Speaker, I have always heard that many government agencies spend roughly 60 percent of their budgets within the first 11 months and then scramble around during the last month trying to spend the rest of their budget so they won’t be cut for the next year. I think we should do what we can to incentivize more government employees to come up with costsaving ideas. That is why I introduced, along with Mr. POLIS from Colorado and Mr. J ONES  from North Carolina, an amendment to the NDAA which will do just that. It will give all military personnel even more reasons to be creative in how to save costs. I am pleased that my amendment, which has been made in order en bloc, directs the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on the military’s existing incentive programs for costsaving ideas. This amendment will also include a report on how the Secretary plans to expand and streamline those existing programs to better reward military personnel who help the Department of Defense to be more efficient. We need to be good stewards of the taxpayers’ money and should do everything we can to ensure that our military’s funding is used wisely and used where it is needed most. I introduced a bill several times many years ago to give Federal employees bonuses for half of any money that their agency or their department can save. This amendment hopefully will move us in that direction. On a side note, I do want to say that I believe the American people are really sick and tired of our spending hundreds of billions on a very unnecessary, nowin war in Afghanistan now 17 years old. I am disappointed that this bill continues that funding instead of bringing our troops back home. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE). The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman will suspend. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our ranking member for yielding and for his tremendous leadership on defense issues and so many other issues that are critical to our national and domestic security. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule and to H.R. 5515, which is the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act. This bill authorizes $717 billion in defense spending. Yet we know that there is at least $150 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse currently over at the Pentagon. Now we are giving them more money. Shame on us. This is an already outofcontrol, bloated Pentagon budget. It would also increase funding to $69 billion for wars that Congress has never debated or voted on. Once again, my Republican colleagues have used offthebooks spending gimmicks to further expand the bloated Pentagon budget. Enough is enough, Mr. Speaker. Instead of writing blank checks to the Pentagon, Congress needs to live up to its constitutional obligation to debate matters of war and peace. Yesterday I offered an amendment to sunset the 2001 and 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force after 8 months of enactment. Congress would have 8 months to debate and vote on a new AUMF before the repeal. Eight months is plenty of time. Mr. Speaker, we passed the 2001 AUMF within 3 days, mind you. Last week, of course, Speaker Ryan— and I say at the orders of Donald Trump—undemocratically stripped our bipartisan 2001 sunset amendment when the Defense Appropriations bill came before us. When in the world will this body have the backbone to debate the costs and consequences of these wars? Our brave troops deserve better. We need to do our job. I am pleased, though, that some of my amendments and others passed last night—which are very important amendments. They include clarifying that nothing in this bill can be construed as authorizing force against North Korea—that is the use of military force. Also we included reporting requirements for auditing the Pentagon. We need the Pentagon audited so that taxpayers will really begin to know where their hardearned tax dollars are going and what weapons systems they are contributing to in terms of the building of weapons systems which probably will never be used, a report and update on the United StatesKabul compact, and also overseas contingency operations reporting requirements. Can you believe we are spending all this money on a slush fund through OCO, and we don’t know what is going on with that account? The underlying bill is still a disgrace. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 30 seconds. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. In conclusion, I just want to reiterate that authorizing wars with no end, no debate, and no vote is unconstitutional, and it is wrong. I call on Speaker RYANto bring forth an authorization because every step of the way, we are trying in a bipartisan fashion to do this, and it is the Speaker’s call. He should do that so that we can debate and vote up or down on these wars. So this rule and this bill should not be passed just based on the amount of money that we are giving to the Pentagon to do more than ensure our national security and fight terrorism. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ on the rule and the underlying bill and reject this shameful bill. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the gentlewoman’s comments, and she probably is unaware of the fact that we are presently undergoing for the first time in the history of the Department of Defense a full Department wide audit. We are already getting some of the things that they have determined from that audit back. That audit is going to give us information we need to make some further changes in the management performance of the Pentagon. She probably didn’t know we are already underway with that, but that is going to be completed in early fall of this year. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ), who is my colleague from both the Rules Committee and the Armed Services Committee. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. BYRNE , for his tremendous work on this issue on the Rules Committee as well as on the Armed Services Committee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this rule and the bipartisan 
work of the House Armed Services Committee that has gone into crafting the underlying bill. This year’s NDAA authorizes programs that are absolutely crucial, Mr. Speaker, to the defense of this Nation. The bill authorizes funding at levels that will begin to restore our readiness, replacing aging equipment and weapons, and developing the next generation of military technology. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would clearly like to divert attention from these issues. They would like to try to discuss everything under the sun, it seems, except funding for our men and women in uniform who are on the front lines defending the freedom that allows us to have the debate that we are having today in this very Chamber. The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that, without the funding authorized in this bill, our adversaries will continue to close capability gaps and further erode our military superiority. Mr. Speaker, while passage of this rule and the underlying NDAA are vital, our work will not be done. We must appropriate the funds authorized here, and we must finally, Mr. Speaker, repeal the Budget Control Act. For the last decade, this body has routinely forced the Department of Defense to operate under continuing resolutions. In plain English, this means we are asking our men and women in uniform to stay on their posts and put their lives on the line to defend all of us while at the same time depriving them of the resources they need to do that job. The situation, Mr. Speaker, was exacerbated in 2011 with the arbitrary budget caps and sequestration of the Budget Control Act. This has devastated military readiness and enabled our adversaries to make significant gains that threaten our security and our military superiority. In testimony earlier this year, Secretary of Defense Mattis described the severity of the situation and congressional responsibility for the situation this way: ‘‘As hard as the last 16 years of war have been, no enemy in the field has done as much to harm the readiness of the U.S. military than the combined impact of the Budget Control Act’s defense spending caps, worsened by operating for 10 of the last 11 years under continuing resolutions of varied and unpredictable duration.’’ In a world in which we face the most complex and severe threat environment we have faced since the end of World War II, this situation is simply shameful. The men and women who put their lives on the line for all of us are sick and tired—as my colleague said, that is absolutely true—but they are sick and tired, Mr. Speaker, of being held hostage to a range of Democratic pet programs and politics that are often played by those on the other side of the aisle in this Chamber. Year after year, Mr. Speaker, we have completed our work in this body on the Defense Appropriations bill, and we have done it on time. Unfortunately, the same is not true of our colleagues in the Senate. Rules over in the Senate have allowed Democrats in that body to hold critical funding for our military hostage in an effort to advance unrelated issues. Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle join me in the belief that no member of our military—no mother or father or wife or husband or child of any servicemember—should have to continue to pay the price for the dysfunction of the United States Congress’ budget process. I fully expect that this House will complete our work, once again, Mr. Speaker, to fund our military in a timely manner this year. I call on my colleagues, the Democrats in this body and in the Senate, to join us in fulfilling our most important constitutional obligation. We must avoid another continuing resolution for the Department of Defense, and we must pass the funding authorized under this bill required to provide for the common defense. The first step in that overall process is the work we are doing here this week. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this rule so we can complete our work on the underlying bill. I urge passage of the NDAA, and I urge my colleagues to join us in putting the resources in place our troops need, to stop holding our troops hostage, and to work with us to break the cycle of continuing resolutions that have only served to undermine military readiness. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say to my Rules Committee colleague that I agree with her that this place is pretty dysfunctional. But I just want to point out, in case she has forgotten, that the White House is controlled by Republicans, the House is controlled by Republicans, and the Senate is controlled by Republicans. So the gentlewoman can blame everybody she wants, but the Republicans are in charge of everything. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) to respond to Mr. BYRNE . Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to respond to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE ) and say that I know exactly what is going on over at the Pentagon in terms of their auditing requirements and what they are doing. But I have to say the Pentagon—and the gentleman should know this—has never been audited, I know, for the last 50 years. The public understands it needs to be audited because they see each and every day the wasteful spending of the Pentagon when you just look at, for example, CEO compensation of millions and millions and millions of dollars that are being paid to defense contractor executives on the taxpayers’ dime. So, yes, I know what is going on; and, yes, it has not been audited in 50 years. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a May 22 letter signed by 32 former Republican and Democratic defense and foreign policy officials rejecting the building and use of lowyield nuclear warheads and opposing their authorization and their funding. 
MAY22, 2018. Hon. JIMMCGOVERN , House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE MCGOVERN : We write to respectfully request that Congress reject the Trump administration’s request for new, more usable, ‘‘lowyield’’ nuclear warheads for Trident missiles. There is no need for such weapons and building them would make the United States less safe. These socalled ‘‘lowyield’’ weapons are a gateway to nuclear catastrophe and should not be pursued. To justify this dangerous proposal, the Trump administration is promoting a false narrative that the United States has a ‘‘gap’’ in its ability to deter the use of nuclear weapons by Russia. Officials allege that Moscow believes that an American president would not respond to Russian use of ‘‘tactical,’’ or lower yield, nuclear weapons if his only options include ‘‘strategic,’’ or high yield, ones. The president, they argue, would be ‘‘selfdeterred.’’ To plug this supposed ‘‘deterrence gap,’’ the Trump administration wants to develop and deploy new lowyield nuclear warheads on Trident II D5 missiles on Ohioclass submarines. The administration is asking Congress for $88 million in FY2019 for this new warhead, in a program that would be completed in that fiscal year under the aegis of the W76 Life Extension Program. Yet this justification for new Trident warheads fails on many levels: 1. There is no ‘‘deterrence gap.’’ The United States has a massive nuclear arsenal of some 4,000 warheads, half of which are deployed on landbased missiles, submarines, and bombers. The administration is in the process of rebuilding this arsenal at an estimated cost of $1.7 trillion, with inflation, over the next 30 years. While this immense program is excessive, adds to a new arms race with Russia, and should be scaled back, Russia cannot doubt that the United States is serious about maintaining an unambiguously strong nuclear deterrent. 2. The United States already has many lowyield nuclear weapons. As part of that massive arsenal, the United States already has about 1,000 nuclear weapons with low yield options, which are being modernized at great expense. If the president ever needed to use a lowyield nuclear weapon, he has many options. 3. Nuclear war cannot be controlled. Perhaps the biggest fallacy in the whole argument is the mistaken and dangerous belief that a ‘‘small’’ nuclear war would remain small. There is no basis for the dubious theory that, if Russia used a ‘‘lowyield’’ nuclear weapon and the United States responded in kind, the conflict could stay at that level. Indeed, it is unlikely that there is such a thing as a limited nuclear war; preparing for one is folly. As George Shultz, Secretary of State for President Ronald Reagan, recently noted, ‘‘A nuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon. You use a small one, then you go to a bigger one. I think nuclear weapons are nuclear weapons and we need to draw the line there.’’ Secretary of Defense James Mattis similarly declared, ‘‘I don’t think there’s any such thing as a tactical nuclear weapon. Any 
nuclear weapon used at any time is a strategic game changer.’’ Ultimately, the greatest concern about the proposed lowyield Trident warhead is that the president might feel less restrained about using it in a crisis. When it comes to using a nuclear weapon, restraint is a good thing. The proposed ‘‘lowyield’’ Trident warhead is dangerous, unjustified, and redundant. Congress has the power to stop the administration from starting down this slippery slope to nuclear war. We call on Congress to exercise that authority without delay. Sincerely, The Hon. George P.

b1315 Mr. MCGOVERN. This letter is coled by former Reagan Secretary of State George Shultz and former Clinton Secretary of Defense William Perry. Mr. Speaker, as the letter states, ‘‘there is no such thing as a limited nuclear war and preparing for one is folly.’’ George Shultz, Secretary of State for President Ronald Reagan, recently noted: ‘‘A nuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon. You use a small one, then you go to a bigger one.’’ Secretary of Defense James Mattis also recently declared: ‘‘I don’t think there’s any such thing as a tactical nuclear weapon. Any nuclear weapon used at any time is a strategic game changer.’’ Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill, for all of its many positive developments, is seriously deficient in this particular area. It authorizes funding for new low yield nuclear weapons. The U.S. already possesses lowyield nuclear weapons. If these weapons are not effective deterrents, we should examine why before building and deploying a new generation of weapons. We should listen to our seasoned elder statesmen and women and stop walking down a road that begins a nuclear war that can rapidly escalate. Any use of a nuclear weapon is a catastrophe. We should be destroying nuclear weapons, not building new ones. I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together and make sure this funding is not included in the final version of the FY19 NDAA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill authorizes what it authorizes with regard to these smaller nuclear weapons because we find our adversaries developing such nuclear weapons. We are not developing them because we want to use them. We want to develop them because the mere fact that we have got them, we believe, is a deterrent to our adversaries using the very same weapons they have in their arsenal themselves. So we are simply making sure that we don’t have one hand tied behind our back if we get into one of these types of conflicts. I understand what the gentleman is saying. No one ever wants to use a nuclear weapon. But to see your adversary have such a weapon and do nothing is not what we should do to defend the people of the United States. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would say to the gentleman that we already have lowyield nuclear weapons. I don’t know why we need more. We heard the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), talk about the amendment he would like to see made in order to help reinforce our schools. I think most people watching also appreciate the fact that our national defense includes things like the quality of life for people here in this country, including the quality of our schools, whether people have jobs, whether people have good healthcare. We are shortchanging all these domestic investments, and I think the concern we have is when you start investing in more nuclear weapons, not only is it not a good use of our taxpayer dollars, but it also increases insecurity for the people of this country. Mr. Speaker, this is the most closed Congress in the history of the United States of America. Let me repeat that. This is the most closed Congress in the history of the United States of America. The majority is very proud of this rule. They have made a bunch of amendments in order on a handful of bills to run up their numbers, but let’s remember one thing: On most bills, the majority of the legislation that comes to this floor, they do not allow a single amendment. Not one. On most bills that come to the floor, no Member of this House, Democratic or Republican, can offer an amendment. This rule before us today is not closed, but let me highlight a few germane amendments from the 281 amendments that this rule blocks. Several bipartisan amendments were blocked, such as an amendment by Representatives DENHAM , F OSTER , CURBELO , and P ANETTA which allows Dreamers who grew up in the United States to gain legal status, provided that they serve out the terms of their enlistment honorably. So we are talking about rewarding people who served in our military. That was the amendment. That was brought before the Rules Committee. That was blocked. There was another bipartisan amendment from 25 Members, including myself, that expresses the sense of Congress that the lessons of past genocides should be applied to help prevent future war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. I say to my colleagues: When did a sense of Congress on the atrocities of genocide become such a controversial topic? But that was blocked. This rule blocks an amendment by Representative KEATING to test ticks for an increased number of tickborne diseases. When did fighting tickborne diseases become too sensitive for the House to debate? This rule, once again, blocks us from having one of the most important debates we could have. It prevents us 
from debating whether or not to send our sons and daughters into harm’s way. The bipartisan amendment by Representatives LEE, JONES , and E LLISON  would repeal the 2001 AUMF after 240 days of enactment of the act, giving Congress ample time to debate a new AUMF. The Constitution of the United States says the Congress has the power to declare war. This is our job, Mr. Speaker. And I appreciate the gentleman from Alabama saying: Well, the Foreign Affairs Committee deals with that, not us. We hear that every year. Every year that goes by, we don’t see any bill from the Foreign Affairs Committee dealing with these topics. The bottom line, let’s be honest, is we don’t deal with it because Members in the majority don’t want to deal with this difficult issue. I have always said that our failure to act on an AUMF, our failure to debate these issues, represents moral cowardice. What about our workers? Representatives ELLISON , POCAN , and G RIJALVA  had an amendment blocked that would have prohibited Federal contracts with companies that have repeated and willful wage theft violations. Why would we knowingly reward companies that hurt our workers? The list goes on: An amendment by Representative LIEUto require a public report on all DOD expenditures to support Presidential visits to entities owned or significantly controlled by the President or a member of his immediate family. The American people deserve to know if the President and his family are directly profiting off of this Presidency. Blocked. Blocked. An amendment by Representative VEASEY that would prohibit the deportation of family members of servicemembers on Active Duty. How can we, with a good conscience, deport the family members of brave young men and women putting their lives on the line for all of us and fighting for our safety everyday? Blocked. An amendment by Representative TORRES , a distinguished member of the Rules Committee, that would have prevented DOD in helping the Department of Homeland Security from deporting spouses, parents, and sons and daughters of certain military personnel, veterans, and enlistees. Mr. Speaker, I could spend the rest of the week describing the thousands of amendments that this Republican leadership has blocked, but I would much prefer to be debating the ideas that Members from both parties have put forward in good faith. This is the most closed Congress in history. Dana Milbank recently described it as the most authoritarian Congress in history. You know, 180 Democratic Members have had an amendment blocked in this Congress alone. That is 180 elected Members. I would like my Republican friends to listen closely to my next point. This Congress, 180 Republican Members have also had their amendments blocked this Congress. You are all voting to block your own ideas. Stop it. Read the rules that you are voting on. The vast majority of Republican Members have had their proposals blocked from even getting a vote. I don’t understand why you keep voting to block proposals that you supposedly believe in. Hundreds of Republican amendments have been blocked by the Rules Committee. Most Republicans voted to block them. They are your amendments. I don’t understand why it is such a radical idea to debate any of the amendments I just spoke about. We can do so much better. Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of amendments that have been made in order. There is a lot of quantity. But a lot of the amendments that really shine in quality and that are important in terms of substance have been blocked. This is nothing new. Again, the majority of bills that come to this floor are under closed rules. You can’t amend them. Nobody can. Take it or leave it. The majority of bills that come to this floor are closed. I know it is uncomfortable for my Republican friends to hear that they have presided over this closed process, but my hope is they will be so embarrassed and so ashamed that they will want to change things. They can still redeem themselves. We are only in May. They have a long way to go. Whether it is on the defense bill, on an education bill, or whatever bill it is, there are good ideas that are being brought forward. I will close with this. I met with a group of young students who were engaged in the nationwide protest asking Congress to do something on gun violence. And the most frustrating thing they said to them is the fact that when they were lobbying Members of Congress, it’s not even about telling them how to vote on an issue; they are frustrated because you can’t get a vote on any of the issues that are related to gun violence. We won’t let anything come to the floor. It is wrong. I just say to my friends, in closing, if this place becomes more accommodating, if the Speaker decides to live up to the words that he enunciated when he became Speaker of the House, to have a more open process, to respect all ideas, let me tell you something; you are going to see a decrease in polarization. You are going to see more bills passed a bipartisan way. You are going to see more good bills going forward. Legislation will be better. If you have a lousy process, you end up with a lousy bill. Again, I respect all the time and energy that went into crafting this NDAA. I respect the chairman and the ranking member, Democrats and Republicans alike, but there are a lot of important amendments here that are being blocked that are really important and that most of our constituents would believe deserve a debate and a vote on this floor. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule. And I plead with them, let’s bring some accomodation and some respect to differing ideas and just regular order to this House, because this is certainly not what I think any of us could possibly believe is the way our government should be run. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I know that some of our Democratic colleagues—not all of them—would like for us today to be talking about a Federal takeover of local education. Some of my Democratic colleagues—not all of them— would like to talk about doing away with the Second Amendment. But that is not what we are about today. We are talking about the defense of the United States of America. Remember where we were 2 years ago, at the end of the Obama administration. ISIS still controlled vast swaths of western Iraq and eastern Syria. Iran had just gotten its hands on tens of billions of dollars that had been frozen—money that they were able to get because of the deal that President Obama cut with them. We now know that they have taken that money and increased defense spending, military spending, in Iran by 40 percent. Two years ago, we had cut troop levels down to levels we haven’t seen in decades. In fact, we cut the Air Force to the point it had never been since the founding of the Air Force. Our fleet had been cut down to less than 280 ships after it had been to at least 400 under the Clinton administration. Fifty percent of the Navy’s jets couldn’t fly. Our adversaries didn’t fear us and our friends and allies didn’t know if they could count on us. We have begun to turn that around. ISIS is largely gone from Iraq. It is largely gone from Syria. It is obliterated as a conventional force after becoming a conventional terrorist army that controlled a big chunk of the Middle East. Gone. Slipped over into North Africa. We understand that. So we have to continue what we are doing to fight against them in those places. And, yes, we need an AUMF to do that. We have also done something that is very important in rebuilding our military. We have told our men and women that we value them by giving them pay increases. This bill calls for another pay increase on top of the one we gave them last year. They have gone too long without real pay increases. We are beginning to give them the equipment they need to do the missions that we have them to do. More ships, more jets, more ammunition, more missiles, more missile defense. We are going to make sure that our jets can fly. Most importantly, we want to make sure that our men and women in uniform have the training, preparation, 
and support they need so we don’t have another year that goes by where we have more of our men and women in uniform who lose their lives in training exercises than they do in combat. b1330 We are turning that around. We are leaving the sorry legacy of the Obama administration so that we can put in place a defense strategy for this country that will defend our country and, at the same time, protect the safety of our men and women in uniform. So that is what we are here today to talk about. I believe that we will vote on this bill, the underlying bill, in a bipartisan fashion because, going back to the Kennedy administration, that is what we have done year after year after year. That is the message that we send to our foes, to our friends abroad, and, yes, to those men and women in uniform: that we come together, this Congress comes together, to make sure that we do what we are supposed to do in our job to defend this country. Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 908 and the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. MCGOVERN is as follows: 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of adoption.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 908, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 53 printed in House Report 115–702 be modified in the form I have placed at the desk. 
The ACTING Chair. The Clerk will report the modification. The Clerk read as follows: Modification to amendment No. 53 offered by Mr. CURBELO of Florida: 
The amendment as modified is as follows: Page 877, insert after line 9 the following new section (and redesignate the succeeding sections accordingly): 
Mr. THORNBERRY (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent the modification be considered as read. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the original request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is modified. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman THORNBERRY for yielding me time. Mr. Chairman, protecting U.S. Government communication networks from foreign adversaries such as China is vital to our national security. I share the concerns of FBI Director Wray, who testified before the Senate. He was deeply concerned about the risk of allowing any company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments that don’t share our values to gain positions of power inside our telecommunications networks. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to see that section 880 of the NDAA of FY19 addresses this concern by prohibiting Federal departments and agencies from procuring equipment and services from foreign firms such as ZTE and Huawei. Specifically, ZTE violated U.S. sanctions and then got caught lying about it. After agreeing to discipline their employees, they lied again and, instead, gave those employees a bonus. Now it appears that we are offering them the same kind of deal. They clearly do not have a record built on trust with the United States Government. This poses significant risks to our Nation’s security. However, this prohibition does not apply to State and local governments, who often rely on Federal grant dollars and play a major role in the protection of our Nations’ security, and that is why I have offered this amendment. My amendment simply extends the prohibition on purchasing ZTE and Huawei products and services to Federal grant money and loans to better safeguard State and local communications networks. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to protect our Nation’s communications networks from foreign adversaries and support this amendment. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN  GRISHAM ). Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, New Mexico is home to the Kirtland Air Force Research Laboratory that develops groundbreaking technologies that support our men and women in the Armed Forces. These technologies often have a range of commercial applications that can reenergize domestic manufacturing, create highpaying jobs, and increase economic development in our State, which has the second highest unemployment rate in the Nation. Highspeed internet servers, GPS, electric vehicles, and even microwave ovens are just a few of the examples of transformational technologies that were originally developed by the Federal Government. My amendments would help facilitate the commercialization of innovative DODdeveloped technologies by investing in the scientists, engineers, and mathematicians serving in our military laboratories. By providing laboratory personnel with business education, entrepreneurial sabbaticals, and new opportunities to partner with universities and businesses, we can make cuttingedge technologies more widely available to American businesses and consumers, grow our economy, and ensure that the United States leads the world in innovation. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendments. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ). Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, I greatly appreciate everybody recognizing the importance of the hardworking folks at the Defense Financing Accounting Services. Lots of our fellow Americans might not realize that DFAS has an incredibly important function to cut the payroll checks for our men and women in uniform, and also they pay the vendors, suppliers, and contractors that keep our military operating; 122 million transactions last year. Mr. Chairman, during the past 20 years, the Pentagon has consolidated 300 DFAS offices into 10 today, and the civilian workforce has been reduced from 27,000 to 13,000. Mr. Chairman, I am so pleased and grateful that the Armed Services Committee and the Rules Committee are advancing my amendment to clarify that there is no intention by the House of Representatives to further consolidate any DFAS location or jobs. Mr. Chairman, I am so proud of the 600 hardworking Mainers who cut checks for our brave military personnel at the DFAS facility in Limestone, Maine, way up north in Aroostook County. These 600 Maine jobs are so important to our families and also to our military personnel. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. SUOZZI ). Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that my bipartisan amendment has been included in this en bloc package. There is a major problem in our country that Americans want us to address. It is a bipartisan issue related to contamination related from defenserelated activities, and I want to thank 
the chairman of the committee for his assistance in working on this, as well as my colleagues, Congressman COOK and Congresswoman HANABUSA , for their work in helping to get this done. Military bases and munitions storage depots and armament manufacturing facilities have left behind a multibilliondollar legacy of required environmental cleanup. Under my amendment, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and the Environment will be required to brief the Committee on Armed Services on initiatives being pursued to accelerate environmental restoration efforts. In my district alone, there is a site that was contaminated by a Grumman in conjunction with the United States Navy. It was discovered over 40 years ago. It has contaminated groundwater, which is the sole source of drinking water on Long Island. There are people that are trying to get these things cleaned up, but there is so much bureaucracy, so much red tape, so much fingerpointing, that we need to send a clear message from Congress that we need the executive branch to work together with us to accelerate this cleanup. Mr. Chairman, this amendment will help get that done. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ), the distinguished chair of our Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this en bloc package. Mr. Chairman, this package includes a bipartisan amendment to ensure that video surveillance equipment is included in the scope of the NDAA’s prohibition on using certain Chinese technology in government agencies. China is actively expanding the role of its companies in the U.S. domestic communications and public safety sectors. Video surveillance and security equipment sold by Chinese companies exposes the U.S. Government to significant vulnerabilities due to builtin backdoors baked right into their products. These backdoors can be used to covertly funnel data, including live video and audio surveillance of America’s sensitive military installations and embassies, back to Chinese operatives. Given what we know about China’s intentions and the security risks posed by these firms, we have absolutely no business helping China extend its networks further and further into our agencies. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH for including this amendment in the package. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER ). Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the ranking member for yielding me the time. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to increase flexibility within the Small Business Innovative Research and Technology Transfer Programs. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH for including it in this en bloc package. Federal research programs invest in the future and ensure we stay at the global forefront of innovation and advancement. But this investment is only the first step of the process. We must ensure that innovators and entrepreneurs have the tools necessary to bring their ideas to market. Currently, SBIR and STTR recipients are restricted in how much funding they can use towards commercialization. My amendment would increase the amount of funding recipients in phase 1 and phase 2 can use to pay for assistance protecting intellectual property, conducting market research, mapping out manufacturing plans, and other steps that would help them successfully commercialize their ideas. My amendment would help empower successful innovators with more resources to turn federally funded research into viable commercial products, creating quality jobs and securing our Nation’s creative leadership. b1445 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 55 be removed from the en bloc package. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the modification. The Clerk read the modification as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The Acting CHAIR. Amendments en bloc No. 1 is modified. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. TAKANO ). Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which would create a demonstration program in the Air Force for 15 to 20 deaf and hardofhearing individuals to serve their country. This amendment is inspired by a young deaf man I met a few years ago named Keith Nolan. He excelled at the first two levels of Army ROTC and was prepared to take the next step when he was told that he could not continue because he is deaf. Including this amendment is an incredible tribute to Keith’s advocacy, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to maintain this provision. I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for including this amendment. I am excited that we are taking this step forward to give the deaf community a chance to defend the country that they love and that we love. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI ). Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, Iran is the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism. In spite of their weak economy and U.S.imposed sanctions in response to Iran’s support for terrorism, abuse of human rights, and acquisition of prohibited weapons, they continue to support violent groups abroad. As our diplomatic and military leaders determine how best to respond to Iran, they and the world, including Iranians, should have a detailed accounting of the amount spent by Iran to support specific terrorist groups. This is especially important in light of the escalating conflict between Israel and Iranbacked forces in Syria. My amendment requires an annual report from the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence describing Iranian expenditures on military and terrorist activities outside their country. This will send a clear message to Iran and our allies that we do not tolerate support of terrorism. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and ranking member for including my amendment in this en bloc, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, we have no further speakers. I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc, as modified, offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ). The en bloc amendments, as modified, were agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . GUTHRIE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 115–702. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle B of title III, insert the following: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 908, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I really appreciate the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee for working with me on this amendment. I rise in support of the amendment to clarify Congress’ intent with regard to energy security and conservation programs at Fort Knox. In January 2009, a major ice storm hit my district, crippling local infrastructure for days. This outage across the region also affected Fort Knox, due to the post’s reliance on the local energy grid. This weather event highlighted a vulnerability that local leaders at Fort Knox took very seriously and had already been working for years to mitigate. With the full support of the Pentagon, the leaders on post and in the community around Fort Knox have made great strides to make Fort Knox the Army’s first energysecure installation. This really is a great story and one that we in Congress should support. My amendment is about how natural gas fits into the complex, highly sophisticated energy security program at Fort Knox, Kentucky being blessed with natural gas. The awardwinning combination of features and the Fort Knox energy program ranges from new power generation facilities to a geothermal pond, infrared heating system, extensive energy efficiency upgrades, and even a solar array. The dashboard in the control room is incredible to see as energy officials can remotely observe and analyze current energy consumption and efficiency, isolated to the level of individual rooms in the buildings on post. While the energy conservation program started in the 1970s, the natural gas story really came into focus a little over 10 years ago when the Army established service contracts with local companies to drill and pump methane gas on post. This is everything we want for our national security: energy independence and security that saves Federal money, offthegrid capability during moments of a national crisis, and utilizing energy resources efficiency as close to the source as possible. Natural gas has been produced and used on post since 2009 and makes up about 28 percent of annual needs. The amount of gas produces enough for an entire summer load. However, the catch is, and why we are here with this amendment, that the Interior Department has raised concerns because the Army did not go through the typical Bureau of Land Management lease process. The Bureau of Land Management lease process will not work for this kind of operation because it is not in our national security interest to give mineral rights for DOD property to a third party. The Army should be able to access the resources on post for consumption and use on post without having to go through a third party or remit royalties. This amendment simply allows Fort Knox to continue their great energy security success story and gives them the ability to remain the number one energysecure Army installation. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I am a little surprised that someone from Kentucky is sponsoring this amendment, because if this amendment were to become law, who would be the biggest loser? It would be the Commonwealth of Kentucky. When the Army started developing natural gas under Fort Knox, it did so without notifying the Department of the Interior, which is the agency that is responsible for these resources. Now the Defense Department has admitted that it was a mistake and says that it has taken steps to prevent this from ever happening again. But we still know that they are producing gas, and I am glad that they have taken steps to prevent this in the future. To my knowledge, that is not the critical issue. The critical issue is that we have a real problem here. That is, the natural gas that is under Fort Knox belongs to the American people, not the military, and royalties are owed to the American people when that gas is sold. As we know, half of those royalties would go to Kentucky. For example, in 2014, the Army estimated that it effectively cheated Kentucky out of $250,000, and now there are 4 more years of cheating Kentucky and the American people out of their royalties. That number is probably much larger now than the $250,000 a year. We have no indication that the Army has paid any of these royalties, and until we deal with that issue that they are not paying royalties for the gas that the American people and the people of Kentucky own, we should not be letting them off the hook. I would ask the sponsor of the amendment to look closely at this issue and what his home State stands to lose because of it and then to reconsider again whether or not he wants this amendment to be adopted. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I just want to close by saying that it is owned by the American people, the military, which is why we are here today at the national level. It is owned by the American people. There are things that we can work through so that we can move forward. Fort Knox is an economic driver in the community. The Federal tax dollars that come to Fort Knox to support our men and women contribute greatly to that community. Being energy secure is a vital component when we look at the overall needs of the Army and the importance of every Army post, and Fort Knox can certainly make a great claim, being off the grid and being able to operate in times of national emergencies. So I do think this has been thought through. I think instead of going through the other process, we need to move forward and let the Department of Defense do what the Pentagon had sent Fort Knox forward to do. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the comments of my friend from California, but I do think this is the right policy to move forward, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE ). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 8 OFFERED BY MR . AMODEI  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 115–702. Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Add at the end the following: DIVISION E—NATIONAL STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL MINERALS PRODUCTION 
This division shall not apply to any mineral described in Secretarial Order 3324, issued by the Secretary of the Interior on December 3, 2012, in any area to which the order applies. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 908, the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. AMODEI ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada. Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. My amendment would streamline the permitting process for production of minerals deemed critical and strategic for national security and other infrastructure needs. What does the word ‘‘streamline’’ mean? If you read the amendment, it means 30 months. Now, I am a little embarrassed to tell you that streamline is 30 months, but unless the parties agree to something longer, it is 30 months. When you say ‘‘deemed critical,’’ if you read the amendment, you will see multiple pages basically paying respect to the NEPA process and also setting forth due process and asking for a Federal representative of the lead agency to coordinate Federal permitting actions so that we proceed as expeditiously as possible when there is, in fact, a need that affects the Armed Services of our country for supply chain and things like that that are critical. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment The Acting CHAIR (Mr. BARTON ). The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simply an attempt to waive portions of our environmental laws for all—and I use the word ‘‘all’’—new mines by pretending that these mines are essential for national security. Under this amendment, even sand and gravel—yes, sand and gravel— would become a critical and strategic mineral. The proponents of this amendment have argued in the past that sand and gravel are extremely important when you need to build roads. I will agree with that; it is. But this is a deliberate distortion of the meaning of what is a critical mineral. When it comes to minerals, just because something is important does not mean that it is critical. When someone is in critical condition in the hospital, that doesn’t simply mean that their condition is important. It has a specific meaning. The same is true for critical minerals. All reputable definitions of critical minerals make it clear that there must be a risk of losing access to the mineral for it truly to be called critical. Even the definition from an executive order signed by President Trump just 5 months ago says that a critical mineral has to have a supply chain that is vulnerable to disruption. b1500 In the final list of critical minerals identified by the Secretary of the Interior published just last week, the department states that it recognizes the economic significance and indispensable nature of minerals such as sand and gravel. But it also states: ‘‘ . . . these minerals do not currently meet the definition of critical’’ because we are not reliant on imports and we have access here in the United States to adequate domestic sources. Simply put, we are not at risk of losing access to our supplies of sand and gravel, and no foreign government is threatening to close down our quarries. We should not be waiving environmental laws for every single mineral simply because it is important for something. Supporters of the amendment say a broad definition is needed because what is and isn’t critical changes all the 
time, so we shouldn’t tie our hands. But I point out, it only took 4 months for the Interior Department of this administration to publish their final list of critical minerals, and that is starting from scratch. Clearly the existing process is already very quick and very flexible. There is no need to define everything as critical and weaken environmental protections for all mines just so a mining company doesn’t have to wait 4 months. Also, if this amendment looks familiar to many of my colleagues, that is because it is language that has come out of the Natural Resources Committee on a party line vote in each of the past four Congresses. In the past three Congresses it passed the House, again on a party line vote, only to go nowhere in the Senate. The reason why it goes nowhere in the Senate is because that body understands what the definition of a critical and strategic mineral is. This amendment would have similar luck in the Senate, and it has no business being added to a defense authorization bill. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR ). Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my good friend and colleague, Representative AMODEI ’s, amendment. The amendment aims to streamline a bureaucratic process that is hampering the production of defense critical metals and minerals. Strategic and critical minerals are important to national security and help provide our troops with the equipment and weapons they need to keep us safe. A nonclassified defense study recently found that failure to have a reliable supply chain for at least 16 of the 35 critical minerals has already caused significant weapon system production delays for the Department of Defense. A recent report published by the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey found the U.S. is 100 percent net import reliant on foreign countries, including China, for 20 different critical minerals. Such reliance threatens our national security as well as our ability to make equipment and weapons that our troops need to be successful in their missions. I applaud Representative AMODEI and his strong leadership and tireless efforts to support the needs of our men and women in uniform, and I urge the adoption of this amendment. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, it is good to hear that my colleagues from the Golden State think that the administration is doing a good job in this area in some respects, and it is good to hear about concerns about the State of Kentucky. But let’s talk about what is actually in the amendment. So let’s talk about what is not in the amendment first. First of all, there is nothing in the amendment that says you must approve a request to be considered a strategic critical mineral. So when we talk in the context of, oh, gee, this could be sand and gravel, some Federal land manager in the executive department, under the provisions in this amendment, has to find that. By the way, there are multiple pages saying how they go about that. So it is 30 months. Guess what? After that 30 months, you don’t get a yes. So when we talk about how the sky is going to fall, let’s keep in mind that if you can’t satisfy them on whatever it is that is critical, then guess what? You may get a no, as should be done if it doesn’t satisfy that. So to indicate in context that this is something that is going to make everything critical omits the whole application process and omits the consideration process that goes over 30 months. Now, I just want to point out a couple other things, because, quite frankly, although maybe the other side thinks that the crystal ball that the administration has is an excellent one, I beg to differ. Since we are talking about things that happened in specific States, let’s talk about the Loma Prieta earthquake that happened in northern California a while back that, quite frankly, shut down freeways— major arteries—in the bay area. Now, I don’t know if sand and gravel would have been appropriate and critical for that, but guess what? To those people in the bay area who wanted that transportation infrastructure open, they wanted it open as soon as possible. So if we have to wait for 30 months to haul loads of sand and gravel and make concrete to get the 580 or the 680, or whatever it was, in the East Bay open, then perhaps there was an argument for that. I don’t know, unless something like that happens again. But for those minerals that are critical to our healthcare industry, our defense industry, and all of those sorts of things, they ought to have the opportunity to apply and see if they get told yes or no in 30 months. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. A MODEI ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Nevada will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 10 OFFERED BY MR . MCGOVERN  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in House Report 115–702. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle F of title V, add the following new section: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 908, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that I am offering along with my colleague from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ). I want to thank him for his leadership on this issue. Our amendment would very simply create a service medal to be awarded to atomic veterans or their surviving family members in honor of their service and sacrifice to our Nation. Between 1945 and 1962, about 225,000 members of our Armed Forces participated in hundreds of nuclear weapons tests. Now known as atomic veterans, these GIs were placed in extremely dangerous areas and were constantly exposed to potentially dangerous levels of radiation in performance of their duties. They were sworn to secrecy, unable to even talk to their doctors about their past exposure to radiation. Thankfully, Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush recognized the atomic veterans’ valiant service and acted to provide specialized care and compensation for their harrowing duty. In 2007, our allies Great Britain, New Zealand, and Australia, enacted their versions of this amendment by authorizing a medal to honor their atomic veterans who served with the United States. Regrettably, the Pentagon remains silent on honoring the service of our atomic veterans, arguing that to do so would diminish the service of other military personnel who are tasked with dangerous missions. Mr. Chairman, this is a pitiful excuse. Tragically, more than 75 percent of atomic veterans have already passed 
away, never having received this recognition. They served honorably and kept a code of silence that most certainly led to many of these veterans passing away prematurely. Past administrations and Congresses have dealt with thornier issues of legality and compensation. What remains is recognizing these veterans’ duty, honor, and faithful service to our Nation. I want to thank my colleagues in the House for unanimously voting favorably last year by a vote of 424–0. I was shocked when the Service Medal was not included in the conference report. So I am urging my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment again. Let us send a message to the Senate that this is important and that we are not going to give up. Together we can show them that we are serious about honoring this brave and distinguished group of patriotic Americans. We owe it to our atomic veterans to recognize them for their selfless service to our Nation. Mr. Chairman, let me close by saying, our veterans who are now known as atomic veterans served this country with great distinction. When they left the service they raised our families, they worked in our factories, and they contributed to our communities. They are getting older. Let us not wait until there are no surviving atomic veterans before we do the right thing. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring our atomic veterans. This is the right thing to do. It is shameful that we have not been able to do this sooner. I am confident that maybe this is the moment where we will do the right thing. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 13 OFFERED BY MR . MCKINLEY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in House Report 115–702. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the end of subtitle B of title VIII, add the following: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 908, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 5515. Let’s put this in historical context: In 1941, Congress passed the Berry amendment, which requires the Department of Defense to purchase certain items only from American companies. That list includes Americanmade products and already includes textiles, clothing, shoes, food, and certain tools. Our amendment would simply add dinnerware. America has some of the best and most talented producers of nontoxic, leadfree dinnerware in the globe. Companies like Coors in Tucson, Arizona; Emerson Creek in Bedford, Virginia; and Homer Laughlin in West Virginia. It makes common sense that when we purchase equipment for our military, whether it is weapons, food or supplies, it is incumbent upon us to consider American jobs as well. This amendment solidifies that belief. It shows our strong support for American manufacturing and already has been supported and endorsed by the Alliance for American Manufacturing. Importantly, it would ensure access to safe dinnerware for our military, free from lead or other carcinogenic materials. According to the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, there have been numerous violations involving lead and other contaminants in dinnerware coming from China, Mexico, and other suppliers around the world leading to concerns for their use by American troops. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to stand with American manufacturers, safety and health concerns, and the jobs that are created in our communities by supporting this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate and understand all Members’ desire to not only support jobs in their district, but to support American manufacturing. I share, of course, that goal. At the same time, I must oppose this amendment because there is simply no national security justification to mandate where DOD buys its plates and mugs. Now, there was a view in the past that textiles, food, and certain tools were essential for the health and well being of our military and related to their combat effectiveness. It is absolutely true that we have had troops die from exposure to tainted food, and that not having the appropriate tools has had an effect on the quality of our weaponry. b1515 I have never heard that argument apply when it comes to plates and bowls and knives or forks and spoons that we are about to discuss with the next amendment. Mr. Chairman, adding this mandate hurts our troops because if these suppliers of plates are the best price, then that is what DOD buys. But if it costs more to buy these plates, that money has to come from somewhere. And that money will come from bullets or fuel or other things that are essential for our troops to have. I cannot tell you how many fewer bullets the Pentagon will be able to buy because they have to pay more for their bowls and plates and mugs. I also can’t tell you how much more exactly the Pentagon will expend in ensuring compliance with this mandate, to do the studies to check the quality, to have a report if they should fall in one of the exceptions, which are all there within the law. But I know it will be some. Some money, some added bureaucracy is too much. As a matter of fact, the underlying bill is trying to go the other way and get more resources into the hands of our warfighters to increase what we send to the tooth and reduce the tail. I would just say one other point at this point, Mr. Chairman. Where does this stop? Where does this end? Last year, we had knives and forks and spoons. This year, we have got plates and mugs. Does it next go to the trays that they carry their food on? What about the plastic cups that they may drink from? Do we just keep rolling with this and go all the way to the hand soap and toilet paper in the bathroom? I don’t know where it stops. If there is not a national security justification to put this added cost and added mandate, we should not do it to our troops. Therefore, I must oppose the gentleman’s amendment and other amendments that are not related to national security. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the remarks of the chairman. As far as it relates to national security, our schools and our hospitals all across America consider it a serious enough situation on their chinaware because of the lead content and other carcinogenic materials that they have mandated for the health of our children across America that they must have leadfree chinaware. But, unfortunately, what is happening for our military is that we don’t 
have that requirement. By putting leadfree American products in, we would be able to have control. You say our troops can get sick from tainted food. They can get sick as well from the plates that they eat from if it migrates out of the material into their food when you put hot contents on it or cook it in a microwave. Those things can happen with that. If the schools and the hospitals think it is enough of a concern that they make this mandate, quite frankly, I think we ought to consider the same thing for our troops so that they are not made sick. As far as the price and the quality, if that language in the Berry amendment deals with satisfactory quality and fair price is the standard, all we are doing is adding that to it. So I don’t see that issue being valid on this, because if it is not good quality, even if it is Americanmade, you are going to be able at a very minimum to acquire it from someone else at the same time. Mr. Chairman, again, I urge my colleagues to stand with us on this issue of Americanmade products safe for our troops. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time simply to say: Mr. Chairman, before we add this additional burden on our troops and what we provide to them, there ought to be a scintilla of evidence that this is a problem with the military. Saying, well, somebody might get sick some day is not sufficient to say we are going to take more money away from your needs and put it into plates and mugs. We have got to have a sense of priority and a sense of evidence of where the real problems are. Mr. Chairman, therefore, I oppose the gentleman’s amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from West Virginia will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 19 OFFERED BY MS . TENNEY  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 19 printed in House Report 115–702. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 908, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Chairman, once again, I stand on the floor of this great body to urge my colleagues to support American manufacturing and American workers. The first shovel was struck into the ground in Rome, New York, to build the Erie Canal, which started the Industrial Revolution in America on July 4, 1817. We were booming. Paul Revere started his company there. Remington Arms was founded just down the road in Ilion, New York, which supplied our military with firearms. These two iconic companies remain, but many more have left. Throughout our Nation and the region that I represent, factories that once boomed with activity and production are now shuttered and empty. Meanwhile, an entire segment of the population has been pushed out of the workforce. President Trump described the America we know in central New York in his first inaugural speech: Our manufacturing plants are now ‘‘rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape.’’ In the 22nd District, the Rust Belt of New York, and in many other regions across this Nation, economic activity has been on a consistent downturn. Wellpaying manufacturing jobs have become increasingly hard to come by, leaving former industrial communities like ours empty as families and businesses flee in droves. In my home State of New York, we have lost 1 million residents since 2010 alone. Here in Washington and in State capitals across the country, special interests have been placed before the American worker. It is time to put our citizens and our workforce first. Mr. Chairman, the amendment that I have introduced will level the playing field for American companies, and it will show our American workforce that they have not been forgotten. And importantly, it will reduce our military’s dependence on foreign goods. For 30 years, the Berry amendment included a domestic sourcing for stainless steel flatware. However, in 2006, the provision was removed when Oneida Limited, once in our region, the sole Berrycompliant manufacturer in the U.S., closed its U.S.based factories and moved its operations to China, where almost all flatware is now manufactured. In a true American comeback story worthy of a Hollywood Cinderella story, two former Oneida Limited employees opened a new company, Sherrill Manufacturing. Greg Owens and Matt Roberts purchased Oneida’s closed factory and old equipment. They refurbished the old equipment and opened Sherrill Manufacturing. They hired many former Oneida Limited employees and now have a workforce of nearly 80. The product line Sherrill employees create is appropriately known as Liberty Tabletop. This former factory ‘‘tombstone’’ on our landscape is now a symbol of American ingenuity, craftsmanship, hard work, and freedom. The story of rebirth has given hope to my district. Sherrill Manufacturing has a strong and proven record of selling highquality products at market prices. Since 2008, Sherrill has been among the top providers of flatware to the Department of Defense and the General Services Administration, fulfilling more than $6.8 million in Federal contracts over the subsequent 8 years. While I understand that there may be some concerns that this domestic sourcing provision will increase costs, GSA has already found Sherrill’s flatware to be offered at ‘‘fair and reasonable’’ prices, which is a major reason why the agency already purchases flatware from Sherrill. Most importantly, my amendment retains all existing waivers under the Berry amendment, unlike some other Berry amendments. In the case of negative changes to price or quality, the Department of Defense can use other sources of flatware, including in other countries. Under this amendment, it doesn’t cost the Department of Defense anything to use Sherrill. Mr. Chairman, at this time, it is true that the only current Berrycompliant flatware manufacturer is located in my district. It is Sherrill. However, that does not mean that others who support domestic manufacturing cannot begin production and comply with this amendment. Opening a door for American manufacturers can encourage entrepreneurs across the country to start an operation of their own. My amendment encourages the American, free market principles of competition and ingenuity. Again, this amendment does not cost the Department of Defense. Passing this amendment will prove to American entrepreneurs and visionaries that Congress’ stated support for American jobs and American manufacturing is not merely just lip service. It shows Congress is committed to putting our Nation back on the path to prosperity. I would like to thank my colleagues who had cosponsored this bipartisan amendment: My fellow New Yorker, Representative JOHNKATKO , who has 15 
businesses in the neighboring New York district he represents that are a part of the Sherrill Manufacturing supply chain; Representatives POLIQUIN  and LIPINSKI , both great supporters of domestic sourcing and Buy America; Representative WALTER B. J ONES , a dedicated member of the House Armed Services Committee; and Representative TIMRYAN, an outspoken advocate for American manufacturing. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman from New York has expired. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ). Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Chairman, again, I want to emphasize that this amendment supports American manufacturing, helps a domestic supply chain that spans 40 congressional districts from New York to California, and decreases the Department of Defense’s dependence on foreign producers and goods. Removing the variability and uncertainty that comes with foreign sourcing of necessary materials for our military is the smart thing to do, considering almost all our goods of this type are now made in China. Mr. Chairman, today we have the opportunity to give American manufacturing the boost it deserves, while adding a measure of certainty to DOD procurement, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I again want to express my admiration for the gentlewoman from New York and her advocacy for workers and businesses in her district. But I must oppose the amendment. The fundamental question before the House is: Are we going to inflict higher costs on the Department of Defense with a mandate that requires where the Department buys its forks and spoons and knives and plates and mugs? That is the question. If any of these suppliers provide the best price, that is where DOD is going to go buy them. So these amendments, both the last one and this one, only become relevant if the costs are higher and we are making DOD buy the higherpriced items anyway. Now, as I mentioned, there may be some justification for that when there is a vital national security concern. But when it comes to forks and plates, I don’t think that exists. So the only way these amendments matter is if it forces DOD to pay more. And when it forces DOD to pay more for plates and bowls and forks and knives, then you are taking money away from bullets and fuel and guns and ships and the things that help keep America safe. Mr. Chairman, creating domestic jobs is not the primary mission of the Department of Defense. Our focus, the Department’s focus and our focus in this bill when it comes to this Congress, is to protect the Nation and to support the men and women who risk their lives for us. We have got to give them everything they need to do their job. We should not do anything that would divert from that. So I, again, with all admiration for the gentlewoman from New York and the gentleman from West Virginia, I just say, if we are going to tell DOD where they have to buy their forks and knives and plates, where does it end? I have a manufacturer, I am sure, in my district that would love to supply the Department of Defense with something or another. b1530 We cannot go down this road. We must let the Department buy the best value. That is what I think all Members should support. Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. TENNEY ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New York will be postponed. The Chair understands that amendment No. 22 will not be offered. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 31 printed in House Report 115–702. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 32 printed in House Report 115–702. 
AMENDMENT NO . 43 OFFERED BY MR . ENGEL  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 43 printed in House Report 115–702. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
At the appropriate place in title XII, insert the following new subtitle: Subtitle ll—Matters Relating to Burma 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 908, the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, let me say that, since August of 2017, the Burmese military has inflicted horrific violence against the Rohingya in Burma’s Rakhine State and is, today, using the same tactics against the Kachin. The result: 700,000 refugees. I didn’t get that wrong. It is 700,000 refugees pushed into Bangladesh. Eighty percent are women and children, many of whom are now victims of horrific genderbased violence. It is the sort of treatment ethnic minorities have endured there for decades. This a manmade crisis—ethnic cleansing, perhaps genocide—and to date there has been no accountability. This measure would change that. It would limit U.S. militarytomilitary assistance with the Burmese military until we see progress on human rights and accountability. It would authorize tough financial sanctions and visa bans against military and security forces involved in human rights abuses, promote transparency, and push reform in the Burmese gem sector, a target of corrupt military influence; and it requires the Secretary of State to determine what, in addition to ethnic cleansing, might have occurred. This body has long stood on the side of freedom, democracy, and human rights in Burma. I urge all Members to join me today in doing the same thing by supporting this measure. Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support this, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 50 OFFERED BY MR . POLIS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 50 printed in House Report 115–702. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of subtitle A of title XXXI, add the following new section: 
Notwithstanding the amounts set forth in the funding tables in division D, the amount authorized to be appropriated by section 3101 for the National Nuclear Security Administration, as specified in the corresponding funding table in section 4701, for weapons activities is hereby reduced by $198,000,000. The amount of such reduction shall not be available for any purpose other than deficit reduction. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 908, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, my amendment, which I am proud to sponsor with Representative BLUMENAUER , makes a small, sensible reduction to unnecessary nuclear weapons spending. The National Defense Authorization that we have before us this week authorizes hundreds of millions of dollars for our nuclear weapons program, even $65 million to reduce an additional low yield warhead. While the threats that we face around the world are different than what they were a few years ago, we cannot afford to sacrifice the fiscal security of our Nation in the name of national security. Spending more than we have and more than we need to on the military makes us less secure, rather than more secure, by mortgaging our future and that of future generations to those foreign nations which hold our debt. My amendment would simply make a small start by reducing the funding for the National Security Administration’s weapons account by $198 million, the exact amount that the agency itself says that it doesn’t need. Let me be clear: This amendment will maintain all of our nuclear capabilities and research; but for a body that should be making the hard choices to get our budget under control, why should we be giving the National Security Administration more money than they want, need, or are asking for? We need to start getting our budget under control. This is a small step. I offered other amendments that were blocked. This one is allowed. I hope that my Republican and Democratic colleagues can come together to show that we are serious about cutting unnecessary spending and reducing our deficit. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I strongly oppose this amendment. This amendment is not about stewardship of taxpayers’ dollars, good government, or setting priorities. Instead, this amendment is part of a broader, antinuclear agenda that we see year in and year out. Let’s be clear about what this amendment does. It cuts $145 million in desperately needed funding for recapitalizing nuclear weapons production buildings dating back to the 1940s and the 1950s. Here is a quote from General Klotz, President Obama’s NNSA Administrator, before my subcommittee a few years ago: Our infrastructure is extensive, complex, and, in many critical areas, several decades old. More than half of the NNSA’s approximately 6,000 real property assets are over 40 years old, and nearly 30 percent date back to the Manhattan Project era. Many of the enterprise’s critical utility, safety, and support systems are failing at an increasing and unpredictable rate, which poses both programmatic and safety risk. 
That was in 2016. Folks, let me assure you, this problem has not gotten any better since then. I know that it has only gotten worse because I have visited all NNSA sites and have seen these deplorable conditions firsthand. We are asking the Nation’s highly skilled scientists, engineers, and technicians to design and build our nuclear weapons in buildings that are literally falling down around them. We have had large chunks of concrete fall from ceilings into operating workspaces. We have even had tape and plastic sheathing around 40yearold pots carrying radioactive liquids. I have personally seen tarps hung over sensitive diagnostic equipment to prevent leaking roofs from destroying equipment worth tens of millions of dollars. NNSA has a $3.7 billion backlog in deferred maintenance and repair needs. The funding that this amendment would strip away is sorely needed to help dig out of this hole. It is unfortunate that the gentleman does not at least recognize that this amendment would do harm to the safety of our workers. I urge my colleagues to recognize this amendment for what it is and reject this broader agenda to undercut the U.S. nuclear deterrent. Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Our nuclear arsenal is capable of ending human life on the planet five to seven times. I don’t understand the need for redundancy when it comes to the extinction of humanity. Once should be more than enough to kill every man, woman, and child on the face of the planet. My amendment doesn’t address all of that, but it does make a cut of $198 million in unnecessary spending for nuclear weapons. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DESJARLAIS ), my friend and colleague and a member of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. 
Mr. D ESJARLAIS. Mr. Chair, I join the gentleman in expressing my opposition to this amendment. The NNSA’s mission is, arguably, one of the most critical national security roles across the U.S. Government. As my colleague from Alabama pointed out, after years of insufficient funding, our Nuclear Security Enterprise is now facing a myriad of infrastructure problems and potential failures. To quote Los Alamos lab director Dr. Charlie McMillan: ‘‘One of the things that keeps me up at night is the realization that essential capabilities are held at risk by the possibility of such failures.’’ The amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado would only exacerbate these problems. Most of the cuts made by this amendment would come from highpriority deferred maintenance and infrastructure repairs. With a $3.7 billion infrastructure and maintenance backlog, these cuts are unacceptable and pose a serious threat not only to the NNSA mission, but to the occupational wellbeing of its employees as well. Under the leadership of Chairman THORNBERRY and Chairman R OGERS , the committee has worked hard over the past 2 years to mitigate these infrastructure issues and prevent the occurrence of a singlepoint failure within the Nuclear Security Enterprise. It is critical that we continue to push forward with these efforts and resolve these outstanding issues. As such, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ), the full committee chairman, for any comments he may have. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, the men and women of NNSA are like the military: they are going to get the job done under whatever conditions are required. But this amendment affects their work environment, their health and safety, and whether we can attract and retain topquality people. It is the people who would suffer under this; it is not the mission. I understand people are antinuclear, but it is the people who would suffer. As both gentlemen have said, we have a tremendous backlog. This just helps us catch up a little bit. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado will be postponed. AMENDMENT NO . 55 OFFERED BY MR . GALLAGHER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 55 printed in House Report 115–702. Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 908, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, as a free and open society, the United States has always drawn in those from around the world seeking to study here, to live here, individuals seeking to observe and participate in our way of life. Indeed, we benefit from these visitors when they take on our values and go home with them. However, when an individual comes to study and work in the United States, we must take care both that they are here for their stated purpose and that they are allowed to fulfill their legitimate goal without disruption. As one FBI study has found, foreign intelligence services have been taking advantage of higher education institutions and personnel for many years. This problem is particularly acute with China. That is why administrations on both sides of the aisle have considered measures to protect academic research from foreign exploitation. In recent years, we have seen a number of cases damaging the national security: In 2008, a Tennessee professor was convicted of exporting defense articles without a license after using Chinese students to conduct Air Force research that they exported to China; In 2009, a researcher at Duke University sent data back to China, which led to the creation of a multibilliondollar Chinese company; And in 2015, Chinese professors were among six defendants charged by the Department of Justice with theft of trade secrets on behalf of Chinese companies and academic institutions. As the United States addresses China’s increasingly aggressive rise, it is critical that we consider how to effectively address these issues as a free society. That is why my amendment requires that a wholeofgovernment strategy on China mandated by the NDAA incorporate two key elements: exploitation of visa programs to enter the United States by the Chinese Communist Party and the party’s intimidation and coercion of Chinese nationals in the United States. This is not a blanket ban or requirement of any sort to limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.; rather, it is merely adding an important element to the existing strategy required under the NDAA to address a wholeofgovernment challenge comprehensively. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1545 Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition, and I want to commend my friend from Wisconsin for correctly identifying one of the strategic challenges that China poses, but I am concerned this effort to amend section 1252 will make flawed language even worse. The bill currently requires the President to provide a report to Congress that outlines a strategy to respond to competitive and, at times, malicious actions by China. In fact, my friend from Wisconsin has outlined several instances where we have been successful in ferreting out these actions all without his amendment being law. So let me be clear, though, on the strategy. The strategy cannot and should not always be only responding to China. The U.S. needs to develop a proactive, assertive agenda to contrast with and to compete with China. Rather than setting up actions that could restrict student visa programs or suggesting that Chinese visitors are in the U.S. to do the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party, Congress should be taking a proactive approach consistent with our national security interests and, importantly, our values. Now, I don’t want to dwell too much on what is called the Confucius Institute in that issue, except to say that part of our response to something like the Confucius Institute ought to be U.S. programs to support Chinese language and culture programs for students in this country, instead of outsourcing it. There is an example where we can go on offense, instead of always responding or reacting to actions by China. Schools that wish to have Chinese language instruction should not have to rely on China for funding, as an example. So I am deeply concerned the language in the underlying bill takes a reflexive and a narrowminded view of the real challenge posed by China. Closing off our country is the wrong approach. 
To use a football metaphor, closing off our Nation to foreign investment and to students is thinking like a defensive coordinator and not a particularly creative one. Instead, we need to think like a head coach, developing new offensive and defensive strategies, a new playbook revamping the old one. So let me clarify. Going on offense is not just a reaction to China. It represents a strategy to keep the U.S. engaged in the global community. We should focus on multiple aspects of public policy: education, foreign trade, investment, immigration, military capabilities, innovation, and, of course, our bilateral relationship with China. A smarter strategic plan would demonstrate to the world and to the Chinese people the superiority of the U.S. model: democracy, free and open elections, diversity, open markets, and a free press. We should be exposing Chinese students to these values, making sure they understand that they have a different choice. This is what Congress should be working on, not adding new provisions to an already flawed report. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Gallagher amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ). Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for bringing this important issue into the forefront. We need to face the reality that China is actively pursuing a wholeof nation approach to gain global influence. This includes targeting U.S. universities by exploiting our student visa program in order to gain access and steal sensitive, proprietary, and classified information. According to DOD, in 2014, almost a quarter of foreign efforts to steal sensitive information happened through academic institutions. What is even more alarming is that, under Chinese law, citizens are required to provide data, information, and technological support or assistance to the Chinese Government upon request. This means that China can intimidate and coerce its citizens to provide information. The amendment offered today will ensure that this form of espionage is thoroughly considered as we develop our wholeofgovernment China strategy. I do support what the gentleman said that we need to go on the offensive as well, but that doesn’t mean we give up the defense, and we need to be smart in that strategy as well. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chair, may I ask how much time both parties have left. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington has 2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. JUDYCHU). Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to Mr. GALLAGHER ’s amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. This harmful amendment would add language to the NDAA that specifically targets Chinese foreign nationals who receive U.S. employment or student visas for extra scrutiny by our Federal Government. If this amendment were to confine itself to the serious issue of safeguarding American interests against foreign political influence, industrial acquisitions, and regional global capabilities, it might be supportable. But this amendment specifically targets an ethnic population in this country by singling out the Chinese who participate in student visa programs and who are receiving employment visas. While there is no doubt that we must take national security threats from foreign countries seriously, including Russia, this amendment assumes that there is widespread abuse of our visa program from China alone and attempts to paint all Chinese students, scholars, and employees, en masse, as potential spies for China. This underlying bill already includes elements to address interstate strategic competition and does so without creating a precedent for singling out individuals because of their country of origin. We have seen how our government’s policies and actions towards foreign nationals have the ability to impact Americans of certain ethnic backgrounds. We need to look no further than the examples of Sherry Chen and Dr. Xioaxing Xi, two ChineseAmerican scientists who were wrongfully accused of being spies for China, only to have their charges dropped with no explanation. In fact, just this month, Sherry Chen was exonerated by a judge who said that her case was a case of gross miscarriage of justice. It is reckless to categorize an entire country of people as a threat to our national security, and I reject these overly broad and dangerous attempts to build a case that all Chinese students and employees should be viewed with more suspicion in this country than others. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON ). Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman MIKE GALLAGHER for his military service and now service in Congress. I am grateful to speak in support of Congressman MIKE GALLAGHER ’s amendment that would require the executive branch to create a strategy to address the abuse of visa programs used to enter the United States to conduct political activity and establish groups in support of the Chinese Communist Party. Organizations like the Confucius Institute and the Thousand Talents program are clear examples as to why Congressman GALLAGHER makes perfect sense, and it is critical to our national security. Confucius Institutes are currently active in 103 college campuses, despite Li Changchun, a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo Standing Committee, calling the institutes ‘‘an important part of China’s overseas propaganda setup.’’ Additionally, FBI Director Christopher Wray described the Confucius Institutes operating in the United States as exploiting the very open research and development environment we have, which we all revere, but they are taking advantage of it. Unfortunately, my amendment, cosponsored by Congressman GALLAGHER  and Congresswoman VICKY HARTZLER , dealing with organizations like the Confucius Institutes was not ruled in order. It is critical that the wholeof government China strategy include vulnerabilities within our academic community, and for this reason, I urge everyone to support Congressman GALLAGHER ’s amendment. Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Chairman, with the few seconds that I have left, I would just say, to extend the football metaphor, perhaps to the point of absurdity, our defense doesn’t even get on the field. We keep drawing pick six after pick six; therefore, allowing intellectual property theft, which is the greatest transfer of wealth in human history, by the Chinese, which is what the BlairHuntsman Commission laid out. So I look forward to working with my colleague on a more comprehensive approach, but in the meantime, I hope he will work with me on this. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GALLA GHER ). The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 908, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ). Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee as well as the House Judiciary Committee for working with me and the Armed Services Committee to include an important amendment in this bill that will expand DOD’s ability to interdict drones that pose a threat to certain military installations. My amendment adds mobility airlift to the list of mission sets permitted to use counterdrone technology. If a drone were to attack the mobility mission, it could mean a reduction in our ability to provide logistic support globally to joint and coalition warfighters. Additionally, a drone attack on our mobility forces could prevent our capacity to conduct global operations by severely limiting our ability to conduct aerial refueling. This is a commonsense proposal necessary to protect a critical aspect of our national defense. I am delighted it is included in an en bloc package, and I want to thank Representatives GARAMENDI , H ANABUSA , ROSEN , and A USTIN SCOTT for cosponsoring this bipartisan amendment. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. WILSON). Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of amendment No. 73, requiring a report to relevant committees on the missions, operations, and activities of the Department of Defense in Niger and the broader region. I believe that key components of the amendment are necessary to obtain critical, tactical, operational, and strategic improvements in U.S. Africa Command’s efforts to achieve stability and security in the region, and most importantly, keep our troops safer. As evidenced by the tragic deaths of the four soldiers who were ambushed by ISIS near Tongo Tongo, Niger, last October, improvements throughout the chain of command and military services are necessary, and DOD must provide greater transparency and communication with Congress regarding legal, operational, and funding authorities for military operations in Africa. The amendment requires DOD to specify its objectives in Niger and justify their relevance to U.S. national security. For the safety of our troops, the amendment also requires DOD to identify measures to mitigate operational risk and increase the preparedness of members of the Armed Forces in Niger and the broader region. It will also mandate that DOD assess the command and support relationships of U.S. Africa Command with subordinate commands like Special Operations Command. This will help to ensure improved command and control throughout the chain of command, that the commander’s intent is clear, and that operational guidance is consistent and concise. Indeed, the tragic deaths of the four soldiers killed in action affected me personally in an overwhelming way. One of the four soldiers killed was a dear constituent of mine, Sergeant La David Johnson of Miami Gardens. Sergeant Johnson, who was killed while bravely defending our country, was 25 years of age. He left behind a lovely extended family, a beautiful wife, and three young children. He was a member of the 5000 Role Models of Excellence, and 50 members are visiting us here today. Mr. Chair, I am hopeful that with actions currently being taken by the DOD, along with the prescriptive elements of this amendment, our Nation will not have to suffer another tragic loss like we did last October. b1700 Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE ) for the purpose of a colloquy. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman for this opportunity to discuss a matter of great interest and importance to the TriCities community in my district. In the 1940s and 1950s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers acquired land along the shoreline of the Columbia River in TriCities, Washington. The land, 34 miles of the McNary shoreline, is currently underutilized. The local communities continue to be saddled with hundreds of thousands of dollars of M&O costs annually for upkeep of land of these shoreline properties that they don’t even own. I support the community proposal to convey the land back to the cities. I have been working with the chairman on proposed amendment language to do so but respect the fact the chairman has let me know there is still some work to be done. I continue to encourage further community engagement and believe public meetings are necessary to ensure all voices are heard, including that of the local Tribes. It is also a requirement that the city governments fully understand the responsibilities and potential costs that could arise from having this land conveyed. There must be further coordination between conveyance proponents, community stakeholders, city governments, and the Army Corps. Mr. Chairman, you have raised concerns about the language in its current form and have urged further efforts. I am committed to continuing to work with the local communities to address these concerns. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I respectfully ask: Will you commit to continuing to work with me as the NDAA process moves forward to try to address concerns with the proposal while the communities continue to assess their needs? Mr. THORNBERRY. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. NEWHOUSE. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for raising this issue. As the gentleman and I have discussed, there are significant hurdles to legislating land transfers of the Department of Defense. Among the issues that must be addressed are: What and where is the property in question? Who is the intended recipient? Are there multiple parties who are also interested in acquiring this property? Are there ongoing legal proceedings related to the property? Are there cleanup costs and liabilities associated with the property? Have the interested parties met with the Department of Defense, and if so, with whom? Does the Department support conveying the property, and do they have a continuing need for it? If supported, why can’t the Department dispose of the property through its surplus/excess process? What are the proposed reuses of the property? Are there any earmark issues—no cost conveyances to private entities or for economic development can be subject to points of order. Has CBO been consulted for any mandatory scoring implications? And, if outside committees have equities, have they been consulted for approval or concerns? I will be happy to continue working with the gentleman moving forward, but I would ask that he and any other Member looking at land transfers take these factors into account and give all relevant committees plenty of time and opportunity to vet their proposal. Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the chairman for that colloquy. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. BLUNT  ROCHESTER ). Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Chairman, first let me thank Chairman THORNBERRY and Ranking Member SMITH for the time. I also want to thank both of them for including my amendment in the en bloc 2 amendment package. My amendment expresses this body’s strong support of the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. The Dover Air Force Base is a pillar of our community in the First State and a pillar of the Air Force community at large. The Dover Air Force Base is home to the 436th and the 512th Air Lift Wings, representing over 4,000 ActiveDuty military and civilians. The 436th was recently recognized with the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. The award served as recognition of the exemplary 
work of the entire unit led by Colonel Ethan Griffin who will, unfortunately, soon be leaving Dover. Along with supporting the missions of the two Air Lift Wings, Dover is also home to the Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs and carries out the solemn obligation of caring for our fallen heroes. Mr. Chair, it is right and fitting that the United States Congress recognize and acknowledge the incredibly important work of the Dover Air Force Base, and I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc amendment package. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LANCE ). Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the en bloc amendments and in support of the underlying bill. Passing this defense bill is one of the most important constitutional responsibilities of Congress. I commend Chairman THORNBERRY for his leadership, and I thank him for his support of my amendments. I was pleased to join with my bipartisan colleagues, Congressman MICHAEL BURGESS and Congresswoman BARBARA LEE, in offering an amendment auditing the Pentagon fully. This has been promised for many years, and I am pleased that it is in this bill. I thank Chairman THORNBERRY for including my bipartisan amendment that would officially create the first ever Department of Defense commendation for military working dogs and their handlers. Nine military working dog handlers from the home State I represent, New Jersey, have been killed in action, and one of my constituents from Short Hills, New Jersey, was among these. Mr. Chairman, I think we should be voting on the en bloc amendments favorably and also voting favorably for the underlying bill. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. CARBAJAL ), who is a member of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman THORN BERRY and Ranking Member S MITH for their bipartisan leadership, and the Armed Services Committee and the Rules Committee for bringing my amendment to the floor. My amendment is simple. It not only urges the Department of Defense to pursue more innovative measures to train servicemembers, but also to train them in a more costeffective manner. This amendment urges DOD to transition training manuals, emergency guidance, and other training publications to applications on mobile telephones to enable interaction and improve and update the training experience for servicemembers. It provides a costefficient mechanism for less printing and less distribution costs while making the materials more readily accessible. The Air Force has already started utilizing such applications, and my amendment would urge the Secretary to utilize such technology throughout all the services. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK ), who is the chair of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express support for my amendment to create an independent national security commission on artificial intelligence. Mr. Chairman, this bill that I have introduced will direct a comprehensive and nationallevel review of advances in AI and machine learning and ensure these align with our national security needs. It will provide actionable recommendations to the President and the Congress to more effectively organize the Federal Government when it comes to AI. Artificial intelligence is a constantly developing technology that will touch every aspect of our lives. The investments we make and policies we establish will provide the foundation of our national security and technological military advantage, but every day we run the risk of that edge being eroded. In order to preserve this, we must increase our research in public, private, and academic institutions, build and educate a talented workforce, embrace the technological advances that AI will provide, and lead the international community in establishing the laws and norms associated with implementing AI. This amendment makes advances in all of these areas. Mr. Chairman, I thank my ranking member, JIMLANGEVIN of Rhode Island, for cosponsoring this amendment. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. CA´RDENAS ). Mr. CA´RDENAS. Mr. Chairman, first I would like to thank Chairman MAC THORNBERRY and also Ranking Member ADAM SMITH for their fine work on this and allowing me to bring my amendment to the floor. My mindfulness amendment would create a pilot program to train members of the Armed Forces in mindfulness stress reduction techniques before deploying to combat zones. According to the VA, mindfulness practice has the potential to benefit individuals with PTSD. Using mindfulness to strengthen reaction to stress together with existing empirically supported PTSD treatments may allow patients to persevere through trauma processing. Rather than waiting to apply these treatments after the traumatic event, why not prepare our brave young men and women who are being sent into combat zones ahead of time? A prior study with the Marines suggested mindfulness training was beneficial for attention, working memory, as well as mood. My amendment would expand this training to all branches of the Armed Forces, including the Coast Guard. It would require a report on the success of this training with stress management and preventing PTSD. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers on this en bloc package, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ENGEL ), who is the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of an amendment I joined with Ranking Member SMITH to offer on Niger. Last October, four American servicemembers were killed in an ambush in Niger. We still don’t fully understand what happened. For some reason, the zeal for oversight seems to have dried up in the last 16 months. Here is what we do know: American personnel were in Niger for an advise andaccompany mission, but sometime after these four heroes lost their lives, the administration said: Well, no, they actually fought under the 2001 war authorization. That is the post9/11 AUMF. So four Americans are dead, and it turns out they have been fighting the war on terror one country after another. There are seemingly no limits, and we have a responsibility to do better. This is a scandal screaming out for congressional oversight—not just in this case, but in so many of the far flung places where our military is engaged overseas. We need to stay focused on fighting terrorist organizations. But the law says Congress decides when and where we fight wars, and the administration appears to be losing track of what authorities it has and where it is using them. Mr. Chairman, I am glad to join Ranking Member SMITH in offering this amendment that hopefully will shed light on our mission in the region. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER ). Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague, Mr. SMITH, for yielding. I rise today in support of my amendment to formally codify the Boots to Business program, and I want to thank my friend from Iowa, Congressman ROD BLUM, for his work on this amendment and on our bill, the Veterans Entrepreneurship Training Act. As transitioning servicemembers enter civilian life, they bring adaptability and experience to excel as entrepreneurs. However, they often lack businessspecific skills or experience that can help bring their ideas to reality. 
The Boots to Business program seeks to fill these gaps and helps prepare transitioning servicemembers, their spouses, and also veterans for challenges starting their own small business. Participants take a 2day, inperson course on business ownership, followed by an indepth, 8week online course that teaches them daytoday skills they will need to run a successful small business, such as the fundamentals in developing a business plan and how to acquire financing. I am grateful my amendment is included in the NDAA, and I am hopeful we can continue to expand Boots to Business so that more servicemembers and veterans can start and grow their own small business. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, we have no further speakers. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I also yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD the following editorial from my local paper, The Ledger, in reference to my amendment to H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, to provide taxpayers with greater transparency into ‘‘official time.’’ 
REPORT ALL ‘OFFICIAL ’ TIME (The Editorial Board) Think unions and the stereotype that comes to mind is one of burly, thicknecked guys clad in hard hats, scuffed work boots and plenty of denim. Perhaps that image was fit in 1955, when the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations merged to form the AFLCIO, America’s largest organized labor group. At the time an estimated 35 percent of U.S. workers belonged to a union, and most often such workers drove trucks, assembled cars, built and wired buildings, or engaged in similar handsdirtying work. Today, only 11 percent of workers are unionized, and frequently they wear a uniform (such as police or firefighter), or work in an office or public school classroom. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 34 percent of union workers toil for local, state, or federal government agencies—or roughly five times the number of those who drive trucks, assemble cars, build and wire buildings, or engage in similar handsdirtying work. Inevitably, these workers must tend to union business at the expense of their official duties in service to the public. U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross is particularly concerned about how such juggling among federal civil servants taxpayers, and seeks to enlighten the public, and perhaps the rest of the U.S. government, about how taxpayers’ dimes are consumed by union time. Ross is eyeing a federal law that says managers must allot staffers time—known in government jargon as ‘‘official time’’—to perform union activities, insofar as it remains ‘‘consistent with the requirements of an effective and efficient government.’’ The federal Office of Personnel Management reported last month that most union workers who tap official time spend it lobbying Congress about legislation that affects federal union employees (for instance, bills relate to federal pay and benefits); representing union employees who face discipline or who filed grievances; and participating in labormanagement ‘‘workgroups.’’ Certain federal employees, under law, are paid to spend 100 percent of their time on union functions. Or some union reps establish ‘‘banks’’ of paid time that they draw down in working just for the union. The OPM report found that between 2010 and 2016, the most recent year available, the hours spent on official time jumped nearly 17 percent, from 3.1 million hours to 3.61 million. In some cases, official time was negligible. The Federal Election Commission, for example, reported just six hours of official time in 2016. In other cases, it was considerable. The Defense Department recorded almost 387,000 hours of official time that year. The size, scope and mission of a particular agency will drive much of that. Still, in the aggregate, this is no small expense. The OPM notes that in 2016 official time cost taxpayers almost $175 million, up roughly 8 percent from 2014, the last time the survey was done. And the report doesn’t catch everything. The OPM said its report was limited to payroll costs because it lacks ‘‘comprehensive data source’’ that would allow for ‘‘a complete accounting of the costs of union activities.’’ Thus, its analysis does not include taxpayers’ costs for facilities, equipment and travel related to collective bargaining. The OPM knew, for example, that the Social Security Administration in 2016 spent $2.1 million on union reps’ travel, office space, telephones and supplies only because the agency was required to report that to its congressional oversight committee. Congressman Ross seeks to fix that. In May 2017, the Lakeland Republican, noting inconsistencies and lags in datagathering on these costs, filed a bill that would require all federal agencies to provide Congress detailed annual reports of official time expenses. ‘‘With greater transparency, employees will be less likely to abuse the system, which will result in less waste of taxpayer dollars,’’ Ross said at the time ‘‘It is far past time we require agencies to provide this information to Congress and the public. Taxpayers deserve clear, reliable data on how many employees are performing union work on official time in lieu of their regularly assigned government duties.’’ He’s right. His bill passed the House, but unfortunately stalled in the Senate. Ross’ office told us Monday he will seek to have the measure added to the National Defense Authorization Act, the mustpass defense spending bill that the House will take up later this week. Ross will soon retire, but we encourage him to pursue this bill until he leaves. Moreover, we urge the rest of Congress to heed his point. Congress owes taxpayers a full accounting of time spent by staffers promoting the personal career interests of the nearly 1 million unionized federal workers, and how that squares with the commitment, under law, of providing ‘‘effective and efficient’’ government.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 908, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have no speakers on this set of amendments en bloc. Mr. Chairman, I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time. b1715 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I, too, have no speakers on this amendment. I urge adoption of the en bloc amendments, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORN BERRY ). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. LAMALFA ) having assumed the chair, Mr. MARSHALL , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5515) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2019 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. 
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H. RES. 774 Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove my name as a cosponsor of H. Res. 774. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MARSHALL ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. 
PATIENTS’ RIGHT TO TRY EXPERIMENTAL DRUGS (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the passage of the Right to Try Act—better late than never. After months of jumping through parliamentary hoops to pass this legislation out of both the House and the Senate, we are finally able to put the Right to Try Act on the President’s desk. This bill would allow very sick or terminally ill patients to request access to drugs and treatments that have yet to be approved by the FDA. This is a bipartisan issue. So far, 40 States have already adopted Right to Try laws but are unable to actually enforce them. This bill changes that. While giving terminally ill patients the right to try experimental medicine won’t always be successful, it does give patients one final avenue of hope. For those who have exhausted all other possibilities of conventional treatment, they deserve the opportunity to leave no stone unturned. Also, the industry can learn from their experience. I am disappointed that some in the Senate chose to delay this very time sensitive bill, but I am pleased the President now can make Right to Try the law of the land. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JOSE FRANCISCO PENA GOMEZ (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and commemorate Dr. Jose Francisco Pena Gomez on the 20th anniversary of his passing. From his lifetime of service, Dr. Pena Gomez will, without question, be recorded in history as a civil rights icon to the marginalized AfroLatino community and advocate for the poor. Dr. Pena Gomez personified his motto, ‘‘Primero la gente,’’ or ‘‘The People First,’’ serving as Mayor of Santo Domingo, vice president of the International Socialist Party for the Western Hemisphere, president of the Dominican Revolutionary Party, and twice nominated for the Presidency of the Dominican Republic. Dr. Pena Gomez was a fierce proponent of free speech and denounced unfair election practices in the Dominican Republic and around the world. He was fervent in his condemnation of civil and human rights violations in Latin America. The largest airport in Santo Domingo bears his name and welcomes people from all over the world. It is my pleasure and great honor to celebrate the life of Dr. Pena Gomez with his family and those who fondly remember his model and standard. Primero la gente. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind all persons in the gallery that they are here as guests of the House and that any manifestation of approval or disapproval of proceedings is in violation of the rules of the House. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF CAMERON ROBINSON (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to remember the life of Cameron Robinson. He attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1. Cameron found his perfect balance in his boyfriend, Bobby Eardley. They loved each other immensely, and Cameron loved Bobby’s children as if they were his own. Bobby describes Cameron as a man who never did anything halfway. Whether it was cooking fancy meals or working in the Las Vegas City Attorney’s Office, he put his all in everything he did. Cameron loved people without judgment and without condition. He is a man who is remembered as being full of spontaneous fun. I would like to extend my condolences to Cameron Robinson’s family and friends. Please note that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you. 
ECONOMIC INEQUALITY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. KHANNA ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the Janus v. AFSCME Council 31 Supreme Court case and economic inequality. The issue of our time is economic inequality and the challenge of the middle class being left behind. We know that 81 percent of American households between 2005 and 2015 have not had a raise. They have actually either had their wages stagnate or decline. This is an issue that goes to the core principles of our Nation. As every American knows, in 1968, Dr. King marched with sanitation workers in Memphis, with AFSCME local 1733. The march was not just about racial justice. The march was about economic justice. The march was about the freedom of sanitation workers to earn what Dr. King called a decent living. It was about the dignity of work. It was about the right to join a union. They fought against socalled right towork legislation. They fought for collective bargaining so that people who work hard, who rode on trucks and picked up the trash and did hard labor, earn a decent wage. Dr. King talked about the importance of economic justice, much as he talked about the importance of racial justice. 
Here are the facts that we know. Unionized African American women earn about $21.90 an hour. That is not a bad wage. Nonunion African American women earned almost $4 less, on average. That means $4 per hour is the difference between unionized and nonunionized work for African American women. Seventytwo percent of African American women in unions have health insurance. Guess what? Less than 50 percent of nonunion African American women have health insurance. Some of us have read the horrific studies about how pregnant African American women still face huge issues with infant mortality and problems with child labor. Part of it is because they lack health insurance. If they have health insurance through a union, that is not as much of an issue. Latinos who join a union see their median weekly income increase by almost 38 percent. They are 41 percent more likely to have employerprovided health insurance. Caucasian working class families have seen a raise of nearly 20 percent when they are in union jobs compared to nonunion jobs. Unions are more important now than ever, because the question is: When 81 percent of this country hasn’t had a raise for the past 15 years, do we need to have more policies favoring corporations and executives or do we need to figure out how we give Americans a raise? The one institution that gives Americans a raise is unions. We didn’t invent this. We know collective bargaining works in other nations. We know that cooks in Germany make almost $25 an hour. The Danish Ambassador was visiting me today, and I said: How much would someone make if they worked at Starbucks in Denmark? He said: Almost $20 to $22 an hour. My jaw dropped. I said: How is that possible? Is it government prescribed? He said: No, it is strong union movements across other countries. It is not that they discourage entrepreneurship or innovation. It is that they believe that working families should have the dignity to earn an honest living; that they can afford rent, that they can afford food, that they can afford healthcare, that they can afford a job. This is what FDR talked about with the right of a job and healthcare and housing; that the positive rights were necessary to truly have freedom in democracy. Collective action raises the standard of living for everyone. Guess what? Henry Ford knew it. It led to economic growth. That is why he paid workers more. He said: Someone has got to earn a living to buy the cars. If we don’t have a middle class that can earn, then who is going to buy the iPhones, who is going to buy the new cars and the Teslas? Who is going to buy and have the money to set up new bank accounts? Our economic growth is dependent on the middle class. That is what America has gotten and China has never understood. China doesn’t care about their middle class. They care about the elites. We have believed in the middle class from FDR to Dwight Eisenhower. We believed that every person in this country is extraordinary; that our success is based on ordinary Americans earning enough to buy things; that every American matters, not just in our democracy but to our economy. It is what makes us different from the Chinese model, and it is why unions matter so much. Unions are what allow ordinary Americans to get the wages they deserve. Union workers are more likely to have healthcare and retirement benefits. We know that the decline of the middle class is directly correlated to a decline in union membership. b1730 Let me give you this staggering statistic: It used to be, in our GDP, that 90 percent of GDP went to income, of our GDP. That statistic has fallen to the high 50s or low 60s. Most of the loss now goes to capital, to automation, to machinery. Here is the irony: Corporations, you would think they would invest in human capital. You would think they would invest more in the workforce. But their incentives are not to do that. The Tax Code incentivizes research and development, if they want to open up plants or have automation; but they don’t incentivize the investment in actual human capital so that workers and human beings get more of the GDP and not less. This decline from 90 percent to 60 percent of income is correlated partly with automation but also with the decline of union membership. Guess what: The unions are one of the only institutions in this country that are investing in worker training, that are investing in improving people’s human capital. I know so many apprenticeship programs in my own district you can go in with just a high school degree, no test, no fees required, and become an apprentice to become an electrician, to become a drywaller, a glazer, a painter. These are tough jobs. They are not easy jobs. Once you do the apprenticeship, it doesn’t cost you anything. It comes out of the fees of journeymen and other union members. You go and develop the skills, and the unions invest in you. When you talk to these apprentices, they are so proud of the work they are doing, proud of the investment that the unions are making in them, and they are extraordinary people with an extraordinary work ethic. That is the investment that the unions are making in our workforce. Don’t think that it is just about them making sure people get the wages they deserve. They are making sure that we have the workers that we need in this country to be productive. They are the ones who are investing in the human capital in our society and the ones who are looking at the investments needed for the future. Union apprenticeships are what closed the skills gap. They are the ones who are teaching folks about 3D printing. They are the ones who are teaching folks the tech skills that are needed as auto repair mechanics. They are the ones who are teaching folks the basic ways that you now need to operate machines and robots. Highquality training in our unions is why American workers are the most productive in the world: 6 times more productive than China, 6 times more productive than India, 1
1⁄2times more productive than Japan. That is partly because of our union efforts and training and because of the grit of the American people. Now, here is what this Janus case is about. The Janus case is about corporate special interests saying unions should no longer have a role in collective bargaining, that the work unions do to represent workers is no longer important, that every person can go fend for themselves. Really? We tried that before the New Deal, during the Lochner era, where every person had to go fend for themselves. It was the time that F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote about in ‘‘The Great Gatsby,’’ the Gilded Age, the largest economic disparities known in American society. It led to the greatest stock market crash. It led to the Great Depression. It led to huge economic instability in the United States and around the world. And then we said: This system doesn’t work. FDR and Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower said: Let’s build an American middle class with unions, to which ordinary Americans can go to get a higher education, to get a wage where they can afford a house and they can afford food and they can afford to have a decent quality of life. Unions are what provided that. Collective bargaining is what allowed for that. It balanced the corporate interests. It said: people who do work should be rewarded. That is what unions have done. I know there are all these complex phrases: fee sharing, righttowork, and all of that. But cut through all the noise, and here is the basic question: Do you think collective bargaining has a role in American society? If you think it does, if you think people should have the right to organize and bargain and that there should be some counterweight to corporate power, then you should be for AFSCME and the union in this Supreme Court case. If you think workers are doing fine, working families are doing fine—the painters, the firefighters, the mechanics, the teachers, and the nurses—that they are all doing great and the real people we need to be worried about are 
the corporate executives and the investors and the corporate bankers—well, if you have that theory, then I suppose you would be for Janus. You would say: Let’s not have collective bargaining. The question is: What is your theory of the case? Are you for workers having a greater say and greater wages in this country, or are you for corporations having even greater power? That is what this case is about. I know that our Progressive Caucus stands so firmly in the belief that we need to be on the side of the workers. If the Supreme Court decides against collective bargaining, it will be one of the worst decisions in recent American history, a catastrophe for this court to strike a blow to working families across America, to strike a blow to the heart and soul of the union movement. We need to strengthen working families and unions, not weaken them. Before I turn it over to one of the strongest champions for working families, I want to thank the leadership of AFSCME—President Saunders, Scott Frey—who have done so much to help not just AFSCME members, not just honor the tradition of Dr. King, but to help the fight for unions. I want to thank Dr. David Madland and Kevin Fox, on my team, for their research about the role of unions and the leaders of the NEA: Mary Kusler and Marc Egan. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. CURTIS ). The Chair would like to ask the gentleman to suspend. The Chair would ask occupants of the gallery to cease audible conversation. The gentleman from California may proceed. Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL ), my good friend. PRAMILA JAYAPAL , before she was even elected to the State Senate, has been a tireless advocate for unions, for working families. She understands that working families and unions have helped not just minority communities, not just women, but all Americans. She is our vice chair of the Progressive Caucus. She is one of the strongest progressive voices in our Nation. She is on the front lines, the picket lines, and has traveled across the country standing in solidarity with union members. It is a real honor now to yield to my friend and colleague, Representative JAYAPAL . Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, it has been a great honor to be able to come into Congress with Mr. KHANNA and to see the years of work that he has done before coming to Congress now turning into critical legislation around Yemen, around workers’ rights, around progressive issues, around healthcare for all. How proud I am that I get to serve with the gentleman in this Congress, and how proud I am of our Progressive Caucus, which is the largest values based caucus in the House. We are 78 members strong, and I believe we are going to hopefully have more members added on. Mr. Speaker, I think the reality of what we are talking about is that the ideas that we are putting forward are not really progressive ideas; they are ideas that serve the interests of working families. Labor unions are at the core of that. I am proud to come from Washington State. We are one of the most labor dense States in the country. We have one of the highest minimum wages in the country. Thanks to the labor movement, we have minimum wage that is tied to inflation. We have had that for many years. It is part of the reason our minimum wage has been able to rise in Washington State. Yes, we are the place of the $15 minimum wage, and I was proud to be on that committee to pass the $15 minimum wage in Seattle. We are able to show that these policies, like higher minimum wages, like paid safe and sick days—we have some of the best paid family leave policies in the country. All of that has been brought forward by labor unions representing workers. When we talk about collective bargaining, what is that? For the average person, who may not be as familiar with terminology, really all that means is that you get to take the power that comes from having more than one individual together to bargain for the things that are really going to help your life. That is what collective bargaining is about: bringing the power of many to the policies and putting policies forward that really help us. Mr. KHANNA spoke so eloquently about—I think he said—the Danish Ambassador visiting. There is a great TEDx talk out there, TEDxOslo. The title of it is something like, ‘‘Where in the World Is It Easiest to Get Rich?’’ It is a fantastic talk that really puts bullets in the theory that, in social democracies where you provide healthcare, where you have strong labor movements, where you provide free education, somehow you don’t have the opportunity to do well in those countries. In fact, statistics show that, specifically because of a strong labor movement in Scandinavian countries and because of the investment in education, those two factors combined, everybody does well. It is a really simple theory that we are all better off when we are all better off, and that is what labor unions have provided to us. I am proud to be from a strong labor family. My husband actually started off his career as an apprentice, as a bricklayer, and he worked his way up working for a number of different unions. He ended up being the head of the King County Labor Council, elected by 140,000 workers across our county, and was instrumental in helping us to win on many of these important issues. That is, I think, what we are talking about today. So, when we look at the Janus decision, this is a critical issue, an issue of critical importance for all Americans. The Supreme Court’s decision on this case is going to help determine whether or not we really have opportunity for all workers, whether or not labor unions are able to do the work that they need to do to collectively bargain and bring the voices of many workers to bear. Because what happens in, particularly, these workplaces, giant corporations: You know that, if there is a wrong done to one, it is difficult to bring it forward just as one. If you have collective bargaining, you have a structure within where those issues can come forward. So what Janus is looking at is whether or not American workers have the freedom and the right to collectively bargain, which means to fight back against the corporations that are expanding income inequality and decimating the middle class that, frankly, built this country. Let me be clear that I stand strong with labor unions like AFSCME in opposing corporate efforts to drag working people to the bottom. Unions made our country strong. Unions made our country strong. And Janus has the potential to make it harder for working people to join a union. Union members are us. They are our teachers, ironworkers, nurses, government workers, bricklayers, firefighters, machinists. They are the backbone of our communities. Our communities only thrive when we help workers to thrive. Janus would do the opposite. I want to share a statistic with you. My friend ROKHANNA just gave you some incredible statistics. Let me repeat one, which is that workers, on average, in 1973 earned $16.74 per hour, adjusted for inflation. Since then, our economy has doubled, so we can assume that worker salaries have kept up with the pace, right? Not so fast. Wrong. Workers today make $17.86 per hour, which is nowhere near enough to keep pace with growing income inequality and the rising cost of living. Here is another statistic that has captured my attention and that I now use in every speech: Across this country, 67 percent of Americans do not even have $1,000 in their bank account to deal with an emergency. Mr. Speaker, 67 percent. It is a remarkable statistic. That means that, if you have a leak in your roof, your car breaks down, your kid has an emergency or an illness and you have to take off from work for a couple of weeks and you don’t have paid family leave like we do in Washington State thanks to the labor movement, all of those things mean that families are no longer thinking about thriving; they are thinking about surviving. That decline is directly tied, if you look at the research, to the decline in the labor movement and the decline in collective bargaining. So now we are facing an administration that, despite lofty campaign promises, is putting corporations and greed first and workers second. 
b1745 Just look at the tax bill that the Republicans just passed. The largest transfer of wealth in the history of the United States going straight to corporations and the 1 percent. That is the reality of all of the research is that the majority of those tax breaks went to the largest corporations, the top 1 percent. It was used for stock buybacks and not for any kinds of increases, permanent increases, for workers. So unions have been fighting back, and that is why we have to ensure that unions remain in fighting shape because they are fighting for us. Janus is nothing more than a political attack underwritten by corporations, and it will not make our economy stronger. It further rigs the economy against workers, and it is, frankly, a disgrace and a slap in the face to the union legacy that has helped our country grow. We need to be working to make it easier and not harder for workers to join unions, to collectively bargain for fair wages, safe working conditions, and healthcare. And before I yield back, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friends in labor, the brothers and sisters who have been fighting for working Americans, winning worker safety protections, sick leave, the 40hour workweek. Don’t forget about the 40 hour workweek brought to you by your labor unions throughout our country’s history. It is not hyperbole to say that we simply would not be where we are without unions. And instead of trying to tear them apart by pushing socalled righttowork laws—I don’t even like to say the phrase, because it isn’t right to work. The reality is that we should have the right to have workers collectively bargain and organize. But by filing these harmful lawsuits like Janus, we are hurting workers across the country. We should be working to educate and to engage a new generation of union workers and leaders, and if history is any indication, our country will be better off when we are all better off. We are all better off when we have unions that represent the voices of working people and can actually build that power, organize together to take on that corporate power, which, frankly, has a lot of money behind it but isn’t looking out for the best interest of our workers. With that, I thank Mr. KHANNA for his tremendous leadership. Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative JAYAPAL for infusing the Progressive Caucus with a new vision, new energy, and, really, making it the strongest caucus in Congress and sharing some of those facts. I didn’t know that 67 percent of Americans live on just $1,000—can’t afford $1,000 emergency expenditure. So I think talking about these facts and what this case means to real Americans is important. I thank her for being here. It is now my real honor to give the floor to someone who really built the Progressive Caucus. You know, the Progressive Caucus used to be a social club where people chatted, before KEITH ELLISON took over and said: You know, we have got to do more than just talk. We have got to actually act on our values. If you talk to anyone in this Congress, they will tell you that he took a group of 15, 20 Members that used to get together and has turned that caucus, through his leadership, into the largest caucus on the Democratic side, the most effective caucus, and one that has a bold agenda. Keith has been an organizer his whole life. He understands the importance of working families and believes in these issues from his heart, and he has been a truly effective leader for the caucus in the House. It is my honor now to yield to Representative KEITH ELLISON . Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. ROKHANNA for organizing this today and holding this particular Special Order about Janus v. AFSCME. But, actually, the larger question is: What kind of shape will America be in if the Supreme Court makes the wrong decision? We envision, in the Progressive Caucus, an America in which parents can dream about their kids being able to go to college. We believe that you ought to be able to put food on the table. You ought to be able to get a good job and earn a decent pay and have a voice on your job. You ought to be able to turn on the water faucet and drink the water. You ought to be able to drive down the road without busting the axle on your car. You ought to be able to have safe affordable transit to get to where you have got to go. We don’t think this is too much to ask. This is something that other countries in the world have. We think you ought to be able to go to the doctor if you are sick. Now, the guarantor of all those things for so many years has been people coming together and organizing themselves into a group that argued and negotiated with their employer for a fair wage. They negotiated with their employer, and they said: Look, you know, you want us to supply labor? We will do it. You have got to pay us right. You have got to make sure the benefits package is right. You have got to make sure that this thing is making sense, not just for you, but for us, too. And, for many years, employers who didn’t want to see strikes and didn’t want to see labor shutdowns, and wanted to stop the turnover that you would see, and wanted to make sure that there was labor peace, came to an agreement, and said: Okay, we will work with you. And between World War II and right up until about 1970, even a little beyond, that bargain helped create the world’s greatest middle class. It wasn’t easy to get a cohesive union movement. In fact, there was a time in American history where being in a union was a criminal offense. They called the Pinkertons in. They beat you down. There is a lot of labor blood that has been spilled in this country in order to have a labor movement, but we have got one. And by 1957, a year that had racism and segregation, sexism and homophobia, had one thing going, and that was about 35 percent of all Americans were in a union, and about 35 percent more were paid as if they were. So the unions were setting the wage scale, and they helped create an American middle class, which really is what we think of when we think of America at its best economically. The union movement didn’t just stop at labor issues. It went further than that. It was the UAW that helped fund the March on Washington. The march for jobs and justice was funded by organized labor. It was labor that stood with those sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee, when they were on strike and Martin Luther King came down to march with them. It was AFSCME—AFSCME, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees—who had the back of those workers in Memphis. And when we lost the great Martin Luther King just about 50 years ago, AFSCME was by the side of those workers. And those workers literally won that strike, and many of them are still around to talk about it today. These folks made it so that in 1968 you had a rate of poverty that was much lower than it is today. You had CEOs that made about 20 times more than their average worker. Today, that is 339 to 1, and that is just the median. In fact, you have companies like Mattel that make almost 5,000 times— the CEO makes 5,000 times the average worker. McDonald’s, the CEO makes 3,100 times the average worker. Kohl’s, the CEO makes 1,200 times the average worker. But in 1968, with its strong union movement, we had an emerging civil rights movement. We had a minimum wage that was probably in the neighborhood, as has been mentioned, that was livable at the time, if you compare it to inflation. You had a rate of poverty where fewer people were in poverty. You had a ratio between workers and CEO which was much more rational. And something interesting happened beginning in the 1970s; there came an organized concerted attack on labor. And people will tell you that in 1980, after Ronald Reagan was elected, he went out on the campaign trail saying that he was for working people, but shortly after he got in office, he dismissed the air traffic controllers. When he broke that strike and he broke those workers, it set working people in this country on a trajectory, which brings us to where we are now, which is stagnating wages for literally three, four decades. The CEOs have done great. And if you ask Donald Trump, he will tell you: Oh, yeah, you know, the stock market is booming out of control. We are doing fine. 
But, you know, in this America, our America, this largesse is not shared by most people. My colleague, PRAMILA  JAYAPAL , mentioned earlier that about 67 percent of Americans would not know what to do if they were hit with a $1,000 bill. They don’t have it. But there are even other statistics that are as jarring, as equally upsetting. Other statistics would show just how difficult it is for Americans to pay their bills. Now, I know we are talking about Janus today. I am getting there. But there is a recent story that I want to share with you, and we can submit it for the RECORD , and the title of this story, Mr. Speaker, is ‘‘More Than 40 Percent of Americans Can’t Pay Their Bills.’’ That is the name of the story, and it says: ‘‘Donald Trump thinks the economy is doing great—way, way better than under Obama. Actually, Obama created more jobs on his way out the door than Trump has so far. ‘‘But that’s besides the point.’’ The story says, based on this research, the conclusion of the research: ‘‘43 percent of us struggle to pay our bills, and 34 percent are suffering ‘material hardships,’ including ‘running out of food, not being able to afford a place to live, or lacking the money to seek medical treatment.’’’ The truth is, Mr. Speaker, is that we live in a Nation that is lurching toward plutocracy. We live in a Nation that is lurching toward oligopoly and oligarchs, because the people who make the hamburgers, they don’t benefit in the profits of the company. The CEO does that. The people who make the clothes and work for Kohl’s and work their job, they don’t benefit. They just get survival wages, and the executives take it all home for themselves. Part of the reason is a conservative philosophy which says that companies should not have to pay any taxes. They shouldn’t have to abide by any regulations. They should be allowed to slam labor cost to the ground, if they can, and then the CEO should be able to walk away with all the money. And then the theory goes that they will use that money to invest in plant and equipment, and then everybody will be better off. But that never happens. That Republican philosophy, that conservative philosophy, is absolutely and utterly bankrupt. It doesn’t work. It is not true. And, yet, we keep on doing it over and over again. But part of this philosophy is the union busting. And they have been on a 40year trajectory of trying to break the union. I mentioned PATCO a little while ago, when Reagan broke PATCO. That sent a shockwave that reverberated even until the moment we are in now, and it is culminating in this attack on Janus. Let me tell you, they have been trolling around for a worker, a public employee, to try to break Janus—break public employees for years. A few years ago, right before the Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia passed, there was a case before the Supreme Court called the Frederick case. And in that case, it is exactly like the Janus case. Why are they similar? Because right wing law firms are trolling the country looking for any public employee to try to attack the union and attack fair share. That is what they have been doing. They have been going around: Will you take the case? Can we represent you? Can we represent you? And they finally found somebody, this guy, Janus. And he makes the outrageous claim that he—who benefits from collective bargaining and who the union expends money to make sure he has a decent contract—he is saying: Oh, this is unfair. My free speech rights are going into this union, and I don’t want that to happen. Well, they are not, actually. All they are doing is assessing a reasonable fee that is associated with the cost of negotiating on his behalf to have a better wage. But he says: No, I want to be able to benefit from the work that the union does, but I don’t want to pay anything. It is quite ridiculous. But that is the case that is in the Supreme Court right now. You know, you want to know what is in the First Amendment? The right to freedom of assembly. The right to freedom of assembly is in the Constitution. And if some workers want to assemble together and negotiate for better wages and better benefits with their employer, I believe they have a constitutional right to do so. b1800 What I don’t think you have a constitutional right to do is to be a freeloader, which is what Janus is arguing. He is saying: I want to be able to benefit from what the union negotiates on my behalf, but I don’t want to pay anything. He doesn’t have to pay into the fund that goes to political stuff. He doesn’t have to pay for that. That issue has been decided. It is not required under the law that he help fund candidates or issues that he doesn’t want to support. But it is fair, and it is right, and it is reasonable, and the Supreme Court has found in the past that an assessment on employees for the cost of representation is fair and constitutional. Now, this is a case called the Abood case where this was found to be constitutional. What they want to do is flip Abood and say: No, you can now be a freeloader. Let me just say to my good friend from California, our law has been favoring the employer over the worker for years now. Here is the law right now. If you are an employer and you fire a worker because they are trying to organize a union, that is not legal to do. But guess what? That worker can file, but they can’t file a private lawsuit; they have to file under the National Labor Relations Act. They can’t get punitive and treble damages. They can’t do discovery. They just have to go through the NLRB process, which takes quite a long time, according to most workers who go through it. And when they do go through it, all they can ever get is back pay, minus whatever they earned after they were fired illegally. This is a very small price to pay for people who are exercising what I believe is a constitutional right to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. But why shouldn’t you fire them because, hey, it is the worst of the cost of doing business for some employers who don’t want a union? Another example of how unfair the situation is an employer can tell the workers: You better be in the cafeteria tomorrow because there is a union drive, and I want to threaten you and scare you and tell you all the reasons why it is a bad idea. This is called captive audience. Can the union go into the same plant and say, ‘‘Well, now we want to give you our side of why you do need a union’’? They cannot do it. It is not fair. It is like having an election, where the rights of the workers will be determined by the election, and yet only one side gets to be able to go and argue in the negative. By the way, if the employer said, ‘‘Come to the meeting, we are going to tell you why you do need a union,’’ that would be an unfair labor practice. It is crazy, really. But it is the kind of world that a guy like Neil Gorsuch thinks would be a good one. This is the guy who was, in my view, illegally put on the Supreme Court of the United States—illegally. The Constitution says that the sitting President gets to offer a replacement for a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Barack Obama did that, and the head of the Senate Republicans, who was in the majority, said: We will not hear anybody. Do you know what? The role of the Senate is to give advice and consent. They can say, ‘‘We think that this guy is not qualified’’; they can say that this guy has a judicial temperament that is not proper; they can criticize that nominee any way they want to. But one thing they cannot do is say: We simply will not discharge our constitutional responsibility. But that is what they did do because nobody can make them do otherwise. They did it because they could do it, but it was wrong. It was actually immoral, and it was an abuse of their responsibility as Members of the United States Senate. But they didn’t care. They want power—raw, naked power. That is what they did, and somehow they got away with it because they got Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. This is the guy who was a deciding vote in a case that, I believe, is a foreshadowing of what we are going to see in Janus. Just the other day, a case called Murphy Oil was decided—Monday. Neil Gorsuch cast a deciding vote in a Supreme Court decision that ruled, for 
the first time, that bosses can forbid their workers from joining together in class action lawsuits to challenge violations of the Federal labor laws. This is an outrageous usurpation. Bringing a complaint against your boss or your company is expensive and risky, especially for workers who have no safety net. Congresswoman JAYAPAL  just got through telling you how stressed to the wall American workers are, and yet those workers, who don’t have much money, are now told that they cannot come together in a class action suit to challenge violations of Federal labor law. They have to pursue these claims individually. They don’t have a chance. The bargaining position power is absolutely unequal, and yet that is what we got. Decisions like this are why MITCH MCCONNELL and Republicans have engaged in the historic obstruction to block President Obama from filling the Supreme Court vacancy for nearly a year. They wanted an ideologue like Neil Gorsuch to tip antiworker cases like this. So what is going to happen in Janus? I hate to admit it, but even I, who consider myself quite optimistic, believe that: Look, they put Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court to destroy public employee bargaining; that is why he is there. I have no illusions about what is about to happen. But it is just like other unjust Supreme Court decisions that have happened, along the lines of Shelby County, which destroyed the Voting Rights Act, or along the lines of Citizens United, which basically said that corporations can dump massive amounts of money into elections. Who has a massive amount of money? You know. America’s corporate elites. And then it goes all the way back to unjust decisions like the Lochner case or even Dred Scott. History will look very dimly on this moment in time. I believe that when you crush decency and fairness to earth, it does rise. And I believe that workers of this country, if they are prohibited by the law and the Supreme Court from being treated fairly, they are just going to start going on strike all over the place, just like the teachers just showed us that they would. They are just going to start going on strike, and we will just settle it out in the street. This is unfortunate. Wouldn’t it be much better to have fair bargaining and come to the table and negotiate decent wages and benefits? Of course it would be. Those teachers didn’t want to go on strike. They wanted to be in the classroom teaching those kids. But whether it is Arizona, North Carolina, or Oklahoma, these people, who dedicated their lives to young people, had to go out on the trail, go out on the strike line, just so that they could get a decent situation for those kids and themselves. Those teachers said: These kids’ learning environment is our work environment. Both are bad. So we have to strike. We have been given no alternative but to do so. So they did, and they got some justice out of it. This is what the likes of Neil Gorsuch and Janus v. AFSCME are pushing the American labor picture towards. It is too bad, but I have great faith in the American worker. They will not take this lying down, and we will be on the picket line with them. Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative ELLISON for those words and for explaining so simply and powerfully what is at stake with the Janus case and why the constitutional right is actually with the unions, as he put it, to assemble and not to freeload when someone is getting a benefit. I thank him for his leadership and fight on this. Mr. Speaker, I want to make one other point before yielding to my friend. One of the contemporary examples of the need for collective bargaining is seen with CWA in their struggle with American Airlines when passenger service agents aren’t making a living wage. I don’t understand it. I pay so much for these American Airline tickets that I wonder who the money is going to. Would any American think that the passenger service agents aren’t getting a fair wage, given what we are paying in airline tickets? Yet the truth is many of those workers aren’t getting a fair wage, particularly those who are working for Envoy Air and those who are working with Piedmont Airlines. There are many Members of this House—81 of us—who believe that American Airlines needs to do the right thing and pay a living wage and CWA’s ability to bargain, to ask for a fair wage for what all of us pay when we pay for tickets, to ask that the workers benefit from that as well. That is what is at stake in this Janus case: Can CWA organize and get a fair wage so that workers benefit? Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO), a good friend, who is in my freshman class and who is a great leader on so many issues—on issues of technology and the future of work—so that he can speak out on this important Janus decision. He has come out to Silicon Valley. But what I respect about him is he has his values in fighting for working families, for the middle class, for people who have been left out. Those are the issues he is most passionate about. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. KHANNA for all of the good work that he is doing. I know he is changing the world in California. There are going to be so many labor issues to come from that that I can’t even dream of right now. But I rest assured knowing that someone of his savviness of knowing technology will help us make sure that we are protecting working families going into the future. I also share his concern and believe that American Airlines should be paying living wages to the folks who are working for them and certainly stand with CWA on that issue. Today, we are talking about Janus v. AFSCME. Mr. Janus is a man who wants to get something for nothing, a man who wants to get the benefit of collective bargaining without having to pay for it, and he is asking the Supreme Court to dismantle unions in the process of that, all because he doesn’t agree with some political messaging of the union, in this case, AFSCME. I would like to take a moment to take this logic to its end. Perhaps every shareholder should be able to object to Fortune 500 companies about political messaging they disagree with. Every single one of them: 1 share; 1 million shares. Perhaps every employee should have the right to object to their Fortune 500 company employers’ political messaging if they disagree. But, of course, that is not what is happening because this is a concerted attack on America’s unions, leaving corporate dark money to reign unchecked in our political process. Ultimately, it is an attack on the middle class. Imagine our country without a strong middle class. Imagine a country with just the haves and the havenots. There are plenty across this globe. There are plenty that aren’t making a big difference in this world because when you have the rich control all capital, all political power, that is when they control us, and we don’t have the innovation. We don’t have the incentive. We don’t have the progress that is so critical to capitalism, which I think is being missed on this. If you don’t have a fair market, you can’t have successful capitalism, and part of a fair market includes having a strong voice for our middle class, for our working folks, through our unions. It is no surprise that a rise to greatness in this country was tied to the rise of the middle class. Think about it: GIs returning home from World War II, fanning out to the suburbs. Even before that, around World War I and before that, when you had all of these major milestones that we talked about—a 40 day workweek, overtime, child labor laws, OSHA, so many things that happened, antitrust, that created the modern economy—and we surged and prosperity reigned through most corners of the United States. So I want to just take a moment— and I appreciate Mr. KHANNA for bringing this forward—to urge the Supreme Court to do the right thing: to protect the right to collectively bargain from being dragged down by nonunion free riders just because they disagree with the political message. Or, in the alternative, allow every employee, every shareholder, to object to corporate political speech they disagree with. Let’s keep it fair on all sides then. If I have one share and I am a parttime employee of a major Fortune 500 company and I disagree, I should be able to object, just like this man wants to be able to object. Corporations aren’t people; people are people. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. KHANNA ) for the opportunity to be able to stand with him on behalf of America’s working families. b1815 Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative SOTO for his analogy that the rules for our corporate shareholders shouldn’t be different than the rules for workers. We need fairness. We certainly shouldn’t be privileging shareholders. I appreciate the gentleman’s advocacy for working families and speaking out today. Mr. Speaker, I want to close with some simple points. People often say that workers have a negative view of unions or don’t want unions to be representing them, but here are the facts: Gallup Poll research shows that 60 percent of Americans have a favorable view of labor unions, and that number has been going up as more and more Americans see that their wages have been going down. More and more Americans are saying they need the unions to level the playing field. When we look at AFSCME and what AFSCME stands for, what Janus is saying that he doesn’t want representing him, I think about the trip I took with Representative JOHN LEWIS down to Memphis a few months ago. We went to Mason Temple. In Mason Temple, we heard over the loud speaker Dr. King’s voice as he spoke about seeing the promised land. As that booming voice came over the loud speakers in that temple, there on stage was a man in his 80s who was a sanitation worker at the time that Dr. King marched in Memphis, and he talked about how he still was owed money for his fair work. At the age of 80, Memphis still hadn’t paid him. That person, that man, he didn’t shirk from work. He was working still in his 80s. He believed in the dignity of work. He talked about young people needing to believe in the dignity of work. He just wanted to have a fair shot at being paid for that work. That was AFSCME. That is what AFSCME stands for in this country. That is what is at stake in this Supreme Court fight. Do we stand for the values that Dr. King marched for, and do we stand for the labor union in this Nation? 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, thank you for your graciousness in giving us this hour and moderating this debate. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. THE PROSPER ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 30 minutes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, only days after we commemorated National Police Week, I rise to honor the life of Trooper Samuel Newton Bullard. The community of Ronda, North Carolina, tragically lost Trooper Bullard in the line of duty on Monday in my district. A 3year State trooper veteran, Trooper Bullard was dedicated to the safety and protection of Surry County. Our country could not be so blessed without selfless law enforcement officers like him who protect our communities and uphold the rule of law that our safety rests upon. My heartfelt condolences go to the family and friends of Trooper Samuel Newton Bullard. While Trooper Bullard’s ultimate sacrifice cannot be repaid, I remain grateful for his sacrifice and remember him and his loved ones in my prayers. Mr. Speaker, I am here tonight to talk about a serious situation that exists in our country, a very serious situation. Every Member of this body hears every day from employers in our districts that they have jobs that are going unfilled because Americans do not have the skills they need to fill those unfilled jobs. Specifically, there are over 6 million unfilled jobs in this country due to the skills gap. We have a solution to that problem, Mr. Speaker, and it has come out of the Education and the Workforce Committee. It is called the PROSPER Act. Today, in The Hill, there was a terrific article encouraging this body and this Congress to pass the PROSPER Act, and I am going to quote some of the article. The article was entitled ‘‘Congress, Pass the PROSPER Act for Federal Student Aid Reform.’’ It is written by Rachelle Peterson. ‘‘It has been 53 years since President Lyndon Johnson signed the Higher Education Act into law, and 10 years since it was reauthorized, under President Obama. Over the years, the law— which touches nearly every aspect of higher education—has turned into a special interest bonanza. It shields traditional colleges from marketplace competition, weaves a labyrinthine web of student aid options, packs on the pork, and in the last administration served as a pretext for the Department of Education to invent politically charged regulations. ‘‘The PROSPER Act . . . would reauthorize the Higher Education Act and clean up the mess it has become. The bill would streamline Federal programs, relax burdensome regulations, forbid the Secretary of Education from acting outside the scope of the law, and protect the key principles of free speech and religious freedom. ‘‘Today, my organization, the National Association of Scholars, released a toptobottom review of the PROSPER Act, concluding that it represents the best opportunity to reform higher education in decades. With a few tweaks, the PROSPER Act should be passed at once. Two especially important areas—Federal student aid reform and protections for freedom of speech and association—show why.’’ Ms. Peterson goes on: ‘‘Currently, Federal student aid is a complicated system that encourages students to take on unmanageable debt and incentivizes colleges to raise tuition. The system has six loan programs, numerous grants, and some four dozen options for paying off or getting loans forgiven. ‘‘The PROSPER Act simplifies Federal student aid, reining in costs and making it easier for students to see their options. It caps the amount of money parents and students can borrow from the Federal Government. It streamlines Federal student aid into a single loan program, a single grant program, and a single repayment program. It eliminates special interest projects, such as public service loan forgiveness, which privileged government employees by forgiving their loans after 10 years of payments.’’ Mr. Speaker, Ms. Peterson really encapsulates at the beginning of this article the reasons why we should be passing the PROSPER Act. Again, it passed out of the committee in December, and we are working to find floor time to be able to bring this bill to the floor and be able to have the House vote on it, send it to the Senate, have the Senate vote on it, and send it to the President for his signature. Again, Ms. Peterson says, ‘‘Congress, Pass the PROSPER Act for Federal Student Aid Reform,’’ but as she explains in her quotes as I quoted, she says even more about it. Let me explain some additional reasons why we need to pass the PROSPER Act. Eightyone percent of parents say 4 year schools charge too much. Fifty four percent of parents think 4year schools are accessible to middle class Americans. Mr. Speaker, we have a problem in this country, not just with skills but people who are in poverty. The way for people to get out of poverty is to gain a good education that provides skills for people to be able to get a job. Mr. Speaker, all my life I have promoted the need for people to get a great education. I myself am a living example of what an education can do for a person. I grew up in a house with no electricity, no running water. My parents had a sixth grade and ninth grade education. I come from no privilege whatsoever, and yet, Mr. Speaker, I and many millions of other people in this country who came from similar circumstances were able to get a good education and use their talents and skills to lead successful lives. 
What I want, Mr. Speaker, is for every American who has the drive to do the same thing. Mr. Speaker, while the Federal Government doesn’t create jobs, the Federal Government can create situations where jobs can be created by the private sector, and we can help people gain the skills that they need to take those jobs. Again, as I said, we have over 6 million unfilled jobs in this country, and what we need and what employers are begging us for is to provide the opportunity for people to gain the skills that they need to fill those jobs. This is the way the American people feel right now. Again, 81 percent of Americans say the schools charge too much. What we do with PROSPER is give an incentive to the schools to charge less. We don’t tell them what to charge— that is not the role of the Federal Government—but we put in place policies that we believe will cause tuition not to continue to rise at such a high rate and that students will get more information so they choose well the programs they go into. Also, we are closing out the opportunities that I had and millions of other middle class Americans have had in the past by pricing postsecondary education too high and making people feel it is not possible. Only 13 percent of the people in this country believe that college graduates are well prepared for success in the workplace. Something is wrong, Mr. Speaker, that we have this low a number of people in this country who believe that those who are graduating from college or attending college don’t have the skills that they need to take those jobs that are out there available. b1830 And there is even more negativity coming from those who employ those who go to college. Let me share some other information. Only two in five managers believe college graduates are well equipped for a job in their field. Mr. Speaker, even those who go to college are not completing their education. We have a 6year completion rate of only 54.8 percent. And what does this mean to students? It means $68,000 per year in lost wages and the cost of attending. Mr. Speaker, this is occurring not just with those who attend what are known as 4year colleges, which actually now are 6year colleges because students are aren’t graduating in 4 years—most of the ones graduating are graduating in 6 years—but it is applying to students who are in what we have always called 2year colleges. So we have a terrible problem every way you look in this country in terms of providing the opportunities for not only poor people, but middleincome people, for completing a degree or a program or a certificate that will allow them to gain the skills that they need and the credentials they need. We are a credentialing society, Mr. Speaker. We want people to be able to prove what they have done. Therefore, we need to honor people with all kinds of credentials and make it easier for them to gain those credentials. Not everybody needs a baccalaureate degree to be a successful person in our country, and we know that because only 30 percent of the people in this country do have a baccalaureate degree. Yet we have millions and millions of people already who are successful. What we want to do is encourage more people to seek certification and programs that allow them to be certified without necessarily completing a baccalaureate. Mr. Speaker, people will say: Well, you don’t honor liberal arts degrees if you are encouraging people to go on and just get a certificate. I want everybody to get a liberal arts degree. I got a liberal arts degree. I think that is wonderful. But people don’t have to do that immediately out of high school, and they don’t have to do it in order to lead successful lives. But ultimately, we hope everybody will be a lifelong learner, and the best way to be a lifelong learner, I think, is to help people be successful early on so they will be encouraged to continue to want to learn and do the things that will make them successful. So what does PROSPER do? We make it possible for more students to qualify for Pell grants for shortterm programs. This is what we do, Mr. Speaker. Pell grants are the grants that undergird most people going to college who don’t come from very affluent families. The maximum Pell grant in this country now is about $6,000. But students can qualify for that if they are very, very poor. What we would like to do is allow Pell grants to be used for shorter term programs, again, to get students to get into a program, help them gain certification so they can continue to earn and learn, so they can get a job, continue their education. So we make it possible for 7 million more people to qualify for Pell grants. Many colleges and universities, unfortunately, have come out against the PROSPER Act. Why is that, Mr. Speaker, when we make 7 million more students eligible for Pell grants? It is because, Mr. Speaker, we also ask for more accountability on the part of the schools and universities, and I will talk a little bit more about that in a minute. And what do we do for the schools? We say to them: Help these Pell grant students graduate on time, meaning 4 years. And guess what. We will give you a little bonus for this. Right now, the schools get no rewards for helping their students graduate on time. In fact, they get rewarded if they extend the amount of time that students are in school. But that costs the students money in lost wages. It also encourages them to borrow more money, which is not a good thing. We know right now that we have $1.4 trillion in student debt in this country. We see the headlines every day in the newspapers about the problem with student debt. We don’t want to encourage students to take out more debt. We want the students to get less debt. So we simplify what we are doing in financial aid, Mr. Speaker. That is what we hear from schools, parents, students. We just had a meeting with Members of Congress before I came up here, and Members of Congress who have had children go to college all talked about how complicated the FAFSA is, how invasive of privacy it is, and how we need to do better with the FAFSA, which is the financial aid form that students have to fill out to qualify. But we also have a complicated set of loans, grants, and campusbased programs. So what do we do with PROSPER? We simplify things, Mr. Speaker. Right now, we have six different loan programs, nine repayment options, 32 deferment and forbearance options— that means 32 different ways not to pay back your loan—and $1.4 trillion in student debt. What we do is we turn these six loan programs into one loan program. We make it much less complicated. Students and parents can understand. We take the various grant programs and turn them into one grant program. It will all be called Pell grants. And we take a couple of the grant programs and put them in workstudy. Why do we do that, Mr. Speaker? Because we have known for 50 years or more that workstudy is successful. We have done studies to show that students who work are much more likely to graduate, they do better academically, they become better time managers, and they are much more likely to get a job when they graduate. What we do with workstudy is we make it an even better program than it is now. We double the amount of money that is in workstudy, and we make it possible for the school to allocate up to 50 percent of the money into the private sector. What that will do, Mr. Speaker, is that will allow the students to work in the private sector, do an internship, a coop, or an apprenticeship program. We know that most of the time those programs result in a job, and that will start the student on a successful career, we believe, in the industry or business or area that the student wants to go into. It is better than just working on campus. Working on campus is a positive thing, and it helps the students a lot, but working in the private sector is even better because, again, those often lead directly into employment in the private sector. So this is what we do. Mr. Speaker, we are responding to the public. We are 
responding to the schools saying financial aid is too complicated. Parents and students say financial aid is too complicated. We are listening to both of those folks. The institutions have said it, and the students and parents have said it. What else are we doing with the financial aid? We are putting $14.5 billion back in the pockets of students. How are we doing that? We are eliminating the origination fee for loans. This was a hidden fee that most students didn’t know anything about. They had to pay this up front out of the loans that they were getting, and very often it made a big difference to the students in terms of having the funds that they needed to be successful in their programs. So we eliminate that, Mr. Speaker, and we think this is a very, very positive thing that we are doing. In general, what we are doing with the PROSPER Act is we are responding to the American people. We are responding to employers who are saying to us: Please, help us with smoothing the way for students to go to colleges and universities to be able to gain the skills that they need to take these 6 million jobs that we have available out here. Universities are not doing it for us. The colleges are not doing it for us. The colleges and universities are graduating approximately 1.4 million students every year. Yet what is happening is we have got all of these jobs unfilled out here, and we have got graduates being graduated but they don’t have the skills that the employers need. Study after study after study, poll after poll after poll is telling us that. We are hearing it from everybody. This is not a panacea. It is not going to answer every single need that is out there. We never said that it would. But it is a true reform of postsecondary education. What we want to do is say to the postsecondary institutions: We have heard you. We have heard what you have said. You have said reduce or eliminate a lot of the rules and regulations that we have. That is what is driving up the cost of tuition. Well, guess what, Mr. Speaker. We have revised or eliminated 59 percent of the 59 rules that were presented to us by the colleges and universities. But when they talk to our colleagues here, we never hear them mention that to them. But we are doing that. So we are responding to them. They said: Simplify financial aid. We are doing that. So we are doing what the schools asked us to do. We are doing what employers asked us to do. We are providing funds for shortterm programs that will result in certificates that will result in the ability for students to gain the skills they need and go to work after as short a period of time as 10 weeks and 300 hours. This is a huge change in the way financial aid has been offered in the past. We have listened to parents and students. We have simplified financial aid. We are making it much easier for students to apply for financial aid. We make it simpler for them to understand exactly the aid that they are going to be getting, what their obligations are going to be, and we know that, ultimately, it is going to bring down the cost of postsecondary education because we remove incentives for the colleges and universities to keep raising tuition and fees because we are saying to the colleges and universities: We want you to help these students succeed. We want you to encourage these students to take out less debt, and we are providing you the vehicle for doing that. So, Mr. Speaker, we are responding to all the segments of the population that have asked us to change the way postsecondary education is delivered in this country. We are going to help fulfill these 6 million unfilled jobs and we are going to bring down the cost of tuition and fees and make financial aid less complicated. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
